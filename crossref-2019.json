		"abstract": "Abstract: Tick-borne infections—including tick-borne encephalitis viruses, represented in the United States by rare infections with Powassan and deer tick viruses, and more often Lyme disease—are of increasing importance to neurologists. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) causes all or part of a triad including meningitis, radiculoneuritis, and cranial neuritis. Rarely, parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement occur, with focal findings on examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LNB diagnosis requires plausible exposure, objective evidence of nervous system involvement, and, generally, positive two-tier serology. Central nervous system (CNS) LNB is almost always accompanied by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cells, protein), often with intrathecal antibody production, which is determined by concentration-adjusted comparison of serum and CSF antibody. Measuring CSF antibody in isolation and nucleic acid-based testing of CSF are not useful in LNB and should be avoided. LNB treatment is highly effective with a 2- to 3-week course of antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that LNB not involving the CNS parenchyma can be treated successfully with oral doxycycline."

		"abstract": "Globally, vector-borne diseases are an increasing public health burden; in the United States, tick-borne diseases have tripled in the last three years. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes the need for resilience to the increasing vector-borne disease burden and has called for increased partnerships and sustained networks to identify and respond to the most pressing challenges that face vector-borne disease management, including increased surveillance. To increase applied research, develop communities of practice, and enhance workforce development, the CDC has created five regional Centers of Excellence in Vector-borne Disease. These Centers are a partnership of public health agencies, vector control groups, academic institutions, and industries. This special issue on tick and tick-borne disease surveillance is a collection of research articles on multiple aspects of surveillance from authors that are affiliated with or funded by the CDC Centers of Excellence. This body of work illustrates a community-based system of research by which participants share common problems and use integrated methodologies to produce outputs and effect outcomes that benefit human, animal and environmental health."

		"abstract": "Objectives: We evaluated trends in non-Lyme disease tick-borne disease (NLTBI) testing at a national reference laboratory. Methods: Testing data performed at Quest Diagnostics during 2010 to 2016 were analyzed nationally and at the state level. Results: Testing and positivity for most NLTBIs increased dramatically from 2010 through 2016 based on testing from a large reference laboratory. The number of positive cases, though not as stringent as criteria for public health reporting, generally exceeds that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The frequency of NLTBI in the US is seasonal but testing activity and positive test results are observed throughout all months of the year. Positive results for NLTBI testing mostly originated from a limited number of states, indicating the geographic concentration and distribution of NLTBIs reported in this study. Conclusions: This report provides an important complementary source of data to best understand trends in and spread of NLTBI."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. This species undergoes a life cycle consisting of eggs and three active stages: larva, nymph, and adult. Each active life stage takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of blood digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within endosomes of acidic digestive cells. However, in other hematophagous arthropods, the serine protease trypsin plays an important role in early protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of I. scapularis cathepsins and serine proteases, some with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. Gut pH was also determined and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels during blood digestion. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 days post host detachment, respectively. In addition, alkaline gut pH (8.0) conditions after I. scapularis blood feeding were similar to those required for trypsin activity in other arthropods suggesting these enzymes have an important and previously overlooked role in I. scapularis blood digestion."

		"abstract": "Abstract: In an update of earlier surveys conducted in Connecticut and New Jersey in the mid-1990s, an online survey of private commercial pest control firms engaged in residential tick control showed that the application of synthetic acaricides continues to be the primary method of control used. The carbamate and organophospate acaricides, previously the most commonly used against ticks, have given way to synthetic pyrethroids and, to a lesser extent, the use of natural product/organic acaricides. Typical costs for a single acaricide application today ($100–$200 for a 1 acre [0.4 ha] property) remain similar to those reported from the earlier surveys, although the frequency of applications and, therefore, also the overall annual cost has increased. The application habitats within residential properties, life stages targeted, and application equipment used have not changed appreciably since the mid-1990s. While most survey respondents expressed knowledge of natural product acaricides and Damminix Tick Tubes, many reported that they either did not employ or knew very little about other alternative tick control methods (including entomopathogenic fungus and topical application of acaricides to tick hosts via 4-Poster deer treatment stations or Select TCS rodent bait boxes). This suggests either a failure to adequately inform the pest management industry and their potential client base of the availability of alternate methods, and/or industry concerns about cost and effectiveness of the alternatives."

Projections estimate that by the year 2049 all health units in Ontario will have suitable environmental conditions for the establishment of this vector. A review of website content from health units in Ontario was performed to assess the quality of tick and Lyme disease information provided to the public and health care providers. Websites were evaluated based on criteria such as the provision of Lyme disease information (i.e., transmission, symptoms, treatment, etc.), the inclusion of misleading or incorrect information, and visuals provided. The quality of textual and visual information varied substantially across the 35 health units analyzed. Eleven health units were found to provide misleading or incorrect information. Disparities were found between areas with current Lyme disease risk and those without. The majority of health units did not include satisfactory visual content pertaining to ticks. Given the expected expansion and intensification of blacklegged tick populations across the province, all health units must ensure the information communicated to the public about ticks and Lyme disease is of high-quality and consistent. We conclude with specific recommendations to improve the textual and visual content of websites."

The potential involvement of other cell types has not been examined to date. • Immune cells from peripheral blood, in particular neutrophils, T cells, B cells and NK cells, infiltrate into the cerebrospinal fluid of TBE patients."

Within each subtype, some genetic lineages are described. • The European subtype (TBEV-EU) (formerly known also as the “Western subtype”) of TBEV is prevalent in Europe, but it was also isolated in Western and Eastern Siberia in Russia and South Korea. • The Far-Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE) was preferably found in the territory of the far-eastern part of Eurasia, but some strains were isolated in other regions of Eurasia. • The Siberian (TBEV-SIB) subtype is the most common and has been found in almost all TBEV habitat areas. • The Baikalian subtype is prevalent around Lake Baikal and was isolated several times from ticks and rodents. • In addition to the four TBEV subtypes, one single isolate of TBEV (178-79) and two genetic sequences (Himalayan) supposed to be new TBEV subtypes were described in Eastern Siberia and China. • The data on TBEV seroprevalence in humans and animals can serve as an indication for the presence or absence of TBEV in studied area."

For FSME-IMMUN, Encepur and EnceVir a rapid immunization schedules is also licensed. The Chinese vaccine is giv-en with 2 primary doses 2 weeks apart followed by annual boosters. • All vaccines induce significant immune responses. In the absence of a formal correlate of pro-tection, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is used as a surrogate marker for protection. • Recent clinical studies show long-term seropersistence of TBE antibodies after the first booster vaccination (dose 4) with the two European vaccines. • An effectiveness of approximately 99% (years 2000–2006) and 98,7% (years 2000-2011) was calculated for regularly vaccinated persons in Austria, a country with established high vaccina-tion uptake. • Whereas in Western Europe post-exposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulins was discontinued in the late 1990s, in the highly endemic regions of Russia it continues to be common practice. • Both - FSME-IMMUN and Encepur are well tolerated with a well-established safety profile. TBE-Moscow and EnceVir appear to be somewhat more reactogenic."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are the two vector-borne diseases with the largest impact on human health. Based on data on the density of host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks and pathogen prevalence and using a variety of environmental data, we have created an acarological risk model for a region where both diseases are endemic (Czech Republic—South Bohemia and Germany—Lower Bavaria, Upper Palatinate). The data on tick density were acquired by flagging 50 sampling sites three times in a single season. Prevalence of the causative agents of LB and TBE was determined. Data on environmental variables (e.g., altitude, vegetation cover, NDVI, land surface temperature) were obtained from various sources and processed using geographical information systems. Generalized linear models were used to estimate tick density, probability of tick infection, and density of infected ticks for the whole area. A significantly higher incidence of human TBE cases was recorded in South Bohemia compared to Bavarian regions, which correlated with a lower tick density in Bavaria. However, the differences in pathogen prevalence rates were not significant. The model outputs were made available to the public in the form of risk maps, indicating the distribution of tick-borne disease risk in space."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background Tick-borne infections are continuously increasing due to climate change, increased outdoor activities and increased travel between countries. This study was to investigate the presence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks removed from tick-bitten humans in southwest provinces of Republic of Korea (ROK). Methods Ticks were obtained from those tick-bitten humans between May 2014 and September 2017 in Jeollanam provinces and Gwangju metropolitan city in ROK. The presence of the tick-borne pathogens in ticks removed from tick-bitten humans was analyzed using pathogen-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results We identified 33 ticks from three tick species, namely Amblyomma testudinarium (60.6%), Haemaphysalis longicornis (27.3%), and Ixodes nipponensis (12.1%) in order of occurrence by morphology and 16S rDNA-targeting PCR. Tick-borne pathogens were found in 16 ticks using pathogen-specific PCR. From the results, 12 ticks (36.4%) tested positive for spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia: Rickettsia monacensis (1/12), R. tamurae (8/12), and Candidatus Rickettsia jingxinensis (3/12). Three ticks (9.1%) were positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum . In addition, three ticks (9.1%) tested positive for Babesia gibsoni (1/3) and B. microti (2/3). Conclusions In conclusion, we identified three tick species; the most common species was A. testudinarium followed by H. longicornis and I. nipponensis . SFG Rickettsia , A. phagocytophilum , and Babesia spp. were the most frequently detected pathogens in ticks removed from tick-bitten humans. R. tamurae and Ca. R. jingxinensis were firstly detected in Korea. The present results will contribute to the understanding of tick-borne infections in animals and humans in the ROK."

The efficiency of detecting a genetic marker in PCR compared with ELISA for a weakly pathogenic strain with defects in the genetic structure was higher by a factor of 10, and for a highly pathogenic strain by a factor of 5,000. At the same time, positive results in both reactions with respect to two strains were detected with a virus titer of not less than 1-1.5 log TCID50, i.e. this level of virus in the sample is defined as epidemically significant. An algorithm for conducting research on the verification of TBEV is proposed: 1) Ticks collected from vegetation can be examined by ELISA or by PCR. All positive results can be summarized and considered viral ticks; 2) All samples with positive results only in PCR or ELISA must be investigated in two reactions in order to obtain confirmation of the possible infectivity of the pathogen; 3) To obtain a fast complex result of infection of the removed ticks from patients or blood after a tick bite, studies should be carried out simultaneously in two reactions simultaneously in ELISA and PCR; 4) Isolation virus should be carried out in biological samples (ticks collected from vegetation, ticks removed from patients, the blood of patients with suspected TBE, mammals) only with the same results in PCR and ELISA. Thus, such an approach to verifying TBEV in a tick or in the blood of patients will improve the reliability of laboratory diagnostics, identifying not only markers of TBEV, but also determining the infectivity of the pathogen, which may be the basis for the appointment of early intensive antiviral therapy."

In 1–2% (-20%) of cases, TBE may even result in death. • No specific treatments exist for TBE. The severity of the disease and high frequency of long-term sequelae result in high public awareness and concerns about tick bites in endemic areas. Public health officials in TBE-endemic areas need to address these concerns; moreover, they need to address the concerns of potential travelers to their region. • The principal public health measures aim at reducing TBE cases and at reduction of exposure and preventive vaccination."

		"abstract": "Introduction: Fever is a cardinal manifestation of both autoinflammatory disease and infection. Distinguishing the two is a familiar challenge to the rheumatologist. This case report describes a young female presenting with recurrent fevers, rash and inflammatory arthritis. The case illustrates the importance of a careful travel and social history in the diagnosis and management of a patient presenting with recurrent fevers, particularly in an era of globalisation and air travel. Case description: A 19-year-old Caucasian female presented to her local district general hospital with episodic fevers, rash, arthralgia, and abdominal pain. Past medical history included autoimmune liver disease, treated with azathioprine. She had no relevant family history, took no medications other than azathioprine, was a non-smoker and had no allergies.  Discussion: Autoinflammatory diseases are characterised by recurrent episodes of inflammation due to defects in innate immunity. The absence of autoantibodies means recognition of clinical phenotype is crucial. In this patient, the presence of synovitis, high fevers, raised inflammatory markers and serum ferritin fit with adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD). However, the rash was atypical. The rash in AOSD is salmon-pink, non-pruritic and typically occurs in the upper arms, abdomen and thighs. Additionally, although the spleen is often enlarged, focal lesions are rare. Key learning points: Rheumatologists are often asked to review patients with recurrent fever. An awareness of atypical infectious differentials can be crucial to making the correct diagnosis. Relapsing fever is an umbrella term used to describe the characteristic pattern of infection caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia and can be transmitted by ticks or lice. Other infectious causes of recurrent fever include malaria and rat-bite fever. An important non-infectious cause is lymphoma.  Conflicts of interest: The authors have declared no conflicts of interest."

Reported incidences do not reflect actual risk since this fluctuates annually as a result of changes in exposure, vaccine uptake, intensity of case finding and reporting, and climate, just to men-tion the most relevant factors. • For largely unknown reasons (including human behavior, improved diagnostics, or climate change) TBEV appears to be spreading north, east, and even south to areas that were pre-viously believed to be free of the virus. • The country reports in Chapter 12b provide a current and official ‘state-of-the-art’ survey on TBE, with available information about the virus, vectors, modes of transmission, case reporting, vaccine and prevention efforts, burden of disease over time, age and gender distribution of cases, virus isolation data, and risk area distribution. • Chapter 12c provides a risk map for TBEV based on documented TBE cases, TBEV infection, as well as on the detection of TBEV in nature. This map does not reflect the incidence of the disease or the prevalence of the virus in a given area. As the intensity and complete-ness of epidemiological surveillance varies between different countries, the map presented here may not be entirely complete, and very likely TBEV infections and thus TBE may occur in additional (‘new’) areas."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis exhibits profound inter-annual fluctuations in incidence. Previous studies showed that three-fifths of the variation can be explained in terms of four superimposed oscillations: a quasi-biennial, triennial, pentennial, and a decadal cycle. This study was conducted to determine how these cycles could be influenced by climate change. Epidemiological data, spanning from the 1970s to the present, and originating from six regions/countries bridging Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, represented a temporal/latitudinal gradient. Spectral analysis of time series was used to determine variation in the cycles’ length/amplitude with respect to these gradients. The analysis showed that—whereas the lengths of the shorter cycles do not vary substantially—cycles in the decadal band tend to be longer southwards. When comparing the disease’s oscillations before- and after the mid-1990s, a shift towards longer oscillations was detected in the pentennial–decadal band, but not in the biennial– triennial band. Simultaneously, oscillations in the latter band increased in intensity whereas the decadal oscillations weakened. In summary, the rhythm of the cycles has been altered by climate change. Lengthened cycles may be explained by prolonged survival of some animal hosts, and consequently greater inertia in herd immunity changes, slowing down a feedback loop between the herd immunity and amount of virus circulating in nature."

		"abstract": "• TBEV is the most medically important member of the tick-borne serocomplex group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. • Three antigenic subtypes of TBEV correspond to the 3 recognized genotypes: European (TBEV-EU), also known as Western, Far Eastern (TBEV-FE), and Siberian (TBEV-SIB). Additional 2 genotypes have been identified in the Irkutsk region of Russia, currently named TBE virus Baikalian subtype (TBEV-BKL) and TBE virus Himalaya subtype (Himalayan and “178-79” group; TBEV-HIM). • TBEV virions are small enveloped spherical particles about 50 nm in diameter. • The TBEV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule. • The genome encodes one open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by untranslated (non-coding) regions (UTRs). • The 5′-UTR end has a methylated nucleotide cap for canonical cellular translation. The 3′-UTR is not polyadenylated and is characterized by extensive length and sequence heterogeneity. • The ORF encodes one large polyprotein, which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 3 structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). • TBEV replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell in close association with virus-induced intracellular membrane structures. Virus assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The immature virions are transported to the Golgi complex, and mature virions pass through the host secretory pathway and are finally released from the host cell by fusion of the transport vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane."

		"abstract": "Background: There is a strong interest in tick-borne diseases worldwide due to their negative impact on both human and animal health. Epidemiological studies of tick-borne diseases depend on reliable data on tick population dynamics and activity patterns. Such data are essentially based on tick sampling in the field. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cloth type on the efficiency of field sampling by the flagging technique. Methods: The impact of cloth type on the efficiency of field sampling by the flagging technique was investigated by comparing tick sampling yields of two different fabrics, the Munich type (MUC) vs. the Oxford type (OX), based on 30 pairs of transect lines. Data analysis included classical statistics and computer modelling. Results: The MUC flag yielded nearly five times more larval ticks than the OX flag, whereas the differences in yields for nymphs and adult ticks were not statistically significant based on classical statistics. Conclusion: The flag made of MUC type fabric, thanks to its tight and relatively flat texture, facilitates detection and collection of ticks from its surface. The OX flag, due to its loose texture, is unsuitable for the quantitative sampling of larval Ixodes ricinus."

		"abstract": "<p>In this chapter, the author examines his embodied experience with Lyme disease to chart how power and knowledge within the dominant biomedical framework were produced via engagement with medical providers. Analyzing the medical governance of Lyme disease through actors’ everyday decision-making practices, the author shows how, in failing to accurately diagnose and treat his sick body and depriving him of treatment, credentialed health care providers reproduced culturally dominant, institutionalized, yet inadequate formations of medical power-knowledge. The author’s experience of this disease illustrates how the manufacture of disease categories and their ascription regulates bodies that do not fit into established categories. Analyzing data from his own life in light of medical science research, the author advances an analytical autoethnography and dissenting embodied knowledge, legitimizing the diagnostic category of chronic Lyme disease, and introducing two concepts—<italic>contested disease</italic> and <italic>contested care</italic>—to theorize the complex phenomenon of Lyme disease.</p>"

Utilized were the data on operative monitoring performed by the Rospotrebnadzor Institutions in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and form data from the Federal statistical survey «Data on Infectious and Parasitic Diseases» over the period of 2009–2017, and also information from the operative monitoring, 2018. The increase in medical aid appealability among the population due to tick suctions was observed in all endemic Federal Districts (FD) of the European part of the Russian Federation during the epidemic season, 2018. The total of 1508 cases in 46 constituent entities of the country was registered: Siberian FD – 44.3 % of the cases, Privolzhsky FD – 22 %, Ural FD – 14.7 %, Northwest FD – 12.6 %,Central FD – 3.7 % , and Far Eastern FD – 1.7 %. Twenty two cases had lethal outcomes. Nation average infection rate of ticks taken off from humans was 1.38 %, from environment objects – 0.61 %. General level of tick infectivity was 1.5 times lower in 2018 as compared to 2017. The forecast of the incidence for 2019, taking into account the presence or absence of the trend fluctuations in the constituent entities in 2009–2018 and the values of the 95 % confidential interval of the possible parameter variations, is presented. The further gradual improvement of the epidemiological conditions for tick-borne viral encephalitis is expected. According to estimates, in 2019, morbidity rates will be 0.19"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background Anaplasma marginale is the causative agent of the severe bovine anaplasmosis. The tick Rhipicephalus microplus is one of the main vectors of A. marginale in tropical and subtropical regions of world. After the tick bite, the bacterium invades and proliferates within the bovine erythrocytes, causing anemia and impairing milk production and weight gain. In addition, infection can cause abortion and high mortality in areas of enzootic instability. The immunization with live and inactivated vaccines are employed to the control acute bovine anaplasmosis. However, they do not prevent persistent infection. Therefore, infected animals, even if immunized, are reservoirs of the bacterium and contribute to the dissemination of the disease. Antimicrobials are also largely employed for the prophylaxis of bovine anaplasmosis. However, they are often used in subtlethal doses, what can select pre-existing resistant bacteria and induce genetic or phenotypic variations. Therefore, the standardization of an in vitro assay to evaluate the susceptibility of A. marginale strains to different antimicrobials is important to allow the prescription of the more effective treatment, preventing both the selection and spread of resistant strains. Results Initially the antimicrobial susceptibility of two field isolates of A. marginale (Jaboticabal and Palmeira) infecting bovines was evaluated. The least susceptible strain (Jaboticabal) was used for the standardization of an antimicrobial assay using a culture of Ixodes scapularis-derived tick cell line, ISE6. Results showed that enrofloxacin (ENRO) at 0.25, 1 or 4 μg/mL and oxytetracycline (OTC) at 4 or 16 μg/mL are the most efficient treatments, followed by OTC at 1 μg/mL and imidocarb dipropionate (IMD) at 1 or 4 μg/mL. Conclusion In the current study, we present a new in vitro assay using a tick cell line to evaluate the susceptibility of A. marginale to antimicrobials. The maintenance of such culture is much easier than the maintenance of bovine erythrocyte culture, which depends on continuous cell replacement. This assay may be used to guide cattle farmers to the correct use of antimicrobials. The choice of the most suitable antimicrobial is essential to eliminate persistent infections, preventing the spread of resistant strains and helping in the control of bovine anaplasmosis."

The data obtained through molecular-biological verification allow to unite under the name of “tick-borne ricketsioses” a group of infections caused by R. sibirica subsp. sibirica, R. conorii, R. heilongjiangensis and other species of rickettsiae circulating in natural foci of various regions of Russia. Cases of tick-borne rickettsioses in Siberia and the Far East, caused by various species of rickettsiae, are registered under the name of “Siberian tick-borne typhus” due to the lack of available methods of differential laboratory diagnostics. The paper presents the assessment of the incidence of Siberian tick-borne typhus, indicating not only the varying degrees of epidemic hazard of endemic regions, but also changes in the distribution of risk areas, including the identification of new, epidemically significant foci. In accordance with the risk-oriented approach to prophylaxis, forecasting of epidemic situation on tick-borne rickettsioses was given and differentiation of the endemic territories of the Russian Federation as regards Siberian tick-borne typhus was carried out with distinguishing of epidemiological zones of low, medium, above average, high and very high risk of population infection."

The aim of this study was twofold: (i) to describe the profile of patients hospitalised by TBDs; and (ii) to evaluate the data collected in the medical records from the ED in order to analyse their potential clinical consequences. A total of 84 cases that included all TBD diagnoses registered in the ED records were identified and analysed. These corresponded to all the hospitalisations by TBDs in the last 10 years (2009–2019) in two tertiary hospitals in Granada, Spain. Statistical analyses were made using RStudio. Coinciding with the absence of patient's report of exposure to ticks, 64.3% of TBDs were not suspected in the ED. Intensive care unit admission was required in 8.3% of cases, and the mortality rate was 2.4%. Non-suspected cases showed longer hospital stay ("

The major epidemiological importance of ticks of the species I. persulcatus is found, their share being 87,6%. The majority of patients being bitten by a tick were from the southern and southeast areas of Primorye. Contamination of ticks with Borrelia was revealed not only in I. persulcatus, but also in ticks of the Haemaphysalis and Dermacentor. The infectiousness of ticks of B. burgdorferi s.l. (42,3%), tick-borne encephalitis virus (7,7%) and A. phagocytophilum (15,4%) was highest on Russky Island."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The abundance of tick populations in South Africa represents a probable risk for both animal and human health. Rickettsia and Borrelia are well-known significant agents of emerging human tick-borne infectious diseases throughout the world. Nevertheless, the epidemiology of their infections has been underreported in South Africa, Therefore, the aim of this study was to profile for zoonotic Rickettsia and Borrelia species from ticks infesting domesticated animals in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Morphological and molecular identification techniques were conducted on 1,200 tick samples collected from domestic animals before screening for the target bacterial pathogens. The molecular identification of the tick samples was based on the amplification of the 12S rRNA mitochondrial DNA while those of Rickettsia and Borrelia species were carried out by amplifying fragments of glt A, omp A and omp B genes for Rickettsia and fla B gene for Borrelia spp. Thereafter, the positive ticks, Borrelia and Rickettsia omp B amplicons were sequenced and further analysed. Eight species of ticks belonging to three genera; Rhipicephalus, Amblyomma, and Haemaphysalis were identified. A total of 320 (27%) samples were confirmed positive for Rickettsia out of which 74 (23%) were positive for both omp A and omp B genes. Phylogenetic analysis of omp B revealed a high homology to rickettsial reference strains from GenBank, while there was no positive result for Borrelia. The generated sequences showed 99.1 to 100% homology with R. africae -KX227790 (100%), R. parkeri - KY113111 (99.8%), R .peacock (99.3%) and R. slovaca - KJ675445, JX683122 (99.1%) representative sequences in GenBank. The findings from this study revealed that ticks collected from domesticated animals were parasitized by Rickettsia species with possible zoonotic potential, which is detrimental to human health if bitten by infected ticks."

		"abstract": "The tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the causative agent of one of the most severe human neuroinfections. The infection transmitted by ixodid ticks is spread throughout the forest and foreststeppe zones of the temperate climatic belt of the Eurasian continent, including the Siberian region of the Russian Federation. Despite the availability of commercial analytical systems for the detection of TBEV, the task of developing approaches to a quick and reliable analysis that can be performed routinely, particularly in environmental studies, remains topical. A solid-phase bioluminescent immunoassay for determining the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks was developed. The assay is based on the hybrid protein consisting of a modified thermostable version of Renilla muelleri luciferase and a single-chain mini-antibody to protein E. This unique protein had been obtained and investigated by the authors earlier. The current study describes the expression of the hybrid protein in two different strains of recombinant E. coli cells. The optimal conditions for obtaining a highly purified protein were found. The bioluminescent reaction of the luciferase domain was triggered with the help of the stable natural form of the substrate, a Ca2+-dependent coelenterazine-binding protein, the recombinant variant of which was obtained by the authors. The conditions for production and storage of the immunoassay components (the hybrid protein, the stable form of the luciferase substrate, and activated microplates) were determined. Using the developed test system, more than 900 tick samples were analyzed for TBEV. In terms of sensitivity (89.5%) and specificity (98.9%), the proposed method is not inferior to colorimetric detection and is much simpler and faster than the latter"

		"abstract": "In Poland, out of the 21 species of ticks described, two species have the greatest epidemiological significance: Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus. Their participation in the transmission of etiologic agents of vector diseases such as Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis and many others is widely known. Due to the often severe and sometimes fatal course of diseases transmitted by ticks, a great deal of emphasis is placed on prophylactic activities, minimizing the possibility of biting and transfering pathogens along with the arachnid saliva. In addition to means of personal protection, including appropriate clothing, protective vaccinations, avoiding tick habitats or body checking after returning from this type of places, one of the most important elements of anti-tick prevention is the use of effective repellents. The key role of using the repellent is to discourage the arthropod from attacking and to prevent it from taking food, as a result of which there is no phenomenon of transmission of pathogens from the hematophage to the host organism. The most commonly used substances with arthropod repellent properties are: N-N-diethylm-toluamide (DEET), 3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester (IR3535), icaridine, permethrin and essential oils. However, it should be remembered that no repellent ever protects 100% all the time after application - its use should be considered as one of many elements of personal protection in the prevention of tick bites."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is an important arbovirus, which is found across large parts of Eurasia and is considered to be a major health risk for humans. Like any other arbovirus, TBEV relies on complex interactions between vectors, reservoir hosts, and the environment for successful virus circulation. Hard ticks are the vectors for TBEV, transmitting the virus to a variety of animals. The importance of these animals in the lifecycle of TBEV is still up for debate. Large woodland animals seem to have a positive influence on virus circulation by providing a food source for adult ticks; birds are suspected to play a role in virus distribution. Bank voles and yellow-necked mice are often referred to as classical virus reservoirs, but this statement lacks strong evidence supporting their highlighted role. Other small mammals (e.g., insectivores) may also play a crucial role in virus transmission, not to mention the absence of any suspected reservoir host for non-European endemic regions. Theories highlighting the importance of the co-feeding transmission route go as far as naming ticks themselves as the true reservoir for TBEV, and mammalian hosts as a mere bridge for transmission. A deeper insight into the virus reservoir could lead to a better understanding of the development of endemic regions. The spatial distribution of TBEV is constricted to certain areas, forming natural foci that can be restricted to sizes of merely 500 square meters. The limiting factors for their occurrence are largely unknown, but a possible influence of reservoir hosts on the distribution pattern of TBE is discussed. This review aims to give an overview of the multiple factors influencing the TBEV transmission cycle, focusing on the role of virus reservoirs, and highlights the questions that are waiting to be further explored."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus remains one of the main etiological agents of central nervous system infections in Europe. The disease occurs endemically in Central and Eastern Europe, Southern part of Russia and Scandinavia. Between 2000 and 2015 there were 3 662 registered TBE cases in Poland and approximately 45% of them were reported in Podlaskie voivodeship. TBE typically develops as a result of being bitten by infected tick, however, it can also be a consequence of ingestion of unpasteurized milk from viremic animal. OBJECTIVES. The aim of the article was to underline to the importance of TBE virus transmission via alimentary route and clinical description of four patients who developed TBE as a result of raw goat milk consumption. MATERIAL AND METHODS. A retrospective analysis of documentation of four patients hospitalized in Observational-Infectious Department of Independent Public Healthcare Centre in Hajnówka and Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections at the Medical University of Bialystok from June 10th 2017 to July 11th 2017 due to alimentary TBE. RESULTS. Patients were between 24 and 36 years of age. They have consumed goat milk from the same source. None of the patients have been vaccinated against TBE virus. In all patients typical biphasic disease course with the presence of prodromal and neurological phase was observed. TBE was confirmed by demonstration of anti-TBE antibodies in serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid of patients. CONCLUSIONS. Diagnosis of TBE should be considered in every case of encephalitis in endemic areas. Due to the risk of TBE infection after consumption of unpasteurized milk from livestock, it is crucial to raise awareness of general population and farm owners about the possibility of TBE infection via alimentary route."

		"abstract": "Background: Early diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) is critical for mitigating their adverse health outcomes, but the differential diagnosis of TBDs is challenging because many symptoms are nonspecific and commonly used diagnostic assays have significant shortcomings. Furthermore, although the local incidence of TBDs is recognized as an important factor in diagnosis, tools to help clinicians formally consider surveillance data in their decision-making are not available. To address these gaps, Gryphon Scientific developed a differential diagnosis application (app) for TBDs that calculates a patient’s likelihood of infection with specific TBDs based on their symptoms, risk factors, and state of suspected tick exposure. Methods: A differential diagnosis model for TBDs was developed using data on: (1) TBD symptom and risk factor prevalence in TBD patient populations, collected from clinical studies; and (2) human TBD incidence data from notifiable disease surveillance systems and tick infection prevalence data from reports and public databases, which were combined to develop an environmental risk measure. These data were used to build a Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model that predicts TBD infection probabilities based on a patient’s symptoms, risk factors, and state of suspected tick exposure. Performance of the model was validated using case studies from the biomedical literature. The model was incorporated into an app developed using R-shiny, called TBD-DDx (Figures 1 and 3). Results: A pilot application was developed that includes 10 states (AR, CT, MA, ME, MN, MO, NH, RI, VT, and WI) and the 11 TBDs endemic to those states. The differential diagnosis model identified the patient’s true disease as the top-predicted disease in 56% of cases and within the top three predicted TBD in 84% of cases. The inclusion of incidence factors in the model improved performance (Figure 4). Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the TBD-DDx app is a promising tool for informing clinical diagnoses of TBDs to guide selection of diagnostic testing and treatment. This study represents the first use of a BBN modeling approach that incorporates an environmental risk measure and could be adapted for differential diagnosis of other diseases with environmental or other exposure risks.

The data on the incidence of Rospotrebnadzor of the Russian Federation and the regions of the Siberian Federal District for 2000–2017 years were used, the reporting of regional health services, the conditions and cause-effect relationships of the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis were assessed in the analysis of epidemiological survey maps of outbreaks. The study found that the analysis of the potential risk of contact with the foci of this infection in the regions of the Siberian Federal District, based on the ranking of regions by the level of population’s appeal for tick bites, can be considered as a prognostic criterion in planning the volume of preventive measures. Vaccination, having a significant impact on reducing morbidity (r = –0.89; p < 0.001) and mortality (r = –0.86; p < 0.001) from this infection, together with seroprophylaxis, can be one of the leading factors in epidemiological forecasting the incidence of tick-borne viral encephalitis in endemic areas."

DNA of Eh. canis was detected in four I. ricinus ticks (12%) . Bartonella spp. DNAs with 100% identity with Bartonella henselae were identified in two I. ricinus (5%) collected from one dog and one cat. One tick showed 100% similarity with C. abortus , while 16 I. ricinus ticks exhibithed DNA of C. psittaci . DNAs of piroplasmids, Anaplasma spp., and C. burnetii were not detected in this study. Findings expand knowledge about the repertoire of tick-borne bacteria present in ticks from Tuscany and indicate that cats and dogs are exposed to tick-borne pathogen which represent a medical risk for their owners."

		"abstract": "Background:: In the United States, tick-borne illnesses account for a significant number of patients that have been seen and treated by health care facilities. This in turn, has resulted in a significant morbidity and mortality and economic costs to the country. Methods:: The distribution of these illnesses is geographically variable and is related to the climate as well. Many of these illnesses can be diagnosed and treated successfully, if recognized and started on appropriate antimicrobial therapy early in the disease process. Patient with illnesses such as Lyme disease, Wet Nile illness can result in chronic debilitating diseases if not recognized early and treated. Conclusion:: This paper covers illnesses such as Lyme disease, West Nile illness, Rocky Mountain Spotted fever, Ehrlichia, Tularemia, typhus, mosquito borne illnesses such as enteroviruses, arboviruses as well as arthropod and rodent borne virus infections as well. It covers the epidemiology, clinical features and diagnostic tools needed to make the diagnosis and treat these patients as well."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis is the most important tick-transmitted zoonotic virus infection in Eurasia, causing severe neurological symptoms in humans. The causative agent, the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), circulates between ticks and a variety of mammalian hosts. To study the interaction between TBEV and one of its suspected reservoir hosts, bank voles of the Western evolutionary lineage were inoculated subcutaneously with either one of eight TBEV strains or the related attenuated Langat virus, and were euthanized after 28 days. In addition, a subset of four strains was characterized in bank voles of the Carpathian linage. Six bank voles were inoculated per strain, and were housed together in groups of three with one uninfected in-contact animal each. Generally, most bank voles did not show any clinical signs over the course of infection. However, one infected bank vole died and three had to be euthanized prematurely, all of which had been inoculated with the identical TBEV strain (Battaune 17-H9, isolated in 2017 in Germany from a bank vole). All inoculated animals seroconverted, while none of the in-contact animals did. Viral RNA was detected via real-time RT-PCR in the whole blood samples of 31 out of 74 inoculated and surviving bank voles. The corresponding serum sample remained PCR-negative in nearly all cases (29/31). In addition, brain and/or spine samples tested positive in 11 cases, mostly correlating with a positive whole blood sample. Our findings suggest a good adaption of TBEV to bank voles, combining in most cases a low virulence phenotype with detectable virus replication and hinting at a reservoir host function of bank voles for TBEV."

We performed descriptive analyses of notification data (2001–2018, n = 6063) according to region, demographics and clinical manifestations and calculated incidence trends using negative binomial regression. Risk areas were defined based on incidence in administrative districts. Most cases (89%) occurred in the federal states of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria, where annual TBE incidence fluctuated markedly between 0.7–2.0 cases/100,000 inhabitants. A slight but significantly increasing temporal trend was observed from 2001–2018 (age-adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01–1.04)), primarily driven by high case numbers in 2017–2018. Mean incidence was highest in 40–69-year-olds and in males. More males (23.7%) than females (18.0%, p = 0.02) had severe disease (encephalitis or myelitis), which increased with age, as did case-fatality (0.4% overall; 2.1% among ≥70-year-olds). Risk areas increased from 129 districts in 2007 to 161 in 2019. Expansion occurred mainly within existent southern endemic areas, with slower contiguous north-eastern and patchy north-western spread. Median vaccination coverage at school entry in risk areas in 2016–2017 ranged from 20%–41% in 4 states. Increasing TBE vaccine uptake is an urgent priority, particularly in high-incidence risk areas."

Since many tick identification studies are based on the analysis of 16S rDNA, 12S rDNA and ITS-1, 2 rDNA genes, we aimed to compare the performance of these molecular markers of common use for the identification of ticks, under a diagnostic laboratory environment. Methods: Overall, 192 tick specimens were collected through the state of Texas from January 2014 to August 2015 and the species was determined by both morphology and molecular amplification using the 16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, ITS1 and ITS2. Results: The species collected were identified by molecular techniques as Dermacentor albipictus, D. variabilis, Am­blyomma americanum, Ixodes scapularis, A. cajennense, Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Carios capensis. ITS1 and ITS2 were not able to prove consistent amplification and therefore have been considered as potential markers for tick iden­tification. Conclusion: The use of mitochondrial genes in tick identification showed to provide more consistent results in the diagnostic environment."

Our data support the wide distribution of previously experimentally characterized exoribonuclease resistant RNAs (xrRNAs) within tick-borne and no-known-vector flaviviruses and provide evidence for the existence of a cascade of duplicated RNA structures within insect-specific flaviviruses. On a broader scale, our findings indicate that viral 3 ′ UTRs represent a flexible scaffold for evolution to come up with novel xrRNAs."

In the present study, we assessed the levels of 24 cytokines/chemokines associated with innate and adaptive immune responses in matched serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of 81 patients at first visit, and in serum at follow-up time points. Serum levels of several cytokines/chemokines obtained during the meningoencephalitic phase of TBE differed compared to the levels at a follow-up visit 2 months later; several significant differences were also found in cytokine/chemokine levels in serum at 2 months compared to the last time point, 2–7 years after acute illness. Cytokines/chemokines levels in CSF or serum obtained at the time of acute illness or serum levels obtained 2 months after the onset of TBE did not have predictive value for an unfavorable outcome 2–7 years later. In contrast, serum levels of mediators associated with Th17 responses were lower in patients with unfavorable outcome whereas those associated with other adaptive or innate immune responses were higher at the last visit in those with an unfavorable outcome. These findings provide new insights into the immunopathogenesis of TBE and implicate inflammatory immune responses with post-encephalitic syndrome years after the initial infection."

The genus Ornithodoros spp., which is included in Family Argasidae, is usually associated with wild animals including seabirds and it was difficult to investigate because seabirds’ nests are found in inaccessible uninhabited islands. However, Ornithodoros spp. has been known for the vector of many diseases including African swine fever.MethodsIn this study, nest with soil and litter of seabirds were collected, to investigate Ornithodoros species from 9 uninhabited islands, Nan-do, Chilsan-do, Chilbal-do, Sogukhol-do, Googul-do, Gaerin-do, Sasu-do, Hong-do (Hallyeohaesang) and Dok-do located western and southern part of the Korea from July, 2017 to September in 2018. The islands are known for breeding places of migratory and resident birds. Maximum ten nests with soil and litter of seabirds were collected from one uninhabited island for the conservation of the islands environment. Ticks were collected from nest with soil and litter of seabirds using Tullgren funnel and were assayed for tick identification by PCR using 16S rRNA gene and tick-borne pathogens including Rickettia spp., Borrelia spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia chaffensis, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma bovis by nested PCR.ResultsTotal 65 Ornithodoros species ticks from 338 seabird's (black-tailed gull, Larus crassirotris; streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas and Swinhoe's storm petrel, Oceanodroma monorhis) nesting soil with litter in 9 uninhabited islands. In the sequence identification of 16S rRNA gene fragment of Ornithodoros species, O. capensis and O. sawaii were 37 and 28, respectively. In the analyses of tick-borne pathogens, Borrelia spp. (n=5) was detected in O. sawaii from Gaerin-do and Googul-do. The total detection rate of Borrelia sp. from Ornithodoros spp. was 7.69% (5/65).ConclusionsIn this research, we discovered that O. sawaii are habitat in west and southern part of uninhabited islands to breeding place of black-tailed gulls and streaked shearwater and O. capensis are habitat in uninhabited islands related to breeding place of streaked shearwater. This is first report of the Borrelia spp. from Ornithodoros sawaii in Korea. "

		"abstract": "Within the past three decades, new bacterial etiological agents of tick-borne disease have been discovered in the southeastern U.S., and the number of reported tick-borne pathogen infections has increased. In Florida, few systematic studies have been conducted to determine the presence of tick-borne bacterial pathogens. This investigation examined the distribution and presence of tick-borne bacterial pathogens in Florida. Ticks were collected by flagging at 41 field sites, spanning the climatic regions of mainland Florida. DNA was extracted individually from 1608 ticks and screened for Anaplasma, Borrelia, Ehrlichia and Rickettsia using conventional PCR and primers that amplified multiple species for each genus. PCR positive samples were Sanger sequenced. Four species of ticks were collected: Amblyomma americanum, Amblyomma maculatum, Dermacentor variabilis, and Ixodes scapularis. Within these ticks, six bacterial species were identified: Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia lonestari, Ehrlichia ewingii, Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia andeanae, Rickettsia parkeri, and Rickettsia endosymbionts. Pathogenic Borrelia, Ehrlichia, and Rickettsia species were all detected in the North and North-Central Florida counties; however, we found only moderate concordance between the distribution of ticks infected with pathogenic bacteria and human cases of tick-borne diseases in Florida. Given the diversity and numerous bacterial species detected in ticks in Florida, further investigations should be conducted to identify regional hotspots of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "In Africa, pathogens transmitted by ticks are of major concern in livestock production and human health. Despite noticeable improvements particularly of molecular screening methods, their widespread availability and the detection of multiple infections remain challenging. Hence, we developed a universally accessible and robust tool for the detection of bacterial pathogens and piroplasmid parasites of cattle. A low-cost and low-density chip DNA microarray kit (LCD-Array) was designed and tested towards its specificity and sensitivity for five genera causing tick-borne diseases. The blood samples used for this study were collected from cattle in Northern Cameroon. Altogether, 12 species of the genera Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Rickettsia and Theileria, and their corresponding genus-wide probes including Babesia were tested on a single LCD-Array. The detection limit of plasmid controls by PCR ranged from 1 to 75 copies per µL depending on the species. All sequenced species hybridized on the LCD-Array. As expected, PCR, agarose gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing found significantly less pathogens than the LCD-Array (p < 0.001). Theileria and Rickettsia had lower detection limits than Anaplasma and Ehrlichia. The parallel identification of some of the most detrimental tick-borne pathogens of livestock, and the possible implementation in small molecular-diagnostic laboratories with limited capacities makes the LCD-Array an appealing asset."

We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. Results: The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95% CI 1.96 – 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95% CI 2.49 – 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95% CI 1.59 – 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. Conclusions: This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health. Trial registration: The study was registered with PROSPERO:"

In this study, we compared paired results of clinical 2-tier Lyme disease tests to those of the C6 peptide EIA followed by supplemental immunoblotting (C6 2-tier test). Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of children aged ≥1 to ≤21 years who were undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease in the emergency department at 1 of 6 centers located in regions in which Lyme disease is endemic. The clinical first-tier test and a C6 EIA were performed on the same serum sample with supplemental immunoblotting if the first-tier test result was either positive or equivocal. We compared the results of the paired clinical and C6 2-tier Lyme disease test results using the McNemar test. Results: Of the 1714 children enrolled, we collected a research serum sample from 1584 (92.4%). The clinical 2-tier EIA result was positive in 316 (19.9%) children, and the C6 2-tier test result was positive or equivocal in 295 (18.6%) children. The clinical and C6 2-tier test results disagreed more often than they would have by chance alone (P = .002). Of the 39 children with either a positive clinical or C6 2-tier test result alone, 2 children had an erythema migrans (EM) lesion, and 29 had symptoms compatible with early disseminated Lyme disease. Conclusions: Two-tier Lyme disease test results differed for a substantial number of children on the basis of the specific first-tier test used. In children for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for Lyme disease and who have an initially negative test result, clinicians should consider retesting for Lyme disease."

Maine, USA, is a high Lyme disease incidence state, with rising incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses associated with increasing I. scapularis abundance and northward range expansion. Members of the public submitted ticks to a tick identification program (1990–2013). From these passive surveillance data, we characterized temporal trends in I. scapularis submission rate (an index of abundance), comparing Maine’s northern tier (seven counties) versus southern tier (nine counties). In the northern tier, the I. scapularis submission rate increased throughout the duration of the time series, suggesting I. scapularis was emergent but not established. By contrast, in the southern tier, submission rate increased initially but leveled off after 10–14 yr, suggesting I. scapularis was established by the mid-2000s. Active (field) surveillance data from a site in the southern tier—bird tick burdens and questing adult tick collections—corroborated this leveling pattern. Lyme disease incidence and I. scapularis submission rate were temporally correlated in the northern but not southern tier. This suggested a decoupling of reported disease incidence and entomological risk."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease, caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus. Infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi can occur throughout Poland and therefore, according to ECDC description, the whole country should be considered as an endemic area. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2017 in comparison to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on data from the annual bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017”. (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2018, NIZP-PZH, GIS). RESULTS. In 2017 were registered 21,514 Lyme disease cases i.e. 1.48% more than in the previous year and 2,324 people were hospitalized. Epidemiological situation in Western European countries and Poland are similar. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. A slightly increase in 2017 and lack of a clear trend in individual voivodeships may indicate, that a very high level of sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance has been achieved."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective of this research is to develop the model for calculating the forecast of the Lyme disease dynamics what will help to take effective preventive and control measures using the intelligent multi-agent approach.IntroductionClimate warming, globalization, social and economic crises lead to the activation of natural foci of vector-borne infections, among which a special place belongs to Lyme disease (Ixodic tick borreliosis – ITB), the vectors of which are the Ixodes ticks. More than 5,000 cases are registered in the United States every year [1]. In European countries, the number of cases may reach up to 8,000-10,000 per year. Incidence rate for ITB in France is 39.4 per 100,000 population, in Bulgaria – 36.6 [2]. In Ukraine, among all ticks, 10-70% are infected with Borrelia; from 10% to 42.2% of Ukrainian population had contact with the causative agent of ITB.Mathematical modeling as an element of monitoring of natural focal infections makes it possible to assess the epidemiological potential of foci in the region and in individual territories, to forecast the trends of the epidemic process and to determine the main priorities and directions in the prevention of ITB. The most modern and effective method of simulation is multi-agent simulation, which is associated with the concept of an intelligent agent, as some robot, purposefully interacting with other similar elements and the external environment under given conditions. An intelligent agent is an imitation model of an active element, the state and behavior of which in various situations of achieving the goal vary depending on the state and behavior of other agents and the environment, in analogy with the intellectual behavior of a live organism (including a human) under similar conditions.As the epidemic process of Lyme disease is characterized by vector transmission, heterogeneous tick population, variable pathogen infectivity, heterogeneous environment, and seasonal changes in tick activity, the use of classical statistical methods for predicting the dynamics of morbidity cannot show high accuracy. The multiagent approach to simulation of the epidemic process of Lyme disease allows considering all of the above features, and since the dynamics of the modeled system is formed from the behavior of local objects (humans and ticks), we expect that a model constructed using a multiagent approach will yield a higher accuracy of prognosis morbidity. The multiagent model will allow not only to calculate the forecast, but also to reveal the factors influencing increase of the incidence of Lyme disease the most.MethodsThe research is based on official reports of new Lyme disease cases registered during 2006-2017. The data were collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine from the healthcare facilities of Kharkiv Oblast of Ukraine as a part of passive routine disease surveillance. In total, 1016 cases of Lyme disease registered during the study period were included in this research.The multi-agent approach to simulation of epidemic process has been used for the model development.The epidemiological model of Lyme disease is based on the Gromashevsky’s concept of the epidemic process, according to which the epidemic process exists with the continuous interaction of the three main components - source of infection, mechanism of transmission and susceptible organism.The most profitable type of agent in the study of epidemic process is an emotionally-motivated intellectual agent for the most complete and accurate model of human behavior. Let’s consider the agent as a set of properties:a=<s,st,c,ta,l>, a∈A, s∈S, c∈C, ta∈Ta, (1)where st is time in state s,A is set of all agents,S is set of different agent’s states,C is set of working area’s cells,Ta is set of possible agent’s types,l is length of life.The set of agent states is predefined and is constant. Depending on the process being studied, the set can be supplemented by different states, the initial set is:S={Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Dead}. (2)The composition of the workspace leads to the appearance of a set of cells, as conditional abstract objects. It is assumed that one cell can simultaneously include a number of agents as well as one object-vector of infection (tick). It is assumed that depending on the type of working area where the agent is located the specific nature of the epidemic process is changed.The vector transmission of the disease from tick to agent is realized as follows. To begin with, the possibility of contact with tick is checked. It is believed that this is possible if other agents are also processed in the same cell along with the tick processed as well. Each pair agent-tick is compared. If tick is infected, it is believed that with a certain probability healthy agent can become infected.To automate the prediction of the incidence of Lyme disease, a software package has been developed using C# programing language that allows to calculate prognosis morbidity based on existing statistical data in real time. In the developed model, the configuration of the software package includes data for the period 2006-2017. This data include incidence rate of ITB per 100,000 population, the population's seeking healthcare providers for tick bites, the results of studies of ticks removed from humans for the presence of Borrelia, the number and proportion of ticks infected by Borrelia collected by the flagging method.ResultsThe calculated prognosis shows the expected increase in the number of cases with a certain three-year cycle: an increase in the number of cases of Ixodic tick borreliosis within 2 years with a slight decrease for the next year.A comparative analysis of the accuracy of forecasting by moving average method to 3 years [3] and multiagent simulation showed that the latter describes the existing data better, therefore, the forecast will be more accurate. The accuracy rates using the moving average method is 85.4%, with the use of multiagent simulation 96.6%.ConclusionsA comparative assessment of the accuracy of predicting the dynamics of the epidemic process using the moving average method [3] and the multiagent approach was carried out. A higher accuracy is noted with the use of multi-agent simulation (96.6% against 85.4% using moving average method), based on which a software package has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate the expected morbidity rate of Lyme disease. That means that the hypothesis made of the research was confirmed. The adequacy of the tested prognosis was verified on the real statistical data collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine on the incidence of Lyme disease in Kharkiv Oblast (Ukraine) from 2006 to 2017. The obtained forecast revealed the expected persistence of the unstable epidemic situation with respect to Lyme disease, which dictates the need to develop a set of preventive measures aimed at reducing the morbidity of people by ITB. Virtual verification of the effectiveness of such events will be the next step in our study.ReferencesGulia-Nuss M. Genomic insights into the Ixodes scapularis tick vector of Lyme disease [Text] / M.

For example, CRISPR-based genome editing may be used to create white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) that are resistant to the Lyme disease spirochete vectored by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). Toward this goal, academic researchers are developing Lyme-resistant and tick-resistant white-footed mice, which are a primary pathogen reservoir for Lyme disease in the United States. If field trials on small, experimental islands are successful, the project would scale up to the larger islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and possibly to the mainland, most likely with a local gene drive to speed the traits’ proliferation, pending approvals from relevant constituents. Despite considerable publicity, this project has yet to be evaluated by independent professional ecologists. In the present article, I discuss key ecological and evolutionary questions that should be considered before such genetically engineered mice are released into natural habitats."

		"abstract": "The Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Neurology, and American Academy of Rheumatology jointly proposed Lyme disease guidelines. Four areas most relevant to psychiatry were reviewed—the disclaimer, laboratory testing, and adult and pediatric psychiatric sections. The disclaimer and the manner in which these guidelines are implemented are insufficient to remove the authors and sponsoring organizations from liability for harm caused by these guidelines. The guidelines and supporting citations place improper credibility upon surveillance case definition rather than clinical diagnosis criteria. The guidelines fail to address the clear causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, developmental disabilities and substance abuse despite significant supporting evidence. If these guidelines are published without very major revisions, and if the sponsoring medical societies attempt to enforce these guidelines as a standard of care, it will directly contribute to increasing a national and global epidemic of psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, substance abuse and developmental disabilities and the associated economic and non-economic societal burdens. The guideline flaws could be improved with a more appropriate disclaimer, an evidence-based rather than an evidence-biased approach, more accurate diagnostic criteria, and recognition of the direct and serious causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses."

In the present study, we provided a qualitative analysis of written correspondence produced by 23 parents of children and adolescents with Lyme disease. The goal of this study was to investigate how medical and psychological issues were highlighted by parents describing their family’s Lyme disease experiences. The results suggest a series of four stages in these families where satisfactory treatment had not been obtained over months or years. The experiences of parents evolved from feelings of worry for the child to frustration with the lack of a helpful treatment, to mistrust of physicians’ actions, and, in some case, to a rejection of the conventional health care system as a whole. Improved diagnostic testing and treatment guidelines, as well as family-centered practices of medical care were proposed as important features for improving the experiences of families living with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to describe incidence over time, geographic and seasonal distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of Lyme disease cases in Canada.IntroductionLyme disease (LD), a multisystem infection that is manifested by progressive stages (1), is emerging in central and eastern provinces of Canada due to northward expansion of the geographic range of Ixodes scapularis, the main vector in these regions (2). In 2004, approximately 40 human cases of LD were reported in Canada. In 2009, LD disease became nationally notifiable, with provincial and territorial health departments reporting clinician-diagnosed cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). This study summarizes seven years (2009-2015) of national surveillance data for LD in Canada.MethodsNational Lyme disease surveillance data is collected through two surveillance systems, the Canadian National Disease Surveillance System (CNDSS) and the Lyme disease enhanced surveillance system (LDES). The CNDSS collects only demographic data (age and sex), and information on episode date and case classification. The LDES system captures additional data, including: possible geographic location of infection (for both locally acquired and travel-related cases); clinical manifestations; and results of laboratory testing. Nine provinces out of ten participate to LDES that means they provide a part of or all the data elements of this surveillance system. The 2009 national Lyme disease case definition (3) that distinguishes confirmed and probable cases (Table 1) is used to classify and report cases diagnosed by clinicians.This study describes the incidence over time, seasonal and geographic distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of reported LD cases. Logistic regression was used to explore variations among age groups, sex and year of reporting clinical manifestations to better understand potential demographic risk factors for the occurrence of LD. Different models were used with as outcomes absence or presence of: erythema migrans (early Lyme disease), neurologic and cardiac symptoms and multiple erythema, migrans (early disseminated Lyme disease); and arthritis (late disseminated Lyme disease). The most parsimonious multivariate models were sought by backward elimination of nonsignificant variables until all factors in the model were significant (P<0.05).ResultsThe number of reported LD cases increased more than six-fold, from 144 in 2009 to 917 in 2015, mainly due to an increase in infections acquired in Canada. For the provinces participating into the LDES system, the month of illness onset for Lyme disease cases acquired in Canada was available for 2010 cases. Most cases were reported during the summer months of June (20.7%), July (35.4%) and August (17.3%) (Figure 1). An increase in incidence of LD was observed in provinces from Manitoba eastwards (Figure 2). This is consistent with our knowledge of range expansion of the tick vectors in this region. In the western provinces the incidence has remained low and stable. All cases reported by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador were acquired outside of the province, either elsewhere in Canada or abroad. There was a bimodal distribution for LD by age with peaks at 5–9 and 45–74 years of age (Figure 3). The most common presenting symptoms were a single erythema migrans rash (74.2%) and arthritis (35.7%) (Figure 4). In the multivariate analysis for clinical manifestations, children aged 0–9 years had a greater number of cases reported as early LD (erythema migrans only) than patients aged 10–19 and 30–39 years (P<0.05). For early disseminated manifestations, young adults 20–29 years of age reported more neurologic manifestations, cardiac manifestations or multiple erythema migrans than the reference age group of 0–9 years (P<0.05). For late disseminated manifestations, children under 15 years of age were more frequently reported as having arthritis than other age groups.ConclusionsLyme disease incidence continues to increase in Canada as does the geographic range of ticks that carry the LD bacteria. This increasing of LD incidence might also be due to changing in knowledge, attitudes, and practices of clinicians who diagnose the disease and or of the public health workers who collect and report the data. Ongoing surveillance, preventive strategies as well as early disease recognition and treatment will continue to minimize the impact of LD in Canada.References1.

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. The disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, a skin rash, and joint pain. If left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system, resulting in inflammation and long-term symptoms that include arthritis and/or intermittent pain in joints and muscles, facial palsy, cardiovascular abnormalities and cognitive disturbances. Recent research suggests that late-stage Lyme disease may be a result of malfunctioning immune function. AHCCÒ is a natural immune modulating compound derived from a unique fraction of special cultured medicinal mushroom mycelia. Previous studies have also suggested that AHCCÒ exhibits preventive effect against a wide range of infections caused by MRSA, influenza and West Nile virus. The effect of AHCCÒ supplementation on Lyme disease patients was evaluated in the current study.Methods: In a pilot open-label study, 12 Lyme disease patients were administered 3 grams of AHCCÒ daily for 8 weeks. Before commencement of the administration and after 4 and 8 weeks, the effects of AHCCÒ were evaluated clinically based on symptoms, serum antibodies to pathogens, inflammatory activity and serum immunological parameters. Patients completed questionnaires pertaining to Qualify of Life parameters.Results: After 8 weeks of AHCCÒ administration, AHCCÒ ameliorated flu-like symptoms and manifestations in the eye, joint, muscle, nervous system and cardiovascular system. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an index as inflammation and serum interleukin-8 was significantly decreased.Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that AHCCÒ may be effective in treating patients with Lyme disease."

Methodology: three questionnaires were designed and applied to 290 individuals (40 small animal veterinarians, 50 in other professional practice and 200 veterinary students). Results and discussion: in general, the three groups were unaware about the disease, although there is a high interest in learning about this problem. Graduates from seven universities included in this study stated that Lyme disease was not part of the veterinary curriculum in their schools. Five clinical cases suggestive of Lyme disease occurring in dogs in the area were detected at the time of this research. Conclusion: although the presence of the agent causing Lyme disease has not been demonstrated in the studied area due to the lack of laboratory support and the apparent absence of the vector, it cannot be ruled out; furthermore, it is important that veterinary practitioners and student alike be aware of the potential presence of Lyme disease, paying particular attention to differential diagnosis when resembling clinical signs are observed."

We conducted a qualitative literature review of 100 field studies where birds were searched for ticks to characterize which parts of a bird’s anatomy are typically sampled. To increase understanding of potential biases associated with different sampling approaches, we described variation in tick loads among bird body parts using field-collected data from 459 wild-caught birds that were searched across the entire body. The literature review illustrated a lack of clarity and consistency in tick-searching protocols: 57% of studies did not explicitly report whether entire birds or only particular body parts were searched, 34% reported concentrating searches on certain body parts (most frequently the head only), and only 9% explicitly reported searching the entire bird. Based on field-collected data, only 22% of ticks were found on the head, indicating that studies focusing on the head likely miss a large proportion of ticks. We provide tentative evidence that feeding locations may vary among tick species; 89% of Amblyomma americanum, 73% of Ambloyomma maculatum, and 56% of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris were on body parts other than the head. Our findings indicate a need for clear reporting and increased standardization of tick searching methodologies, including sampling the entire bird body, to provide an unbiased understanding of the role of birds in the maintenance and emergence of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can persist for long periods in the human body has been a controversial question. The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation."

The more simplistic “implicit” framework facilitates derivation of mathematically rigorous results on disease suppression and optimal control, but the biological connection of these results to realworld “explicit” control actions that could guide specific management actions is vague at best. Here, we formally define the biological and mathematical relationships between implicit and explicit control, and we provide detailed mathematical expressions relating the strength of implicit control to management-relevant properties of explicit control for four common intervention strategies. These expressions allow optimal control and sensitivity analysis results in existing implicit control studies to be interpreted in terms of real world actions. Our work reveals a previously unknown fact: implicit control is a meaningful approximation of explicit control only when resonance-like synergistic effects between multiple controls have a negligible effect on average population reduction. When non-negligible synergy exists, implicit control results, despite their mathematical tidiness, fail to provide accurate predictions regarding vector control and disease spread. The methodology we establish can be applied to study the interaction of phenological effects with control strategies, and we present a new technique for finding impulse control strategies that optimally reduce a vector population in the presence of seasonally oscillating model parameters. Collectively, these elements build an effective bridge between analytically interesting and mathematically tractable implicit control and the challenging, action-oriented explicit control."

The clinical signs are characterized by abortion and congenital deformities in newborns. The virus is transmitted by Culicoides midges of the Obsoletus complex. SBV infection induces a solid protective immunity that persists for at least 4 or 6 years in sheep and cattle, respectively. SBV infection can be diagnosed directly by real-time RT-qPCR and virus isolation or indirectly by serological assays. Three vaccines are commercially available in Europe. This article provides a comprehensive literature review on this emerging disease regarding pathogenesis, transmission, diagnosis, control and prevention. This review also highlights that although much has been learned since SBV’s first emergence, there are still areas that require further study to devise better mitigation strategies."

This qualitative study aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of the farmworkers’ experience, knowledge, health beliefs, information needs, and preventive practices of tick bites and TBDs. Methodology: A total of nine focus group discussions with 56 farmworkers across eight animal farms in Peninsular Malaysia were conducted between August and October 2013. Results: Farmworkers explained their experience of tick bites, but no one reported TBDs. Many farmworkers indicated that they did not seek any medical treatment. There was a misconception that ticks are solely pathogenic to farm animals. Farmworkers perceived low severity and susceptibility of tick bites, and low self-efficacy of tick bite prevention, however, a group also perceived susceptibility to getting tick bites due to the characteristics of their job. Barriers for prevention were related to the perception and knowledge towards ticks. Farmworkers requested information about TBDs. Conclusions: This study of farmworkers identified gaps in the knowledge of TBDs, barriers of the tick bite preventive measures and information needs. These findings suggest a need for education programs to improve the knowledge of ticks and TBDs, change health beliefs and address the barriers of tick bite preventive measures."

The frequency of these TBDs has been increasing and extending to new territories in a significant way, partly since ticks’ populations are highly favored by prevailing factors such as change in land use patterns, and climate change. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate estimates of mortality, premature mortality, and disability associated about TBDs, more molecular and epidemiological studies in different regions of the world, including Latin America, are required. In the case of this region, there is still a limited number of published studies. In addition, there is recently the emergence and discovering of pathogens not reported previously in this region but present in other areas of the world. In this article we discuss some studies and implications about TBDs in Latin America, most of them, zoonotic and with evolving taxonomical issues.</ns4:p>"

Analysis of the effectiveness of specific preventive measures against tick-borne viral encephalitis among the urban and rural population of the Altai Krai of different age groups in 2000-2017. Methods. The paper presents the results of a long-term epidemiological analysis of the incidence among urban and rural population of the Altai Krai of tick-borne viral encephalitis in 2000-2017, the calculation of absolute and relative indicators, long-standing dynamics of the incidence of tick-borne viral encephalitis in RF ad Altai Krai was evaluzted as well as summarized parameter of vaccination and revaccination. Statistical data processing was carried out in the program Statistica 12.0. Results. The study revealed an inverse moderate correlation between the factor of the volume of emergency prophylaxis and the incidence of tick-borne viral encephalitis among the population of the Altai Krai (r=-0.51; p"

Hitherto, TBEV had only been detected in a limited area in eastern England. This southern English viral genome sequence is distinct from TBEV-UK, being most similar to TBEV-NL. The new location of TBEV presence highlights that the diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis should be considered in encephalitic patients in areas of the United Kingdom outside eastern England."

TBRF shares symptoms with Lyme disease (LD) caused by related Lyme disease Borreliae (LDB). TBRF and LD are transmitted by ticks and occur in overlapping localities worldwide. Serological detection of antibodies used for laboratory confirmation of LD is not established for TBRF. A line immunoblot assay using recombinant proteins from different RFB species, termed TBRF IB, was developed and its diagnostic utility investigated. The TBRF IBs were able to differentiate between antibodies to RFB and LDB and had estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 70.5%, 99.5%, 97.3%, and 93.4%, respectively, based on results with reference sera from patients known to be positive and negative for TBRF. The use of TBRF IBs and analogous immunoblots for LD to test sera of patients from Australia, Ukraine, and the USA with LD symptoms revealed infection with TBRF alone, LD alone, and both TBRF and LD. Diagnosis by clinical criteria alone can, therefore, underestimate the incidence of TBRF. TBRF IBs will be useful for laboratory confirmation of TBRF and understanding its epidemiology worldwide."

		"abstract": "A new simple electrochemical immunosensor approach for the determination of antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in immunological products was developed and tested. The assay is performed by detecting the silver reduction signal in the bioconjugates with antibodies (Ab@AgNP). Here, signal is read by cathodic linear sweep voltammetry (CLSV) through the detection of silver chloride reduction on a gold–carbon composite electrode (GCCE). Covalent immobilization of the antigen on the electrode surface was performed after thiolation and glutarization of the GCCE. Specific attention has been paid to the selection of conditions for stabilizing both the silver nanoparticles and their Ab@AgNP. A simple flocculation test with NaCl was used to select the concentration of antibodies, and the additional stabilizer bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for Ab@AgNP preparation. The antibodies to TBEV were quantified in the range from 50 IU·mL−1 to 1600 IU·mL−1, with a detection limit of 50 IU·mL−1. The coefficient of determination (r2) is 0.989. The electrochemical immunosensor was successfully applied to check the quality of immunological products containing IgG antibodies to TBEV. The present work paves the path for a novel method for monitoring TBEV in biological fluids."

Differentiation of natural focal areas of Western Siberia by integral incidence rates of tick-borne infectious diseases for determination of the strategy and tactics of their comprehensive prevention. Materials and methods. A retrospective analysis of official statistics for the period 2002-2018 for eight sub-federal units in the context of administrative territories was carried out. The criteria of differentiation were determined by means of three evaluation scales, including long-term mean rates of tick-borne encephalitis, tick-borne borreliosis, and Siberian tick-borne typhus. As a scale gradation tool, we used the number of sample elements between the confidence boundaries of the median. The integral assessment was carried out by the sum of points corresponding to the incidence rates for each of the analyzed infections. Results. The areas of low, medium, above average, high and very high risk of tick-borne infectious diseases were determined. Recommendations on the choice of prevention strategy and tactics were given. In areas of very high and high incidence rates, a combination of population-based and individual prevention strategies is preferable while in other areas a combination of high-risk and individual strategies is recommended. Discussion. Epidemiologic zoning should be the basis of a risk-based approach to determining optimal volumes and directions of preventive measures against natural focal infections. It is necessary to improve the means and methods of determining the individual risk of getting infected and developing tick-borne infectious diseases in case of bites, in view of mixed infection of vectors, as well as methods of post-exposure disease prevention (preventive therapy)."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a causative agent of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), one of the most important human infections involving the central nervous system. Although effective vaccines are available on the market, they are recommended only in endemic areas. Despite many attempts, there are still no specific antiviral therapies for TBEV treatment. Previously, we synthesized a series of uridine derivatives of 2-deoxy sugars and proved that some compounds show antiviral activity against viruses from the Flaviviridae and Orthomyxoviridae families targeting the late steps of the N-glycosylation process, affecting the maturation of viral proteins. In this study, we evaluated a series of uridine derivatives of 2-deoxy sugars for their antiviral properties against two strains of the tick-borne encephalitis virus; the highly virulent TBEV strain Hypr and the less virulent strain Neudoerfl. Four compounds (2, 4, 10, and 11) showed significant anti-TBEV activity with IC50 values ranging from 1.4 to 10.2 µM and low cytotoxicity. The obtained results indicate that glycosylation inhibitors, which may interact with glycosylated membrane TBEV E and prM proteins, might be promising candidates for future antiviral therapies against TBEV."

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is an acute viral disease with activation of oxidative stress and increasing in cytogenetic instability. Clinical symptoms of infectious diseases usually more severe in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2), especially in the case of burden in the genotype of mutant variants of glutathione-S-transferase genes GSTM1 and GSTT1. AIMS: The aim of this study was to study the dynamics of the frequency of micronucleated cells in patients with acute TBE with concomitant DM2, depending on the burden of active and inactive variants of glutathione-S-transferase genes (GSTM1 and GSTT1) in the patients genotype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally, samples to make micronucleus assay were obtained from 138 patients with febrile illness of acute TBE, 64 of whom were diagnosed with concomitant DM2 (groups 3 and 4). As control groups, 57 healthy individuals (control 1) and 61 patients with DM2 (control 2) were examined. The samples of buccal cells for the micronucleus assay were repeatedly obtained from the individuals on the first day of admission, and also after 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months. Polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the variants of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. RESULTS: On the first days of the disease, significant increases in the frequency of micronucleated buccal cells were determined in all TBE patients as compared to controls 1 and 2 (P0.001). Significant increases in the frequency of micronucleated buccal cells was revealed in groups 3 and 4 of the TBE patients who were carriers of inactive variants of the GSTM1(0) and GSTT1(0) genes, as compared to the subgroup of TBE patients with active variants of these genes (P0.001). In all subgroups of TBE patients with concomitant DM2, the frequencies of micronucleated cells were significantly higher than in the subgroups of TBE patients without DM2 (P0.001). Study of the dynamics of the frequency of micronucleated buccal cells, as compared to the control, demonstrated that the highest and long-lasting (within 6 months) cytogenetical effects were maintained in the group of TBE patients with genotype GSTM1(0)/GSTT1 (0) and concomitant DM2. CONCLUSION: The most prolonged and highest increases in the frequencies of cytogenetically instable cells were determined in the group of acute TBE patients with concomitant DM2 who were carriers of the genotype with inactive variants of both GSTM1(0) and GSTT1(0) glutathione-S-transferase genes."

		"abstract": "Vaccines for prophylactic immunization provide the most reliable and effective protection against the vast majority of infectious diseases. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) represents a high-priority medical issue at the territory of the Eurasian continent. Of great importance is assessing a role of distinct antibody titers especially low titers, observed quite often in vaccinated individuals, sometimes posing obstacles in determining a threshold of seropositivity as well as the level of specific protection against TBE virus. We aimed at obtaining data to assess antiviral activity of virus-specific antibodies with distinct titer levels based on the in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo experimental studies with a highly virulent Far-Eastern strain of tick-borne encephalitis virus. The in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo comprehensive experimental studies with a highly virulent Far-Eastern strain of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) were conducted and the dynamics of antiviral activity of virus-specific antibodies at variable titers (1:100–1:3200) was measured (timeframe ranged within 1–96 hours p.i.) to provide a rationale for evaluating the antiviral immune response. It was found that the in vitro experiments demonstrated that the IgG at 1:100 titer exerted a weak anti-TBEV neutralizing effect at all time-points examined. The IgG 1:400 titer caused a 2 log PFU/mL decline in TBEV Dal strain yield at 72 h post-infection, whereas at 1:3200 titer it completely suppressed TBEV replication throughout the observation period. The ex vivo experiments with blood serum obtained from vaccinated subjects demonstrating a range of TBEV antibody titers (sera from vaccinated individuals with varying anti-TBEV antibody titers) and in vivo (outinbred white mice) experiments revealed a delayed virus elimination for antibody titers at 1:100 and 1:200 as well as rapid virus elimination (1–2 days p.i.) for antibody titers greater than 1:400. Thus, antibody titer at 1:400 may be considered as the universal anti-TBEV protection threshold. In order to properly conclude regarding the revaccination schedule it is advised to start with testing blood serum for durability of anti-TBEV immune response. Subjects with TBEV antibody titers at 1:100 and 1:200 should be strongly recommended to undergo a mandatory revaccination. Such an approach is believed to be the most effective way toward enhancing efficacy of vaccine-mediated protection against TBE."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background Ticks and tick-borne diseases are increasingly recognized as a cause of disease in dogs worldwide. The epidemiology of ticks and tick-transmitted protozoa and bacteria has changed due to the spread of ticks to urban and peri-urban areas and the movement of infected animals, posing new risks for animals and humans. This countrywide study reports information on distribution and prevalence of pathogens in ticks collected from privately-owned dogs in Italy. We analyzed 2681 Ixodidae ticks, collected from 1454 pet dogs from Italy. Specific PCR protocols were used to detect i) Piroplasms of the genera Babesia and Theileria , ii) Gram-negative cocci of the family Anaplasmataceae and iii) Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Sequencing of positive amplicons allowed for species identification.Results Babesia / Theileria spp. DNA was detected in 435 tick-pools (Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) = 27.57%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25.42-29.82%) with higher prevalence in Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus sanguneus group. The zoonotic B. venatorum was the most prevalent species (MIR = 7.54%; 95% CI = 6.34-8.95%). Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species were detected in 165 tick-pools (MIR = 10.46%; 95% CI = 9.26-11.79%) and specifically, A. phagocytophilum was identified with MIR = 5.07% (95% CI = 4.09-6.27%). Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and B. afzelii were detected with MIR = 0.38% (95% CI = 0.17-0.83%) and MIR = 0.25% (95% CI 0.1-0.65%) respectively.Conclusions Zoonotic pathogens were the most frequently detected in ticks collected from privately-owned dogs which might be used as markers of pathogens presence and distribution."

He had no symptoms of a respiratory tract infection. Blood examination revealed severe leukopenia and mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Onset of symptoms was rapid, intense, and occurred only a few hours after routine tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) booster vaccine. The question of a relationship between booster vaccine administration and the febrile illness with bicytopenia was raised. A broad range of diagnostics excluded infections and other causes for bicytopenia. Symptoms resolved within a few days, and blood counts normalized within two weeks. Due to the close temporal relationship, a transient benign bicytopenia and febrile illness as a systemic reaction to TBE vaccination was assumed. Review of the literature and adverse event reporting systems suggest that this is a very rare reaction."

We performed a detailed clinical evaluation and characterization of innate and adaptive inflammatory immune responses in matched serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 81 adult patients with TBE. Immune responses were then correlated with laboratory and clinical findings. The inflammatory immune responses were generally site-specific. Cytokines and chemokines associated with innate and Th1 adaptive immune responses were significantly higher in CSF, while mediators associated with Th17 and B-cell responses were generally higher in serum. Furthermore, mediators associated with innate and Th1 adaptive immune responses were positively associated with disease severity, whereas Th17 and B cell immune responses were not. During the meningoencephalitic phase of TBE, innate and Th1 adaptive inflammatory mediators were highly concentrated in CSF, the site of the disease. The consequence of this robust immune response was more severe acute illness. In contrast, inflammatory mediators associated with B cell and particularly Th17 responses were concentrated in serum. These findings provide new insights into the immunopathogenesis of TBE and implicate innate and Th1 adaptive responses in severity and clinical presentation of acute illness."

		"abstract": "Importance: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in large areas of Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. We have previously found that Galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, which is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus infection, has a strong antiviral effect against TBEV. For any antiviral drug, it is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works. Here, we produced TBEV mutants resistant to Galidesivir and found that the resistance is caused by a single amino acid substitution in an active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme which is crucial for replication of viral RNA genome. Although, this substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, Galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of Galidesivir antiviral activity."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a natural focal viral neuroinfection vastly spread in the mid-latitude climate zone of theEurasia. Lethal cases and disability related to TBE determine its high epidemiological significance as well as underlie undiminished attention to prevent it in endemic territories. At the same time, TBE epidemiologic features significantly differ in various geographic areas. Importantly, Republic Sakha (Yakutia) is not among TBE endemic areas in theRussian Federation. However, in the last decade an increased incidence of ixodic tick bites was registered in the Republic Sakha. A pattern of pathogen-specific population immunity is one of the most valuable criteria for assessing magnitude of epidemic process in TBE foci. Hence, our study was aimed at assessing natural herd immunity TBEV in Republic Sakha associated with elevated incidence of tick bite visits. Here, we analyzed the data regarding the rate of tick attacks in the period of 2001–2007 in Republic Sakha. Residents and individuals unvaccinated against TBEV in the city ofYakutskas well as various administrative regions were examined to record the peak incidence of tick attacks. It was found that a range of the administrative regions recording with registered of ixodic tick attacks and elevated incidence of tick bites was expanded. Moreover, the top incidence of tick bites was annually recorded in the south regions of the republic Aldanian, Neryungri, Olyekminsk, Leninsk, Khangalassky districts, city ofYakutskand its suburbs. Furthermore, TBEV-specific immunoglobulins were detected in 5.7±0.68% of the residents examined suggesting about contacts with the pathogen. In addition, the peak count of seropositive people (8.9±1.85%) was identified in Namsky district located in the central part of the republic. Overall, detection rate of TBEV-specific antibodies among general adult population (6.9±0.95%) was significantly higher compared to those observed in children (3.9±0.89%, р < 0.05). no significant differences in urban (5.8±1.12%) vs. rural population (5.63±0.84%) was found. "

		"abstract": "Background: In Scandinavia, the distribution of ticks is expanding and tick-borne diseases constitute growing health risks. While the probability of getting a tick-borne disease after a tick bite is low, the health impacts can be large. This, as well as other characteristics of these diseases make tick-related risks difficult for laypeople to assess and perceived risk may differ substantially from actual risk. Understanding risk perceptions is important since it is the perceived risk, rather than actual risk, that determine behaviour and even more so for new and emerging risks. The aim of this study is to investigate knowledge and risk perceptions related to tick bites and the tick-borne diseases Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). By analysing risk perceptions and knowledge, the study helps inform the development of public health strategies in response to the increasing incidence of these diseases in Scandinavia. Methods: Two thousand, six hundred sixty-eight respondents in Denmark, Norway and Sweden answered an online questionnaire with 48 questions, including 7 questions on risk perceptions and 9 knowledge questions. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse statistical differences between country sub-samples, gender and age groups. A multivariate regression model was used to analyse factors associated with risk perceptions. Results: Risk perceptions were on average high in comparison with scientific estimates, with respondents grossly overrating the probability of contracting LB or TBE if bitten by a tick. Also, the average perceived seriousness of a single tick bite and of getting LB or TBE was high. Knowledge on the other hand was low, especially among men and the youngest age group (18–29 years). Higher levels of knowledge about tick-borne diseases were associated with lower perceived seriousness of tick bites and LB and higher perceived seriousness of TBE. Also, having been diagnosed with LB was negatively associated with the perceived seriousness of LB. Conclusions: Our results indicate that informing about ticks and tick-borne diseases would be a relevant public health strategy as it could make risk perceptions better aligned with actual risk."

		"abstract": "Background: Neurotropic arboviruses are increasingly recognised as causative agents of neurological disease in Europe but underdiagnosis is still suspected. Capability for accurate diagnosis is a prerequisite for adequate clinical and public health response. Aim: To improve diagnostic capability in EVD-LabNet laboratories, we organised an external quality assessment (EQA) focusing on molecular detection of Toscana (TOSV), Usutu (USUV), West Nile (WNV) and tick-borne encephalitis viruses (TBEV). Methods: Sixty-nine laboratories were invited. The EQA panel included two WNV RNA-positive samples (lineages 1 and 2), two TOSV RNA-positive samples (lineages A and B), one TBEV RNA-positive sample (Western subtype), one USUV RNA-positive sample and four negative samples. The EQA focused on overall capability rather than sensitivity of the used techniques. Only detection of one, clinically relevant, concentration per virus species and lineage was assessed. Results: The final EQA analysis included 51 laboratories from 35 countries; 44 of these laboratories were from 28 of 31 countries in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA). USUV diagnostic capability was lowest (28 laboratories in 18 countries), WNV detection capacity was highest (48 laboratories in 32 countries). Twenty-five laboratories were able to test the whole EQA panel, of which only 11 provided completely correct results. The highest scores were observed for WNV and TOSV (92%), followed by TBEV (86%) and USUV (75%). Conclusion: We observed wide variety in extraction methods and RT-PCR tests, showing a profound absence of standardisation across European laboratories. Overall, the results were not satisfactory; capacity and capability need to be improved in 40 laboratories."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most important tick-borne arboviral disease in Europe. Presently, the main endemic regions in Germany are located in the southern half of the country. Although recently, sporadic human TBE cases were reported outside of these known endemic regions. The detection and characterization of invading TBE virus (TBEV) strains will considerably facilitate the surveillance and assessment of this important disease. In 2018, ticks were collected by flagging in several locations of the German federal state of Lower Saxony where TBEV-infections in humans (diagnosed clinical TBE disease or detection of TBEV antibodies) were reported previously. Ticks were pooled according to their developmental stage and tested for TBEV-RNA by RT-qPCR. Five of 730 (0.68%) pools from Ixodes spp. ticks collected in the areas of “Rauher Busch” and “Barsinghausen/Mooshuette” were found positive for TBEV-RNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the whole genomes and E gene sequences revealed a close relationship between the two TBEV isolates, which cluster with a TBEV strain from Poland isolated in 1971. This study provides first data on the phylogeny of TBEV in the German federal state of Lower Saxony, outside of the known TBE endemic areas of Germany. Our results support the hypothesis of an east-west invasion of TBEV strains in Western Europe."

A better understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of flaviviruses in France is needed to better define risk areas and to gain knowledge of the dynamics of virus transmission cycles. Serum samples from 1014 wild boar and 758 roe deer from 16 departments (administrative units) in France collected from 2009 to 2014 were screened for flavivirus antibodies using a competitive ELISA (cELISA) technique. Serum samples found to be positive or doubtful by cELISA were then tested for antibodies directed against West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV), Bagaza virus (BAGV), and tick-borne encephalitis/Louping ill viruses (TBEV/LIV) by microsphere immunoassays (except BAGV) and micro-neutralization tests. USUV antibodies were detected only in southeastern and southwestern areas. TBEV/LIV antibodies were detected in serum samples from eastern, southwestern and northern departments. The results indicate continuous circulation of USUV in southern France from 2009 to 2014, which was unnoticed by the French monitoring system for bird mortality. The findings also confirm wider distribution of TBEV in the eastern part of the country than of human clinical cases. However, further studies are needed to determine the tick-borne flavivirus responsible for the seroconversion in southwestern and northern France."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a severe neuropathological disorder caused by tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Brain TBEV infection is characterized by extensive pathological neuroinflammation. The mechanism by which TBEV causes CNS destruction remains unclear, but growing evidence suggests that it involves both direct neuronal damage by the virus infection and indirect damage caused by the immune response. Here, we aimed to examine the TBEV-infection-induced innate immune response in mice and in human neural cells. We also compared cytokine/chemokine communication between naïve and infected neuronal cells and astrocytes. Methods: We used a multiplexed Luminex system to measure multiple cytokines/chemokines and growth factors in mouse serum samples and brain tissue, and in human neuroblastoma cells (SK-N-SH) and primary cortical astrocytes (HBCA), which were infected with the highly pathogenic TBEV strain Hypr. We also investigated changes in cytokine/chemokine production in naïve HBCA cells treated with virus-free supernatants from TBEV-infected SK-N-SH cells and in naïve SK-N-SH cells treated with virus-free supernatants from TBEV-infected HBCA cells. Additionally, a plaque assay was performed to assess how cytokine/chemokine treatment influenced viral growth following TBEV infection. Results: TBEV-infected mice exhibited time-dependent increases in serum and brain tissue concentrations of multiple cytokines/chemokines (mainly CXCL10/IP-10, and also CXCL1, G-CSF, IL-6, and others). TBEV-infected SK-N-SH cells exhibited increased production of IL-8 and RANTES and downregulated MCP-1 and HGF. TBEV infection of HBCA cells activated production of a broad spectrum of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (mainly IL-6, IL-8, CXCL10, RANTES, and G-CSF) and downregulated the expression of VEGF. Treatment of SK-N-SH with supernatants from infected HBCA induced expression of a variety of chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced SK-N-SH mortality after TBEV infection, and decreased virus growth in these cells. Treatment of HBCA with supernatants from infected SK-N-SH had little effect on cytokine/chemokine/growth factor expression but reduced TBEV growth in these cells after infection. Conclusions: Our results indicated that both neurons and astrocytes are potential sources of pro-inflammatory cytokines in TBEV-infected brain tissue. Infected/activated astrocytes produce cytokines/chemokines that stimulate the innate neuronal immune response, limiting virus replication, and increasing survival of infected neurons."

In the present case series, we present clinical and socio-epidemiological data of patients with TBE hospitalized in the period of TBE virus epidemic in Serbia. Methodology: A case series was conducted in Serbia in 2017. Patients with confirmed TBE were included in the study. Biochemical and serological analysis of blood and CSF, as well as radiological imaging (CT and MRI) were done. Results: In total, 10 patients with TBE were included in the study. M:F ratio was 1.5:1, while average age was 45.1 years. Half of the patients had severe clinical picture. Endocranial CT scan and MRI did not reveal any abnormality, except in the patient with the most severe CNS infection (meningoencephalomyelitis). Mean value of sedimentation and CRP was slightly elevated (29.6 mm/1hours and 20.1 mg/L, respectively) in 80% of the patients, although elevation was almost negligible. The average number of leucocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was 171×106/L, the mean value of the CSF protein was 1.1g/L. There were no fatal outcomes. Conclusion: Since other CNS infections have similar clinical picture and CSF finding as TBE, serological analysis for TBE should be included in routine diagnostic practice."

Concepts like the true burden of the illness, from incidence rates to longstanding consequences of infection, and optimal case management, also remain shrouded in controversy. At the heart of this multidisciplinary issue are the causative spirochetal pathogens belonging to the Borrelia Lyme complex. Their unusual physiology and versatile lifestyle have challenged microbiologists, and may also hold the key to unlocking mysteries of the disease. The goal of this review is therefore to integrate established and emerging concepts of Borrelia biology and pathogenesis, and position them in the broader context of biomedical research and clinical practice. We begin by considering the conventions around diagnosing and characterizing Lyme disease that have served as a conceptual framework for the discipline. We then explore virulence from the perspective of both host (genetic and environmental predispositions) and pathogen (serotypes, dissemination, and immune modulation), as well as considering antimicrobial strategies (lab methodology, resistance, persistence, and clinical application), and borrelial adaptations of hypothesized medical significance (phenotypic plasticity or pleomorphy)."

It was after the second spontaneous tear that the patient's recent diagnosis of Lyme disease became the likely culprit. Often, patients with chronic Lyme disease present with an elaborate clinical picture that can mimic many more common diagnoses such as septic arthritis, transient synovitis, ligamentous sprain, and various other traumatic injuries. With the pathognomonic erythema migrans rash reported to be present less than 50% of the time in late-stage infections, the diagnosis of Lyme disease can often be difficult, with a high rate of underdiagnosis. It is important that Lyme disease be included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous tendon pathology, especially for physicians practicing in highly endemic areas. The treatment is relatively simple and successful—especially for an acute infection—and it is important to initiate treatment promptly to prevent disability."

Factors influencing the number of LD cases range from environmental to system-level variables, but little is known about the influence of vegetation (canopy, understory, and ground cover) and human behavioral risk on LD cases and exposure to infected ticks. We determined the influence of various risk factors on the risk of exposure to infected ticks on 22 different walkways using multinomial logistic regression. The model classifies the walkways into high-risk and low-risk categories with 90% accuracy, in which the understory, human risk, and number of rodents are significant indicators. These factors should be managed to control the risk of transmission of LD to humans."

The hot topic is whether or not long-term antibiotics should be used for Lyme disease patients with persistent symptoms. The source of such a long-running debate stems from the difference in opinions over the cause of long-term, persistent symptoms after treatment in some patients. Toward its end, Medicine has finally begun to embrace the existence of Chronic Lyme Disease, but changes still need to be made in the future."

		"abstract": "Background: Chronic Lyme disease (LD) is a matter of debate worldwide and has emerged as a social problem. We aim to analyze the media content and describe the transformation process of a collective pain into a social problem in France. Methods: Using social science methodology, a corpus of articles from 20 newspapers and videos from seven major TV stations from 1987 to 2017 were analyzed for discourse content. The speaking times and the frequency of interventions between doctors supporting the official guidelines and those against them were compared using the Mann–Whitney test and the Chi-square test, respectively. Results: In France, the media discourse is carried through testimonials from patient organizations and a professor of infectiology who acted as a whistleblower (WB). We showed that the emergence of the LD alert in the media corresponds to the process described by social sciences as ‘naming, blaming, claiming’. Since his first article in 2014, the WB has featured in 24% (22/89) of newspaper articles compared with 20% (18/89) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.52). Since his first appearance on a TV newscast in 2014, the WB has appeared in 45% (22/49) of news reports on LD with 24% of the speaking time compared with 22% (11/49) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.018). Conclusions: Media coverage of LD has been unbalanced since 2014 and promotes associations as well as the WB, who seems to be better identified than any of the different doctors defending the official guidelines."

		"abstract": "Gastrointestinal signs and symptoms are common in the early stages of Lyme disease. However, hyperbilirubinemia from Lyme disease is extremely uncommon. There are only two case reports in literature attributing Lyme disease to hyperbilirubinemia. Here we report a case of severe hyperbilirubinemia as the presenting symptom of Lyme disease. Other plausible etiologies have been ruled out after extensive workups, including liver biopsy. His hyperbilirubinemia gradually resolved after being started on doxycycline. With high incidence of Lyme disease, it should be considered for patients who present with hyperbilirubinemia in endemic areas with possible tick exposure."

CLD is an example of a contested condition and shares problems of legitimacy with other medically unexplained conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome. We use a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach to understand the arguments of the authors to establish the legitimacy, or not, of a CLD diagnosis. This enabled us to make sense of the nature of the stalemate between patient groups and advocates of the medical establishment, as performed by authors of academic articles. In this article, we bring together the arguments to explain the polemical debate and to support accounts that avoid the impasse to give us greater insight into the experience of chronic illness."

Borrelia infections can cause an intrathecal inflammatory response with accompanying cerebral and spinal imaging findings. Cases. Two children with acute or subacute initial neurological presentation, subsequent relapsing  course, and MR imaging features suggestive of multiple sclerosis are presented. A history of tick bite or dramatic response to antibiotic treatment supported Lyme disease in the beginning, but requirement of disaese-modifying treatment later in the course supported multiple sclerosis. Results. These cases carrying features supportive of both multiple sclerosis and Lyme disease caused clinical dilemma and were treated for both disorders. Borrelia-specific IgG index testing before any treatment could have prevented the difficulty in differential diagnosis. Conclusions. Clinical, imaging and CSF findings of multiple sclerosis and acute or chronic progressive borrelia encephalomyelitis may overlap and testing for Borrelia-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis should not be omitted in endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Objective: Chronic Lyme disease has been a poorly defined term and often dismissed as a fictitious entity. In this paper, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) provides its evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease. Definition: ILADS defines chronic Lyme disease (CLD) as a multisystem illness with a wide range of symptoms and/or signs that are either continuously or intermittently present for a minimum of six months. The illness is the result of an active and ongoing infection by any of several pathogenic members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bbsl). The infection has variable latency periods and signs and symptoms may wax, wane and migrate. CLD has two subcategories, CLD, untreated (CLD-U) and CLD, previously treated (CLD-PT). The latter requires that CLD manifestations persist or recur following treatment and are present continuously or in a relapsing/remitting pattern for a duration of six months or more. Methods: Systematic review of over 250 peer reviewed papers in the international literature to characterize the clinical spectrum of CLD-U and CLD-PT. Conclusion: This evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease clarifies the term’s meaning and the literature review validates that chronic and ongoing Bbsl infections can result in chronic disease. Use of this CLD definition will promote a better understanding of the infection and facilitate future research of this infection."

However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory/attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% (n=16) performed in the impaired range. Among the 239 patients who displayed sufficient performance validity, 2.9% (n=7) were classified as cognitively impaired. No association between subjective cognitive symptoms and objective impairment was found. Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment."

Three international database (electronic PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus) and two national database (Ulakbim and Turkmedline) searches were performed using the following keywords ([‘Lyme’ or ‘Borrelia burgdorferi’ or ‘Borrelia’ or ‘Borreliosis’] and ‘Turkey [and/country]’). National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNNDS) of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria were used for classification. A PRISMA-based algorithm was used for systematic review. There were a total of 75 LD cases in 36 different reports. Studies related to LD are confined to case reports. We believe that LD is an important healthcare problem in Turkey and to our knowledge this is the first systematic review from this country."

LD can present with a wide range of symptoms depending on time since infection; from localised skin reactions such as erythema migrans, to widespread multi-system involvement. There may be non-specific symptoms of malaise, aching joints and muscles, and cognitive effects. Treatment with antibiotics is effective, especially if started in the early stages of infection. There is rising awareness of LD by the general public through media coverage and high-profile celebrity cases. Greater awareness has benefits, such as increased diagnosis and treatment of LD. However, cases in the media tend to highlight delays in diagnosis and complications of LD, which can lead to high levels of patient anxiety about the risks of LD."

Setting: Study data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a primary care database covering about 8% of the population in the UK in 658 primary care practices. Participants: Cohort of 8.4 million individuals registered with general practitioners with 52.4 million person-years of observation between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012. Primary and secondary outcome measures: LD was identified from recorded medical codes, notes indicating LD, laboratory tests and use of specific antibiotics. Annual incidence rates and the estimated total number of LD cases were calculated separately for each UK region. Results: The number of cases of LD increased rapidly over the years 2001 to 2012, leading to an estimated incidence rate of 12.1 (95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) per 100 000 individuals per year and a UK total of 7738 LD cases in 2012. LD was detected in every UK region with highest incidence rates and largest number of cases in Scotland followed by South West and South England. If the number of cases has continued to rise since the end of the study period, then the number in the UK in 2019 could be over 8000. The incidence of LD is about threefold higher than previously estimated, and people are at risk throughout the UK. These results should lead to increased awareness of the need for preventive measures. Trial registration number: This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for CPRD research (Protocol number 13_210R)."

LD related optic neuritis or cranial nerve (CN) six palsy have been reported in the literature. However, this is the first case report of simultaneous involvement of CN 2 and CN 6 in a patient with LD. The diagnosis of LD can be challenging and initial laboratory tests can be a false negative. It is paramount important to repeat the diagnostic test if clinical suspicious is ongoing. With this case, we aim to increase awareness of clinicians for possible ocular manifestations of LD and its complex diagnostic process."

We systematically reviewed publicly accessible WNV surveillance records published within the federal, provincial (n = 10), territorial (n = 3), and regional health authorities (n = 95) between 2000 and 2016. We describe the strategic approaches and activities to WNV surveillance from 124 websites, four public health databases, and three custom Google search engines. WNV surveillance in Canada can address emerging mosquito-borne diseases. However, surveillance practices are likely to underestimate the true risks. Prioritizing and strengthening WNV surveillance by all levels of the Canadian Government through timely surveillance measures, consistent and representative data for accurate prediction of trends and risks are recommended."

While the regional distributions of these species are well characterized, more localized distribution estimates are sparse. We used records of field collected ticks and an ensemble modeling approach to predict habitat suitability for each of these species in Florida. Environmental variables capturing climatic extremes were common contributors to habitat suitability. Most frequently, annual precipitation (Bio12), mean temperature of the driest quarter (Bio9), minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6), and mean Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were included in the final models for each species. Agreement between the modeling algorithms used in this study was high and indicated the distribution of suitable habitat for all three species was reduced at lower latitudes. These findings are important for raising awareness of the potential for tick-borne pathogens in Florida."

Survey sites were stratified by climatic zones and proportional to recognized land cover categories. A total of 560 transects on 41 sites within the state were sampled repeatedly by flagging between 2015 and 2018. Four tick species were collected; Amblyomma americanum, Amblyomma maculatum, Ixodes scapularis and Dermacentor variabilis. All species were more commonly found in northern and central regions of the state than in southern and western regions. Adult I. scapularis were active from autumn through spring and complementary to adult A. americanum and D. variabilis. Standardized survey methods help reduce sampling biases and better characterize risk from the species surveyed. However, differences in the attractiveness of collection methods for different tick species makes cross-species comparisons a continuing challenge."

Amblyomma ticks have occasionally been introduced into California, but as yet, no established populations have been reported in the state. Because California has high ecological diversity and is a transport hub for potentially parasitized humans and animals, the risk of future Amblyomma establishment may be high. We used ecological niche modeling to predict areas in California suitable for four tick species that pose high risk to humans: Amblyomma americanum, Amblyomma maculatum, Amblyomma cajennense and Amblyomma mixtum. We collected presence data in the Americas for each species from the published literature and online databases. Twenty-three climatic and ecological variables were used in a MaxEnt algorithm to predict the distribution of each species. The minimum temperature of the coldest month was an important predictor for all four species due to high mortality of Amblyomma at low temperatures. Areas in California appear to be ecologically suitable for A. americanum, A. maculatum, and A. cajennense, but not A. mixtum. These findings could inform targeted surveillance prior to an invasion event, to allow mitigation actions to be quickly implemented."

The framework was applied to the Lyme Bay MPA, southwest England, the site of a controversial fisheries closure, which has subsequently been proposed as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well the location for an NGO-led project focusing on stakeholder engagement. This paper examines a broad range of perspectives on the governance of this MPA, via semi-structured interviews with representatives of different interest groups and document analyses. The MPAG framework found a governance structure with a diversity of incentives, providing for bottom-up stakeholder engagement and awareness-raising coupled with strong top-down legislative structures. Although the fisheries closure and subsequent SAC restrictions have provided the main mechanisms for protecting biodiversity, an NGO-led project has provided a complement to the legislative framework and helped to facilitate a mechanism for adaptive co-management. However, the site is predicted to be subject to external pressures from changes in legislation, state resource restrictions and reduced NGO involvement, which will test the resilience of the structure and whether such a diversity of incentives provides sufficient resilience to maintain MPA effectiveness in the face of these pressures.</p>"

This chapter focuses on HBV, HCV, and HIV because these are the most common blood-borne viruses that have particular implications for work. Blood-borne viral infections can affect people of any age. In the UK, HIV infection is specifically mentioned and automatically considered as a disability, from the point of diagnosis, by the Equality Act 2010. HBV and HCV infections may also qualify as disabilities, if associated disease causes impairment. There are therefore practical, legal, and ethical issues to consider when assessing fitness for work in people with blood-borne viral infections.</p>"

		"abstract": "Mycobacterium goodii has only rarely been reported to cause invasive disease in humans. Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central line. The line had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broad-spectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. The long duration of antibiotic use and presence of a central venous catheter predisposed the patient to this infection. Patients should be counseled regarding the serious risks of long courses of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics via central venous catheters to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease."

In light of this, future tick control approaches are poised to rely on integration of rational acaricide application and other methods such as vaccination.

Tick size which became the research object in this evet study was the tick size on January 6, 2014. The sources of data were secondary data from BEI and Yahoo Finance. The samples were 147 stocks before the change in tick size and 147 stocks after the change in tick size, using purposive sampling technique.The data were analyzed by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test and regression analysis with an SPSS software program. The result of the research showed that spread and depth decreased significantly after the change in tick size. Lower spread and depth had contradictory implication on stock liquidity. Based on the dimension of immediacy cost and width, lower spread indicated that stock liquidity increased, while based on the dimension of market depth, lower depth indicated that stock liquidity decreased. In order to settlethis contradiction, the researcher used depth to spread ratio. Intuitively, this ratio measured whether the decrease in depthwas bigger or smaller that the decrease in spread. The result of Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated that depth to spread ratio increased significantly which indicated that the decrease in depth was smaller than in spread so that it was concluded that stock liquidity increased after the change in tick size. The result of F-test showed that stock price, stock return volatility, and stock trading frequency simultaneously had significant influence on spread and depth. The result of t-test also indicated that stock price, stock return volatility, and stock trading frequency partially had significant influence on spread and depth."

The present study was done to assess the activities of NVBDCP in state of Karnatakaand to analyze selective qualitative and quantitative indicators related to the activities.Methods:Quantitatively retrospective data was collected from Directorate office Department of Health and Family Welfare, NVBDCP section from April 2016 to March 2017. Qualitatively questionnaire based protocol was made and interviews were conducted with District programme officer, PHC medical officer and  grass root level health workers like ANM, ASHA with reference to one each of selected least performing districts and good performing districts in the state. The collected data was analysed by using Microsoft Excel 2010 version.Results:The highest prevalent districts in Karnataka areDakshina Kannada for malaria, Udupi for dengue, Tumakurufor chikungunya andBidar for lymphatic filariasis. Major factors related to poor outcome in some districts were rigid attitude of the community, poor support of local panchayats and less human resources.Conclusion:The result of this investigation revealed that Dakshina Kannada has got highest number of cases with greater proposition and high prevalence rate of vector borne diseases due to lack of sufficient human resources and geographical factors. Strengthening the surveillance activities along with integrated vector control programmes will improves the outcome of the programme."

There were still many potential sites for Anopheles sp. breeding place inPangandaran, so that the Regency was categorized as a receptive area. This study aimed to identify thespread of potential breeding sites for Anopheles sp. in Pangandaran Regency. The data were collected usinga spatial method in all of the areas in Pangandaran District. Data collecting was done by mapping thepositive breeding sites of Anopheles sp. which was then overlayed with a map of the tourist destination inPangandaran Regency. The larvae found were identified as An. aconitus, An. annularis, An. barbirostris, An.identifinitus, An. maculatus, An. subpictus, An. sundaicus and An. Vagus. All of the species found werepotentially became malaria vectors. There seven positive breeding sites were found which six of them locatedin tourism areas that were the Districts of Pangandaran, Cimerak, Parigi, Kalipucang, Sidamulih, andCijulang. It was concluded that Pangandaran still has the potential for malaria transmission both for localtransmission and for the potential entry of imported malaria."

The high number of dengue cases in this area raises the question of whether there has been transovarial transmission occured from the Aedes sp. to their eggs. Transovarial transmission could be dangerous because the next generation of mosquitoes can directly become competent vectors as transmitters of the dengue virus (DENV). The purpose of this study is to detect dengue virus transovarial transmission in Aedes sp. in Gombong Subdistrict. This is a descriptive research in Gombong, Semanding, and Kali Tengah villages, Gombong Sub District. A total of 300 houses, 100 houses from each village were selected in this study. There were 600 Oviposition traps (ovitraps) were installed both inside and outside of houses for 6 days. Ovitraps were calculated by its Ovitrap Index (OI). Detection of transovarial transmission was carried by rearing field mosquitoes to Filial 1 then identified by RT-PCR assay. This study showed that OI in the three villages was higher in outdoor compared to indoor positions. All tested samples were negative DENV, indicated that there were no transovarial transmission occured at the study sites. Transmission in these study areas might still through horizontal mechanism transmission by mosquito bites. Although there is no transovarial transmission, awareness of dengue transmission must be continued by eradicating of mosquito nests such as 3M plus activities on a regular basis"

		"abstract": "Author summary: Mycetoma is a severely neglected tropical disease characterised by painless subcutaneous tumour-like swellings frequently noted in the extremities. There is a massive knowledge gap in transmission, infection route, and historically, it is believed to be associated with minor trauma caused by thorn pricks. This study was designed to determine the possible role of arthropods in mycetoma transmission in an endemic area in Sudan during the cold dry season. Pools of medically important arthropods were screened for mycetoma causative agents using DNA based method. The villagers’ habits and knowledge on arthropod vectors were examined using a pre-designed questionnaire. The results showed various presences of many arthropod vectors. Ticks were found in high prevalence, and densities in domestic animals found inside houses and the villagers had high contact level with the ticks in comparison to other vectors. The study reports for the first time, the detection of the causative agents of mycetoma in a pool of ticks. More studies on the possible role of ticks in the transmission of mycetoma diseases are badly needed to delineate the possible role of ticks on transmission of mycetoma."

Kota has also been a favourite place for mosquito breeding & hence a record of malaria & dengue cases reported are more from neighbouring Bundi (Roteda) & Kota city in comparison to other districts of Rajasthan. In Kota city maximum cases of malaria occur during August to October. The mosquitoes are more active in humid atmosphere. The rainy season falls between June to September. Rainfall provides water for mosquito breeding as well as increases humidity of the atmosphere for survival of the mosquitoes. Key words: Mosquito-borne diseases, anopheline, mosquitoes and malaria."

Data on mosquito catching, habitat type, and environment each ecosystem analyzed. Filariasis suspect vector species in Sarmi Regency Papua Province obtained were four genus with nine species. These vector/suspect filariasis vector were Anopheles farauti, An. koliensis, An. pediateniatus, An. punctulatus, An. tesselatus, An. subalbatus, Culex quinquefasciatus, Mansonia dives, and Ma. papuensis. Four specific habitat characteristics were found in the mosquito-data collecting sites: primary forest, secondary forest, shrubs, and grass/brown/grassland habitat. Anopheles farauti is a species found abundantly in all specific habitats. Based on the ecosystem, Cx. quinquefasciatus dominates the urban ecosystems of non-forest settlements and beaches near settlements, while An. farauti is found in forests settlements, remote forest settlements, non-remote forest settlements, distant coastal settlements, and beaches near settlements."

However, integrating GSTR skills into curriculum has been shown to increase spatial thinking skills, which leads to better cognitive thinking and problem solving skills. An Examining Vector-Borne Disease Transmission (EVBDT) curriculum unit was developed using the geospatial curriculum approach to investigate malaria, dengue fever, and zika disease spread in the environment, using patterns, data, and sociodemographic factors. The purpose of this design-based research study was to understand public health content learning and GSTR skill acquisition through use of the geospatial curriculum approach among students ( n = 95) enrolled in undergraduate public health content classes. Data sources included a classroom observation instrument; pretest and posttest measures for the Spatial Habits of the Mind survey; a pretest, Posttest 1, and delayed Posttest 2 EVBDT assessment that included public health content and GSTR skill items; and a postimplementation survey to understand students’ perceptions of geographic information systems use in the curriculum. Findings revealed significant mean differences showing growth in public health content learning and GSTR skills. The findings provide support that Web geographic information systems with appropriate curriculum design can engage students and affect both learning outcomes and GSTR skills in public health education."

Cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are still a threat in Indonesia, especially entering the rainy season, the number of sufferers usually tends to increase, this occurs due to the proliferation of Aedes aegypti mosquito breeding breed. Prevention and eradication of dengue fever must be the responsibility of all communities. Efforts that can be done by the community are to be able to play an active role in monitoring mosquito larvae. This study aims to identify the knowledge and attitudes of the community in the prevention and eradication of dengue mosquito larvae. The head of the family in Jayaraga Garut, 103 kk, the amount of total populations, the study time was October 2018. Aspect Research Results Respondents' knowledge of participation in prevention and eradication of dengue vector still had 8 respondents whose knowledge was lacking. Attitude, there are still 9 responses whose attitude is not good. Participation in doing 3M most of the people of Jayaraga have prevented the breeding of the Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae even though there are still respondents who did nothing. The conclusion is that there are still some respondents whose knowledge, attitudes and actions are not good or not good."

In addition, beside causing ahigh morbidity rate and socioeconomic losses, the disease may also decrease the human productivity. Thecontrol efforts have been done by vector control program, yet still not effective. This is due to a lack ofunderstanding of the biology of mosquito vector. The aim of this research was to determine diversity ofmosquitoes, density, behavior, characteristic habitat and their role of filariasis transmission. The researchwas conducted from Januari to April 2015 in Hamarung and Hukai Villages, Juai Subdistrict, BalanganDistrict, South Kalimantan Province. Collection of mosquitoes was done by bare leg bait indoor collectionmethod and outdoor collection method from 06.00 pm–06.00 am. In additon, larvae were collected in theirpotencial habitats. There were 15 species mosquitoes comprising of 5 genera i.e. genus of Culex, Mansonia,Anopheles, Armigeres, and Aedes. There were 5 dominant species of mosquitoes i.e. Cx. tritaeniorhynchus(36.80%), Cx. quinquefasciatus (29.60%), Ma. dives (11.73%), Ma. annulata (10.04%) dan Ma. uniformis(4.62%). The peak activity of Cx. tritaeniorhynchus and Cx. quinquefasciatus in both villages occurred at21.00–00.45. Based on the habitat of mosquitoes, genus of Culex, Mansonia and Anopheles were found inswamps. Mosquitoes dissection did not show any microfilaria stages (L1, L2, L3)."

This paper reviews previous studies of foodborne illness, particularly foodborne illness happened because bacteria which represent 66% of problems. Vibrosis, Shigellosis, Bacillosis, Listerosis Salmonellosis, Botulism, and staphylococcal food poisoning are the main dietary disease happened because of bacteria. Bacteria in nutrition will increase beneath optimal cases and secrete poison in nutrition. After swallowing, poisons were absorbed by Intestinal epithelial lining that make natural harm to tissues. In certain cases, poisons are transmitted to tissues or devices like the central nervous system, kidney nor liver where they can cause damage. Foods carried diseases are divided into two collections which are food infection and poisoning. Food infection is happened because eating food, including fertile pathogens that secrete toxins in the intestine only, while poisoning is acquired by eating poison formed by pathogens (secrete toxins directly in the food). The most clinical sign of food poisoning are abdominal cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and headache. Diagnosis of foodborne illnesses carried by a patient’s record and the symptoms. Protection of foodborne diseases can be depended on food safety control during the production, processing, and distribution, secession of uncooked from cooked food, cooking carefully, and save food at a safe temperature."

The most common cause of infectionis consumption of food contaminated with pathogenic Listeria species, in particular L. monocytogenes . Listeria bacteria are psychrophiles, live in all media of the environment, and easily move from saprotrophic to parasitic mode of life. All these qualities have provided them with adaptability and high survival capacity. The sources of food contamination with Listeria bacteria usually are contaminated raw materials or equipment of food production facilities. Deep frozen beef blocks were tested for contamination with Listeria bacteria that were detected and identified by bacteriological technique and enzyme immunoassayand immunochromatographic assay. Listeria bacteria were found in 35% of samples but there were no pathogenic species among them. The isolated species were identified as L. innocua, L. welshimeri, L. grayi and L. seeligeri . These species often colonisevarious media of the environment. The examined meat samples were found to be safe. Listeriosis can be prevented by systemic proactive measures including sanitary and epidemiological control of food raw materials and finished products, properly organized technological process, and hygienic education of the population."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) cause significant morbidity and mortality each year in the United States. Over the last 14 yr, over 700,000 cases of diseases carried by ticks, mosquitoes, and fleas have been reported from U.S. states and territories to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of reported cases has been increasing annually with two major trends: a steady increase in tick-borne diseases and increasing intermittent outbreaks of mosquito-borne arboviruses. The factors that are driving VBD introduction and emergence vary among diseases but are not likely to disappear, indicating that current trends will continue and probably worsen in the absence of effective prevention and control tools and implementation capacity. There are a number of challenges to preventing VBDs, including the lack of vaccines and effective vector control tools, insecticide resistance, and eroding technical capacities in public health entomology at federal, state, and local levels. For these reasons, a national strategy is needed to address VBD threats and to reverse the alarming trend in morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases."

		"abstract": "Determining the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on pest dispersal behavior is a critical component of integrated pest management. The behavioral and physiological traits of movement of the Asian Citrus Psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama, has received significant attention. Field and laboratory experiments have explored the physiological capabilities of ACP dispersal, as well as, the abiotic and biotic drivers that initiate movement behavior. Abiotic factors such as temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, landscape, and orchard architecture, as well as, biotic factors including mating status, pathogen infection, and morphotype have been investigated in great detail. The current review focuses on dispersal of ACP with the goal of synthesizing current knowledge to suggest management tactics. Overall, vision serves as the primary modality for host finding in ACP. Current data suggest that ACP populations increase more within uniform landscapes of seedling trees, as compared to mature orchards with randomly interspersed young seedlings. The data also suggest that establishment and conservation of visual and physical barriers might be beneficial to protect orchards from ACP. Management of ACP must take into account large-area cooperation, orchard border surveillance and treatment, removal of non-crop habitat, and an understanding that immigration can occur from distances of several kilometers."

We report a laboratory-acquired case of TBRF caused by Borrelia caucasica, which is endemic in Ukraine and transmitted by Ornithodoros verrucosus ticks. Methods: We isolated spirochetes and characterized them by partially sequencing the 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrs), flagellin (flaB), and deoxyribonucleic acid gyrase (gyrB) genes and conducting a phylogenetic analysis. Results: These analyses revealed a close relationship of Ukrainian spirochetes with the Asian TBRF species, Borrelia persica. The taxonomic and nomenclature problems related to insufficient knowledge on the spirochetes and their vectors in the region are discussed. Conclusions: Although these findings enhance our understanding of species identities for TBRF Borrelia in Eurasia, further work is required to address the neglected status of TBRF in this part of the world. Public health practitioners should consider TBRF and include the disease into differential diagnosis of febrile illnesses with unknown etiology."

A high level of inter-annual variation was found in the density of blacklegged tick nymphs, Ixodes scapularis Say, with a high density of host-seeking nymphs (DON) in summer 2015 and 2017 and a relatively low DON in summer 2016 and 2018. Very few American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say) and Ixodes cookei Packard were collected. Lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum L.) and longhorned ticks (Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann) were not represented among the 6,398 ticks collected. For tick-borne pathogen surveillance, DNA samples from 1,721 I. scapularis nymphs were prepared from specimens collected in summers 2015–2017 and screened using qPCR, high resolution melting analysis, and DNA sequencing when necessary. The overall 3-yr nymphal infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi was 24.8%, Borrelia miyamotoi was 0.3%, Anaplasma phagocytophilum variant-ha was 0.8%, and Babesia microti was 2.8%. Prevalence of coinfection with B. burgdorferi and B. microti as well as B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum variant-ha were significantly higher than would be expected by independent infection. B. burgdorferi nymphal infection prevalence is similar to what other studies have found in the Hudson Valley region of New York, but levels of B. microti and A. phagocytophilum variant-ha nymphal infection prevalence are relatively lower. This study reinforces the urgent need for continued tick and pathogen surveillance in the Lehigh Valley region."

Humans can become infected by tick bite and in some cases also by consumption of nonpasteurized raw milk and raw milk products from ruminants. Serological investigations of milking flocks can help to assess the risk of TBEV infection for humans. 735 blood samples from 50 goat flocks from four federal states of Germany were tested by TBEV-VNT to assess a potential risk for TBEV infection. Results: Only one sample in each of the three states was TBEV-antibody positive (VNT), albeit with low titers. However, in Baden-Württemberg seven samples were positive, among them four goats of the same flock. Conclusion: It can be concluded that in the tested flocks the risk of an alimentary TBEV infection was low. However, in one single flock a considerably higher risk must be assumed."

The animal tissues (liver and spleen) and blood were screened using molecular tools for the detection of Babesia, Coxiella, Cytauxzoon, Hepatozoon, Theileria, and Anaplasmataceae agents. A total of 230 specimens (78 rodents and 152 marsupials) were trapped. Hepatozoon and Piroplasmorida agents were detected in the common opossums (Didelphis marsupialis). In turn, all samples (blood, liver, or spleen) collected from the small mammals were negative for the genus Coxiella and the family Anaplasmataceae, as detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phylogenetic analyses inferred from partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene highlighted the occurrence of new Hepatozoon and Piroplasmorida haplotypes. Future studies determining the role of common opossum (D. marsupialis) in the epidemiological cycles of Hepatozoon and Babesia under natural conditions in the Amazonian biome are necessary."

Consequently, correct identification of these potential pathogens is crucial to estimate the level of exposition, the risk and the detrimental impact on livestock and the human population. Results: Conventional PCR with generic primers was used to identify groups of tick-borne pathogens in cattle breeds from northern Cameroon. The overall prevalence in 1260 blood samples was 89.1%, with 993 (78.8%) positive for Conclusion: Co-infections of tick-borne pathogens with an overall high prevalence were found in all five study sites, and were more likely to occur than single infections. Fulani, Namchi and Kapsiki were the most infected breed in general; however, with regions as significant risk factor. A better-adapted approach for tick-borne pathogen identification in co-infected samples is a requirement for epidemiological investigations and tailored control measures."

However, it is known that preparations obtained from donated blood have certain disadvantages, and therefore development of novel preparations for post exposure prophylaxis and therapy of tick-borne encephalitis is required.

Our aim in this study was to describe cases of vaccine failures and to optimize future vaccination recommendations. Methods: Patients with TBE were identified in the notification database at the Department of Communicable Disease Control and Prevention in Stockholm County during 2006–2015. Vaccine failure was defined as TBE despite adherence to the recommended vaccination schedule with at least 2 doses. Clinical data were extracted from medical records. Results: A total of 1004 TBE cases were identified, 53 (5%) were defined as vaccine failures. In this latter group, the median age was 62 years (6–83). Forty-three (81%) patients were aged &gt;50 years and 2 were children. Approximately half of the patients had comorbidities, with diseases affecting the immune system accounting for 26% of all cases. Vaccine failures following the third or fourth vaccine dose accounted for 36 (68%) of the patients. Severe and moderate TBE disease affected 81% of the cases. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest documented cohort of TBE vaccine failures. Vaccine failure after 5 TBE vaccine doses is rare. Our data provide rationale for adding an extra priming dose to those aged ≥50 years."

Similar to other flaviviruses, TBEV exploits intracellular membranes to build RCs for viral replication. The viral NS proteins have been suggested to be involved in this process; however, the mechanism of RC formation and the roles of individual NS proteins remain unclear. To study how TBEV induces membrane remodeling, we developed an inducible stable cell system expressing the TBEV NS polyprotein in the absence of viral RNA replication. Using this system, we were able to reproduce RC-like vesicles that resembled the RCs formed in flavivirus-infected cells, in terms of morphology and size. This cell system is a robust tool to facilitate studies of flavivirus RC formation and is an ideal model for the screening of antiviral agents at a lower biosafety level."

Among 684 patients enrolled during a seven-year period from 2007 through 2013, 382 (55.8%) had TBE alone, 62 (9.1%) had proven co-infection with borreliae and 240 (35.1%) had possible co-infection. The severity of acute illness was similar in all the groups. The odds for incomplete recovery decreased during a 12-month follow-up but were higher in women, older patients, and in those with more severe acute illness. Incomplete recovery was not associated with either proven (odds ratio (OR) 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49–2.95; p = 0.670) or possible co-infection (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.55–1.65; p = 0.853). Among patients with possible co-infection, older patients were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics, but the odds for incomplete recovery were similar in those who received antibiotics and those who did not (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.36–1.87; p = 0.630), suggesting that routine antibiotic treatment in patients with TBE and possible co-infection may not be warranted."

		"abstract": "Greenhouse cultivation of ornamentals is subjected to a high incidence of soil-borne fungal pathogens. In Kalanchoe, these pathogens are responsible for root and stem rot, and for infection of the vascular tissue. Well-known soil-borne pathogens are believed to cause these diseases. Yet, a systematized survey of these pathogens is lacking for Kalanchoe produced commercially. Here, we studied the occurrence of soil-borne fungal pathogens associated with cultivation of Kalanchoe in Denmark and production of cuttings and stock plants in greenhouse facilities located in Turkey and Vietnam. Molecular identification of pathogens complemented mycological identification and pathogenicity testing of the soil-borne fungal pathogens. This study revealed that the fungi Corynespora cassiicola, Thielaviopsis basicola, Fusarium solani, and F. oxysporum are the most prevalent pathogens associated with root and stem rotting and wilt of Kalanchoe under the conditions studied. Furthermore, the study showed that some of the pathogens are part of an infection complex comprising both primary and opportunistic fungal species. The fact that some of the pathogens were present in some regions, while absent in others, suggests how they move between greenhouse facilities on infected plant material. This study generated important information about the soil-borne fungal complex affecting Kalanchoe, which is useful for a better understanding of the biology of the disease and for designing control strategies."

Test lots containing various seed-borne PVY levels were created by mixing different proportions of seed pieces from healthy and infected tubers drawn from the same seed source. These seed lots were planted in commercial potato fields near the Teton Seed Potato Management Area from 2010 to 2012. Regression analyses on data from these test plots produced models of the in-season spread of PVY originating from infected seed. Conventional ordinary least squares techniques were supplemented with the use of quantile regression; the resulting models indicate the significance of seed-borne PVY on end-of-season infection levels and highlight the need of seed potato buyers to review postharvest testing results."

		"abstract": "Indigenous forests cover 24% of New Zealand and provide valuable ecosystem services. However, a national map of forest types, that is, physiognomic types, which would benefit conservation management, does not currently exist at an appropriate level of detail. While traditional forest classification approaches from remote sensing data are based on spectral information alone, the joint use of space-based optical imagery and structural information from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and canopy metrics from air-borne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) facilitates more detailed and accurate classifications of forest structure. We present a support vector machine (SVM) classification using data from ESA&rsquo;s Sentinel-1 and 2 missions, ALOS PALSAR, and airborne LiDAR to produce a regional map of physiognomic types of indigenous forest in New Zealand. A five-fold cross-validation of ground data showed that the highest classification accuracy of 80.9% is achieved for bands 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, and 12 from Sentinel-2, the ratio of bands VH and VV from Sentinel-1, HH from PALSAR, and mean canopy height and 97th percentile canopy height from LiDAR. The classification based on the optical bands alone was 73.1% accurate and the addition of structural metrics from SAR and LiDAR increased accuracy by 7.8%. The classification accuracy is sufficient for many management applications for indigenous forest in New Zealand, including biodiversity management, carbon inventory, pest control, ungulate management, and disease management. National application of the method will be possible in several years, once national LiDAR coverage is achieved, and a national canopy height model is available."

		"abstract": "<p>Blood- borne viruses (BBVs) are viral infections transmitted by blood or body fluid. In practice, any viral infection that achieves a high viral load in blood or body fluid can be transmitted through exposure to infected biological materials. In western countries, the most significant BBVs are human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV1 and HIV2), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Other viruses that can be transmitted by blood and body fluid include human T cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV1 and HTLV2), cytomegalovirus, West Nile virus and viruses responsible for viral haemorrhagic fever such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. BBVs are transmitted via exposure to blood and body fluid. Some examples of routes of transmission include: ● Sharing needles in people who inject drugs (PWID); ● Medical re-use of contaminated instruments (common in resource poor settings); ● Sharps injuries in healthcare setting, including in laboratories (less commonly through mucosal exposure); ● Transfusion of blood contaminated with BBVs (failure to screen blood donors); ● Transplantation of organs from BBV-infected donors; ● Sexual exposure to BBV-infected body fluid; and ● Exposure to maternal BBV infection: intrauterine, perinatally, or postnatally. If exposure to a BBV is via a needle stick injury in a healthcare setting, immediate first aid needs to be carried out by gently encouraging bleeding and washing the exposed area with soap and water. Prompt reporting of the incident is required so that an assessment can be done as soon as possible to determine if post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is required. The decision may be aided by urgent assessment of source patient infection status. The British Medical Association has issued guidance for testing adults who lack the capacity to consent. In the case of a sexual exposure to a BBV, immediate consultation to a genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic is warranted. The risk of transmission of BBVs associated with exposure depends on the nature of the exposure and the body fluid involved. The following factors are important in needle stick injuries: ● Deep percutaneous injury. ● Freshly used sharps. ● Visible blood on sharps.</p>"

Materials and Methods:: This retrospective study included 36 adolescents who had bilateral maxillary crossbite and received bone-borne maxillary expansion (average age: 14.7 years) or tooth-borne maxillary expansion (average age: 14.4 years). Subjects had two cone beam computed tomography images acquired, one before expansion (T1) and a second after a 3-month retention period (T2). Images were oriented, and three-dimensional airway volume and dentoskeletal expansion were measured. Analysis of variance was used to test for differences between the two expansion methods for pretreatment, posttreatment, and prepost changes. Paired t-tests were used to test for significance of prepost changes within each method. Results:: Both groups showed significant increase only in nasal cavity and nasopharynx volume (P &lt; .05), but not oropharynx and maxillary sinus volumes. Intermolar and maxillary width increased significantly in both groups (P &lt; .05); however, the buccal inclination of maxillary molars increased significantly only in the tooth-borne group (P &lt; .05). There was no significant difference between tooth- and bone-borne expansion groups, except for the significantly larger increase in buccal inclination of the maxillary right first molar after tooth-borne expansion. Conclusions:: In adolescents, both tooth- and bone-borne RME resulted in an increase in nasal cavity and nasopharynx volume, as well as expansion in maxillary intermolar and skeletal widths. However, only tooth-borne expanders caused significant buccal tipping of maxillary molars."

		"abstract": "Background: West Nile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne viral pathogen that is the causative agent of West Nile fever and encephalitis. Diagnostic tools for WNV infection in Nigeria are not well established hence the current prevalence rate of WNV infection in Nigeria is unknown. We aimed to establish the serological prevalence of WNV infection in febrile patients in Ilorin, Nigeria in 2016, and to assess the risk factors associated with the acquisition of the virus. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study involving the screening of subjects presenting with febrile illnesses. While specific IgM ELISA was used to determine the seroprevalence, a closed-ended questionnaire was used to as­certain the risk factors associated with this viral infection. Results: Fifteen (7.5%) of the respondents were positive for WNV infection. Subjects living in areas in close prox­imity to trees and bushes (P= 0.011) and stagnant water (P= 0.001) were at a higher risk of having WNV infection. Other risk factors associated with WNV among the respondents include the none use of insecticide (P= 0.001), sitting out at night (P= 0.044), HIV positivity (P= 0.003) and having an organ transplant (P= 0.002). Conclusion: This study clearly shows a considerable WNV infection in Ilorin, with the presence of factors that can promulgate an outbreak, hence a need for further surveillance in the study area.  "

Pathogen infection increases the expression of several tick gut proteins which disturb the tick gut microbiota and impact bacterial biofilm formation. Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces ticks to express I. scapularis IAFGP, a protein with antimicrobial activity while Borrelia burgdorferi induces the expression of PIXR. Here, we tested the resistance of I. scapularis microbiome to A. phagocytophilum infection, antimicrobial peptide IAFGP, and anti-tick immunity specific to PIXR. Results : We demonstrate that A. phagocytophilum infection and IAFGP affect the taxonomic composition and taxa co-occurrence networks but had no effect on the functional traits of tick microbiome. In contrast, anti-tick immunity disturbed the taxonomic composition and the functional profile of tick microbiome, by increasing both taxonomic and pathways diversity. Mechanistically, we show that anti-tick immunity increases the representation and importance of polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways involved in biofilm formation while these pathways are under-represented in the microbiome of ticks infected by A. phagocytophilum or exposed to IAFGP. Conclusions : These analyses revealed that tick microbiota is highly sensitive to anti-tick immunity, while it is less sensitive to pathogen infection and antimicrobial peptides. Results suggest that biofilm formation is a defensive response of tick microbiome to anti-tick immunity."

In the Midwest, an additional Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia mayonii, was recorded from naturally infected I. scapularis and P. leucopus. However, an experimental demonstration of reservoir competence was lacking for a natural tick host. We therefore experimentally infected P. leucopus with B. mayonii via I. scapularis nymphal bites and then fed uninfected larvae on the mice to demonstrate spirochete acquisition and passage to resulting nymphs. Of 23 mice fed on by B. mayonii-infected nymphs, 21 (91%) developed active infections. The infection prevalence for nymphs fed as larvae on these infected mice 4 wk post-infection ranged from 56 to 98%, and the overall infection prevalence for 842 nymphs across all 21 P. leucopus was 75% (95% confidence interval, 72–77%). To assess duration of infectivity, 10 of the P. leucopus were reinfested with uninfected larval ticks 12 wk after the mice were infected. The overall infection prevalence for 480 nymphs across all 10 P. leucopus at the 12-wk time point was 26% (95% confidence interval, 23–31%), when compared with 76% (95% confidence interval, 71–79%) for 474 nymphs from the same subset of 10 mice at the 4-wk time point. We conclude that P. leucopus is susceptible to infection with B. mayonii via bite by I. scapularis nymphs and an efficient reservoir for this Lyme disease spirochete."

		"abstract": "Issue: Virtually non-existent in Eastern Townships (ET) before 2010, Lyme disease incidence rate reached 52 confirmed cases per 100 000 in some districts in 2018, leading to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendation by public health. To improve access to PEP, community pharmacists can now screen and initiate PEP under a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) with the regional Medical Officer of Health. Knowledge, attitudes and practices of pharmacists regarding Lyme disease PEP were surveyed after implementation of this measure. Description of the problem: 312 community pharmacists practicing in ET were invited, in October 2018, to complete an online survey, based on Godin’s integrative model (2012), with questions on professional characteristics, knowledge of CPA, attitudes about PEP, and facilitators and barriers to the use of CPA. Pharmacist’s practices were evaluated using 8 clinical vignettes. Vignette-specific and a global score were calculated. Bivariate analyses were done to test the association between global score and knowledge, attitudes, facilitators and barriers. Results: Response rate was 13.8%. Most pharmacists knew (97.4%) and were in favor (93.1%) of the CPA, and believed it was effective to prevent Lyme disease (96.4%). The main barriers reported to using the CPA were related to the assessment of PEP criteria. With regards to practice, pharmacists answered correctly for clients presenting all criteria for PEP (80.6%), aged &lt; 8 y.o. (51.6%), who had their tick removed for &gt;72 hrs (67.7%), already presenting with symptoms (32.3%) or who had exposure in a non-endemic area (38.7%). Finally, none of the variables studied were associated with the global score. Lessons: This measure has now been expanded in other endemic regions in Quebec and a provincial CPA is under development. These results will help guide the development of the provincial CPA, specifically to better consider and to provide guidance regarding PEP contraindications. Key messages: Pharmacist-initiated PEP is an innovative approach to increase timely population access to an essential preventive measure in the fight against Lyme disease in endemic districts. Additional guidance is required for pharmacists with regards to assessment of PEP criteria in future CPAs."

Here we present the case of a 24-year-old Second Lieutenant, a recent graduate from the United States Military Academy, with a history of Lyme disease who developed recurrent knee effusions following surgery to correct a hip impingement. Although gonococcal arthritis was initially suspected from preliminary laboratory results, a comprehensive evaluation contradicted this diagnosis. Despite antibiotic therapy, aspiration of the effusions, and steroid treatment to control inflammation, the condition of the patient deteriorated to the point where he was found to be unfit for duty and subsequently discharged from active military service. This case illustrates the profound effect that latent Lyme disease can have on the quality of life and the career of an active duty military member. It highlights the need for increased surveillance for Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) in military training areas and for the early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of military personnel who present with the symptoms of acute Lyme disease."

RESULTS: The results of this protocol on serious pathologies considered incurable in veterinary and overlapping human pathologies, are giving good outcomes. DISCUSSION: The difficult to diagnose Borrelliosis and Bartonellosis in the Lab and variability of the clinical symptoms cause difficulty to both human and veterinary doctors. Even when these pathologies are confirmed by analyses they are treated with a short antibiotic cycle. Because bacteria have systems to overcome antibiotics the pathologies become chronic leading to sub-clinical meningitis that also blocks the correct functioning of the autonomous nervous system that regulates every physiological process. Serious pathologies appear even years after bacterial contamination and mankind’s increasing longevity together with these bacterias’ tropism can cause or has already caused a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Alternating or combining therapies using various antibiotics, together with the antibacterial and catalytic effect of the oxygen/ozone therapy in the antibiotics and stem cells and the immunomodulation and neurotrophic effect of the Blood Stem Cells can indirectly resolve pathologies considered incurable up to now."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most significant vector-borne disease in the United States, and its southward advance over several decades has been quantified. Previous research has examined the potential role of climate change on the disease’s expansion, but no studies have considered the role of future land cover upon its distribution. This research examines Lyme disease risk in the south-eastern U.S. based on projected land cover developed under four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scenarios: A1B, A2, B1, and B2. Land cover types and edge indices significantly associated with Lyme disease in Virginia were incorporated into a spatial Poisson regression model to quantify potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease in the south-eastern U.S. under each scenario. Our results indicate an intensification of potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease under the A scenarios and a decrease of potential land cover suitability under the B scenarios. The decrease under the B scenarios is a critical result, indicating that Lyme disease risk can be decreased by making different land cover choices. Additionally, health officials can focus efforts in projected high incidence areas."

		"abstract": "This study examines potential challenges facing Lyme disease patients in Canada’s Maritime provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island—and considers how issues could be addressed. Reviews of both the academic and grey literature are complemented by surveys targeting both medical professionals and decision makers in government. Combined, the literature reviews and surveys demonstrate that there is considerable debate surrounding the effectiveness of testing, treatment options, and the existence of chronic Lyme disease. As the focus on the Maritimes demonstrates, these debates often pit the medical community against patients and patient advocates and, thus far, governments have been unable to produce policy that entirely pleases either side. Moving forward, this study recommends the creation of a discussion forum via a federal Commission of inquiry to review best practise guidelines for Lyme disease. The key is to foster an unbiased probe of central issues surrounding treatment and diagnosis without alienating stakeholders. This course of action will not necessarily solve the issue of Lyme disease, but would foster a greater understanding through dialogue that includes and validates the experiences of stakeholders, which is something that is currently missing."

		"abstract": "Background: Approximately 300,000 cases of Lyme disease occur annually in the UNITED STATES, with children aged 5–9 years disproportionately affected. A single dose of doxycycline administered within 72 hours of a high-risk tick bite is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent Lyme disease in areas of high incidence. However, it is not known how often or for which patients PEP is used. We aimed to describe recent patterns of single-dose doxycycline medication claims in states with high and low Lyme disease incidence, and the associated patient and prescription characteristics in a large national commercial insurance claims database. Methods: Outpatient medication claims in the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Database®, a large nation-wide database of de-identified insurance claims filed between January 1, 2014–December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Claims of single-dose doxycycline were identified and associated patient demographics and medication characteristics were analyzed. Results: During 2014–2017, 66,210 medication claims for single-dose doxycycline were filed by 63,112 enrollees; mean annual incidence of receiving at least one single-dose doxycycline prescription was 56 per 100,000 enrollees. Mean patient age was 43 years (IQR 33–56 years); only 8% were for children aged <18 years. About half (46%) were male patients. Most claims (71%) were made by patients residing in the 14 states with high Lyme disease incidence, defined as an average annual incidence of ≥ 10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population. The majority (80%) of medication claims were during the 6 months of peak tick activity (April–July for nymphal ticks and October–November for adult ticks). Conclusion: Single-dose doxycycline medication claims are common in states with high Lyme disease incidence and are highest during months of peak tick activity, consistent with the assumption that most single-dose doxycycline is used for Lyme disease PEP. Use of single-dose doxycycline to prevent Lyme disease is infrequent in children, despite being a group at high risk for Lyme disease. Efforts to educate pediatric healthcare providers and parents should be made to increase Lyme disease PEP access for children. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

		"abstract": "Background: Diagnosing Lyme disease often involves laboratory evaluation, yet available tests have limitations. Serology remains negative for weeks after infection occurs, and may then remain positive for years. Borrelia burgdorferi blood PCR testing has low sensitivity, rendering it unhelpful. We sought to determine whether an emerging technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA), can detect B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with erythema migrans (EM). Methods: Patients aged 1–17 years with a clinically-identified single or multiple EM were enrolled. Two clinical investigators were required to agree on the EM finding, with no evidence of an alternative diagnosis. Subjects were excluded if they previously had Lyme disease, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to enrollment, or if the rash had resolved before the first blood draw. Three blood samples were taken during the study period: one before antibiotics were administered, then 1–3 weeks and 2–3 months later. At enrollment, plasma was tested for Lyme disease using C6 antibody with reflex to Western Blot and mcfDNA sequencing (Karius, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Briefly, mcfDNA was extracted from plasma and NGS performed. Human reads were removed and remaining sequences were aligned to a curated microbial database. Only mcfDNA testing was performed at follow-up visits. Results: We enrolled 5 subjects (ages 4–15 years old, median age 4). Four subjects had a single EM and negative Lyme serology. One subject had approximately 20 EMs and positive serology (C6-antibody=7.52 (Positive >1.09), 3/3 IgM, 2/10 IgG). All 14 plasma samples, including five pre- and nine post-antibiotic samples, were negative for B. burgdorferi DNA by mcfDNA sequencing. No other infections, including other tick-borne infections, were detected. Conclusion: NGS of mcfDNA did not identify B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with active EM rashes. This approach is unlikely to be helpful in diagnosing early localized Lyme disease. This may be because spirochetes are localized to the periphery of the rash in EM and spirochetemia likely occurs at later stages of infection. Follow-up studies are planned to investigate how NGS of mcfDNA performs during early and late disseminated Lyme disease. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of patients referred to an academic center with a presumed diagnosis or concern for Lyme disease between 2000 and 2013 was performed to analyze diagnoses and treatments. Characteristics of those with Lyme disease and those misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease were compared. Results: Of 1261 patients, 911 (72.2%) did not have Lyme disease, 184 (14.6%) had active or recent Lyme disease, 150 (11.9%) had a remote history of Lyme disease, and 16 (1.3%) were identified as having possible Lyme disease. Patients without current Lyme disease were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–2.45), to have had symptoms for &gt;3 months (OR, 8.78; 95% CI, 5.87–13.1), to have higher symptom counts (OR per additional symptom, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13), to have had more Lyme-related laboratory testing (OR per additional laboratory test, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.32), and to have been diagnosed with what were regarded as coinfections (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14–8.57). Of the 911 patients without Lyme disease, 764 (83.9%) had received antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease or their coinfections. The percentage of patients established to have Lyme disease was lower than in earlier studies of referred populations. Conclusions: Among patients referred to an academic Infectious Diseases practice for Lyme disease, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment were common, both for Lyme disease and for coinfections."

		"abstract": "Background: Persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis often include self-reported cognitive impairment. However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory / attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% ( Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment.

In seventy-six (N = 76) adult patients with LD (mean age 57.6 ± 14.6 years) and 54 healthy non-Lyme volunteers with a mean age of 56.4 ± 13.5 years, possible function (i.e., non-pain) diagnoses were established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria of Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Pain diagnoses were established by means of the function-dependent dynamic and static tests. The two groups did not significantly differ in the frequency of disc displacements diagnoses and function-dependent pain diagnoses. LD showed a significantly higher frequency (p < 0.001) of osteoarthrosis than the control group. For the prediction of pain diagnoses in LD patients, the single regression analyses pointed out an association with age, sleep bruxism (SB), and awake bruxism (AB). Two predictors (i.e., SB (p = 0.002) and AB (p = 0.017)) were statistically significant in the final multiple variable model. The frequency of TMD in patients with LD based on function-dependent tests was not significantly different from that in the control group. This investigation suggests that the contribution of bruxism to the differentiation between patients with Lyme and TMD is high."

This exploratory study relies on the theory of planned behavior and certain constructs from the health belief model to identify the factors leading municipal authorities to implement preventive interventions for Lyme disease (PILD). Data were obtained from an online survey sent, during the summer of 2018, to municipal officers in 820 municipalities in Quebec, in all health regions where the population is at risk of contracting Lyme disease (response rate = 36%). The questionnaire was used to measure the implementation of PILD, the intention to implement these interventions, attitudes, perceived social pressure, perceived control (levers and barriers) over interventions, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures, risk, and perceived vulnerability. Results of structural equation analyses showed that attitudes were significantly associated with municipal authorities’ intention to implement PILD, while the intention to implement PILD was a significant predictor of the implementation of PILD. Additional analyses showed that perceived barriers added a moderating effect in the intention-implementation relationship. The prediction of behaviors or practices that municipal authorities could implement to prevent Lyme disease will enable the evaluation over time of the evolution of Quebec municipalities’ adaptation to Lyme disease. Moreover, the examination of the associations of specific psychosocial factors revealed important implications for the design of effective behavior-change interventions, which would allow health officials doing awareness work to create personalized interventions better suited to municipal officers and their specific contexts."

Despite typical symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash, sometimes we cannot find those due to the lack of physician consultation in those early stages. If this disease is left untreated, infection could spread to the nervous system causing neuroborreliosis, an atypical and complicated manifestation of this disease. We present the case of an atypical papillitis, probably caused by this bacterium. We suspected this because of the results on the indirect test bloods and the improvement of the symptoms after treatment. This entity should be considered as a possible diagnosis of atypical optical neuropathies, particularly if it occurs in an endemic area."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease, but its clinical consequences remain uncertain. We conducted a systematic review of the long-term sequelae and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with LD in North America and Europe. We performed searches in 6 electronic databases up to December 2018 following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including observational studies reporting long-term sequelae, HRQoL, and prognostic factors. We included 46 studies, published between 1994 and 2019. Based on 21 studies reporting attributable outcomes, higher proportions of sequelae reported from exposed patients were: neck pain, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, sleep disorder, poor appetite, and concentration difficulties. Patients with PTLDS reported impaired HRQoL compared to the general US population. Included studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study design, settings, patient characteristics, and quality. Patients with LD are more likely to report nonspecific long-term sequelae, especially those experiencing persistent symptoms posttreatment. Opportunities exist for prospective longitudinal studies to better understand LD outcomes."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Early confirmatory diagnosis remains a challenge, while the disease can be debilitating if left untreated. Further, the decision to test is complicated by under-reporting, low positive predictive values of testing in non-endemic areas and travel, which together exacerbate the difficulty in identification of newly endemic areas or areas of emerging concern. Spatio-temporal analyses at the national scale are critical to establishing a baseline human LD risk assessment tool that would allow for the detection of changes in these areas. A well-established surrogate for human LD incidence is canine LD seroprevalence, making it a strong candidate covariate for use in such analyses. In this paper, Bayesian statistical methods were used to fit a spatio-temporal spline regression model to estimate the relationship between human LD incidence and canine seroprevalence, treating the latter as an explanatory covariate. A strong non-linear monotonically increasing association was found. That is, this analysis suggests that mean incidence in humans increases with canine seroprevalence until the seroprevalence in dogs reaches approximately 30%. This finding reinforces the use of canines as sentinels for human LD risk, especially with respect to identifying geographic areas of concern for potential human exposure."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background: In Finland, the routine surveillance of Lyme borreliosis (LB) is laboratory-based. In addition, we have well established national health care registers where countrywide data from patient visits in public health care units are collected. In our previous study based on these registers, we reported an increasing incidence of both microbiologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed LB cases in Finland during the past years. Here, we evaluated our register data, refined LB incidence estimates provided in our previous study, and evaluated treatment practices considering LB in the primary health care. Methods: Three national health care registers were used. The Register for Primary Health Care Visits (Avohilmo) and the National Hospital Discharge Register (Hilmo) collect physician-recorded data from the outpatient and inpatient health care visits, respectively, whereas the National Infectious Diseases Register (NIDR) represents positive findings in LB diagnostics notified electronically by microbiological laboratories. We used a personal identification number in register-linkage to identify LB cases on an individual level in the study year 2014. In addition, antibiotic purchase data was retrieved from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution in order to evaluate the LB treatment practices in the primary health care in Finland.Results: Avohilmo was found to be useful in monitoring clinically diagnosed LB (i.e. EM infections), whereas Hilmo did not add much value next to existing laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB. However, Hilmo gave valuable information about uncertainties related to physician-based surveillance of disseminated LB and the total annual number of EM infections in our country. Antibiotic purchases associated with the LB-related outpatient visits in the primary health care indicated a good compliance with the recommended treatment guidelines. Conclusions: In 2018, Avohilmo was introduced in the routine surveillance of LB in Finland next to laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB."

		"abstract": "Lyme Disease continues to be a complex phenomenon, medically, culturally, epistemologically. Based on a theoretical framework steeped in feminist science studies and post-human onto-epistemologies, I suggest that conventional biomedicine has failed not only practically as far as helping patients suffering from Lyme and other \"emergent diseases,\" but also conceptually as it applies the determinist monocausal infectious disease model to Lyme. Several recent essays on autoimmunity have developed tools based on both science studies and deconstruction that pinpoint the conceptual  shortcoming of dominant immunology, which presumes a stable and antagonistic ontology of immune self and pathogenic other. The authors suggest to replace this ontology with an ecology of entangled becomings. My argument is developed by weaving together the human-centered Lyme conundrum with that of horses because Lyme seems better understood by veterinarians than human physicians. While I critically examine an important official study on equine borreliosis, conducted by Cornell University's Veterinary College, which is characterized by the typical reductionist and mechanistic approach, I nevertheless concede that it has yielded a better testing system than what is available in the human context. But ultimately, I end up making the case for an energy-medicine approach to healing rather than a biomedical \"cure\" through the case study of my horse Caspio, who suffers from the chronic stage of the illness, and whom I have rehabilitated over the course of nearly a decade. His etiology simultaneously blends into my own, as I move from self- to cross-species case history in this hybrid piece. Leaning on the notion of entangled ecologies developed in recent literature, which proposes to think of immune-system related illnesses as dynamic relations of becoming together, I conclude with the notion of balance —mental, immunological, and biomechanical— which I have striven to achieve with Caspio through acupuncture and the art of classical training: learning to live well with the embodiment of (at times debilitating) symptoms, rather than engaging in pharmacological warfare."
