However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later “febrile patients”) based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases.","https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/6/1/38/pdf",""

The disease was first identified as a problem in sheep and goats in Kenya in 1910. The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus and family Bunyaviridae. An equally pathogenic variant of NSDV is Ganjam virus, which is found in India and Sri Lanka. Both viruses are closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a fever transmitted through infected tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Other members of the genus include Dugbe virus, Hazara virus, and Kupe virus, isolated from cattle ticks in East Africa. The virus is spread by hard (Ixodid) ticks and appears to be dependent on the tick vector for dissemination, with no direct transmission between animals. The transmission of tick-borne viruses (TBV) occurs primarily during tick feeding and is a complex process, known to be promoted by tick saliva constituents.","https://www.igi-global.com/viewtitle.aspx?TitleId=271922",""
