During May and September 1999, field surveys on Lyme disease spirochetes were conducted in three locations of a region of north-west Poland, known as recreational districts visited by many people. The ticks Ixodes ricinus were collected in natural habitats by dragging a flanel cloth over the vegetation. Sex and developmental stage of each tick were determined. Based on a polymerase chain reaction test with primers that recognize a chromosomal gene of all strains, out of the total 1414 specimens collected, 126 (8.9%) were found to be infected. The species B. burgdorferi s. l. comprises at least three pathogenic genomospecies, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s. s.), Borrelia garinii, and Borerelia afzelii, witch could be distinguished in nested-PCR tests with species-specific primers. B. burgdorferi s. s. was most prevalent (96% of infected ticks), followed by B. garinii (1.3%), and B. afzelii. was not found. Of the infected ticks, over the 99% were infected with a single species, one specimens was infected with two species. For 4 ticks, the infecting species could not be identied. The difference in rates of prevalence was observed among the tree locations (17%--5.3%--3.2%)."

		"abstract": "The author describes the histories of three patients with panic-like episodes that turned out to be related to underlying, previously unsuspected tick-borne diseases. Each woman experienced symptoms that are not usual in panic disorder but are typical of neurological Lyme disease, including exquisite sensitivity to light, touch, and sounds, joint pain often in combination with cognitive changes including mental fogginess and loss of recent memory, and some degree of bizarre, shifting, and often excruciating neurological pain. Because these symptoms are atypical of primary panic disorder, they were very helpful in alerting the clinician to suspect an underlying physical illness. In each case, the results of testing revealed positive hallmarks of disseminated Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including Lyme borreliosis caused by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis. Since beginning treatment with intensive doses of appropriate antimicrobial medications for their tick-borne infections, all three patients have become free of panic attacks. Treatment of their infections by a specialist in Lyme disease allowed one of the women to discontinue anti-anxiety medication completely and another to reduce the dose of medication to occasional use only. The third patient is no longer anxious but her depression is resolving more slowly despite the ongoing use of an antidepressant. Two of the patients have also needed ongoing medication for pain and other symptoms of late-stage, neurological Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Drag sampling is a commonly used method to obtain relative estimates of the density of questing nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say and I pacificus Cooley & Kohls ticks, which are primary vectors of Lyme disease spirochetes to humans in North America. However, the efficiency of drag sampling in determining absolute population densities of questing nymphs has not been evaluated previously. Therefore, we assessed the efficiency of a single drag-sampling occasion to estimate the total population size of questing I pacificus nymphs in a leaf-litter habitat in California. Repeated daily removal sampling was carried out in four areas, each covering 300 m2, on 17 occasions over a 23-d period in the spring of 1999. In total, 573 I. pacificus nymphs were collected, of which 55 (9.6%) were collected on the initial sampling occasion and 20 (3.5%) on the last occasion. The total population size of questing nymphs, i.e., the intersection with the horizontal axis of a linear regression of daily nymphal catch rates on the number of nymphs caught previously, was estimated to be 936. Thus, the efficiency of the initial sampling occasion to estimate the total population size was 5.9% (4.8, 5.0, 5.8, and 9.1%, respectively, for the four individual sampling areas). Further, the overall mean efficiencies of the two, five, and 10 first removal sampling occasions to estimate the absolute nymphal density was 5.2, 4.7, and 4.3%, respectively, and 13 sampling occasions were required to collect 50% of the estimated total nymphal population."

Ticks were removed from Peromyscus leucopus mice and collected via tick drags at approximately 3-wk intervals. Mouse population estimates along the trail varied from 2, in the spring of 1996 following a year of drought, to > 200 in 1993, the wettest year on record. During the 8-yr period, there were major droughts during the summers of 1991 and 1995. Cumulative degree-days were positively correlated with the number of ticks collected on drags in the same year and negatively correlated with larval tick populations for the following year (P < 0.05). Cumulative rainfall was positively correlated with larval tick abundance for the following year. This was most readily apparent by examination of the larval density on captured mice. In the year following each of two drought years, larval densities were significantly depressed compared with the 8-yr average at the site."

We focused on the collection of the nymphal stage, which is the principal stage of disease transmission to humans. This study was carried out in Rambouillet forest (Yvelines, France) where seven study areas were demarcated. These areas are maximally homogeneous for plant species using a finer scale than the phytosociological classification as defined by the method of landscape diagnostics. Out of 23 collections performed from March 1997 to May 1998, 2,906 I. ricinus nymphs were collected. The sampling technique chosen was the cloth lure technique. The technical parameters were studied and fixed (cloth type, cloth size, sample size, researcher position). It appeared that toweling was the best cloth type to optimize the number of ticks collected; the position of the researcher had no effect on tick samples. To satisfy the criteria for correct sampling, we studied representativity, randomness, and nonselectivity of our methodology. The spatial distribution of nymphs in a homogeneous area was close to random and thus very few subsamples were needed to obtain a relative density which was representative. No significant differences were found between random samples and following transect samples; and nonselectivity was totally satisfied because we only worked on questing nymphs. We grouped the samples that presented no significant differences to attribute a density index, which varied from 0 to 5. This methodology, applied with the same parameters, offers potential for producing comparable results from studies in different geographical areas and at different times of the years."

Medicated corn was supplied in troughs within the island village and from automatic feeders at remote sites during 5 consecutive fall and spring adult tick questing seasons. Acaricide consumption was monitored by assaying its presence in fresh deer pellets and its concentration in deer sera. Its effectiveness was evaluated by recording the number of adult ticks collected from the hides of deer, the number of females becoming sufficiently engorged to oviposit, and the success of subsequent oviposition and eclosion. Entomologic risk was monitored by collecting immature ticks from hosts and adult ticks from vegetation. Estimates based on a subsequent deer reduction program indicated that up to twice as many deer had been present during the project as originally presumed. For this and other reasons related to deer behavior, target levels of serum ivermectin were achieved in a minority of deer. Nevertheless, > 90% control of female tick infestation, subsequent oviposition, and larval eclosion was obtained in those 8 of 16 sampled deer with serum ivermectin levels of > or = 15 ng/ml. In addition, the ratio of females to males, the numbers of females engorging > 10 mg body weight, and the numbers of those eventually hatching, were all significantly less among ticks from island deer in comparison with ticks from untreated deer. No consistent changes in the numbers of ticks found on immature-stage hosts or removed from vegetation were noted within 3 yr of the cessation of treatment."

In Europe neuroborreliosis is the most frequent manifestation of late Lyme borreliosis. In this study we investigated characteristics of intrathecal antibody synthesis in patients with neuroborreliosis. Our goal was also to reveal to what extend anti - B.burgdorferi antibody detection in serum correlates to anti - B.burgdorferi antibody detection in CSF. We examined 266 patients with clinically suspected neuroborreliosis, and found serologic evidence of B.burgdorferi infection in 94 (35 percent). By calculation of IgG and IgM specific antibody indices, we detected intrathecal antibody production in 49 (18 percent) of patients. IgM antibody response dominated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples and IgG antibody response was prevalent in the serum samples. Manifestations of neuroborreliosis included cranial nerve affection (n=12), radiculitis (n=10), meningoradiculitis (n=11), encephalopathy (n=7), radiculomyelitis (n=6), and encephalitis (n=3). No patients with either MS-like syndrome (n=15) or motor neurone disease (n=8) had intrathecal B.burgdorferi-specific antibody production despite positive serum reaction for the specific antibodies. Most of the patients with documented intrathecal antibody synthesis (42/49-86 percent) improved significantly after etiologic treatment. In the rest of patients, mainly those with long-terming neurological disorders, the improvement was partial and temporal. We concluded, that detection of antibodies against B.burgdorferi in serum should always be completed with detection of intrathecal antibody synthesis in CSF in order to confirm clinical diagnosis of neuroborreliosis."

Using an immunoenzymatic technique which was confirmed with Western Blot, 29 patients were diagnosed positive. Twenty-five of these patients contracted the disease in Abruzzo, two during a trip to the USA, one was from Molise and one from Marche. Overall the patients were young, 64&#x0025; were women and residents of costal areas who frequently engaged in naturalistic activities. The most common symptoms were articular and one patient presented Bannwarth Syndrome. The various antibiotic therapies used gave good results in most cases. These are the first cases reported in literature for this region and for Molise. We believe that LD is underestimated, especially due to the favorable climatic and environmental conditions present in this region. Therefore, we suggest an intensification of clinical and epidemiological controls."

All isolates tested were susceptible to amoxicillin, erythromycin, and minocycline. The MICs of these drugs for the Chinese isolates were 0.025-0.1 microg/ml, <0.012-0.05 microg/ml, and <0.012-0.05 microg/ml, respectively. The MBCs were 0.1-0.39 microg/ml, <0.012-0.2 microg/ml, and 0.025-0.39 microg/ml, respectively. The in-vivo antimicrobial susceptibilities of the Chinese Borrelia isolates to two test drugs, amoxicillin and minocycline, were evaluated using ddY mice. Mice were infected by subcutaneous inoculation into the right hind footpad. When infection was confirmed, the mice were treated by subcutaneous injection of the test drugs into the back. Amoxicillin and minocycline, which possessed high in-vitro activities against Lyme disease Borrelia, provided good protection against borreliosis in this animal model. Higher doses of these drugs resulted in elimination of the Lyme disease spirochete from all animals receiving this course of treatment. The 50% curative doses (CD50) of amoxicillin and minocycline were 8.7 mg/kg and 3.1 mg/kg, respectively. This suggested that amoxicillin and minocycline could be useful for the treatment of Chinese Borrelia infection."

Patients were divided into the following groups: Group I n = 9--without detected specific antibodies against B. burgdorferi and with clinical recognition of EM(erythema migrans). Group II n = 10--with increased IgM production, with a clinical form of Lyme arthritis and neuroborreliosis. Group III n = 11--with increased IgG anti B. burgdorferi production, with clinical recognition of Lyme arthritis. The results were compared with the results obtained in the control group consisting of 90 healthy people. The measurements were performed in the flow cytometer COULTER EPI XL with Becton Dickinson antibodies. The antibodies against B. burgdorferi were detected by means of ELISA method using Dako, Biomedica and Biocom kits. The statistic analysis was performed with AnStat Program. The changes in lymphocyte subsets were characterised by the decrease in the percentage of CD4, CD8, NK and CD3+HLA-DR+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood before treatment with later tendency to increase. The results show that the lag phase of antibodies production coincides with high activity of lymphocytes (group I). The significant level of antibodies in IgM class induced by the collaboration of T and B cells was found in the group II. In the group III, in which antibodies in IgG class predominated, the changes in lymphocyte subsets were less intensive. The results of our investigations indicate that the immune response in Lyme disease develops mainly with the participation of both cellular and humoral response which is involved in both the defense against and the pathogenesis of the disease."

To conduct serosurveys, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay by cloning, expressing, and purifying a portion of the DTV envelope glycoprotein (DTV rE) for use as test antigen. Sera from mice and voles trapped in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin were screened by ELISA for IgG reactive to DTV rE. Samples that were positive or borderline by ELISA were subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting. Samples reactive in both assays were considered to be positive. Three percent of 264 mouse samples collected from sites in Rhode Island, 3.8% of 52 samples from mice trapped in Wisconsin, and 3.9% of 282 samples collected from mice trapped on Nantucket Island, MA were positive. No samples from either Great Island, MA, or voles from any study site were reactive. A reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction yielded molecular evidence of DTV infecting questing adult deer ticks in sites where seroreactive mice were trapped, but not from ticks collected where serologic evidence of virus perpetuation was absent. White-footed mice appear to be exposed to DTV in certain sites where other deer tick-borne agents perpetuate. This virus may be maintained in the same enzootic cycle."

		"abstract": "The human risk of contracting Lyme disease or other tick borne diseases transmitted by the tick species Ixodes ricinus is broadly linked to the tick nymph density. The study was performed in Rambouillet forest (Yvelines, France), a known focus of Lyme borreliosis, from January 1997 to December 1999. We used a nymph sampling methodology which permitted us to obtain a monthly nymph density index (from 0 to 5). Studying the seasonal nymph and larval activity patterns and estimating the larval developmental duration, we demonstrate the existence of an annual nymphal stock. Secondly, we elucidate how this stock is distributed throughout the year, month by month. Its distribution is principally dependent on two factors: the monthly mean ambient temperature and the proportion of active nymphs which find a host each month. Expected monthly nymph densities derived from a theoretical model describing the temperature-dependent stock distribution gave a good fit to the observed densities, accounting for between 76-86% of the monthly variation in observed nymph densities. Predicting the temporal distribution of nymph activity within a stable Lyme borreliosis focus enables more precise identification of risk periods."

Equally if not more alarming is the appearance of new infectious diseases that have become major sources of morbidity and mortality. Among recent examples are HIV/AIDS, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, Lyme disease, hemolytic uremic syndrome (caused by a strain of Escherichia coli), Rift Valley fever, Dengue hemorrhagic fever, malaria, cryptosporidiosis, and schistosomiasis. The reasons for this situation are easily identified in some cases as associated with treatment modalities (permissive use of antibiotics), the industrial use of antibiotics, demographic changes, societal behavior patterns, changes in ecology, global warming, the inability to deliver minimal health care and the neglect of well-established public health priorities. In addition is the emergence of diseases of another type. We have begun to characterize the potential microbial etiology of what has historically been referred to as chronic diseases."

In Poland, Lyme borreliosis is being identified, mainly, based on the clinical symptoms, epidemiological anamnesis, and serological tests. On the other hand, it is evident from the foreign publications, that in many cases representing different phases of Lyme disease, a reliable and totally accurate identification tool of Borrelia burgdorferi is amplification of bacterial DNA using PCR method. The main goal of the present studies has been implementation of the DNA amplification method into diagnostic procedures of Lyme. Although we dealt with DNA of B. burgdorferi isolated from tics, it would not make a difference because the method of DNA isolation is the same for human samples. The results acquired from the preliminary studies, suggest that amplification of a fragment of fla gene, may be useful in Lyme disease diagnostics. Spirochetes of B. burgdorferi sensu lato were detected in tics Ixodes ricinus using PCR method in both individual animals and tick pools. The latter version of the method seems to be very useful in so called screening studies, because of minimizing the cost and duration of the procedure."

A total of 50 animals (200 biopsies) were shot in the Lyme disease foci of Rambouillet during the hunting season 1995-1996 and 1996-1997, from the beginning of November to the end of February. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. DNA was detected by PCR in 18 biopsies from 14 animals (28%). Borrelia burgdorferi s.str. was predominant (50%), followed by B. garinii (30%) and B. afzelii (10%). Multiple infections were detected in four animals: same species at different levels or two different species from the same biopsy or from different biopsies from the same foot. A total of 125 biopsies were cultivated on BSKH medium. Cultures at 160 days revealed immobile spiralled forms in 10 cultures. One, from a deer killed at the end of December, was confirmed by PCR as B. burgdorferi s.str. These results, frequency of detection of spirochetes by PCR in the skin, multiple infections and alive spirochetes in biopsies taken out side the season of activity of ticks strongly suggest an affinity of Lyme disease spirochetes for skin of cervids."

In Slovakia (Carpathian Euroregion) the most frequent genotypes are B. garini, B. afzelii, as well as B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae. Infestation of the vector Ixodes ricinus is 3-30%. The most frequent early skin manifestation is erythema migrans (60-70%). Borrelia burgdorferi is suggested to be the causative agent in sclerodermia circumscripta, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, maybe also in urticaria chronica, granuloma anulare, erythema anulare, erythema nodosum. It can be the causative agent also in neurological diagnoses as e.g. chronic oligosymptomatic encephalopathy, \"sclerosis multiplex-like\" syndrome and fatigue syndrome, arthralgia, myalgia, seronegative indifferentiated oligoarthritis and fibromyalgies. The serological diagnosis has to be coincide with clinical findings. Used serological examinations are ELISA, Immunoblot, indirect immunofluorescence examination. PCR is an important contribution in examination of synovial fluid (85% detection) and cerebrospinal liquor (24-100%). The importance of PCR is stressed in cases with mixed infections by several borrrelia genotypes. The first line treatment includes doxyciclin, amoxicilin, and erythromycin. The second line includes macrolides, cephalosporines. New perspectives are ascribed to active immunisation with recombined antigen OsA (LYMErix, ImuLyme)."

Early studies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto identified outer surface protein A (OspA), a lipoprotein on the surface of spirochetes that could be the target of protective antibodies to this agent. Pasteur Mérieux Connaught has developed a Lyme vaccine, ImuLyme, using recombinant OspA protein (rOspA). Methods were developed to routinely assess the identity, quantity, structure, purity, biological activity, heterogeneity, stability, and potency of rOspA. In addition, several methods were performed on a series of lots to support the routine testing methods and further our understanding of the physicochemical characteristics of rOspA. These tests were electrospray mass spectrometry, circular dichroism, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, amino acid analysis, peptide mapping with peptide sequencing, and the application of proteomic methodology to identify trace contaminant host cell proteins. The results of these methods indicate that the rOspA lots are composed of highly purified and properly processed and folded rOspA with trace amounts of E. coli host cell proteins."

Officially reported cases have been used and analysed in this article. Although, aware of the limits of such a source, the results gained with this analysis point to certain epidemiological characteristics of Lyme borreliosis in Croatia, which can be useful. Clinical manifestations might vary, depending on the part of the world, i.e. type of Borrelia involved. In Croatia, skin manifestations are predominant--erythema (chronicum) migrans. The disease generally does not occur in Southern Croatia; it has been only sporadically reported in the area south of Zadar. Although the tick, the vector of this disease, can be found everywhere in Croatia, data about vector species and their presence in the coastal area are not complete or they are missing. Therefore, additional entomological, epidemiological, and clinical research are necessary to clarify the absence of Lyme borreliosis in Southern Croatia."

There were 27 males and 15 females, aged from 9 to 84 years, and 13 had relapses. No patient had vasculitis, monoclonal gammopathy, tumor, diabetes mellitus, Lyme disease, familial neuropathy, HIV, or any other immune deficiency. In the endoneurium, perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates were present in only one case, but scattered histiocytes marked by KP1 on paraffin-embedded fragments were present in every case and there were no T-lymphocytes. At ultrastructural examination macrophage-associated demyelination was observed in 17 cases, of which 6 had relapses separated by intervals of several months or years. Axonal lesions without associated primary demyelination were observed in 4 cases and 3 of these had relapses. Thirty-two patients had mixed lesions of demyelination and axonal involvement. This study confirms other recent data indicating that in all cases of CIDP, macrophages are present in the endoneurium. Macrophage-associated demyelination is the characteristic feature of demyelinating forms. On the other hand, isolated primary axonal forms, which have been known since 1989, are relatively frequent and prone to relapses."

In general, antibody levels peaked within the first 3 months of symptom onset, whereafter a gradual decline was observed within 1 year. Twenty-two patients with chronic cutaneous borreliosis were followed for 23+/-11 months and all patients stayed IgG positive. Nearly three-quarters showed a clear decline in IgG levels over the years, while the rest did not. After 9+/-1 years 88% of 16 patients examined were still IgG positive. In conclusion, treatment of erythema migrans should be initiated on clinical appearance as a substantial number of patients stayed seronegative. Treatment success may in part be monitored serologically for both seropositive erythema migrans and chronic cutaneous borreliosis as most patients show declining titres after successful treatment. However, continuously high titres do not necessarily indicate treatment failure."

		"abstract": "Various species of cervid deer are the preferred hosts for adult, black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus) in the United States. Although frequently exposed to the agent of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), these animals, for the most part, are incompetent as transmission reservoirs. We examined the borreliacidal activity of normal and B. burgdorferi-immune sera from sika deer (Cervus nippon) maintained in a laboratory setting and compared it to that of similar sera from reservoir-competent mice and rabbits. All normal deer sera (NDS) tested killed > 90% of B. burgdorferi cells. In contrast, normal mouse and rabbit sera killed < or = 22% of the Borrelia. Anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies could not be detected in any normal sera by indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA). Sera collected from deer 6 wk after exposure to B. burgdorferi by tick feeding exhibited IFA titers of 1:256, whereas sera from mice and rabbits similarly exposed had titers of > 1:1,024. Heat treatment (56 C, 30 min) of NDS reduced borreliacidal activity, with < 20% of the B. burgdorferi cells killed, suggesting complement-mediated killing. The chelators EGTA and EDTA were used to block the classical or both the classical and alternative complement pathways, respectively. Addition of 10 mM EGTA to NDS had a negligible effect on borreliacidal activity, with > 90% of the cells killed. Addition of 10 mM EDTA reduced the killing to approximately 30%, whereas the addition of Mg2+ (10 mM) restored borreliacidal activity to NDS. The addition of zymosan A, an activator of the alternative pathway, increased the survival of B. burgdorferi cells to approximately 80% in NDS. These data suggest that the alternative complement activation pathway plays a major role in the borreliacidal activity of NDS. Additionally, 10 mM EGTA had almost no effect on the killing activity of B. burgdorferi-exposed deer sera, suggesting that the classical pathway is not involved in Borrelia killing, even in sera from B. burgdorferi-exposed deer."

Complement-mediated killing was observed when cultured spirochetes were inoculated into sera from the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis) and from the southern alligator lizard (Elgaria multicarinata), but not when they were inoculated into serum from either the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) or from humans. Spirochetes were still alive after 4 hr in lizard serum that had been preheated at 56 C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Furthermore, when lizard serum was chelated with 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to block all complement activation, borreliacidal activity was arrested. When lizard serum was chelated with 10 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid plus 4 mM MgCl2 to block only classical complement pathway activation, >85% of spirochetes were immobilized within 1 hr. Differences in B. burgdorferi s.s. mortality were not observed when chelators with or without MgCl2 were added to serum from either deer mice or humans. Proteins comprising the alternative complement pathway are responsible for the borreliacidal activity observed in the blood of S. occidentalis and E. multicarinata."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, the most common vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, is caused by bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi complex. The disease is multisystemic, affecting mainly the skin, nervous system, heart and joints. In Europe, the vector of the disease is the tick Ixodes ricinus, whereas in the United States of America, two primary tick vectors exist, namely: I. scapularis in the north-eastern and mid-western regions and I. pacificus on the west coast. Several species of small and medium-sized mammals and ground-feeding birds serve as reservoirs for the bacteria in endemic areas. The prognosis for patients with Lyme borreliosis is excellent, particularly when diagnosed and treated early in the course of infection. Prevention of Lyme borreliosis can be achieved using two approaches, either prevention of infection by immunisation, or prevention of tick bites through avoidance, personal protection and tick control."

		"abstract": "From January 1995 to June 1996, ticks were studied in a fragment of Atlantic Forest in a residential area in the city of Itapevi, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Cases of human Lyme disease-like illness were registered in this area during the spring of 1992. The monthly relative density of ticks was determined and the influence of seasonal climatic conditions was evaluated as well as the relationship between ticks and hosts. Ticks (n = 88) were collected from small mammals captured (n = 134) in monthly trappings where the traps were operated for five consecutive days. Immature ticks (n = 42, 47.7%) were identified as Ixodes spp. The adult ticks (n = 46, 52.3%) were identified as Ixodes didelphidis Fonseca and Aragão (n = 19, 21.6%), I. loricatus Neumann (n = 26, 29.5%) and Amblyomma cajennense (F.) (n = 1, 1.1%). The monthly correlations between tick numbers and meteorological data were not significant. The correlation between the different stages of ticks and the two seasons (cold-dry and warm-rainy) indicated that both immature and adult ticks showed a seasonal pattern of abundance. The highest numbers of immature ticks were observed on rodents, during the cold-dry season (from April to September) with a peak in August 1995. Adults ticks were predominant during the warm-rainy season (from October to March) with a peak in January 1995. Adult ticks were only collected on marsupials."

		"abstract": "Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a major lipoprotein of the Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Vaccination with OspA generates an immune response that can prevent bacterial transmission to a mammalian host during the attachment of an infected tick. However, the protective capacity of immune sera cannot be predicted by measuring total anti-OspA antibody. The murine monoclonal antibody LA-2 defines an important protective B-cell epitope of OspA against which protective sera have strong levels of reactivity. We have now mapped the LA-2 epitope of OspA using both NMR chemical-shift perturbation measurements in solution and X-ray crystal structure determination. LA-2 recognizes the three surface-exposed loops of the C-terminal domain of OspA that are on the tip of the elongated molecule most distant from the lipid-modified N terminus. The structure suggests that the natural variation at OspA sequence position 208 in the first loop is a major limiting factor for antibody cross-reactivity between different Lyme disease-causing Borrelia strains. The unusual Fab-dominated lattice of the crystal also permits a rare view of antigen flexibility within an antigen:antibody complex. These results provide a rationale for improvements in OspA-based vaccines and suggest possible designs for more direct tests of antibody protective levels in vaccinated individuals."

Group III was composed of 90 healthy people. Measurements were carried out in an COULTER EPIC XL cytoflowmeter, using Becton Dickinson antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed using AnStat software. In the examined groups, a decrease of the subpopulations of CD4, CD8 lymphocytes in comparison with healthy subjects was revealed, as well as a decrease of the CD4/CD8 ratio after treatment. A considerably lower percentage value of active lymphocytes CD3 + HLA-DR+ in both groups and the reduction of the NK subpopulation before and after treatment of early disseminated Lyme disease in comparison with healthy people was observed. The higher percentage values of the lymphocytes with IL-2 receptor were not statistically significant. The indicated essential changes in the subpopulations of T lymphocytes, characterized by a decrease before the antibiotic therapy and by the tendency towards an increase after that therapy of the percentage of CD4, CD8, NK and CD3 + HLA-DR+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood, point out their role in the immunopathogenesis of the Lyme disease. The absence of the complete normalization of the examined parameters after the treatment, on the one hand, may provide evidence for some inertia of the elements of the immune system, on the other hand can also result from too short antibiotic therapy and maintenance of the antigenic stimulation."

A total of 170 patients (141 adults and 29 children) with the following forms of Lyme borreliosis were included between 1989 and 1997: erythema migrans alone (n = 38), early neuroborreliosis (n = 76), arthritis (n = 34), acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (n = 12), carditis (n = 2), lymphocytoma (n = 3), chronic neuroborreliosis (n = 2), and miscellaneous disorders (n = 3). On the basis of the occurrence and course of the full spectrum of complicated forms of Lyme borreliosis, the specificity of the clinical and biological presentation of the complicated forms (age, ratio of children/adults, sex ratio, incubation period, time to diagnosis, and serological profiles) was demonstrated, as was the absence of overlap between the clinical presentations. Using these data, an alternative scheme for the natural history of Lyme borreliosis is suggested."

The most common manifestation is acute, self-limiting Lyme carditis, which manifests mostly as transient conduction disorders of the heart, pericarditis and myocarditis. Laboratory tests (ELISA, immunoblotting and PCR) usually have limited sensitivity and specificity, and criteria of performance and interpretation have not yet been fully evaluated. Therefore the laboratory evidence should only be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical and diagnostic features. Recently there has been convincing evidence published that long standing dilated cardiomyopathy in many cases is associated with a chronic Borrelia burgdorferi (BB) infection. Several studies showed a higher prevalence of BB antibodies in patients with severe heart failure in endemic areas (e.g., 26% versus 8% in healthy individuals). The isolation of spirochetes from the myocardium gave further evidence that BB may cause chronic heart muscle disease. In several studies antimicrobial treatment showed an improvement of the left ventricular function in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy associated with BB. However the duration of dilated cardiomyopathy before treatment plays an important part in the clinical outcome of BB-associated chronic myocarditis."

The incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) has increased dramatically over the past few decades and the epidemic calls for epidemiological studies. The study of Munksgaard and colleagues, in this issue of Dermatology, is a good example of an epidemiological study based on the so-called ecological correlation. It focuses on cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) and fails to document a correlation between CBCL incidence and Lyme disease as a surrogate indicator for the exposure to tick bites. Although ecological studies neither inform about the time relationship between exposure and disease nor usually allow control for confounding variables, they can provide important information that would guide the direction of further research. There is a number of analytical studies focusing on risk factors for NHLs. One drawback of these studies is that they consider NHLs as a single category. One merit of the paper of Munksgaard et al. is that it focused on a rather specific disease, i.e. CBCL."

Serologies tested were herpes simplex and zoster (IgM and IgG titres), Lyme disease (ELISA), syphilis (FTA-abs and MHA-TP) and HIV. Screening for infection was negative in 172 patients. 2 patients had positive serology for Lyme disease and one for syphilis. The case of serological syphilis was finally diagnosed as latent syphilis after ruling out neurosyphilis. Both cases of suspected Lyme disease were later invalidated by Western blot and lumbar puncture (2 false positives). Screening for infection was positive only in 1/175 patients (0.6%), rendering diagnosis of latent syphilis possible. These results suggest that, on grounds of cost-effectiveness, testing for infection should be limited to and focused on patients with a positive clinical evaluation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is known for its numerous neurological manifestations. Cerebral ischemic lesions are more rarely reported. We describe the case of a 27 - year old man - presenting with a left-sided hemiparesis when waking up. We first thought of a stroke, due to the presence of a light right capsulo-thalamic hypodensity on C.T. scan and the spontaneous regression of the hemiparesis within a few days. However, the lumbar puncture performed on the patient due to a fever running 38 degrees C and some drowziness showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with a very inflammatory face of the spinal fluid. The M. R.I. revealed a right capsular and thalamic image with edema of the front part of the thalamus showing either a vascular or an inflammatory origin. The Lyme serodiagnosis in the blood and in the spinal fluid was positive, and we demonstrated an intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi specific antibody synthesis. This case is interesting because it shows a central form of neuroborreliosis through cerebral infarct and its regressive evolution under treatment. The possible pathophysiology mechanisms have been discussed."

		"abstract": "The mechanism controlling the development of experimental Lyme arthritis remains poorly understood. Mice with the H-2k haplotype have generally been thought to be more susceptible to Lyme arthritis development than those with the H-2d haplotype. In the present study the role of genes within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in determining resistance or susceptibility to the development of experimental Lyme arthritis was investigated. We found that C3H congenic mice were equally susceptible, and DBA congenic mice equally resistant, to arthritis development regardless of their H-2 haplotype (H-2k or H-2d). These results indicate that genes outside the murine MHC are the major determinants of both resistance and susceptibility to the development of experimental Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Previous studies with different Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) strains revealed that temperature as well as cocultivation with tick cells modulates the expression of outer surface proteins (Osp) A and C. We investigated the effects of temperature and of interaction with tick cells in culture on the expression of OspA and OspC of the B. afzelii clones cPKo97 and cPKo345 in comparison to the B. burgdorferi s.s. strain N40. To follow the dynamics of Osp expression of single borreliae we used indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with double staining of OspA and OspC. Clone PKo345 always showed expression of only OspA, regardless the conditions it was subjected to. Sequencing of the ospC gene disclosed a insertion leading to a stop codon after base 222 and inability to produce OspC. In cPKo97 and N40 OspC is down-regulated at lower temperatures and up-regulated at higher temperatures, which was especially pronounced on cocultivation with tick cells. Borreliae adherent to tick cells showed greater OspA expression compared to the nonadherent ones, an indication that OspA might play a role as adhesin for tick cells. Interestingly, cPKo97 and N40 displayed different patterns of Osp expression: cPKo97 simultaneously presents OspA and OspC on single borreliae, while N40 has either OspA or OspC on single cells. Adaptation of OspC expression in cPKo97 seems to occur by up- or down-regulation of this protein on single borreliae, as shown by alternating intensities of OspC expression at different temperatures. In contrast, N40 seem to consist of two subsets of borreliae one expressing only OspA and the other only OspC, and change in temperature results in growth benefit for one of these subtypes. Our findings indicate that, regarding OspA and OspC expression, response to temperature and cocultivation with tick cells of B. afzelii is comparable to B. burgdorferi s.s., but the mode of regulation seems phenotypically different. Further European isolates should be investigated for OspA and OspC regulation, especially in the face of vaccine development for the European situation."

However, patients with facial palsy, who frequently had more widespread nervous system involvement, more often had residual facial or peripheral nerve deficits. Moreover, patients with facial palsy who did not receive antibiotics for acute neuroborreliosis more often now had joint pain and sleep difficulty and lower scores on the body pain index and standardized physical component sections of the Short-Form 36 Health Assessment Questionnaire than did antibiotic-treated patients with facial palsy. Thus, the overall current health status of each patient group was good, but sequelae were apparent primarily among patients with facial palsy who did not receive antibiotics for acute neuroborreliosis."

Additionally, we identified species likely to participate in an enzootic cycle for B. burgdorferi in this yellow pine transition habitat. Evidence of infection with B. burgdorferi was identified in 7.3 and 5.4% of host-seeking I. pacificus adults and nymphs, respectively. Mean numbers of I. pacificus observed on rodents were 1.15 for Neotoma fuscipes Baird and 0.18 for Peromyscus spp. One of 104 ear punch tissues obtained from woodrats and none from 49 Peromyscus spp. yielded B. burgdorferi. A total of 291 collected birds representing 34 species had a mean of 0.27 I. pacificus per bird. The mean I. pacificus infestation of ground-dwelling birds was 2.5 ticks per bird. Forty-nine of 92 (53%) blood smears collected from birds were reactive to a B. burgdorferi specific antibody. This study presents the identification of a B. burgdorferi-like spirochete in birds in western North America. The tick burden and spirochete infection of birds suggests that birds may be involved in a local B. burgdorferi enzootic cycle and likely participate in the transport of ticks and spirochetes to other locations while rodents from this site do not appear to be major contributors."

We report herein two cases of B. burgdorferi-associated PCBCL which strengthen this association by demonstrating the organism in cutaneous B-cell infiltrates present at sites in which PCBCL subsequently developed. All studies were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. These were examined by routine light microscopy and immunohistochemically by a standard streptavidin-biotin-complex technique. Genotypic studies were also undertaken using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement, and nested PCR for B. burgdorferi flagellin gene. Both patients presented with erythematous skin lesions, biopsy of which showed dense perivascular infiltrates comprising small T-lymphocytes and collections of B-blasts. Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) developed subsequently in both cases at the same site. PCR for B. burgdorferi flagellin gene was positive in the perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates and the succeeding lymphomas in both patients. These results show that, at least in some instances, PCBCL arises from chronically stimulated lymphoid tissue acquired in the skin in response to B. burgdorferi infection. This may have significant therapeutic implications and warrant further studies on the extent of this association."

The present studies were conducted to determine whether coinfection with the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HE) agent would promote a Th2 cytokine response in mice. Transmission to the spleen of the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE) and B. burgdorferi occurred 4 and 7 days, respectively, after tick infestation. Coinfection synergized to suppress splenic IL-2 production 7-14 days after tick infestion. Transmission of B. burgdorferi or aoHGE alone significantly decreased splenic IFN gamma 4-7 days after tick infestation, while coinfection suppressed IFN gamma production 7-14 days after tick infestation. Splenic IL-4 production was significantly increased 4 days after coinfection, and by day 10, aoHGE plus B. burgdorferi induced greater splenic IL-4 (57.2 pg/ml, 348% of control values) than either organism transmitted alone (aoHGE, 22.7 pg/ml, B. burgdorferi, 25.1 pg/ml). Coinfection enhanced expansion of splenic T cells, CD4+ lymphocytes and B cells while decreasing CD8+ T cells. These data demonstrate that aoHGE and B. burgdorferi, when cotransmitted, suppress a systemic IL-2 and IFN gamma response, while strongly promoting systemic IL-4 production in the susceptible host. The antigen(s) responsible for this polarization are unknown and will be the subject of future studies."

An etiologic role of B burgdorferi in various granulomatous diseases has been suggested. The present study was performed to examine a possible causative role of B burgdorferi for GC/MRS by B burgdorferi-specific polymerase chain reaction analysis of biopsy specimens from affected lip tissue and determination of B burgdorferi IgG and IgM serum antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot tests. We examined a retrospective case series of 12 patients with GC/MRS from a Lyme borreliosis endemic area (median duration of disease, 8 months [range, 3-348 months]). Borrelia burgdorferi-specific DNA could not be amplified by polymerase chain reaction in any of the 12 patients. One (13%) of 8 patients tested had a serum B burgdorferi IgG response on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 2 patients (25%) had an IgM response, but immunoblot testing yielded negative results in all 8 patients. The results of the present study do not indicate that B burgdorferi has an etiologic role in GC/MRS."

The three pathogenic subspecies Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto differ in their disease profiles and susceptibility to complement lysis. We investigated whether complement resistance of Borreliae could be due to acquisition of the main soluble inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway, factor H and the factor H-like protein 1. When exposed to nonimmune EDTA-plasma, the serum-resistant B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains bound factor H/factor H-like protein 1 to their surfaces. Assays with radiolabeled proteins showed that factor H bound strongly to the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain. To identify factor H ligands on the borrelial surface, we analyzed a panel of outer surface proteins of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with the surface plasmon resonance technique. The outer surface lipoprotein OspE was identified as a specific ligand for factor H. Using recombinant constructs of factor H, the binding site for OspE was localized to the C-terminal short consensus repeat domains 15-20. Specific binding of factor H to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto OspE may help the pathogen to evade complement attack and phagocytosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme boreliosis is currently the most common tick-borne infection. It may cause various clinical symptoms depending on organ localization and duration of the infection. The disease may be symptomless, subclinical or with full clinical manifestation. Usually three clinical stages may be distinguished. In stage I erythema migrans and flu-like symptoms usually develop. In stage II, connected with the infection spreading with blood and lymph, beside joint pains, neuroboreliosis appears, sometimes the disease involves other organs such as heart, eyes, testicles, joints. Stage III, chronic in its character, usually develops in patients who had previously reported joint and neurological complaints. Encephalopathy and fibromyalgia accompany joint involvement. Diagnostics of Lyme borreliosis is based on clinical evaluation and laboratory test including culture of the bacteria obtained from biopsies and serological tests. There are no established standards of the treatment--some examples of the therapy are presented in the paper. The disease if not treated has a progressive course in most causes, however in some patients it can resolve spontaneously even with no treatment."

		"abstract": "In recent years in Poland, the interest has increased in studies about tick borne diseases, mainly Lyme borreliosis. Immune response and genotype of pathogen play an important role in the course of this disease. Phagocytic cells, especially PMN are dominant in defence mechanisms against bacterial infections. The main feature of PMN is their ability to destroy pathogenic microorganisms by phagocytosis. The aim of this study was to estimate the phagocytic activity of PMN connected with intracellular respiratory burst in patients with Lyme borreliosis. The PMN activity tests completed were: phagocytosis, spontaneous and reduced of nitrotetralizate blue test (NBT). Decreased phagocytic activity and oxygen metabolism of PMN from patients with borreliosis in comparison with values of controls were found. Normalization of these parameters after treatment was observed. Changed phagocytic activity connected with intracellular oxygen metabolism during the course of therapy was the main observation. Depression of phagocytic activity of PMN connected with oxygen metabolism can influence defence reactions in patients with Lyme borreliosis. It is suggested that changes observed are acquired and associated with Borrelia burgdorferi presence."

One hundred and forty-three healthy children and young adults (6-24 years of age, male to female ratio, 1:1) were assessed for the presence of antibodies to the agents of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (BB), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in Slovenia, where tick-related infections are endemic. Antibodies to HGE and HME agents were assayed by indirect immunofluorescence, and antibodies to BB and TBE by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A questionnaire about tick exposure was answered by all subjects. In the event of a positive result, a detailed interview was conducted. Of 143 study subjects, 22 (15.4%) had detectable antibodies to HGE agent, 22 (15.4%) were positive to BB, 18 (12.6%) were positive to TBE virus (12 of these were vaccinated) and 4 (2.8%) were positive to the HME agent. The history of persons seropositive to an HGE agent had been uneventful. Our study documents a high seroprevalence of HGE in children and young adults in Slovenia, similar to the seroprevalence of LB and higher than that of TBE and HME. Although the majority of these infections are probably asymptomatic or mild, active surveillance for acute HGE infections in children in areas endemic for tick-related infections is necessary."

When the cause is unknown, a decision must be made whether to employ empiric therapy while the diagnostic evaluation is ongoing. This decision is based on three factors: 1) the clinical status of the patient; 2) the most likely cause based on demographic, historical, examination, and initial laboratory data; and 3) the risk-to-benefit ratio of the proposed treatment regimen. Initial efforts focus on deciding whether the meningitis is infectious or noninfectious. When a decision is made to start empiric therapy, antituberculous treatment is generally given for several weeks to judge therapeutic response. Patients who do not respond to antituberculous therapy are next treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics for unusual bacterial pathogens such as Actinomyces (penicillin), the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (ceftriaxone), Brucella (doxycycline plus rifampin), or Francisella tularensis (streptomycin plus gentamicin). Antifungal therapy is generally reserved for patients who are at particular risk for mycotic infection (owing to underlying immunosuppression or an extraneural infection site). Finally, empiric glucocorticoids are generally reserved for patients with consistently negative culture results and a probable noninfectious cause."

Whereas the majority of patients who develop Lyme arthritis may be successfully treated with antibiotic therapy, about 10% go on to develop arthritis which persists for months to years, despite antibiotic therapy. Development of what we have termed treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis has previously been associated with both the presence of particular major histocompatibility complex class II alleles and immunoreactivity to the spriochetal outer surface protein A (OspA). Recently, we showed that patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis, but not patients with other forms of arthritis, generate synovial fluid T cell responses to an immunodominant epitope of OspA and a highly homologous region of the human-lymphocyte-function-associated antigen-1alphaL chain. Identification of a bacterial antigen capable of propagating an autoimmune response against a self-antigen provides a model of molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis."

We found earlier that Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochaete that causes Lyme disease, induces Th1 development in alpha beta TCR-transgenic Th cells. Here, we used TCR-transgenic Th cells and oligonucleotide arrays to analyze the differences between Th1 cells induced by IL-12 vs those induced by B. burgdorferi. Transgenic Th cells primed with peptide in the presence of B. burgdorferi expressed several mRNAs, including the mRNA encoding IL-17, at significantly higher levels than Th cells primed with peptide and IL-12. Cytometric single-cell analysis of Th cell cytokine production revealed that IL-17 cannot be categorized as either Th1 or Th2 cytokine. Instead, almost all IL-17-producing Th cells simultaneously produced TNF-alpha and most IL-17(+) Th cells also produced GM-CSF. This pattern was also observed in humans. Th cells from synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis coexpressed IL-17 and TNF-alpha upon polyclonal stimulation. The induction of IL-17 production in Th cells is not restricted to B. burgdorferi. Priming of TCR-transgenic Th cells in the presence of mycobacterial lysates also induced IL-17/TNF-alpha coproduction. The physiological stimulus for IL-17 production was hitherto unknown. We show here for the first time that microbial stimuli induce the expression of IL-17 together with TNF-alpha in both murine and human T cells. Chronic IL-17 expression induced by microbes could be an important mediator of infection-induced immunopathology."

To infect rabbits or jirds, at least 3 nymphal or adult Ixodes ricinus ticks infected with spirochaetes fed to repletion on each animal. Whereas jirds readily acquired tick-borne Lyme disease spirochaetes and subsequently infected vector ticks, rabbits exposed to tick-borne spirochaetes rarely became infectious to ticks. Only the rabbit that was infectious to ticks developed an antibody response. To the extent that I. ricinus ticks feed on European rabbits, these mammals may be zooprophylactic by diverting vector ticks from more suitable reservoir competent hosts."

The interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels were comparable in the two strains, whereas the IL-4 levels were below detection limits. B. burgdorferi-stimulated LN cells from C57BL/6J mice produced significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL-10 antibody than cells cultured with B. burgdorferi alone. No effect of IL-10 neutralization on IFN-gamma production by LN cells from C3H/HeJ mice was observed. Neutralizing antibody to IFN-gamma had no effect on the production of IL-10 by LN cells from C57BL/6J mice. A slight decrease in IL-10 production was detected in culture supernatants of equivalent cells from C3H/HeJ mice. The differential effect of IL-10 on IFN-gamma production in C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice suggests that IL-10 is probably involved in the regulation of IFN-gamma production by LN cells during infection and may be at the root of the differential susceptibility to Lyme arthritis in these two strains of mice."

		"abstract": "We determined previously that lipoproteins of Borrelia burgdorferi stimulate inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-10 [IL-10]) in monocytes. IL-10 could have an effect on innate and acquired immune responses to B. burgdorferi and influence the magnitude of the infectious inoculum and disease outcome. To understand the mechanism(s) of IL-10 action during early infection, when innate immunity expressed chiefly by skin macrophages is key, we investigated the effect of exogenous and endogenous IL-10 on the production of the macrophage-derived cytokines IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). We used the THP-1 human monocytic cell line and recombinant lipidated OspA (L-OspA) as the model target cell and stimulant, respectively. To determine the kinetics of cytokine production by THP-1 cells, we stimulated them with L-OspA and also with heat-killed B. burgdorferi cells (HBb) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Exogenous IL-10 dampened production of inflammatory cytokines, as elicited by lipoproteins. The inhibition of endogenous IL-10 function by anti-IL-10 antibody reduced the production of IL-12 and IL-6 but not that of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. An inspection of the kinetics of cytokine production clarified this finding. TNF-alpha was produced prior to, and IL-beta was produced at the same time as, IL-10, whereas IL-6 and IL-12 were produced later. HBb, LPS, and L-OspA yielded similar kinetics of cytokine production. This result reinforces the notion that lipoproteins are the functional molecules in HBb and perhaps in vivo. It indicates also that signaling pathways utilized by LPS and lipoproteins may be extensively shared. The results are consistent with a major role played by IL-10 in controlling the initial phase of infection with this spirochete."

Difficulties in recognition are connected usually with long period from tick bite to late neurological signs. Any headache and psychiatric disorder in the course of Lyme disease could be an early manifestation of invasion of the CNS by the spirochaetes. Each part of neurologic system could be involved. The most common clinical picture of neuroborreliosis is meningitis with cranial or peripheral neuropathies connected with radiculalgia, less common are encephalitis and myelitis, neuropathies and polyneuropathies, encephalopathies. Encephalomyelitis is the most serious form of neuroborreliosis. From the pathophysiologic point of view all cranial and peripheral neuropathies are forms of mononeuritis multiplex. Vasculitis and autoimmunology processes are present. Encephalopathy is due to neuroimmunomodulators, like lymphokines and by toxico-metabolic effect could be connected with each form of systemic borreliosis. Spheroplast L-form of borrelia could be responsible for difficulties with their eradication. Diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is based on culturing of B. burgdorferi from CSF, detection of specific antispirochaetal antibodies produced in subarachnoid space, detection of activated lymphocytes, other antigens detection in CSF (also after dissociation of complexes) or borrelial DNA sequences."

Tick infestation levels were high with more than 1000 members of the public reporting for tick removal at a local clinic. Most of the attached ticks were nymphs (82%) and distinct differences in anatomical sites of attachment were observed in children and adults. Children sustained nymphal bites to the head, neck and axilla region much more frequently than adults (48 vs. 10%), whereas adults were bitten on the lower legs more frequently than children (46 vs. 9%). The vegetation was heavily infested with ticks and high numbers were particularly associated with areas used by deer. The average density of nymphs collected from the vegetation was 14.1 per 10 m2 (range 5.1-43.6). Infection rates of these nymphs determined by PCR and indirect IFA ranged from 5.2-17.0%, and the genospecies Borrelia valaisiana and B. garinii were detected, suggesting that birds may be important reservoir hosts in this area. It is estimated that, at the level of tick challenge observed here, at least 50 persons per year may be bitten by infected ticks at this site. However, no cases of Lyme borreliosis have been reported through the clinic follow-up procedure, and sera from 19 forest workers were negative for antibody to B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Despite the high challenge from tick bites, this particular recreational forest site poses a low risk of infection to the general public, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment or serological testing following a bite is not justified."

Both the I-domain and the lectin-like domain of CR3 are involved in the binding recognition and activation because mAb anti I-domain and N-acetyl-glucosamine inhibit cell adhesion to fibronectin. These data indicate that B. burgdorferi whole cells, but not Osps, activate CR3 integrin; since this receptor plays a key role in priming neutrophils to important inflammatory events, the interaction of B. burgdorferi with neutrophils via the CR3 may enhance their role both in defence and in disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme Disease in the US is concentrated in three endemic areas: the Northeast, the upper mid-West, and the Pacific coast. In the mid-West, the range of Lyme disease has expanded to include large parts of Wisconsin and Minnesota. Despite its proximity to the mid-Western focus, Illinois, so far, has not been considered an endemic area. However, more recent data suggest that this situation may be changing. Also, the extent of borrelial diversity in the mid-West remains largely unexplored. Here, we present preliminary results on the molecular characterization of Borrelia isolates from rodents captured in Cook and Lake Counties, both of which are parts of the greater metropolitan Chicago area in Illinois. We investigated the rodent reservoir present in forested areas of suburban Chicago in order to determine the frequency of infection with the Lyme disease agent(s) by culture isolation of Borrelia spirochetes (Picken et al., unpublished). Rodent isolates of Borrelia were identified to the species level by genetic characterization. In total, 19 isolates were obtained over 3 years from NW Cook Co. and Lake Co. Pulsed-field gel electrophoretic analysis of Mlul digested DNA from these isolates showed macrorestriction patterns similar to that of the Californian isolate, strain DN127 (PF type I), New York isolate strain 25015 (PF type II), or a variant of the latter (PF type III). Sequence data generated from the rrf(5S)-rrl(23S) intergenic spacer region of the ribosomal RNA gene cluster confirmed the identity of all the Chicago isolates studied to date as B. bissettii. These strains are unlike our previous Borrelia isolates from NW Illinois and Wisconsin. In addition, there was a predominant association of B. bissettii infection with pratal rodent species such as Microtus pennsylvanicus and Zapus hudsonius. The relationship of this novel enzootic focus to the established mid-Western endemic focus of Lyme disease remains to be elucidated. The geographic range and reservoir diversity of this organism may have hitherto been underestimated."

This regulation results in the increased or decreased synthesis of several proteins whose levels are believed to play key roles in the ability of B. burgdorferi to cycle between both arthropod and mammalian hosts. Moreover, the differential synthesis of these proteins serves to modulate the response of B. burgdorferito signals in the requisite host and may also, in some cases, function as virulence determinants of this spirochete. Elucidation of these mechanisms will help in the understanding of the pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi as well as aid in identifying proteins that are important during different stages of infection."

Here, we review methods that have been used in spirochetes for gene inactivation and DNA exchange, with a primary focus on B. burgdorferi. We also describe factors influencing electrotransformation in B. burgdorferi. In summary, optimal transformation frequencies are obtained with log phase bacteria, large amounts of DNA (up to 50 microg per transformation), and high field strength (12.5-37.5 kV/cm). Infectious B. burgdorferi isolates transform with frequencies 100-fold lower than those found for high passage, non-infectious strains. Surface characteristics of the bacteria, which often correlate with infectivity, are among the obstacles to effective transformation by electroporation."

They survive in a triangle of parasitic interactions between the spirochete and its vertebrate host, the spirochete and its tick vector, and the host and the tick. Until recently, the significance of vector-host interactions in the transmission of arthropod-borne disease agents has been overlooked. However, there is now compelling evidence that the pharmacological activity of tick saliva can have a profound effect on pathogen transmission both from infected tick to uninfected host, and from infected host to uninfected tick. The salivary glands of ticks provide a pharmacopoeia of anti-inflammatory, anti-haemostatic and anti-immune molecules. These include bioactive proteins that control histamine, bind immunoglobulins, and inhibit the alternative complement cascade. The effect of these molecules is to provide a privileged site at the tick-host interface in which borreliae and other tick-borne pathogens are sheltered from the normal innate and acquired host immune mechanisms that combat infections. Understanding the key events at the tick vector-host interface, that promote spirochete infection and transmission, will provide a better understanding of the epidemiology and ecology of these important human pathogens."

We then prospectively examined EDTA blood of 80 patients who presented with fever 7 to 21 days after a tick bite for the presence of the HGE agent (using nested PCR and microscopic examination of blood smears) and anti-E. phagocytophila antibodies. We also collected clinical data. The retrospective study revealed 12 persons (25%) with anti-E. phagocytophila antibody titers > or = 1:80, suggesting coinfection with HGE and either Lyme Borrelia or tick-borne encephalitis virus. Among these, 7 patients presented with clinical manifestations compatible with HGE disease. The prospective investigation identified 8 patients (10%) with anti-E. phagocytophila antibody titers > or = 1:80, and 7 of these presented with signs and symptoms suggesting HGE. The HGE agent, however, was detected neither by PCR nor by microscopic examination. Serological and clinical data suggest the occurrence of an HGE-like agent as well as of coinfections with HGE and B. burgdorferi or tick-borne encephalitis virus in Switzerland. However, the HGE agent was not identified in persons living in Switzerland."

From July 1996 to December 1997, all laboratories performing serological tests for Lyme borreliosis sent a questionnaire to the treating physicians whenever the tests were positive. In addition, the physicians who diagnosed a case on clinical grounds only were also asked to report these cases. During this period, 1460 positive serological tests were recorded among approximately 10,360 performed (14%). A total of 775 questionnaires were returned (53%). In 3/4 of the cases, the test was ordered because of an acute clinical manifestation or a tick bite. The rest related to chronic symptoms or follow-up. In 504 cases (65%), diagnosis was considered certain or probable. These were erythema migrans in 46%, clinical manifestations of stage II in 33% (26 facial palsy, 20 acute arthritis, 5 benign cutaneous lymphocytoma) and chronic symptoms in 21% (23 acrodermatitis, 26 neuropathies, and 8 arthritis). The adjusted incidence, estimated on the basis of the treating physician's place of residence, ranged from 9/100,000 in Valais to 95/100,000 in Neuchâtel. This study indicates that Lyme borreliosis is a diagnosis frequently looked for and established in French-speaking Switzerland. Although erythema migrans is the main clinical manifestation, symptoms of stage II and III indicate that Lyme borreliosis is also responsible for relatively major systemic morbidity."

In this retrospective cohort study, residents indicating a history of Lyme disease were compared with randomly selected population controls on a standardized medical history, blinded physical examination, and serological studies for Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. Serological evidence of exposure to babesiosis was not associated with increased severity of acute Lyme disease.

To determine whether antigen-presenting Langerhans cells (LCs), which reportedly show signs of injury in erythema chronicum migrans (ECM), the early stage of disease, are altered in ACA. We studied the immunophenotype of cutaneous leucocytes on cryostat sections of lesional skin from both ECM and ACA patients. The total number of CD1a+ cells evaluated by semiautomatic image analysis was lower in ECM (594 +/- 263 cells mm(-2) epidermis) than in ACA (835 +/- 317 cells mm(-2) epidermis). HLA-DR expression was remarkably downregulated on CD1a+ LCs to 29% in ECM and 18% in ACA, whereas in normal skin, most of the epidermal CD1a+ dendritic cells were HLA-DR+. The inflammatory infiltrate was mainly composed of CD68+ macrophages and CD45RO+ memory T cells, with a predominance of CD4+ helper T cells. It is conceivable that the downregulation of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules on LC in both the early and late skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis is indicative of a poorly effective anti-B. burgdorferi immune response and thus at least partly responsible for the insufficient elimination of this micro-organism from ACA skin."

During their stay they come in contact with insects and parasites susceptible to induce skin disorders that can manifest during their stay or after returning. This dermatosis account for approximatively 10% of referral to outpatient tropical clinics. The aim of this paper is to provide family physicians not familiar with these pathologies some practical guidelines to help them to identify and treat some tropical dermatosis: cutaneous larva migrans, cutaneous leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, rickettsiosis. Cutaneous larva migrans is the most frequent serpiginous itching eruption observed in travellers. It is cause by transepidermal penetration of animal hookworms (ancylostomas) through contact with soil infested with cat and dog feces. Effective treatments include topical thiabendazole or oral albendazole or ivermectine. Persons visiting mediterranean countries can acquire cutaneous leishmanisis that has many clinical presentations; the most typical is \"bouton d'Orient\", which manifests as painless ulceration resistant to antibiotic treatment. Treatment with intralesionel pentavalent antimony or pentamidine injection are effective. Lyme disease is an endemic infection in certain areas of North America and Europe, caused by the spirochete borrelia and transmitted through tick bite. It manifest as non-itching large persistent migrant erythema. If untreated this infection may expose to chronic debilitating rheumatologic, cardiac and neurological complications. Rickettsiosis, especially boutonneuse fever, are a potentially fatal multisystemic infectious diseases transmitted through the bite of a dog tick. Diagnosis must be evoked in the presence of a brutal fever syndrome, a painless eschar and widespread eruption associate to systemic symptoms. This infection must be recognized clinically in order to begin rapidly treatment with cyclines."

A semiquantitative detection system, representing the input amount of specific DNA and thus the density of spirochetes in clinical specimens, indicated the preferred clinical sample to obtain for PCR testing. Skin biopsy and urine samples from 31 patients with EM and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and urine samples from 30 patients with neuroborreliosis were investigated. Borrelia burgdorferi DNA was detected in 71% of the skin biopsy specimens and 13% of the urine samples from patients with EM. Forty-one percent of the patients with EM were found to have B burgdorferi-specific antibodies in serum, and B burgdorferi was cultured in 29% of the EM specimens. For patients with neuroborreliosis, the diagnostic sensitivities in CSF and urine samples were 17% and 7%, respectively. Specific intrathecal antibody production was found in 90% of the patients, and 87% showed elevated B burgdorferi antibodies in serum. In general, PCR of skin biopsy samples yielded very high amounts of amplicons versus low amounts for CSF and urine samples. PCR of skin biopsy specimens is currently the most sensitive and specific test for the diagnosis of patients with EM, superior to culture and serological testing. For B burgdorferi-specific CSF disgnosis in patients with neuroborreliosis, the measurement of specific intrathecal antibody synthesis is superior to PCR. However, in patients with a short duration of disease (<14 days), PCR may be a useful diagnostic supplement. PCR of urine samples cannot be recommended at the present time for routine diagnosis of patients with EM or neuroborreliosis."

Our aim was to assess the level of sero-prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in a high-risk population of forestry workers in the mountainous region of Gorski Kotar, Croatia, and compare it with the sero-prevalence in the residents of that area and the neighboring littoral region. A sero-epidemiological study was conducted on 520 healthy subjects, divided in 3 groups: the first group included 234 forestry workers, residents of Gorski Kotar, the second 100 residents of various professions in the same region, and the third 186 subjects of various professions from the neighboring littoral region. The sera were collected during the winters of two successive years, 1997 and 1998. Lyme borreliosis serology was performed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Sera from 10 hunting dogs from Gorski Kotar were also analyzed. The IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato were found in 11 examinees (4.7%) from the group of forestry workers, in 3 (3%) from the second group, and in 5 (2.7%) from the third group. Four out of 10 dogs (40%) had IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi. Our results show that the forest and mountainous area of Gorski Kotar, Croatia, has the characteristics of a low sero-prevalence area, in contrast to the endemic neighboring areas."

Six synthetic peptides (C(1) to C(6)), which reproduced the six IR sequences were used as peptide-based, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Two IRs, IR(2) and IR(6), were found to be immunodominant. Studies with serially collected serum samples from experimentally infected dogs revealed that the antibody response to IR(6) appears earlier and is stronger than that to IR(2). Thus, the IR(6) sequence alone appeared to be sufficient for serodiagnosis. When C(6) alone was used as antigen, the peptide-based ELISA was positive in 7 of 23 dogs (30%) as early as 3 weeks postinfection. All dogs (n = 33) became strongly positive 1 or 2 weeks later, and this response persisted for the entire study, which lasted for 69 weeks. Of 55 sera submitted by veterinarians from dogs suspected of having Lyme disease, 19 were also positive by the C(6) ELISA, compared to 20 positives detected by immunoblot analysis using cultured B. burgdorferi lysates as antigen. The sensitivity of using C(2) and C(6) together for detecting specific antibody in both experimentally infected and clinically diagnosed dogs was not better than sensitivity with C(6) alone, confirming that C(6) suffices as a diagnostic probe. Moreover, the C(6) ELISA yielded 100% specificity with serum samples collected from 70 healthy dogs, 14 dogs with infections other than B. burgdorferi, and 15 animals vaccinated with either outer surface protein A, whole-spirochete vaccines, or the common puppy-vaccines. Therefore, this C(6) ELISA was both sensitive and specific for the serodiagnosis of canine Lyme disease and could be used with vaccinated dogs."

Four different genospecies were found (nine Borrelia garinii, including the two human isolates, three B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, two B. valaisiana, and one B. lusitaniae), showing a diverse spectrum of B. burgdorferi sensu lato species. B. garinii isolates were highly variable in terms of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern and OspA serotype, with four of the seven serotypes described. One of the human isolates was OspA serotype 5, the same found in four of seven tick isolates. The second human isolate was OspA serotype 3, which was not present in ticks from the same area. Seven B. garinii isolates were able to disseminate through the skin of C3H/HeN mice and to cause severe inflammation of joints. One of the two B. valaisiana isolates also caused disease in mice. Only one B. burgdorferi sensu stricto isolate was recovered from the urinary bladder. One isolate each of B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae were not able to disseminate through the skin of mice or to infect internal organs. In summary, there is substantial diversity in the species and in the pathogenicity of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in areas in northern Spain where Lyme disease is endemic."

In 35 habitats, a total of 489 larvae, 1,611 nymphs and 193 adult I. ricinus ticks were collected. Tick density was found to be influenced by roe deer abundance and soil water capacity. Based on this evaluation, a model predicting increasing number of ticks with increasing roe deer abundance and soil water capacity was suggested. A total of 1,045 nymphs and 106 adult ticks were tested for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato Of these, 53 nymphs and 6 adults were found to be infected, leading to an general infection rate of 5% and 6% for nymphs and adults, respectively. Prevalences of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in nymphal I. ricinus were found to be independent of roe deer abundance and soil water capacity. The correlation between human neuroborreliosis incidence and the estimated number of I. ricinus based on roe deer abundance and soil water capacity was examined. Differences in human neuroborreliosis incidence were found to correspond with the expected spatial differences in tick density in 12 counties in Denmark."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in Ixodes ricinus nymphs in Denmark was found to be approximately 5%. The mean abundance of infected nymphs varied from 0.3 to 4.4 per 100 m2 according to site. The seasonal occurrence of infected nymphs in a beech forest coincided with seasonal distribution of neuroborreliosis cases. In order to establish a working hypothesis, it was assumed that the availability of habitats and human habitat preferences is one of the factors leading to low number of neuroborreliosis cases in the spring. In addition, this paper gives a description of the neuroborreliosis cases in Denmark in the period 1985-97 and offers a possible explanation for the variation in cases. The explanation is based on an assessment of tick density, which by comparison with the number of neuroborreliosis cases provides information on the infectivity of ticks. The model suggests that high temperatures and low precipitation in the autumn is essential for the transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato to reservoir hosts or development of B. burgdorferi sensu lato within ticks, which secures high tick infectivity in the following season."

		"abstract": "In the United States, the incidence of Lyme disease is considered to be disproportionately high among Whites because of risk of exposure. For assessment of racial differences in Lyme disease incidence and the role of risk exposure, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for Lyme disease and its manifestations between Whites and African Americans in Maryland and in its focus of endemicity, the Upper Eastern Shore, were calculated. Calculations were based on reported cases of Lyme disease in Maryland during the years 1992-1996. The IRR for Lyme disease between Whites and African Americans was 6.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.0, 8.0), decreasing to 1.8 (95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) for the Upper Eastern Shore. Statewide, there was a significant difference between the White to African American IRR for erythema migrans and for Lyme disease-associated arthritis, at 17.7 (95% CI: 11.2, 27.8) and 2.3 (95% CI: 1.7, 3.2), respectively. On the Upper Eastern Shore, the IRR for arthritis reversed, indicating higher incidence among African Americans than among Whites: IRR = 5.7 (95% CI: 2.4, 13.9) for erythema migrans and IRR = 0.7 (95% CI: 0.4, 1.1) for arthritis. White patients were more likely to have erythema migrans (risk ratio = 2.8, 95% CI: 1.9, 4.1) and less likely to have arthritis than were African Americans (risk ratio = 0.4, 95% CI: 0.3, 0.5). Among all patients, there was a significant negative association between arthritis and erythema migrans. Although much of the racial disparity in incidence rates diminishes in a rural, endemic area, consistent with exposure risk being responsible for much of the variation, a difference remains. This may be due to failure to recognize early disease (erythema migrans) among African Americans, resulting in increased rates of late manifestations. Geographic spread of the disease warrants efforts to increase awareness of Lyme disease and its manifestations among people of color and the health care providers who serve them."

Bb infection of CD1d-deficient (CD1d(-/-)) mouse strains normally resistant to this pathogen resulted in arthritis. Pathology correlated with an increased prevalence of spirochete DNA in tissues and enhanced production of Bb-specific IgG, including IgG to Ag rapidly down-modulated on spirochetes in vivo. CD1d(-/-) mice exhibited high-titer Bb-specific IgG2a, an isotype commonly induced in disease-susceptible mice but not in the disease-resistant control mice in this study.

We previously mapped the oriC of the linear chromosome to the center of the molecule, where a pronounced switch in CG skew occurs. In this study, we analyzed B. burgdorferi plasmid sequences for AT and CG skew in an effort to similarly identify plasmid replication origins. Cumulative skew diagrams of the plasmids suggested that they, like the linear chromosome, replicate bidirectionally from an internal origin. The B. burgdorferi linear chromosome contains homologs to partitioning protein genes soj and spoOJ, which are closely linked to oriC at the minimum cumulative skew point of the 1-Mb molecule. A soj/parA homolog also maps to cumulative skew minima of the B. burgdorferi linear and circular plasmids, further suggesting that these regions contain the replication origin. The heterogeneity in these genes and in the nucleotide sequences of the putative origin regions could account for the mutual compatibility of the multiple DNA elements in B. burgdorferi."

The dynamics of the antibody titre against B. burgdorferi (IFA test) were assessed in 21 patients with EM for a period of 1 to 22 months and in 5 patients with acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans (ACA) for 3 to 55 months. In 50% EM developed during the summer months. 66% reported as the vector a tick, 14% insects and 20% did not know. An incubation of 1 and 2 weeks was reported in 34%, the lower extremities were affected in 52%. Manifestations of dissemination were found in 6 patients, in 2 patients EM relapsed. Antibodies (Ab) against B. burgdorferi were present in 38 patients. In 21 patients the dynamics of the antibody titre were followed up for 1 to 22 months and no substantial changes were found. Serum positivity in patients with ACA persisted without change of the titre for several years. In the treatment of EM most frequently doxycycline was administered for two weeks. EM as the early stage of LB is a seasonal disease with a natural focus. If treatment is started in the early stage of infection, antibodies against B. burgdorferi need not develop. There is no correlation between clinical complaints and serological results and the type of treatment. The prognosis of the disease is favourable in the majority of patients. Vaccination offers new possibilities in active protection against Borrelia infection, in particular in endemic areas. For European countries at present a recombined vaccine is being prepared from the surface lipoprotein A (OspA) made from prevalent strains of B. afzelii and B. garinii."

		"abstract": "Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is a well-known target of autoantibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The majority of these autoantibodies are of the IgG isotype and show affinity maturation, both of which are known hallmarks of T cell help. T cell responses to autoantigens, including DNA, have been reported only incidentally in SLE patients. Nevertheless, in murine SLE, naked DNA and complexed DNA (nucleosomes) are known to be recognized by T cells. This study aimed to characterize the antinucleosome response and its clinical impact on human SLE. Nucleosomes were prepared from chicken erythrocytes. Sera from SLE and control patients were investigated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for nucleosome-specific antibody responses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SLE and control patients were analyzed by a kinetic T cell proliferation assay. PBMC were subsequently analyzed for nucleosome-specific T cell proliferation. Of 136 SLE patients, 56% were seropositive for antinucleosome antibodies. In contrast, only 3% of 309 control patients (with rheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, undifferentiated connective tissue disease, Lyme borreliosis, scleroderma, Sjögren's syndrome, ulcerative colitis, hepatitis B virus infection, or human immunodeficiency virus infection) were seropositive. Thus, the antinucleosome ELISA had a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 97%, and a diagnostic confidence of 90% when applied to SLE. It was therefore superior to an anti-DNA ELISA that demonstrated a 69% diagnostic confidence in the same population. Antinucleosome reactivity in SLE patients correlated significantly with disease activity (P < 0.0001), nephritis (P < 0.002), and psychosis (P < 0.02). When proliferation assays were applied, 14 of 26 SLE patients (54%) were positive for nucleosome-specific T cells that proliferated in response to their cognate antigen. A suppressed response was elicited in 3 SLE patients (12%); in these patients, the PBMC response to nucleosomes was lower than the proliferation of PBMC in the presence of culture medium only. PBMC from the remaining 9 SLE patients (35%) were nonresponsive to nucleosomes in either way. Responding, nonresponding, and suppressed populations differed from each other significantly (P < 0.0001). None of the PBMC from 7 healthy donors and 10 control patients could be stimulated with nucleosomal antigens. We present evidence that nucleosomes are major autoantigens in human SLE and that antinucleosomal antibodies are highly specific for the disease. The antinucleosome ELISA has been shown to be superior to the anti-dsDNA ELISA and may thus be a significantly better tool for diagnosing SLE. Nucleosome-specific T cells in SLE patients may help B cells class switch to IgG and undergo affinity maturation."

The density of I. pacificus adults and nymphs varied significantly between years, trails, and sides of trails. Adult ticks occurred on vegetation along sun-exposed trails in January through March, their density (0-1.93 per 20 m) correlated with brush density, trail width, and presence of an uphill slope. Nymphs (0.06-5.10 per 20 m) occurred in leaf litter along shaded trails in May-July. Adult I. pacificus were rare at picnic sites (0.00-0.24 per 20 m), but nymphal densities (0.93-2.37 per 20 m) were comparable with those along some shaded trails. The prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks (2.8% overall) did not differ significantly between locations, years, or stages. We conclude that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease in these sites is low, but varies among trails, seasons, and years."

The visual prognosis is excellent. An infectious cause is found in almost all cases. Case report A 34-year-old man consulted for declining visual acuity of the right eye which began suddenly without pain and was preceded by a flu-like syndrome lasting two weeks. Visual acuity on the right side was 2/10 P6, there was optic disk edema associated with dry macular exsudate (macular star) and a paleness of the posterior pole progressing to the periphery and readily visualized on the angiography, and a central scotome, but no dyschromatopsy. The left eye was strictly normal. Laboratory tests showed an erythrocyte sedimentation rate at 45, C reactive protein at 61, normal red cell count and minimal transaminase elevation. Spinal tap showed: 3 elements/mm(3), protein 0.28g/l, 18% gammaglobulins. Serology tests were negative. Brain imaging was normal. Corticosteroid flashes for three days were initiated and the patient was seen again two weeks later with clear clinical improvement. Visual acuity was 6/10 P2 with considerable resorption of the edema. This case is a typical illustration of acute Leber's neuroretinititis, probably caused by viral infection. The cerebrospinal fluid tests and brain imaging ruled out multiple sclerosis, and serology tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, Lyme disease and possible parasite infection were negative. Acute lever's neuroretinitis is an uncommon condition which must be distinguished from inflammatory optic neuropathy, particularly in multiple sclerosis which has a very different prognosis and clinical course."

		"abstract": "The clinical picture of myocarditis/myopericarditis is of importance in differential diagnosis, especially in younger patients with suspected myocardial infarction. Myocarditis/myopericarditis commonly presents with chest pain, and the diagnosis is usually established on clinical grounds. However, endomyocardial biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. We evaluated the characteristics of acute myocarditis over the years 1980-1998 in 54 patients of the Department of Medicine of the University Hospital, Zurich. Two to 6 patients per year were hospitalised with this diagnosis. In most cases the diagnosis was established by a combination of criteria, such as a preceding infection of the upper respiratory tract, thoracic pain, ST segment elevations in different precordial leads followed by T wave inversions, arrhythmias, elevation of cardiac enzymes, reversible hypokinesia by echocardiography and normal coronary arteries. At least 3 of 5 criteria were requested. In a first step we analysed retrospectively all patients with acute myocarditis/myopericarditis in the years 1980-1993. Among 30 cases of acute myocarditis/myopericarditis the following causes could be identified: one influenza B, one Toxoplasma gondii infection, 2 Epstein-Barr infections and one bacterial myocarditis with gram-negative rods. The aetiology of the other 25 cases remained unknown. The majority of myocarditis/myopericarditis healed without complications. One patient with Epstein-Barr myocarditis and one with Toxoplasma gondii infection died. Two patients developed dilated cardiomyopathy. In a second phase we analysed prospectively all cases with acute myocarditis/myopericarditis over the period 1994-1998: 24 patients with acute myocarditis/myopericarditis were hospitalised. At that time coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsies were performed more frequently. We found 2 patients with giant cell myocarditis and 2 with Toxoplasma gondii infection and HIV, all of whom died. In addition, there were 2 patients with eosinophilic myocarditis, one with Lyme carditis, one with Epstein-Barr myocarditis, one with myopericarditis after Campylobacter enteritis and one histologically proven myocarditis after pneumonia with Haemophilus influenzae. The aetiology of the remaining 13 cases with myocarditis/myopericarditis could not be established. Three patients with probable viral myocarditis developed cardiogenic shock requiring intraaortic balloon pump, and fully recovered. The patient with Lyme carditis manifested with total atrioventricular block and was treated with a temporary pacemaker. One patient with lymphocytic myocarditis required heart transplantation because of terminal heart failure and one female patient with histologically proven diffuse lympho-monocytic myocarditis died of cardiogenic shock. All the other cases healed without complications. Serologies are of little diagnostic value and should be restricted to serologies with therapeutic implications. We believe that the apparent increase in myocarditis/myopericarditis in recent years is a result of better diagnostic tools, such as more specific cardiac enzyme tests, coronary angiography and endomyocardial biopsies. In most cases the therapy remains symptomatic. In elected, severe cases steroids and other immunosuppressive drugs are sometimes used."

The protein encoded by this gene in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is a phosphocarrier protein (histidine-containing protein). A mutation T to G polymorphism at codon 57 was found to be specific to B. garinii.

Serodiagnosis is complicated by this genetic diversity. A synthetic peptide (C(6)), based on the 26-mer invariable region (IR(6)) of the variable surface antigen of B. burgdorferi (VlsE), was used as ELISA antigen, to test serum samples collected from mice experimentally infected with the 3 genospecies and from European patients with Lyme disease. Regardless of the infecting strains, mice produced a strong antibody response to C(6), which indicates that IR(6) is antigenically conserved among the pathogenic genospecies. Twenty of 23 patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans had a detectable antibody response to C(6). A sensitivity of 95.2% was achieved, with serum samples collected from patients with well-defined acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Fourteen of 20 patients with symptoms of late Lyme disease also had a positive anti-IR(6) ELISA. Thus, it is possible that C(6) may be used to serodiagnose Lyme disease universally."

Five of 14 immune sera exhibited borreliacidal activity against isolate FEM1. Heat-inactivated immune sera failed to kill the spirochaetes. Immunoblotting experiments with outer-membrane preparations showed that OspC and 11 additional proteins of 14.0, 16.0, 17.7, 19.3, 21.7, 27.5, 32.7, 40.7, 48.9, 51.3 and 53.6 kDa were recognised by borreliacidal immune sera. To analyse the borreliacidal properties of anti-OspC antibodies, two sera (EM4 and EM5), which beside antibodies against a 51.3-kDa protein contained exclusively anti-OspC antibodies, were further investigated by comparative analysis with a FEM1 wild-type and a FEM1 variant lacking OspC in a growth inhibition assay. Only FEM1 wild-type and not variant FEM1OspC(-) was killed by immune sera EM4 and EM5. Complement-dependent killing of FEM1 wild-type was mediated by formation of the terminal complement complex that was found to be attached directly to the outer membrane as confirmed by immuno-electron microscopy. No complement deposition was observed on the surface of variant FEM1OspC(-) after incubation with immune sera EM4 and EM5, thereby suggesting that only anti-OspC antibodies in these two immune sera were responsible for borreliacidal activity. These results provide direct evidence that anti-OspC antibodies, once developed during the immune response, are of critical importance for efficient killing of borreliae in the early phase of infection."

Charts were reviewed of all patients < 15 years of age who presented with optic neuritis to the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute or the Miami Children's Hospital between 1986 and 1998. Fifteen patients were identified. There was a slight female predilection in the study group (60%), with a mean age of 9.8 years at presentation. A preceding febrile illness within 2 weeks of visual symptoms was reported in 66% of patients. Initial visual acuity ranged from 20/15 to no light perception. Involvement was bilateral in 66% of patients, and disc swelling was present in 64% of involved eyes. Of the patients who underwent magnetic resonance imaging, 33% had focal demyelinating lesions in the brain, and 63% of affected nerves were enlarged or enhanced with gadolinium. Eleven patients were treated with intravenous steroids. Final visual acuity was > or = 20/40 in 58.3% of eyes. Thirty percent of the patients had vision of finger counting or worse. Four (26%) patients developed MS. The mean age of patients with MS was 12 years, compared with 9 years in children who did not develop MS. Patients with unilateral involvement had an excellent visual prognosis (100% > 20/40), but a higher rate of development of MS (75%). Two patients had positive serology for Lyme disease. Optic neuritis presents differently in children than in adults. Children typically have bilateral involvement with papillitis following an antecedent viral illness. Although visual prognosis is poorer in children than adults, the development of MS is less common in children. Children who present with unilateral involvement have a better visual prognosis; however, they also develop MS at a greater frequency than children with bilateral involvement. Patients who developed MS were, on average, older at presentation with optic neuritis than those who did not develop MS."

Serum B burgdorferi or E equi antibodies were measured by use of an ELISA, immunoblot analysis, or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining. Of the 82 serum samples tested, 37 (45.1%) and 13 (15.9%) had detectable antibodies to B burgdorferi or E equi, respectively. Test results indicated that 12 horses had been exposed to both agents, 11 of these horses had granulocytic ehrlichiosis. The ELISA regularly detected antibodies to the following recombinant protein (p) antigens of B burgdorferi: p29, p37, p39, and p41-G. The use of immunoblot analysis confirmed ELISA results by indicating antibody reactivities to antigens of whole-cell B burgdorferi having molecular masses of predominantly 31, 34, 37, 39, 41, 58, and 93 kd. Horses living in areas where ticks (Ixodes scapularis) abound are sometimes exposed to multiple pathogens. Analyses for specific recombinant borrelial antibodies using an ELISA can help separate horses with borreliosis from those with granulocytic ehrlichiosis, even when antibodies to both etiologic agents are detected in serum samples. Analysis using immunoblots is sensitive, and along with ELISA or IFA procedures, is suitable for confirming a clinical diagnosis of each disease."

		"abstract": "Current evidence suggests that inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variability have a direct influence on the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. This evidence has been assessed at the continental level in order to determine the possible consequences of the expected future climate change. By 2100 it is estimated that average global temperatures will have risen by 1.0-3.5 degrees C, increasing the likelihood of many vector-borne diseases in new areas. The greatest effect of climate change on transmission is likely to be observed at the extremes of the range of temperatures at which transmission occurs. For many diseases these lie in the range 14-18 degrees C at the lower end and about 35-40 degrees C at the upper end. Malaria and dengue fever are among the most important vector-borne diseases in the tropics and subtropics; Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the USA and Europe. Encephalitis is also becoming a public health concern. Health risks due to climatic changes will differ between countries that have developed health infrastructures and those that do not. Human settlement patterns in the different regions will influence disease trends. While 70% of the population in South America is urbanized, the proportion in sub-Saharan Africa is less than 45%. Climatic anomalies associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon and resulting in drought and floods are expected to increase in frequency and intensity. They have been linked to outbreaks of malaria in Africa, Asia and South America. Climate change has far-reaching consequences and touches on all life-support systems. It is therefore a factor that should be placed high among those that affect human health and survival."

Dogs were monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of Lyme disease along with borreliacidal antibody production against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto isolates 297 and 50772. Ten (77%) dogs developed lameness in one or more legs within 210 days after attachment of Ixodes scapularis ticks. Eight (80%) of the lame animals had concurrent fever of > or =38 degrees C. Spirochetes were also recovered from the skin and joints of 12 (92%) dogs, but rarely from other organs. Borreliacidal antibodies against B. burgdorferi isolate 297 were detected in only four (31%) dogs, and the levels of killing antibodies remained low for the duration of the infection. In contrast, borreliacidal antibodies against B. burgdorferi isolate 50772 were detected in 13 (100%) dogs within 21 days of infection. Furthermore, the borreliacidal antibody levels correlated with the severity of B. burgdorferi infection. Detection of borreliacidal antibodies, especially against B. burgdorferi isolate 50772, is also a reliable serodiagnostic test for detection of Lyme disease in dogs."

		"abstract": "Human louse-borne relapsing fever occurs in sporadic outbreaks in central and eastern Africa that are characterized by significant morbidity and mortality. Isolates of the causative agent, Borrelia recurrentis, were obtained from the blood of four patients during a recent epidemic of the disease in southern Sudan. The glpQ gene, encoding glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, from these isolates was sequenced and compared with the glpQ sequences obtained from other relapsing-fever spirochetes. Previously we showed that GlpQ of Borrelia hermsii is an immunogenic protein with utility as a serological test antigen for discriminating tick-borne relapsing fever from Lyme disease. In the present work, we cloned and expressed the glpQ gene from B. recurrentis and used recombinant GlpQ in serological tests. Acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples obtained from 42 patients with louse-borne relapsing fever were tested with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) that used whole cells of B. recurrentis and with immunoblotting to whole-cell lysates of the spirochete and Escherichia coli producing recombinant GlpQ. The geometric mean titers of the acute- and convalescent-phase serum samples measured by IFA were 1:83 and 1:575, respectively. The immunoblot analysis identified a high level of reactivity and seroconversion to GlpQ, and the assay was more sensitive than the whole-cell IFA and ELISA using purified, recombinant histidine-tagged GlpQ. Serum antibodies to GlpQ and other antigens persisted for 27 years in one patient. We conclude that assessment of anti-GlpQ antibodies will allow serological confirmation of louse-borne relapsing fever and determination of disease prevalence."

HGE usually runs an asymptomatic and self-limiting course. Symptoms include acute pyrexial illness, frequently accompanied by muscle pain, headache, nausea and vomiting. Treatment is with doxycycline/tetracycline or rifampicin. In a study in Hesse of 128 heavily exposed subjects, 19.5% had serum antibodies (IFA test) against HGE versus 4.4% in a control group. This difference is statistically significant. The prevalence of both symptoms and the seropositivity differ significantly between locations. HGE should be considered in the differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin following tick bite exposure, at least in the North Hesse region."

Direct analysis of OspA-tetramer binding CD4(+) cells in patients expressing the HLA-DRB1*0401 allele revealed frequencies of between <0.005 and 0.1% in peripheral blood (n = 6), and between <0.005 and 3.1% in synovial fluid (n = 3). OspA-tetramer(+)CD4(+) cells were directly cloned at 1 cell per well and expanded by mitogen and IL-2 on allogeneic feeder cells. As measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation, 95% of 168 T cell clones from synovial fluid binding the OspA-tetramer were antigen-reactive. Clones generated from peripheral blood revealed a different pattern of responsiveness when compared with clones generated from synovial fluid, as measured by proliferation, IFN-gamma, and IL-13 secretion. These clones, selected on the basis of their peptide binding, also responded to whole protein, but with a different cytokine profile. Our studies demonstrate that MHC class II tetramers can be used in humans to directly identify, isolate, and characterize antigen-reactive T cells from an inflammatory compartment."

Replete larvae, at 5 d after feeding, were assayed for infection by culture in Barbour-Stoner-Kelly (BSK-H) media. Infection frequency in I. muris replete larvae was 66%. Resultant nymphs were fed on naive ICR outbred mice to determine the ability of I. muris to transmit infection. Infection frequency in fed nymphs declined to 38% and only 1/5 mice was positive for B. burgdorferi on ear biopsy culture. We demonstrated that I. muris is capable of acquiring and transmitting B. burgdorferi but is a relatively poor vector compared with I. scapularis (Say)."

Lyme disease has become the most important vector-borne disease in the United States. In a field-release experiment conducted in Africa by members of the International Center for Insect Physiology and Ecology, effective control of Amblyomma variegatum (F.) was obtained by the release of Ixodiphagus parasitoids in tick habitats.

In the current study, using B. burgdorferi cultivated under varying conditions in BSK-H medium, we found that a decrease in pH, in conjunction with increases in temperature (e.g. 34 degrees C or 37 degrees C) and cell density, acted interdependently for the reciprocal expression of ospC and ospA. The lower pH (6.8), which induced the reciprocal expression of ospC and ospA in BSK-H medium, correlated with a drop in pH from 7.4 to 6.8 of tick midgut contents during tick feeding. In addition to ospC and ospA, other genes were found to be regulated in reciprocal fashion. Such genes were either ospC-like (e.g. ospF, mlp-8 and rpoS) (group I) or ospA-like (lp6.6 and p22) (group II); changes in expression occurred at the mRNA level. That the expression of rpoS, encoding a putative stress-related alternative sigma factor (sigma(s)), was ospC-like suggested that the expression of some of the group I genes may be controlled through sigma(s). The combined results prompt a model that allows for predicting the regulation of other B. burgdorferi genes that may be involved in spirochaete transmission, virulence or mammalian host immune responses."

The clinical spectrum of late cutaneous borreliosis should be enlarged to include livedo racemosa."

		"abstract": "Bacterial shape usually is dictated by the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall. In this paper, we show that the morphology of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is the result of a complex interaction between the cell cylinder and the internal periplasmic flagella. B. burgdorferi has a bundle of 7-11 helically shaped periplasmic flagella attached at each end of the cell cylinder and has a flat-wave cell morphology. Backward moving, propagating waves enable these bacteria to swim in both low viscosity media and highly viscous gel-like media. Using targeted mutagenesis, we inactivated the gene encoding the major periplasmic flagellar filament protein FlaB. The resulting flaB mutants not only were nonmotile, but were rod-shaped. Western blot analysis indicated that FlaB was no longer synthesized, and electron microscopy revealed that the mutants were completely deficient in periplasmic flagella. Wild-type cells poisoned with the protonophore carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone retained their flat-wave morphology, indicating that the periplasmic flagella do not need to be energized for the cell to maintain this shape. Our results indicate that the periplasmic flagella of B. burgdorferi have a skeletal function. These organelles dynamically interact with the rod-shaped cell cylinder to enable the cell to swim, and to confer in part its flat-wave morphology."

		"abstract": "Previous studies have suggested that interleukin-4 (IL-4) has a protective effect in host defense to Borrelia burgdorferi infection, both in limiting the severity of arthritis and in controlling spirochete numbers in tissues, and a mapping study revealed suggestive linkage to a cluster of genes on mouse chromosome 11, including the genes for IL-4 and IL-13. In contrast, other studies have questioned the importance of IL-4. In this study the involvement of IL-4 in murine Lyme disease was examined in C57BL/6J and BALB/cJ mice with targeted disruptions in the IL-4 gene, the IL-4Ralpha chain gene, or both. A spectrum of arthritis severity was seen in BALB/cJ mice, and ablation of IL-4, IL-4Ralpha, or both had no effect on the overall severity of arthritis as determined by joint swelling and histopathology. Wild-type C57BL/6J mice exhibited mild to moderate arthritis, and ablation of IL-4 again had no effect on arthritis severity. IL-4- and IL-4Ralpha-deficient mice produced extremely low levels of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and showed increased production of IgG2b. This shift in immunoglobulin isotype had no effect on the host's ability to control spirochete growth in either strain of mouse, as determined by PCR detection of B. burgdorferi DNA from heart and ankle tissues. In summary, the IL-4-IL-4Ralpha pathway, including IL-13 signaling, neither limits arthritis severity nor is required for control of spirochete growth during B. burgdorferi infection of mice. Furthermore, the IgG1 isotype is not required to control B. burgdorferi cell numbers in tissues. These findings suggest the host defense against B. burgdorferi infection is not dependent on the Th1-Th2 paradigm of T-cell responses."

		"abstract": "Borreliacidal antibody production is one of several parameters for establishing the effectiveness of Borrelia burgdorferi vaccines. The production of borreliacidal antibody was studied in vitro by culturing immune lymph node cells with macrophages and B. burgdorferi. We showed that borreliacidal antibody, directed primarily against outer surface protein A (OspA), was readily produced by lymph node cells obtained from C3H/HeJ mice vaccinated with formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi in aluminum hydroxide, but not recombinant OspA. Anti-OspA borreliacidal antibody was detected in supernatants of cultures of lymph node cells obtained on day 7 after vaccination, peaked on day 17, and rapidly declined. The borreliacidal activity was attributable to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1), IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies. When lymph node cells were treated with interleukin-4 (IL-4), production of borreliacidal antibody was inhibited but was unaffected by treatment with anti-IL-4 antibodies. These results suggest that other cytokines, but not IL-4, are mainly responsible for production of the secondary borreliacidal antibody response."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted in the United States primarily by Ixodes scapularis (the deer tick), is the most common vector borne disease in the United States. Its most frequent manifestation, a characteristic, expanding annular rash (erythema migrans), sometimes accompanied by myalgia, arthralgia, and malaise, occurs in nearly 90% of persons with symptomatic infection. Other manifestations of Lyme disease include seventh cranial nerve palsy, aseptic meningitis, and arthritis. Extensive coverage in the press about the serious effects of Lyme disease has led to widespread anxiety about this illness that is far out of proportion to the actual morbidity that it causes. This problem is exacerbated by the frequent use of serological tests to eliminate the possible diagnosis of Lyme disease in persons with only nonspecific symptoms (such as arthralgia or fatigue) who have a very low probability that Lyme disease is the cause of their symptoms. Consequently, misdiagnosis is frequent and is the most common cause of failure of treatment. The prognosis for most persons with Lyme disease is excellent."

		"abstract": "Holliday junction resolvases (HJRs) are key enzymes of DNA recombination. A detailed computer analysis of the structural and evolutionary relationships of HJRs and related nucleases suggests that the HJR function has evolved independently from at least four distinct structural folds, namely RNase H, endonuclease, endonuclease VII-colicin E and RusA. The endonuclease fold, whose structural prototypes are the phage lambda exonuclease, the very short patch repair nuclease (Vsr) and type II restriction enzymes, is shown to encompass by far a greater diversity of nucleases than previously suspected. This fold unifies archaeal HJRs, repair nucleases such as RecB and Vsr, restriction enzymes and a variety of predicted nucleases whose specific activities remain to be determined. Within the RNase H fold a new family of predicted HJRs, which is nearly ubiquitous in bacteria, was discovered, in addition to the previously characterized RuvC family. The proteins of this family, typified by Escherichia coli YqgF, are likely to function as an alternative to RuvC in most bacteria, but could be the principal HJRs in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria and AQUIFEX: Endonuclease VII of phage T4 is shown to serve as a structural template for many nucleases, including MCR:A and other type II restriction enzymes. Together with colicin E7, endonuclease VII defines a distinct metal-dependent nuclease fold. As a result of this analysis, the principal HJRs are now known or confidently predicted for all bacteria and archaea whose genomes have been completely sequenced, with many species encoding multiple potential HJRs. Horizontal gene transfer, lineage-specific gene loss and gene family expansion, and non-orthologous gene displacement seem to have been major forces in the evolution of HJRs and related nucleases. A remarkable case of displacement is seen in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which does not possess any of the typical HJRs, but instead encodes, in its chromosome and each of the linear plasmids, members of the lambda exonuclease family predicted to function as HJRs. The diversity of HJRs and related nucleases in bacteria and archaea contrasts with their near absence in eukaryotes. The few detected eukaryotic representatives of the endonuclease fold and the RNase H fold have probably been acquired from bacteria via horizontal gene transfer. The identity of the principal HJR(s) involved in recombination in eukaryotes remains uncertain; this function could be performed by topoisomerase IB or by a novel, so far undetected, class of enzymes. Likely HJRs and related nucleases were identified in the genomes of numerous bacterial and eukaryotic DNA viruses. Gene flow between viral and cellular genomes has probably played a major role in the evolution of this class of enzymes. This analysis resulted in the prediction of numerous previously unnoticed nucleases, some of which are likely to be new restriction enzymes."

		"abstract": "Although a link between primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (PCBCL) and Borrelia burgdorferi infection has long been suspected, previous studies have not demonstrated a significant association. The authors looked for evidence of B. burgdorferi in 20 cases of PCBCL from the Scottish Highlands, an area with endemic Lyme disease, and compared their findings with those in 40 control patients (20 undergoing wide reexcision at sites of malignant melanoma and 20 biopsies of inflammatory dermatoses). All studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. The cases of PCBCL were classified according to criteria described by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cutaneous Lymphoma Project Group using a combination of morphology, immunohistochemistry, and seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement. A nested PCR was performed on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracts from the lymphoma and control cases using primers to a unique conserved region of the B. burgdorferi flagellin gene. B. burgdorferi-specific DNA was detected in seven of 20 lymphoma cases (five of 12 marginal zone lymphomas, one of five primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphomas, one of three diffuse, large B-cell lymphomas of the leg) and in one melanoma reexcision patient of 40 control subjects. The relationship between B. burgdorferi and PCBCL was significant when compared with the control groups separately (p <0.05) or in combination (p <0.01). These results provide strong evidence to support the concept of B. burgdorferi-driven lymphomagenesis in the skin."

Interviews were carried out using an open-ended interview guide to explore how patients made assessments of trust in their doctors and health care plans. The guide followed a conceptual approach that asked questions about competence, agency/fiduciary responsibility, control, disclosure and confidentiality. Respondents were given ample opportunity to raise other areas of concern. The data were organized using the NUDIST software package for the analysis of non-numerical and unstructured qualitative data. Patients viewed trust as an iterative process and commonly tested their physicians against their knowledge and expectations. Interpersonal competence, involving caring, concern and compassion, was the most common aspect of trust reported, with listening as a central focus. Most patient comments referred to learnable skills and not simply to personality characteristics. Technical competence also received high priority but was often assessed by reputation or interpersonal cues. Patients were much concerned that doctors be their agents and fight for their interests with health care plans. Disclosure and confidentiality were less common concerns; most patients anticipated that doctors would be honest with them and respect their confidences. Patients' responses also appeared to vary by their disease, their socio-demographic characteristics, their involvement with self-help groups, and how their illness conditions unfolded."

The OspC-I peptide is derived from part of the outer surface protein C (OspC) amino acid sequence of Borrelia burgdorferi and is located in the region conserved among B. burgdorferi sensu stricto or sensu lato isolates. In this study, we demonstrate that sera containing antibodies against OspC-I from patients with early Lyme disease had borreliacidal activity against isolates of three genospecies of Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdoreferi B31, B. garinii HPI and B. afzelii HT61. However, the borreliacidal activity against B. burgdorferi, which has not been isolated in Japan, was weaker than that against the other species. Vaccination of mice with OspC-I induced the production of anti-OspC-I antibodies in serum with borreliacidal activity. The immune mouse serum had significantly higher levels of borreliacidal activity against HP1 and HT61, than against B31. Neutralization of borreliacidal activity with anti-IgM antibodies showed that the borreliacidal activity of anti-OspC-I antibodies in serum was due to IgM. Furthermore. mice vaccinated with OspC-I were protected against challenge with HPI and HT61. but not fully protected against infection with B31. These results suggest that OspC-I is not only a specific antigen for use in serodiagnostic tests for Lyme disease, but is also a potential candidate for a Lyme disease vaccine in Japan."

An efficacy trial of a Lyme disease vaccine had demonstrated safety and efficacy against definite (clinically manifested and laboratory-confirmed) Lyme disease after 3 doses at 0, 1, and 12 months and resulted in 90% of subjects having titers > or =1400 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EL.U)/mL (the proposed seroprotective level for 1 tick season). This multicenter, open-label, prospective, randomized study assessed the safety and efficacy of different doses of a recombinant outer-surface protein A (OspA) vaccine in 956 volunteers aged 17 to 72 years from 3 Lyme disease-endemic sites. Blood samples were collected at months 0, 2, 3, 12, and 13 to assess total immunoglobulin-G anti-OspA titers. Most adverse events were transient and mild to moderate. The geometric mean antibody titer increased 2.8-fold from month 2 (1786 EL.U/mL to 4842 EL.U/mL), and approximately 90% of the volunteers had a titer > or =1400 and 99% had a titer > or =400 EL.U/mL (the mini- mum seroprotective level at any given time) after the third dose. An antibody kinetics model predicts that protection would last for a typical tick-transmission season. In volunteers aged 17 to 72 years, 3 doses of vaccine administered in 2 months was well tolerated, more immunogenic than 2 doses, and provided a higher probability of protection before exposure or travel to Lyme disease-endemic areas."

The pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), persists in endemic areas through a maintenance cycle involving ticks and wild animals. The description of different genospecies associated with Lyme borreliosis in Europe has generated the question concerning the maintenance of these pathogens in nature: how do closely related bacterial species like B. burgdorferi sl circulate between one main tick species, Ixodes ricinus, and several vertebrate host species? Recent studies have provided evidence that specific associations exist in some areas between Borrelia species and vertebrate hosts. The present paper based on this recent knowledge discusses various aspects of the ecology of the disease in Western Europe, in particular the maintenance and dispersal of the pathogens, and brings up some interesting questions."

A prospective multicenter study was carried out in 55 children and adolescents with Lyme arthritis. There were significant differences between younger and older patients with pediatric Lyme arthritis. Younger patients were more likely to have fever at the onset of arthritis and to have acute or episodic arthritis. Older patients were more likely to have chronic arthritis, higher levels of IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi (by ELISA and immunoblot), and a longer interval between antibiotic treatment and the disappearance of arthritis. Of 51 patients followed for at least 12 months after initiation of antibiotic treatment, 24% retained manifestations of the disease including arthritis (8 patients) and arthralgias (4 patients). These patients were predominantly female (9/12) and were significantly older than patients without residual symptoms. Patients who had received intraarticular steroids prior to antibiotic treatment required significantly more courses of antibiotic treatment and the time required for disappearance of the arthritis was longer. Pediatric Lyme arthritis is more benign in younger children. Lyme arthritis should be excluded as a possible cause of arthritis prior to the administration of intraarticular steroids."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein (Osp) A has been used as a Lyme disease vaccine that blocks transmission: OspA antibodies of immune hosts enter ticks during blood feeding and destroy spirochetes before transmission to the host can occur. B. burgdorferi produce OspA in the gut of unfed Ixodes scapularis ticks, and many spirochetes repress OspA production during the feeding process. This preferential expression suggests that OspA may have an important function in the vector. Here we show that OspA mediates spirochete attachment to the tick gut by binding to an I. scapularis protein. The binding domains reside in the central region and COOH-terminus of OspA. OspA also binds to itself, suggesting that spirochete-spirochete interactions may further facilitate adherence in the gut. OspA-mediated attachment in the tick provides a possible mechanism for how stage-specific protein expression can contribute to pathogenesis during the B. burgdorferi natural cycle."

Significant (P<0.0001) differences in the liver uptake of L. interrogans and of B. burgdorferi were observed, the uptakes being 37.4%+/-2.3% for L. interrogans and 60.5%+/-3.1% for B. burgdorferi. Leptospires, in contrast to borreliae, were recovered from the livers when liver samples were cultured in growth medium. Leptospires but not borreliae were recovered in bile within 30 min of infusion. The association of leptospires and borreliae with reticuloendothelial cells of the liver was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Leptospires and borreliae were found to be associated with vimentin-positive cells and not with desmin-positive cells. Few leptospires but no borreliae were also seen associated with vimentin- and desmin-negative cells, suggesting the presence of leptospires outside the sinusoidal spaces, in the liver parenchyma."

This study examined the role of B cells in the absence of T cells during these events, using mice with selected immune dysfunctions. At 6 weeks postinfection, an interval at which arthritis resolves in immunocompetent mice, arthritis severity was equivalent among immunocompetent mice, alphabeta(+)-T-cell-deficient mice, and mice lacking both alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells. Arthritis severity was worse in SCID mice, which lack T and B lymphocytes. Carditis regressed in immunocompetent mice and those lacking both alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells but remained active in mice lacking only alphabeta(+) T cells and in SCID mice. Mice lacking only alphabeta(+) T cells and those lacking both alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells generated immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG3 B. burgdorferi-reactive antibodies. Sera from infected immunocompetent mice, mice lacking only alphabeta(+) T cells, and mice lacking both alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells passively protected naive mice against challenge inoculation with B. burgdorferi. However, only sera from infected immunocompetent mice, but not sera from infected T-cell-deficient mice, were able to resolve arthritis when passively transferred to actively infected SCID mice. These data demonstrate that B-cell activation during a T-cell-independent response may be critical for resolution of arthritis and carditis and that protective antibodies are generated during this response."

Sequence analyses of the B31 mlp genes and physically linked variant gene families indicated that mlp gene heterogeneity is unique and unrelated to location or linkage to divergent sequences. Evidence of recombination between B31 mlp alleles was also detected. Northern blot analysis of cultured strain B31 indicated that the mlp genes were not expressed at a temperature (23 degrees C) characteristic of that of ticks in the environment. In striking contrast, expression of many mlp genes increased substantially when strain B31 was shifted to 35 degrees C, a temperature change mimicking that occurring in the natural transmission cycle of the spirochete from tick to mammal. Primer extension analysis of the mlp mRNA transcripts suggested that sigma 70-like promoters are involved in mlp expression during temperature shift conditions. Antibodies were made against strain B31 Mlp proteins within the first 4 weeks after experimental mouse infection. Importantly, Lyme disease patients also had serum antibodies reactive with purified recombinant Mlp proteins from strain B31, a result indicating that humans are exposed to Mlp proteins during infection. Taken together, the data indicate that strain B31 mlp genes encode a diverse array of lipoproteins which may participate in early infection processes in the mammalian host."

Method 1 involved a sojourn of ticks on vertical plastic sticks and showed that the questing behaviour of I. ricinus nymphs was dependent on temperature and relative humidity (RH). A significantly greater number of nymphs quested at 22 degrees C and 100% RH than at 18 degrees C. When the humidity was reduced to 30% all of the nymphs departed. In the second method, the activity of ticks on an inclined \"ticksdrome\" was estimated. The activity of I. ricinus adults from the Danish population was 1.2 times greater than that of ticks from Russia. Females of the species studied and specimens from all study areas were more active than all other stages of development. The locomotor activity of both adult and immature I. ricinus that were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was suppressed when compared with uninfected specimens. The locomotor activity of I. persulcatus females infected by borreliae with exoskeleton anomalies was 1.3 times greater (P<0.05) than that of infected ticks without anomalies. Our data showed that infected females with exoskeleton anomalies could crawl faster on a human and reach uncovered parts of the body that are vulnerable for attachment and feeding. A study of locomotor activity and questing behaviour may be useful for comparing the risk for different tick species and populations to transmit tick-borne pathogens."

A 52-year-old female painter suffering from high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (stage IVB) was treated with a total of 4 mg of vincristine during two courses of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, prednisone). At onset of treatment no neurological problems were reported. There was good lymphoma response to chemotherapy. At the same time, however, the patient gradually developed dysphagia, dysarthria, muscular weakness of both lower and upper extremities, areflexia, paraesthesia of the fingertips and bilateral sensory impairment of feet and lower legs. These symptoms continually worsened over a period of seven weeks until she was unable to walk or to perform her work. Electrophysiological studies showed peripheral axonal and demyelinative sensorimotor neuropathy in correlation to histological findings. Molecular analysis revealed 17p11.2 duplication typical for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease IA. While continuing chemotherapy without the use of vincristine the patient's neurologic symptoms slowly recovered within six months.

For those patients with a clinical history or symptoms suggestive for CMT nerve conduction velocity studies and on an individual base even molecular genetic analysis are necessary to prevent serious neurologic complications. worsened significantly resulting in dependency on a wheelchair and inability to perform her work as a painter. Finally she consulted a neurologist and was admitted to hospital for further diagnostic studies and continuation of treatment for her lymphoma in March 1998 with a provisional diagnosis of severe vincristine-induced neuropathy. Medical history at time of admission included hyperthyroidism, that was currently treated with propylthiouracil, a MALT lymphoma 1983, that was treated surgically only, and a meningoencephalitis in 1968. No further medication was taken. In addition she had a history of Lyme disease since 1993 with positive IgM-titer until December 1997, when antibiotic therapy with doxycycline and ceftriaxone was administered successfully. Family history obtained on admission revealed that her mother had non-specific neuropathic symptoms as well as a poorly defined foot deformities of the mother's father.

The synovial tissue of 41 consecutive patients with various forms of arthritis was tested for the presence of viral DNA in a diagnosis-unaware fashion, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of all tested viruses, cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19 were positive (each in 10 patients, two double-positives), whereas herpes simplex virus was positive in two patients. Rubella virus RNA was detected in three specimens. When the positivity for viral material was analysed in terms of distribution among the various diagnostic groups, it became evident that five out of 10 parvovirus B 19-positive patients belonged to the undifferentiated arthritis group, whereas cytomegalovirus-positive patients were spread among all diagnostic groups. This indicates the possibility of a new diagnostic category of undifferentiated mono- and oligoarthritis, which can be identified by the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in synovial tissue."

The aim of this survey was to assess the prevalence of this disease in children from the Seine-Maritime and L'Eure, hospitalized in pediatric wards in the Seine-Maritime department, which includes Rouen, Dieppe, Fécamp, Elbeuf, and Le Havre. Fifteen cases of Lyme disease were diagnosed between September 1988 and June 1997. The children (6 girls and 9 boys) were aged between 5 and 14 years old. Only 7 subjects showed primary symptoms, while secondary symptoms were observed in 12 children. In the study population, a high prevalence (11 out of the 15 children) of neurological disorders was found. The following secondary symptoms were noted: 5 cases of erythema migrans, 2 cases of non-malignant cutaneous lymphocytoma, and 4 cases which in fact had previously displayed primary clinical signs (3 subjects with erythema migrans and 1 subject with non-malignant cutaneous lymphocytoma); 7 cases of uni- or bilateral facial paralysis, the most frequent neurological manifestation with or without lymphocytic meningitis; 1 case of central vestibular syndrome with a hyperalgesic meningoradicular reaction in the vicinity of the tick bite; 1 case of peripheral radicular involvement and intense pain in the left lower limb; 4 cases of ocular disorders (3 diplopias, 1 bilateral conjunctivitis complicated by kerato-uveitis, 1 bilateral complete cecitis). Only 10 child had rheumatological symptoms, i.e., Lyme arthritis of the right knee. Treatment consisted of amoxicillin (10 children) administered at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/kg/d over a period ranging from 10 days to 1 month, or ceftriaxone (7 children) at a dosage of 50 to 100 mg/kg/d administered intravenously over a period ranging from 8 days to 3 weeks.

Out of 340 patients, 13 (3.8%) proved to be B. burgdorferi positive, while 9 (2.6%) were found to have Lyme disease with seroprevalence being higher in these latter than that of blood donors from Central Italy. Our results indicate that Lyme borreliosis is present in Central Italy.

		"abstract": "Decorin-binding lipoprotein, lpp-DBP, a bacterial surface adhesin, shows promise as a vaccine against Lyme disease. It is expressed in recombinant E. coli as an undesirable 20.5 KDa apoprotein that is subsequently lipidated in vivo to the desired 22 KDa lpp-DBP form. This study defines fermentation conditions for maximizing lpp-DBP yield. Super broth medium, a low post-induction temperature (30 degrees C), and a glucose feed based on dissolved oxygen resulted in high lpp-DBP yield and minimized apoprotein formation. Since cells lysed within 2-3 h after induction, the cell yield was maximized by growing cells to high cell density prior to induction. Compared to a glucose feed based on maintaining a constant fermentor glucose concentration (Glucose-Stat), feeding based on maintaining a constant dissolved oxygen level (DO-Stat) improved yields. Also, a dissolved oxygen level of 60% (air saturation) was best, as no product degradation was detected by Western blotting and SDS-PAGE. Acetic acid levels under both modes of glucose feed were sufficiently low, and no adverse growth effects were observed."

		"abstract": "The success of organ-replacement therapies has resulted in a population of chronically immunosuppressed but active people who experience increased vulnerability to tick-borne zoonoses. Several of these infections may be life threatening. Human babesiosis is an emerging zoonosis that is transmitted by the same tick that transmits Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. We briefly review these zoonoses and present a case of a renal transplant recipient who survived infection by Babesia microti contracted through blood transfusion. A recipient of a living-related renal transplant developed acute postoperative hemolytic anemia. The etiology of this anemia was diagnosed by peripheral red blood cell smear as Babesia microti. The patient was managed by a reduction in transplant immunosuppressive therapy and administration of clindamycin and quinine antimicrobials. Transplant patients may contract babesiosis after tick exposure and/or via blood transfusion. The diagnosis of babesiosis may be confused with malaria and should be included in the differential diagnosis of posttransplant hemolytic-uremic syndrome in organ transplant patients."

		"abstract": "Borrelia valaisiana is a recently described bacterial species in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. To further characterize this bacterium, the plasmid-encoded ospA genes from eight B. valaisiana isolates were amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. All B. valaisiana isolates studied possessed an ospA gene with a size of 822-825 bp. The identity of the predicted amino acid sequences of the OspA proteins among B. valaisiana isolates was 69.1-100%, and ranged from 68.2 to 79.1% between B. valaisiana and other B. burgdorferi sensu lato species. Based on the OspA protein sequences, the eight B. valaisiana isolates could be distinguished into two subgroups. Subgroup I contained six B. valaisiana isolates of which OspA sequences were almost identical, but clearly differed from other LB spirochetes. Subgroup II consisted of two isolates with identical OspA sequences which were only 70% identical to subgroup I B. valaisiana isolates and similarly distant from the OspA sequences of other B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that B. valaisiana isolates belonging to subgroups I and II possibly evolved from two distinct ancestors. Our data showed for the first time a major difference in OspA proteins within a well-defined B. burgdorferi sensu lato species at the evolutionary level, suggesting that it is not always reliable to assign Borrelia isolates to a definite species solely based on data from ospA gene sequence analysis."

		"abstract": "A novel automated approach for the sequence specific NMR assignments of 1HN, 13Calpha, 13Cbeta, 13C'/1Halpha and 15N spins in proteins, using triple resonance experimental data, is presented. The algorithm, TATAPRO (Tracked AuTomated Assignments in Proteins) utilizes the protein primary sequence and peak lists from a set of triple resonance spectra which correlate 1HN and 15N chemical shifts with those of 13Calpha, 13Cbeta and 13C'/1Halpha. The information derived from such correlations is used to create a 'master-_list' consisting of all possible sets of 1HN(i), 15N(i)13Calpha(i),13Cbeta(i) 13C'beta(i)/1Halpha(i), 13Calpha(i-1), 13Cbeta(i-1) and 13C'(i-1)/1Halpha(i-1) chemical shifts. On the basis of an extensive statistical analysis of 13Calpha and 13Cbeta chemical shift data of proteins derived from the BioMagResBank (BMRB), it is shown that the 20 amino acid residues can be grouped into eight distinct categories, each of which is assigned a unique two-digit code. Such a code is used to tag individual sets of chemical shifts in the master_list and also to translate the protein primary sequence into an array called pps_array. The program then uses the master_list to search for neighbouring partners of a given amino acid residue along the polypeptide chain and sequentially assigns a maximum possible stretch of residues on either side. While doing so. each assigned residue is tracked in an array called assig_array, with the two-digit code assigned earlier. The assig_array is then mapped onto the pps_array for sequence specific resonance assignment. The program has been tested using experimental data on a calcium binding protein from Entamoeba histolytica (Eh-CaBP, 15 kDa) having substantial internal sequence homology and using published data on four other proteins in the molecular weight range of 18-42 kDa. In all the cases, nearly complete sequence specific resonance assignments (> 95%) are obtained. Furthermore, the reliability of the program has been tested by deleting sets of chemical shifts randomly from the master_list created for the test proteins."

The mortality rate for menstrual staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome has decreased with early recognition and treatment, and removal of hyperabsorbent tampons from the market. Kawasaki syndrome (KS) is the most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the U. S., and atypical forms have a higher mortality rate than typical KS. Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a zoonosis with an 80% mortality rate if the diagnosis is not made on first presentation and patients return to the hospital in shock. Children and adolescents with Lyme disease have an excellent prognosis and respond well to antimicrobial therapy. Cat scratch disease (CSD) is caused by Bartonella henselae and is transmitted by flea-infested kittens. CSD lymphadenopathy typically resolves spontaneously in 2ñ3 months; however, there is a 50% likelihood of resolution in 1 month if patients receive a 5-day treatment course with azithromycin."

We investigated the incidence of coinfection among rodents with the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE). aoHGE was detected in 23.5% of 119 rodent spleens examined. Biopsy results indicated that 78 (65.5%) of the 119 rodents were positive for B. burgdorferi, whereas 22 (78.5%) of the 28 animals that harbored aoHGE were also infected with B. burgdorferi. In 14 of 25 I. spinipalpis tick pools, aoHGE was detected by amplifying both the 16s rRNA and p44 gene of aoHGE. The ability of I. spinipalpis to transmit aoHGE was examined in C3H/HeJ mice. aoHGE was detected in their blood 5 days after I. spinipalpis infestation. This study confirms that both B. burgdorferi and aoHGE can be transmitted by I. spinipalpis ticks and that there is a high incidence of coinfection in rodents, predominantly Peromyscus maniculatus and N. mexicana, that inhabit the foothills of northern Colorado."

Indirect immunofluorescent test was used to find out the tieter of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in all groups by using the endemic strains as antigens, which has caused a higher value of the so-called cut-off. The negative control had a positive titer in 44 cases (n = 131, i.e. in 33.6%). The positive titer was found in 11 probands from the SC group (34.4% =, n = 32), 5 probands in LSA (71.4%, n = 7), 9 probands in the EN group (64.3%, n = 14), 6 probands in the EA and GA groups (42.3%, n = 14) and 19 probands in the group of urticaria chronica (33.3%, n = 57). We assume that in the probands with high titers of antibodies, B. burgdorferi could play a role in the etiology of the given diseases titers of antibodies against B. burgdorferi. The draft problem could be solved by modern method including PCR with the use of several primers focused on different antigens regarding the certain epidemiologic regions. (Fig. 7, Ref. 17.)"

The overall trend has been an average annual increase in cases since surveillance was initiated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1982. To date, 10 different Borrelia species have been described within the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, although only Borrelia burgdorferi sensu strico, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia afzelii have been associated with human disease. Ixodes ticks often carry more than one potential pathogen, and co-infection with B. burgdorferi and other organisms have been reported. Recent findings suggested that maintenance cycles of other tick-borne pathogens may be different than those for B. burgdorferi. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis has provided clues about the mechanisms responsible for variation in clinical expression of the disease. Results of therapeutic trials in Lyme neuroborreliosis are likely to have an impact upon treatment recommendations. A long term follow-up study of children treated for LD indicated that the prognosis is excellent in most cases. A safe vaccine for the prevention of LD has been approved in adults. Preliminary data suggested that the vaccine is safe and immunogenic in children."

Advances from genetic cloning have improved our understanding of the immune mechanisms associated with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis and enabled the development of the first Lyme disease vaccine.

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Nonhuman primates inoculated with the N40 strain of B. burgdorferi develop infection of multiple tissues, including the central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system. In immunocompetent nonhuman primates, spirochetes are present in low numbers in tissues. For this reason, it has been difficult to study their localization and changes in expression of surface proteins. To further investigate this, we inoculated four immunosuppressed adult Macaca mulatta with 1 million spirochetes of the N40 strain of B. burgdorferi, and compared them with three infected immunocompetent animals and two uninfected controls. The brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, skeletal muscle, heart, and bladder were obtained at necropsy 4 months later. The spirochetal tissue load was first studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ELISA of the outer surface protein A (ospA) gene. Immunohistochemistry was used to study the localization and numbers of spirochetes in tissues and the expression of spirochetal proteins and to characterize the inflammatory response. Hematoxylin and eosin and trichrome stains were used to study inflammation and tissue injury. The results showed that the number of spirochetes was significantly higher in immunosuppressed animals. B. burgdorferi in the CNS localized to the leptomeninges, nerve roots, and dorsal root ganglia, but not to the parenchyma. Outside of the CNS, B. burgdorferi localized to endoneurium and to connective tissues of peripheral nerves, skeletal muscle, heart, aorta, and bladder. Although ospA, ospB, ospC, and flagellin were present at the time of inoculation, only flagellin was expressed by spirochetes in tissues 4 months later. Significant inflammation occurred only in the heart, and only immunosuppressed animals had cardiac fiber degeneration and necrosis. Plasma cells were abundant in inflammatory foci of steroid-treated animals. We concluded that B. burgdorferi has a tropism for the meninges in the CNS and for connective tissues elsewhere in the body."

		"abstract": "Both genetic resistance and susceptibility to development of experimental Lyme arthritis are mediated by the innate immune response. To determine whether this process is mainly controlled by hemopoietic or nonhemopoietic cells, we created bone marrow (BM) chimeric mice between arthritis-resistant DBA/2J (DBA) and arthritis-susceptible C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice and infected them with Borrelia burgdorferi. Both sets of BM chimeric mice, C3H donors into DBA recipients (C-->D) and DBA donors into C3H recipients (D-->C), as well as DBA sham chimeric mice (D-->D) were resistant to the development of experimental Lyme arthritis as measured by ankle swelling and arthritis severity scores. Only the C3H sham chimeric mice (C-->C) developed severe arthritis. These results indicate that independent and nonoverlapping mechanisms exist in hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cellular compartments that can provide protection against arthritic pathology."

In the present study, DbpA-immunized C3H/HeJ mice were not protected from infection when infested with Ixodes scapularis nymphs harboring virulent B. burgdorferi 297. This lack of protection correlated with the failure to detect DbpA on B. burgdorferi in ticks, suggesting that DbpA is not available as a target for bactericidal antibodies in serum when B. burgdorferi-infected ticks take their blood meal from an immunized host. The failure of DbpA immunization to protect tick-challenged mice contradicts the results of earlier needle inoculation vaccination experiments and suggests that DbpA may not be suitable as a Lyme disease vaccine."

		"abstract": "The bdr (Borrelia direct repeat) gene family of the genus Borrelia encodes a polymorphic group of proteins that carry a central repeat motif region containing putative phosphorylation sites and a hydrophobic carboxyl-terminal domain. It has been postulated that the Bdr proteins may anchor to the inner membrane via the C-terminal domain. In this study, we used cellular fractionation methodologies, salt and detergent treatments, and immunoblot analyses to assess the association of the Bdr proteins with the cellular infrastructure in both Borrelia burgdorferi (a Lyme disease spirochete) and B. turicatae (a relapsing fever spirochete). Triton X-114 extraction and partitioning experiments demonstrated that most Bdr paralogs are associated with the inner membrane-peptidoglycan complex. Analyses of cells treated with the highly chaotropic bile salt detergent deoxycholic acid demonstrated that some Bdr paralogs may also interact with the peptidoglycan, as evidenced by their tight association with the insoluble cellular matrix. In addition, immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments revealed an enhanced IP of all Bdr paralogs when the cell lysates were boiled prior to addition of the precipitating antibody. Furthermore, some Bdr paralogs were accessible to antibody in the IP experiments only in the boiled cell lysates. These observations suggest that different Bdr paralogs may carry out different structural-functional roles. Demonstration of the inner membrane localization of the Bdr proteins and of the differences in nature of the interaction of individual Bdr paralogs with the cell infrastructure is an important step toward defining the functional role of this unique protein family in the genus Borrelia."

We also measured IgG2a anti-borrelial antibodies and total IgE in these mice. Results showed that BALB/c mice developed a Th2 immune response against B. burgdorferi after tick inoculation and a mixed Th1/Th2 response after syringe inoculation of B. burgdorferi. IL-4 deficient mice produced a Th1 immune response in both cases.

Three molecular methods were used: an outer surface membrane protein A (OSP A) gene polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to give different molecular weight products with different genomic groups, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene PCRs using genomic group specific primers. All of the molecular methods used were quick and easy to perform and capable of differentiating between the different genomic groups of B burgdorferi sensu lato. All 12 tick isolates were characterised successfully with each method: five were characterised as B afzelii and seven were characterised as B burgdorferi sensu stricto. RAPD also identified differences within these genomic groups. From this study, it is now known that at least two different B burgdorferi sensu lato genomic groups are present in the Highlands of Scotland: B afzelii and B burgdorferi sensu stricto. This information can now be used to develop appropriate serological tests, which should improve the diagnosis and management of patients with Lyme disease in Scotland. The molecular methods chosen were found to be useful typing tools and will allow rapid identification of any future isolates."

We found that 56.9% (562 of 1,077) of the samples were positive by ELISA and 82.0% (461 of 562) were positive by immunoblotting. A logistic regression model was developed to distinguish between nonvaccinated dogs naturally infected with B. burgdorferi from areas where the disease is endemic and dogs from areas where the disease is nonendemic that were vaccinated against Lyme disease. Of the 18 protein bands analyzed, 8 were found to be significantly different (P<0.05) between the two groups. p93, p34, p31, and p28 occurred with increased frequency in vaccinated dogs, while p58, p37, p35, and p30 occurred more frequently in naturally infected dogs. The logistic regression equation obtained was used to determine the probability of natural infection among vaccinated dogs residing in areas where the disease is endemic. Of 125 samples, 87.2% had a very low probability of natural infection and only 2.4% were highly likely to be infected. Logistic regression is a useful method for distinguishing between vaccinated and naturally infected dogs and predicting the serological status of vaccinated dogs from areas where Lyme disease is endemic."

		"abstract": "In an area where Lyme disease is endemic in The Netherlands all dogs had positive titers by whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and appeared to be naturally infected by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. To compare the antibody responses of symptomatic dogs and asymptomatic controls, we performed Western blots and in vitro immobilization assays to study antibody-dependent bactericidal activity. Strains from three different genospecies were employed as the antigen source: B. burgdorferi strain B31, Borrelia garinii strain A87S, and Borrelia afzelii strain pKo. Antibodies against flagellin (p41) and p39 for three strains were found in sera from both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs and were therefore considered to be markers of exposure. Antibodies against p56 and p30 of strain B31, against p75, p58, p50, OspC, and p<19 of strain A87S, and against p56, p54, p45, OspB, p31, p26, and p<19 of strain pKo were found significantly more frequently in sera from symptomatic dogs younger than 8 years when the first symptoms were observed than in those from age-matched controls (P<0.01). These antibodies were not found in preclinical sera and appeared during development of disease. Antibodies against OspA of strains B31 and A87S were only seen in acute-phase and convalescent sera from three dogs that recovered from disease. Incubation with 25% normal canine serum did not result in the immobilization of strains B31 and pKo, but partial immobilization of strain A87S (61%+/-24% [standard deviation] at 5 h) occurred. Seven of 15 sera from symptomatic dogs but none of the sera from 11 asymptomatic dogs had antibody-dependent immobilizing activity against one of the strains. Consecutive sera from one of these dogs immobilized two different strains. Antibody-mediated bactericidal serum was not seen before onset of disease, was strongest in the acute phase of disease, and fluctuated during chronic disease. From seven out of eight symptomatic dogs Borrelia DNA was amplified by PCR; in three of them the bactericidal activity was directed against one of the genospecies amplified from that dog; however, four PCR-positive dogs lacked bactericidal activity. In conclusion, dogs with symptomatic canine borreliosis have more-extensive antibody reactivity against Borrelia, as shown by both Western blotting and immobilization assays."

Deduced amino acid sequences of amplified rpoB DNA comprised 109 amino acid residues (N(450) to M(558) [Escherichia coli numbering]). All amino acid sequences were identical with the exception of those of Borrelia lusitaniae PotiB2 (T(461)-->A) and B. bissettii DN127 (I(498)-->V). Each species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato was differentiated as a distinct entity in the phylogenetic tree constructed by a neighbor-joining method. B. burgdorferi sensu lato could be distinguished from B. turicatae and B. hermsii, which are associated with relapsing fever. Seventeen Korean isolates could be identified by PCR-linked direct sequencing and restriction analysis of the rpoB DNA. These results suggest that rpoB DNA is useful for identification and characterization of Borrelia. In addition, we developed the rapid species identification method using the species-specific primer sets based on rpoB gene sequences."

To help solve these problems, we constructed a library of recombinant chimeric proteins composed of portions of key antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi. These proteins were then used to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We compared our assay with the most sensitive of three whole-cell borrelia assays. We found that the recombinant assay could detect antibodies significantly better from early Lyme disease sera (P<0.05), and had the same sensitivity for late Lyme disease sera, as the most sensitive whole-cell borrelia assay. On potentially cross-reactive sera, the recombinant assay was more specific, but not significantly so, than the best whole-cell borrelia assay. Optimization of the recombinant assay offers the potential for a significant improvement in both sensitivity and specificity."

Eighteen dogs were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups (n = 6): (1) 65% permethrin, (2) 9.7% fipronil, or (3) untreated control. Dogs were exposed to ticks in individually assigned cages with a carpet that covered =70% of the cage bottom. Dogs in treatment groups 1 and 2 were treated in accordance with label directions for each re-spective product on study day 0. Fifty unfed, male and female adult ticks were placed in the cages 15 to 30 minutes before the dogs. The dogs were placed in the cages for a 2-hour exposure period at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment. After a 2-hour exposure period, dogs were removed from the cages and live (attached and unattached) and dead ticks were counted on the dogs, on the carpets, and in the cages. Cages were thoroughly cleaned and new carpet was used for each tick exposure period. Treatment of dogs with 65% permethrin reduced tick numbers on dogs by 99.1% at 2 days, 99.0% at 1 week, 95.9% at 2 weeks, 88.5% at 3 weeks, 87.1% at 4 weeks, and 48.0% at 6 weeks after application. In contrast, treatment of dogs with 9.7% fipronil reduced tick numbers on dogs by 61.4% at 2 days, 51.6% at 1 week, 37.0% at 2 weeks, 33.7% at 3 weeks, 10.8% at 4 weeks, and 0% at 6 weeks after application. The efficacy of 65% permethrin was significant (P < or = .05) when compared to the control at all challenges, whereas the efficacy of 9.7% fipronil was not significant as compared to controls at 21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin killed significantly more Ixodes ricinus ticks (P < or = .05) than 9.7% fipronil from 2 to 41 days after treatment. The 65% permethrin repelled 1.9-, 2.0-, 3.0-, 43.3-, 3.9-, 8.9-, and 17.3-fold more Ixodes ricinus than did 9.7% fipronil at 2, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 41 days after treatment, respectively, and all differences in repellency were significant (P < or = .05)."

Two further children who presented with acute hemiparesis as a result of cerebral ischaemic infarction had a cerebrovascular course of neuroborreliosis. One was a 15 year old girl; the other, a 5 year old boy, is to our knowledge the youngest patient described with this course of illness. Following adequate antibiotic treatment, all patients showed substantial improvement of their respective symptoms.

Among patients with mixed infection, cases with blurred TBE predominated; severe forms (meningeal and focal) were almost two times less incident than in TBE monoinfection. Typical clinical symptoms of LB were observed in 63.5% patients, while in the rest 36.5% LB manifested only by circulation of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Comparative analysis of patients with mixed TBE + LB infection and TBE monoinfection confirmed a more benign course of TBE during the acute period in patients with mixed infection. Mixed infection should be ruled out or confirmed by thorough clinical examinations with obligatory detection of antibodies to agents of both diseases."

Murine splenocytes previously sensitized to B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l. ), but not those from control mice, could be induced for antigen-specific proliferation in vitro. Moreover, detectable cell-mediated response could be induced only with antigen preparations derived from a corresponding strain but not with those obtained from other Borrelia genospecies as revealed by the [(3)H]thymidine incorporation assay. The current study considers that the strict B. burgdorferi s.l. antigen-specific response may also be expected in infections in humans and contributes to the explanation of the frequently poor antibody- and cell-mediated immune response observed in patients diagnosed with Lyme disease."

After exposure to either the unaltered vaccine preparation or OspA prepared in saline, normal lymphocyte responses to the mitogens concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin-M or pokeweed mitogen, or the antigen BCG were consistently reduced. Whole cell extracts of B. burgdorferi also modulated immune responses but required a much greater quantity of protein than needed for the OspA preparation. The magnitude of modulation was directly dependent on the quantity of OspA. OspA interferes with the response of lymphocytes to proliferative stimuli including a blocking of cell cycle phase progression. Future studies designed to delete the particular region or component of the OspA molecule responsible for this effect may lead to improved vaccine preparations."

To describe the outcome of patients with EM who were treated with cephalexin. Patients presenting with EM to the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center in Westchester, NY (May 1992-September 1997). A 2-mm punch biopsy specimen of the leading edge of the EM lesion and/or blood was cultured for Borrelia burgdorferi. Eleven (2.8%) of 393 study patients had been initially treated with cephalexin prior to our evaluation; 9 (82%) were originally diagnosed with cellulitis. Cephalexin was administered for 8.6 days (range, 2-21 days) prior to presentation. All 11 patients had clinical evidence of disease progression, including 8 whose rash enlarged, 2 who developed seventh-nerve palsy (1 with new EM lesions), and 1 who developed new EM lesions. Borrelia burgdorferi grew in cultures from 5 patients despite a mean of 9.8 days of treatment with cephalexin (range, 5-21 days). Cephalexin should not be used to treat early Lyme disease and should be prescribed with caution during the summer months for patients believed to have cellulitis in locations where Lyme disease is endemic."

Our group reported the first case of Lyme Borreliosis in Italy in 1985. Italian Group for Lyme Borreliosis has recently reported the epidemiology of Lyme disease in Italy. The epidemiological data seem to underestimate the prevalence of Lyme arthritis in Italy. The pattern of articular involvement is most often mono- or oligoarthritis with polyarticular arthralgias and frequently needs laboratory confirmation. In this study, some clinical observations of Lyme Borreliosis occurred in the last year are reported. Analysis of the B. burgdorferi immune response by ELISA and Western Blot techniques has the potential to support or exclude a diagnosis of early stage as well as active LD infection was associated with Polymerase Chain Reaction assay based on amplification of the DNA of B. burgdorferi. When the direct evidence of spirochaeta in tissues is lacking, this approach permits the best evaluation of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "In this study, infection-derived immunity in the rabbit model of Lyme disease was compared to immunity following immunization with purified outer membrane vesicles (OMV) isolated from Borrelia burgdorferi and recombinant outer surface protein A (OspA). Immunization of rabbits with OMV isolated from virulent strain B31 and its avirulent derivative B313 (lacking OspA and DbpA) conferred highly significant protection against intradermal injection with 6 x 10(4) in vitro-cultivated virulent B. burgdorferi. This is the first demonstration of protective immunogenicity induced by OMV. While immunization with OspA and avirulent B31 OMV provided far less protection against this challenge, rabbits with infection-derived immunity were completely protected. Protection against host-adapted B. burgdorferi was assessed by implantation of skin biopsies taken from rabbit erythema migrans (a uniquely rich source of B. burgdorferi in vertebrate tissue) containing up to 10(8) spirochetes. While all of the OMV- and OspA-immunized rabbits were fully susceptible to skin and disseminated infection, rabbits with infection-derived immunity were completely protected. Analysis of the antibody responses to outer membrane proteins, including DbpA, OspA, and OspC, suggests that the remarkable protection exhibited by the infection-immune rabbits is due to antibodies directed at antigens unique to or markedly up-regulated in host-adapted B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "A 37-kDa protein from Borrelia burgdorferi (the agent of Lyme disease) was identified as a target for immune-mediated resolution of Lyme arthritis. Studies in a mouse model have shown that arthritis resolution can be mediated by antibodies (against unknown target antigens) within immune sera from actively infected mice. Immune sera from infected mice were therefore used to screen a B. burgdorferi genomic expression library. A gene was identified whose native product is a putative lipoprotein of approximately 37 kDa, referred to here as arthritis-related protein (Arp). Active and passive immunization of mice with recombinant Arp or Arp antiserum, respectively, did not protect mice from challenge inoculation. However, when Arp antiserum was administered to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice with established infections and with ongoing arthritis and carditis, treatment selectively induced arthritis resolution without affecting the status of carditis or influencing the status of infection, including spirochetemia. The selective arthritis-resolving effect of Arp antiserum mimics the activity of immune serum from immunocompetent mice when such serum is transferred into SCID mice with established infections. The arp gene could not be amplified from unrelated B. burgdorferi isolates but hybridized with those isolates only under very-low-stringency conditions. Arp antiserum reacted against proteins of similar size in a wide range of B. burgdorferi isolates."

		"abstract": "Borrelia hermsii, an agent of tick-borne relapsing fever, was found to contain multiple circular plasmids approximately 30 kb in size. Sequencing of a DNA library constructed from circular plasmid fragments enabled assembly of a composite DNA sequence that is homologous to the cp32 plasmid family of the Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi. Analysis of another relapsing fever bacterium, B. parkeri, indicated that it contains linear homologs of the B. hermsii and B. burgdorferi cp32 plasmids. The B. hermsii cp32 plasmids encode homologs of the B. burgdorferi Mlp and Bdr antigenic proteins and BlyA/BlyB putative hemolysins, but homologs of B. burgdorferi erp genes were absent. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that relapsing fever patients produced antibodies to Mlp proteins, indicating that those proteins are synthesized by the spirochetes during human infection. Conservation of cp32-encoded genes in different Borrelia species suggests that their protein products serve functions essential to both relapsing fever and Lyme disease spirochetes. Relapsing fever borreliae replicate to high levels in the blood of infected animals, permitting direct detection and possible functional studies of Mlp, Bdr, BlyA/BlyB, and other cp32-encoded proteins in vivo."

In the present study the effectiveness of 12 antimicrobials, belonging to six different antibiotic classes have been tested against Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. (N=3), Borrelia garinii (N=3), Borrelia afzelii (N=3), Borrelia valaisiana (N=1), and Borrelia bissettii (N=1) isolates. These isolates were analysed by a new standardised colorimetric minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) method based upon colour changes that result from actively metabolizing spirochaetes after 72 h of incubation. Piperacillin (MIC90: 0.08 mg/l), ceftriaxone (MIC90: 0. 04 mg/l), cefotaxime (MIC90: 0.15 mg/l), azithromycin (MIC90: 0.015 mg/l), roxithromycin (MIC90: 0.05 mg/l) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90: 0.12 mg/l) gave the lowest MIC values. Minimal inhibibitory activity of amoxycillin (MIC90: 1.04 mg/l), cefixime (MIC90: 1.33 mg/l), cefoperazone (MIC90: 0.83 mg/l) tetracycline (MIC90: 0.29 mg/l) and minocycline (MIC90: 0.30 mg/l) was slightly lower, whereas borrelia were resistant to amikacin (MIC90: >128 mg/l). Mean minimal borreliacidal concentrations (MBCs) were representatively determined for piperacillin (MBC: 1.8 mg/l), ceftriaxone (MBC: 2.0 mg/l), azithromycin (MBC: 0.82 mg/ml), roxithromycin (MBC: 1.8 mg/l), quinupristin/dalfopristin (MBC: 5.0 mg/l), minocycline (MBC: 5.8 mg/l), and amikacin (MBC: >128 mg/l) by using conventional subculture for three weeks in combination with dark-field microscopy. B. garinii proved to be the most susceptible of the genospecies tested. Our study showed excellent in vitro antimicrobial activity of all classes of antibiotics tested, except the aminoglycosides and hence their suitability for therapy of Lyme disease."

Rather than a mutation in vivo, these findings suggested a mixed infection in which BORRELIA: containing the wild-type and mutant ospA were waxing and waning in the patient's joint. If so, we reasoned that the mutant should be present in the community. We therefore took the novel epitope resulting from the mutation, expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, and performed Western blots on 80 high-titred stored sera; however, all except that of our index patient were negative. We then collected 36 stored sera from patients with Lyme disease residing within 10 miles of where the index patient had lived. An additional two sera from this circumscribed area were positive (P = 0.038). These findings show that results from single samples can be misleading, and suggest that the OspAs expressed in force late in Lyme arthritis are the same ones introduced initially into the host. Moreover, they allow a speculative mechanism for disease persistence not previously considered, in which antigenically distinct B. burgdorferi variant proteins present themselves serially to the immune system."

In the present study, the remaining conserved IRs (IR(2) to IR(5)) were investigated. Antisera to synthetic peptides based on each of the IR(2) to IR(5) sequences were produced in rabbits. Antipeptide antibody titers were similarly high in all antisera. Native VlsE was immunoprecipitable with antibodies to IR(2), IR(4), and IR(5) but not to IR(3), indicating that the first three sequences were exposed at the VlsE surface.

The antibody detection was made by an indirect immunofluorescence method and confirmed by a haemagglutination test. Seventeen dogs (11.6%) were seropositive, of which seven were hunting dogs, three were shepherd dogs, five were domestic pets, one was a watchdog and one was a stray dog. Seven dogs had longhair phenotype, 2 medium length type, 4 hard-hair and the other 4 were short-haired. Twelve seropositive dogs were males and five were females. All seropositive dogs were more than 1 year old. The dogs with greater seroprevalence were those that harboured ticks more often than the rest. Spring and summer were the seasons when more ticks were observed. The seroprevalence found in dogs was similar to that previously obtained in humans in this area. This finding gave evidence to an intimate association between human and canine seroprevalence."

Cell transfer experiments using infected B6-Rag1 knock out mice demonstrated that: 1) innate immunity mediated the initial sequelae of infection, 2) transferring both naive T cells and B cells induced resolution of carditis and arthritis, 3) infected mice reconstituted with T cells developed myocarditis and severe destructive arthritis, and 4) CD4+ T cells were responsible for the observed immune-mediated pathology.

Suitable material for the detection of the pathogen are various body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, joint fluid) and biopsy material (in particular skin). Antibodies are usually detected in the serum. Negative serology does not exclude an early manifestation, and a positive finding is no proof of a clinically manifest infection--it may simply reflect an earlier Lyme infection."

		"abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in molecular technology, most significantly the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, have allowed the detection of genetic variation in bacterial communities without prior cultivation. These methods often produce data in the form of the presence or absence of alleles or genotypes, however, rather than counts of alleles. Using relative allele frequencies from presence-absence data as estimates of population allele frequencies tends to underestimate the frequencies of common alleles and overestimate those of rare ones, potentially biasing the results of a test of neutrality in favor of balancing selection. In this study, a maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) of bacterial allele frequencies designed for use with presence-absence data is derived using an explicit stochastic model of the host infection (or bacterial sampling) process. The performance of the MLE is evaluated using computer simulation and a method is presented for evaluating the fit of estimated allele frequencies to the neutral infinite alleles model (IAM). The methods are applied to estimate allele frequencies at two outer surface protein loci (ospA and ospC) of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, infecting local populations of deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and to test the fit to a neutral IAM."

Thereafter, 25 tissue samples of each dog were collected for further analysis. Starting at day 120 after tick challenge, 12 dogs were treated with antibiotics (azithromycin, ceftriaxone, or doxycycline) for 30 consecutive days. Four dogs received no antibiotic therapy. Quantification of B. burgdorferi DNA was done with an ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System with oligonucleotide primers and a fluorescence-labeled probe designed to specifically amplify a fragment of the ospA gene of B. burgdorferi strain N40. All 16 dogs became infected with B. burgdorferi after tick challenge. In skin biopsy samples, spirochete numbers peaked at day 60 postinfection (<1.5 x 10(6) organisms per 100 microgram of extracted DNA), at the same time when clinical signs of arthritis developed in 11 of 16 dogs, and decreased to almost undetectable levels during the following 6 months. The number of B. burgdorferi organisms detected in skin biopsy samples was inversely correlated with the antibody levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Antibiotic treatment reduced the amount of detectable spirochete DNA in skin tissue by a factor of 1,000 or more. At the end of the experiment, B. burgdorferi DNA was detectable at low levels (10(2) to 10(4) organisms per 100 microgram of extracted DNA) in multiple tissue samples regardless of treatment. However, more tissue samples of untreated dogs than of antibiotic-treated dogs were positive, and tissue samples of untreated dogs also were positive by culture. Only 1.6% of 576 blood samples of all dogs were positive for B. burgdorferi by PCR."

Six laboratories used different immunoblot methods, and a wide range of bands was detected in all the assays. Multivariable logistic regression analysis of data from individual laboratories was used to determine the most discriminatory bands for reliable detection of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. These bands were used to construct individual interpretation rules for the immunoblots used in the six laboratories. Further analysis identified a subset of eight bands, which were important in all the laboratories, although with variations in significance. Possible European rules, all closely related, were formulated from these bands, although there was no single rule that gave high levels of sensitivity and specificity for all the laboratories. This is a reflection of the wide range of methodologies used, especially the use of different species and strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The panel of European rules provides a framework for immunoblot interpretation which may be adapted in relation to the characteristics of Lyme borreliosis in local areas."

Surprisingly, the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi has bypassed this host defense by eliminating the need for iron. B. burgdorferi grew normally and did not alter gene expression in the presence of iron chelators. Furthermore, typical bacterial iron-containing proteins were not detected in cell lysates, nor were the genes encoding such proteins identified in the genome sequence. The intracellular concentration of iron in B. burgdorferi was estimated to be less than 10 atoms per cell, well below a physiologically relevant concentration."

It is focally endemic in temperature climates of the northern hemisphere. Primary erythema migrans occurs at the site of inoculation. Secondary erythema migrans occurs at sites of hematogenous dissemination. Variations in genospecies account for variations in presentation, including borrelial lymphocytoma. Disseminated disease includes constitutional signs and symptoms, intermittent oligoarticular arthritis, meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculoneuropathy, encephalopathy, atrioventricular block, and myopericarditis. Late persistent disease includes acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, chronic arthritis, neurological impairment, and fatigue. There can be difficulties with both clinical and laboratory diagnosis. First-line oral therapies for early uncomplicated disease are doxycycline and amoxicillin. First-line intravenous therapy for complicated or resistant disease is ceftriaxone. Prevention includes avoiding tick habitats, dressing sensibly, judicious use of repellants, and early removal of imbedded ticks. Vaccination is indicated only for frequent or prolonged exposure to tick-infested habitat."

Higher levels of serum aminotransferases were a major manifestation of Lyme hepatitis in the Sverdlovsk region. In 32 patients, ALT was increased, on the average, up to 176 U/l, and AST activity was up to 113 U/l within the first 2 weeks of the disease in the absence of clinical manifestations of hepatic and biliary diseases. There were changes in the levels of serum transaminases and bilirubin following 3- and 8-month antibiotic therapy.

Bb is unable to recycle synthesized membrane lipids and lipoproteins. Consequently, a large amount of liposome-like vesicle (Bb-blebs) is shed from the outer bacterial membrane. The influence of Bb-blebs on the cellular immune response is not yet known. As a Bb-blebs model, we established standardized Bb-liposomes, produced from freshly extracted lipids and lipoproteins of live Bb. Bb-liposomes were incorporated via nonendocytotic mechanisms by different human cell types, namely dendritic cells (DC), lymphocytes, and fibroblasts, as visualized by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. Bb-liposomes were localized in the cytosol and in the nucleus of the cells. With this in mind, we generated in vitro Bb-specific T-cells from nonadherant peripheral blood mononuclear cells by use of Bb-liposomes loaded autologous DC. More than 95% of those T-cells were CD8(+) and they killed autologous Bb-liposome-loaded T-cell blasts. These results suggest that Bb-blebs may be responsible for the autoimmune-like appearance of Lyme disease."

During 1994-1998 at least two serum samples were submitted for serological testing from more than 1200 patients. An immunofluorescence test was performed paralelly with two pools of antigen (B. bg.s.s. + B. afzelii, and two serological different strains of B. garinii, all of local origin). In 92-96% of patients no change of antibody level was found in repeated tests, about 20% of them being negative (< 1:512). In 2-4% of cases a significant increase and in less than 1% a decrease or a second wave of the rise of the antibody level was observed. From the 58 patients with increasing antibody levels 9 had ECM (mostly children), 2 cardiovascular, 8 musculo-skeletal and 12 neurological disorders. In the remaining cases the diagnosis was not specified (A 69). Only in 9 cases a rise of the titer appeared during 3 weeks after the first negative sample, at contrary in 7 cases no rise of the titer was seen in that time. 2 patients were still after 1 month, 3 after 3 months and 1 even after 7 months (patient with a positive CSF culture) serologically negative. A 2 titer step decrease was observed in 4 cases during 1 year and once a 3 titer decrease after 4 years. A rise of antibodies can be seen in all clinical manifestations of Lyme disease with prevalence in the early types of the disease. The rise of antibodies is often delayed or even inhibited, apparently mostly by an early efficient treatment. Whether a late rise of antibodies or its long persistence indicates a latency of the infection, requires more detailed studies. (Tab. 5, Ref. 6.)"

Spirochetes were detected in 6 (12%) of 50 nymphs derived from larvae that had fed on these animals. Ten nymphs from the same cohort of experimentally infected ticks were placed on each of 4 naive deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). One of the mice seroconverted to B. burgdorferi and spirochetes were isolated from its ear tissues 4 weeks after exposure to ticks. Further vector competence trials were conducted with I. angustus ticks from California. Larvae were fed on deer mice that had been inoculated intradermally with B. burgdoferi along with larvae of I. spinipalpis as a comparison group. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of infection in nymphs of I. angustus (8.2%) versus those of I. spinipalpis (12.1%). We conclude that I. angustus is a competent experimental vector of B. burgdorferi s.s. and its efficiency for acquiring and transstadially passing such spirochetes is similar to that of I. spinipalpis."

Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus ticks. Lyme disease is typically evidenced in its early stage by a characteristic rash (erythema migrans), accompanied by nonspecific symptoms (e.g., fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgia, and arthralgia). Lyme disease can usually be treated successfully with standard antibiotic regimens. 1992-1998. Lyme disease surveillance data are reported to CDC through the National Electronic Telecommunication System for Surveillance, a computerized public health database for nationally notifiable diseases. During 1992-1998, data regarding reported cases of Lyme disease included county and state of residence, age, sex, and date of onset. Descriptive analyses were performed, and cumulative incidence by state, county, age group, and sex were calculated. During 1992-1998, a total of 88,967 cases of Lyme disease was reported to CDC by 49 states and the District of Columbia, with the number of cases increasing from 9,896 in 1992 to 16,802 in 1998. A total of 92% of cases was reported from eight northeastern and mid-Atlantic states and two north-central states. Children aged 5-9 years and adults aged 45-54 years had the highest mean annual incidence. Lyme disease is a highly focal disease, with the majority of reported cases occurring in the northeastern and north-central United States. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease increased during 1992-1998. Geographic and seasonal patterns of disease correlate with the distribution and feeding habits of the vector ticks, I. scapularis and I. pacificus. The results presented in this report will help clinicians evaluate the prior probability of Lyme disease and provide the framework for targeting human Lyme disease vaccine use and other prevention and treatment interventions."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted to the host by a feeding Ixodid tick. The spirochete subsequently disseminates through the skin, enters the bloodstream, and becomes systemic. A potential mechanism for this invasiveness was identified with the discovery that B. burgdorferi can bind components of the plasminogen activation system (PAS). The methodology for analyzing the generation of enzymatically active plasmin on the surface of this organism is given, and applied to measure spirochete viability, strain differences, and breakdown of extracellular matrix (ECM) macromolecules. Plasmin acquisition by B. burgdorferi was measured photometrically by a specific chromogenic substrate. The growth of B. burgdorferi in culture was not affected by the presence of active plasmin on the spirochete surface. Plasmin-coated B. burgdorferi degraded the purified (ECM) components fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin, but not collagen. The addition of B. burgdorferi with surface plasmin to a radiolabeled, native ECM resulted in degradation of noncollagenous protein, as measured by release of solubilized radioactivity. Breakdown of purified ECM components or native ECM did not occur after exposure to untreated spirochetes or spirochetes treated with uPA or PLG alone. These results provide in vitro evidence that enzymatically active plasmin on the surface of B. burgdorferi may be partially responsible for its invasiveness."

Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin biopsy samples from 10 patients with morphea and 12 patients with lichen sclerosus were investigated by PCR analysis for the presence of Bb. The presence of Bb DNA was demonstrated in three of 10 patients with morphea and six of 12 patients with lichen sclerosus by nested PCR. The data obtained in this study suggest that Bb may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of both morphea and lichen sclerosus at least in the western parts of Turkey."

Serological examinations relating to Lyme disease were undertaken in the clinical hospital and the results appeared positive. The patient received Vibramicin for a prolonged treatment lasting 30 days. Radiological findings showed distraction in both hip joints (especially the right one), with areas of bone erosion, severe osteoporosis and calcifications in periarthral soft tissues. After pharmacological treatment the body temperature normalized and the pain became less severe. The state of the patient's health improved from subjective and objective point of view."

		"abstract": "The authors tried to confirm data on the prevalence of antiborrelia antibodies class IgM and IgG in the local healthy population (200 blood donors) and in subjects with an increased risk of infection (forestry labourers, forestry workers and huntsmen). All blood samples were analyzed in the National Reference Laboratory for Lyme borreliosis CEM (LB) in the National Institute of Public Health in Prague by the ELISA NRLB KC 90 method and in case of a positive result they were confirmed by the Western blot Lyme method. All patients completed a special questionnaire used as a standard procedure in the consultation centre for LB. In the group of blood donors 100 men were examined, mean age 33.5 years and 100 women, mean age 24.4 years. In 26 positive antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) were confirmed, but on invitation to medical examination only 22 attended, 11 men and 11 women (10.1%). Examination of antiborrelia antibodies by the ELISA method proved positivity of class IgM 7 times and of class IgG 9 times. By the Western blot method (WB) class IgG was confirmed three times. In the risk group 39 men were examined, mean age 40.6 years and 32 women. In 12 of them (17.9%) positivity of antiborrelia antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) was proved by the ELISA method as well as the WB method. If the percentage confidence interval of the control group is taken as a basis for comparison, then the value of the risk group is within this interval at a significance value of alpha = 0.01. In the conclusion the authors discuss the problem of interpretation of positive serological results and the pitfalls of their evaluation not only from the aspect of validity of laboratory findings, due to the absence of standardization of methods, but also with regards to obscure aspects of the persistence of IgM antibodies after years of lege artis antibiotic treatment."

Banked sera from 440 military working dogs were used for serologic analyses. Serum samples were analyzed for antibodies against B burgdorferi by use of a commercially available ELISA and subsequently by western blot analysis as a confirmatory test. Results from the ELISA indicated that 89 (20%) samples were positive for exposure to B burgdorferi or canine Lyme disease vaccine, and 351 (80%) were negative. Follow-up testing by western blot analysis indicated that results for 109 (25%) samples were positive and 331 (75%) were negative for exposure. All samples that had positive results on the ELISA also had positive results on western blot analysis (true positives). Of the 351 samples that had negative results on the ELISA, only 331 had negative results on western blot analysis (true negatives). The remaining 20 samples had positive results on western blot analysis. By use of a standard 2 x 2 table, it was determined that the ELISA had a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 100%, positive predictive value of 100%, and negative predictive value of 94%. The commercial ELISA kit evaluated in this study appeared to lack adequate sensitivity for detecting all potential cases of borreliosis in dogs. The ELISA was also unable to discriminate natural exposure from exposure attributable to vaccination, which could complicate interpretation of positive results and treatment of dogs with clinical signs."

Therefore, B. burgdorferi bbk32 and bbk50 expression within Ixodes scapularis ticks and the murine host, and the effect of BBK32 and BBK50 antisera on spirochetes throughout the vector-host life cycle were investigated. bbk32 and bbk50 mRNA and protein were first detected within engorged ticks, demonstrating regulated expression within the vector. Then bbk32 expression increased in mice at the cutaneous site of inoculation. During disseminated murine infection, bbk32 and bbk50 were expressed in several murine tissues, and mRNA levels were greatest in the heart and spleen at 30 days. BBK32 antisera protected mice from tick-borne B. burgdorferi infection and spirochete numbers were reduced by 90% within nymphs that engorged on immunized mice. Moreover, 75% of these ticks did not retain spirochetes upon molting, and subsequent B. burgdorferi transmission by adult ticks was impaired. Larval acquisition of B. burgdorferi by I. scapularis was also inhibited by BBK32 antisera. These data demonstrate that bbk32 and bbk50 are expressed during tick engorgement and that BBK32 antisera can interfere with spirochete transmission at various stages of the vector-host life cycle. These studies provide insight into mechanisms of immunity to Lyme borreliosis and other vector-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The aetiology of morphoea and lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is still unknown. Since the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) as the causative agent of Lyme disease, there has been debate about a possible association between B. burgdorferi and morphoea. Initial serological and cultural studies showed controversial results. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) initially suggested an association between B. burgdorferi and morphoea. We reviewed the literature on B. burgdorferi (specific serology, immunohistology, culture, lymphocyte stimulation and DNA detection by PCR) since 1983, using Medline and Current Contents. Histological and immunohistological detection of B. burgdorferi was reported in 0-40% (20 of 82) of the cases with morphoea and in 46-50% (17 of 36) of the cases with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. Cultivation of spirochetes from lesional skin succeeded in five patients (five of 68) with morphoea, but failed in patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. In Europe and Asia, serological detection of antibodies against B. burgdorferi was described in 0-60% (138 of 609) of patients with morphoea and in 19% (six of 32) in the U.S.A. For lichen sclerosus et atrophicus 0-25% of the published cases (three of 23) in Europe and Asia were seropositive. DNA from B. burgdorferi was detected by PCR in 0-100% (17 of 82) of the tissues of patients with morphoea in Europe and Asia, but not a single case among 98 patients was reported to be positive from the U. S.A. In Europe and Asia, borrelial DNA was detected in 0-100% (nine of 28) of the cases with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, whereas in the U.S.A. none of 48 patients was positive. There are two possible explanations for these contradictory findings: the most likely is that B. burgdorferi is not a causative agent for morphoea. Another possible explanation could be that a subset of morphoea is caused by a special subspecies of B. burgdorferi that is present in Europe and Asia but does not occur in the U.S.A."

		"abstract": "Since Lyme arthritis was first described in the United States, it has now been reported in many countries of Europe. However, very few strains of the causative bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, have been isolated from synovial samples. For this reason, different molecular direct typing methods were developed recently to assess which species could be involved in Lyme arthritis in Europe. We developed a simple oligonucleotide typing method with PCR fragments from the flagellin gene of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, which is able to differentiate seven different Borrelia species. Among 10 consecutive PCR-positive patients with Lyme arthritis from the northeastern France, two species were identified in synovial samples: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in 9 cases and B. garinii in 1 case. Conversely, all B. burgdorferi sensu lato species detected in 10 consecutive PCR-positive biopsies from a second set of patients with erythema migrans from the same geographical area were identified as either B. afzelii or B. garinii (P < 0.001). These results indicate that B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the principal but not the only Borrelia species involved in Lyme arthritis in northeastern France."

In analyses for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies, 14 (82%) of 17 serum samples from persons who had erythema migrans reacted positively by an ELISA with one or more recombinant antigens. There was frequent antibody reactivity to protein 41-G (p41-G), outer surface protein C (OspC), and OspF antigens. In an ELISA for IgG antibodies, 13 (87%) of 15 serum samples had antibodies to recombinant antigens; reactivity to p22, p39, p41-G, OspC, and OspF antigens was frequent. By both ELISAs, serum specimens positive for OspB, OspE, and p37 were uncommon. Analyses of sera obtained from persons who were suspected of having human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) but who lacked antibodies to ehrlichiae revealed IgM antibodies to all recombinant antigens of B. burgdorferi except OspB and IgG antibodies to all antigens except OspE. Immunoblotting of sera from the study group of individuals suspected of having HGE reaffirmed antibody reactivity to multiple antigens of B. burgdorferi. There was minor cross-reactivity when sera from healthy subjects or persons who had syphilis, oral infections, or rheumatoid arthritis were tested by ELISAs with p37, p41-G, OspB, OspC, OspE, and OspF antigens. Although the results of class-specific ELISAs with recombinant antigens were comparable to those recorded for assays with whole-cell antigen and for individuals with confirmed clinical diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis, immunoblotting is still advised as an adjunct procedure, particularly when there are low antibody titers by an ELISA."

The similarity of borrelial G + C content to that of Gram-positive organisms suggested that a wide-host-range plasmid active in Gram-positive bacteria might also be recognized by borrelial DNA replication machinery. One such plasmid, pGK12, is able to propagate in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and carries erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance markers. pGK12 propagated extrachromosomally in B. burgdorferi B31 after electroporation but conferred only erythromycin resistance. pGK12 was used to express enhanced green fluorescent protein in B31 under the control of the flaB promoter. Escherichia coli transformed with pGK12 DNA extracted from B31 expressing only erythromycin resistance developed both erythromycin and chloramphenicol resistance, and plasmid DNA isolated from these transformed E. coli had a restriction pattern similar to the original pGK12. Our data indicate that the replicons of pGK12 can provide the basis to continue developing efficient genetic systems for B. burgdorferi together with the erythromycin resistance and reporter egfp genes."

The objective of the present work was to report the clinicoepidemiological features in a series of patients. Retrospective collection of clinicoepidemiological features of the first fifty patients diagnosed of EM at La Rioja Hospital (March 1989-September 1998). In our series, no differences were observed regarding sex or living in a rural or urban area. Mean age was 41 years (range 9 to 78). In 70% of patients the antecedent of a tick bite was obtained and the incubation period was 6.48 days (1 to 15 days). The mean size of the lesions was 14.3 cm (5 to 40) and in 16% of patients satellite cutaneous lesions were observed. The areas where EM appeared were lower limbs and the perineal region (60%), chest (24%), head and neck (10%) and upper limbs (6%). Forty-eight percent of patients reported extra-cutaneous manifestations. All cases occurred during the spring, summer and autumn months, with a peak in June. The most common referred antecedent was walking in forest areas. All patients responded to antibiotic therapy. EM is common in the studied environment and presents with a marked polymorphism."

Oms66 was solubilized from whole-cell lysates of strain B313 (which is derived from B31 but lacks OspA, -B, -C, and -D) and purified to homogeneity by fast-protein liquid chromatography. Purified native Oms66 (nOms66), which retained the ability to form large channels in a planar lipid bilayer model membrane system, and denatured Oms66 (hOms66) were used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. The resulting Oms66 antisera were tested in a complement-dependent borreliacidal assay in parallel with basal serum and with serum from rabbits immune to reinfection with B. burgdorferi (IRS). IRS showed high-titer complement-dependent killing of both strains B31 and B313. Sera from animals immunized with nOms66 showed high-titer complement-dependent killing activity against strain B313 but exhibited no killing of B31. By comparison, serum generated from immunizations with hOms66 showed no killing activity against either strain. Following adsorption of antiserum to nOms66 with recombinant Oms66 (rOms66), the serum antibodies no longer bound to rOms66 or to nOms66 that had been denatured with 8 M urea. However, the antibodies still bound to nOms66 and killing activity against B313 was retained, thus suggesting that native, conformational epitopes are targets of this bactericidal activity. Six C3H HeJ mice were immunized with nOms66 and were challenged using \"host-adapted\" B. burgdorferi B31 by skin implantation of infected mouse ear tissue. Four of the six mice were protected against both localized and disseminated infection. These findings indicate that native Oms66 can elicit potent bactericidal activity and significant protective immunity against host-adapted organisms."

This case report describes a 74-year-old man who developed progressive left hemiparesis and facial palsy. The patient was hospitalized to rule out a cerebral vascular accident. The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was established with serologic studies. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and responded with rapid clinical and functional recovery. Lyme neuroborreliosis presenting as hemiparesis has rarely been reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment appear to facilitate symptomatic relief and prevent persistent neurologic deficits."

The vaccine, which is derived from a lipidated outer surface protein of the causative spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is important because it may decrease the morbidity and financial costs associated with Lyme disease. Its mechanism is unique because it works inside the tick vector itself, preventing the human from becoming infected."

The urological symptoms in borreliosis resemble those of interstitial cystitis (IC): frequency, urgency and nocturia. The aim of this studies is to find the role of B. burgdorferi in interstitial cystitis. We studied antibodies against B. burgdorferi from serum samples of 50 IC patients with two separate EIA tests. Patients with positive serology in both tests underwent cystoscopy and a bladder biopsy was taken. The presence of borrelia DNA was studied with borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and with universal bacterial PCR. IgM class antibodies to B. burgdorferi were not found, but IgG antibodies were found in four samples (8%). This was higher than in the control material (2%). One patient's sample was strongly positive, whereas three samples were weakly positive. Bladder biopsies taken from the 4 patients were negative for borrelia DNA in both PCR tests. None of the seropositive patients had any symptoms consistent with LD. These results indicate that persistent infection of B. burgdorferi has no role in the etiology of IC. On the other hand a connection with a past borrelia infection and IC is not excluded."

The frequency of similarities to probes from each of the 12 B31 plasmids varied from 13 to 100% in the strain panel examined, and these similarities usually reside on plasmids similar in size to the cognate B31 plasmid. Sequences similar to 5 of the 12 B31 plasmids were found in all of the isolates examined, and >66% of the panel members hybridized to probes from 4 other plasmids. Sequences similar to most of the B. burgdorferi B31 plasmid-derived DNA probes used were also found on linear plasmids in the related Eurasian Lyme agents Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii; however, some of these plasmids had uniform but substantially different sizes from their B. burgdorferi counterparts."

The Msel and Dral restriction patterns of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer amplicons of Haenam strains differed from those of other B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains. Furthermore, in the phylogenetic tree based on the 16S rDNA sequences, Haenam strains formed a distinctive cluster, clearly separated from the other members of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. These results suggest that, apart from Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii, other genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu lato exist in Korea and the Haenam strain is a newly identified one."

Inosine 5'- monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) is the enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of IMP to XMP with the concomitant reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (from NAD(+) to NADH). Because of its critical role in purine biosynthesis, IMPDH is a drug design target for anticancer, antiinfective, and immunosuppressive chemotherapy. We have determined the crystal structure of IMPDH from Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial spirochete that causes Lyme disease, with a sulfate ion bound in the IMP phosphate binding site. This is the first structure of IMPDH in the absence of substrate or cofactor where the active-site loop (loop 6), which contains the essential catalytic residue Cys 229, is clearly defined in the electron density. We report that a seven residue region of loop 6, including Cys229, is tilted more than 6 A away from its position in substrate- or substrate analogue-bound structures of IMPDH, suggestive of a conformational change. The location of this loop between beta6 and alpha6 links IMPDH to a family of beta/alpha barrel enzymes known to utilize this loop as a functional lid during catalysis. Least-squares minimization, root-mean-square deviation analysis, and inspection of the molecular surface of the loop 6 region in the substrate-free B. burgdorferi IMPDH and XMP-bound Chinese hamster IMPDH show that loop 6 follows a similar pattern of hinged rigid-body motion and indicates that IMPDH may be using loop 6 to bind and sequester substrate and to recruit an essential catalytic residue."

Although infectivity waned after 2 months, the robins remained susceptible to reinfection, became infectious again, and permitted repeated feeding by vector ticks. In addition, spirochetes passaged through birds retained infectivity for mammalian hosts. American robins become as infectious for vector ticks as do reservoir mice, but infectivity in robins wanes more rapidly."

The borrelial genome is unique among bacterial genomes in that it is composed of a linear chromosome and a series of linear and circular plasmids. The plasmids exhibit significant genetic redundancy and carry 175 paralogous gene families, most of unknown function. Homologous alleles on different plasmids could influence the organization and evolution of the Borrelia genome by serving as foci for interplasmid homologous recombination. The plasmid-carried Borrelia direct repeat (bdr) gene family encodes polymorphic, acidic proteins with putative phosphorylation sites and transmembrane domains. These proteins may play regulatory roles in Borrelia. We describe recent progress in the characterization of the Borrelia bdr genes and discuss the possible influence of this gene family on the biology, pathogenesis, and evolution of the Borrelia genome."

Five hundred thirty-seven residents presenting to their primary care provider with an acute febrile illness suggestive of HGE were identified. Of these, 137 (26%) had laboratory evidence (by indirect fluorescent antibody staining or polymerase chain reaction) of HGE; 89 were confirmed cases, and 48 were probable cases. The incidence of confirmed HGE was 31 cases/100,000 in 1997, 51 cases/100,000 in 1998, and 24 cases/100,000 in 1999. A subset of sera was tested by use of immunoblot assays, and results were in agreement with indirect fluorescent antibody methods for 86% of samples analyzed. Thus, HGE is an important cause of morbidity and is now the second most common tickborne infection in southeastern Connecticut."

Since B. burgdorferi proteins with those molecular masses are of immunodiagnostic importance, Lyme disease patient sera were used in studies of B31 lysates and recombinant B31 ErpA/I/N and ErpB/J/O proteins. Immunoblot analyses indicated that only a minority of the patients produced antibodies that recognized the tested B31 Erp proteins. Southern blot analyses of Lyme disease spirochetes cultured from 16 of the patients indicated that all these bacteria contain genes related to the B31 erpA/I/N and erpB/J/O genes, although signal strengths indicated only weak similarities in many cases, suggestive of genetic variability of erp genes among these bacteria. These data indicate that Erp proteins are generally not the 19- and 60-kDa antigens observed on serodiagnostic immunoblots."

Two groups received two doses of two different lots ofa nonadjuvanted, OspA, recombinant vaccine; the third group served as nonvaccinated controls. All dogs were challenged 3 weeks after the second vaccination with blacklegged deer ticks (Ixodes scapularis) harvested from a B. burgdorferi endemic area in Rhode Island. Clinical signs, antibody titers by ELISA, Western blot assays, and isolation and polymerase chain reaction analyses of spirochetes from biopsy specimens were used to evaluate vaccine efficacy. Direct fluorescent antibody assay was used to evaluate the infection rate in the challenge ticks and in naïve ticks allowed to feed on study dogs after the dogs were infected (xenodiagnosis). Vaccinates responded with high levels of antibodies (determined by ELISA and measured by optical density [OD]), which did not rise after challenge. Vaccinates demonstrated no clinical signs, negative isolation of spirochetes on biopsy, only an OspA antibody pattern on Western blot assay, and negative isolation of spirochetes on biopsy, confirming that the vaccine blocked infection with B. burgdorferi in all vaccinated dogs (20/20). Control dogs demonstrated clinical signs (2/10), antibodies characteristic of infection with B. burgdoferi (10/10), isolation of spirochetes (10/10), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection of spirochetes (9/10). The recombinant, nonadjuvanted B. burgdoferi vaccine protected 100% of vaccinates against infection after a severe challenge that infected 100% of control dogs. The OspA vaccine proved to be highly safe and effective in this study."

Patients with audiograms demonstrating ASNHL of 10 dB or greater in 2 consecutive frequencies or 15 dB in any 1 frequency between 250 and 6000 Hz were asked to participate. Patients underwent MRI scanning of the cerebellopontine angle, internal auditory canals, and posterior fossa with gadolinium contrast, ABR, and an extensive battery of tests. The causative diagnosis was made by the individual clinician based on each patient's history, physical examination, and test results. Forty-five patients completed the study. A review of the data confirmed the utility of a detailed history and physical examination, MRI, and fluorescent treponemal antibody test in all cases. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, glycosylated hemoglobin, Lyme antibody titers, and total hemolytic component (CH50) were helpful in selected cases. Thyroid function testing, complete blood count, Sequential Multiple Analysis-7, prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, lipid profile, and ABR were of no value in these patients. A careful history and physical examination, MRI, and fluorescent treponemal antibody test should be performed for the evaluation of all patients with ASNHL; however, more extensive serologic testing, including sedimentation rate, glycosylated hemoglobin, Lyme antibody titers, and CH50, should be selectively performed, based on a suggestive history or suspicious physical findings."

B. burgdorferi and S. pneumoniae were used as model systems for arthritis and meningitis, respectively. The sensitivity of the B. burgdorferi assay was comparable to that of a species-specific PCR, whereas for S. pneumoniae the detection limit was one to three organisms as determined by plate counts. To specifically differentiate two species, two discontinuously located nucleotide differences in the region complementary to the capture probe are required during the detection step with the PCR-ELISA kit. A preliminary clinical evaluation was performed with eight specimens (joint and cerebrospinal fluids) previously shown to contain B. burgdorferi DNA. Except for one sample which was positive by the broad-range PCR-ELISA system only, the results were in agreement with those obtained by B. burgdorferi species-specific PCR. None of the 23 control samples were positive by either method. Thus, broad-range amplification in combination with the PCR-ELISA kit promises to be a sensitive and specific format for the detection of agents causing reactive arthritis, meningitis or other diseases associated with a limited number of different bacteria."

One thousand canine sera (917 dogs, 83 coyotes) obtained from animal control authorities and area veterinarians were screened by ELISA for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Results were validated by Western blot and indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) tests at referee laboratories. Criterion for a positive Western blot was presence of 5 of 10 of the most common antigen IgG bands; for IFA, >1:128 or the equivalent when correcting for interlaboratory variability. Twenty-two of 1,000 canines were confirmed serologically positive (21 dogs and 1 coyote; seroprevalence 2.3% and 1.2%, respectively). Lifestyle, breed size, gender, and age were not statistically predictive of seropositive status. No regional clustering of seropositive animals was detected. The low prevalence of seropositivity in sentinel canines suggests the Lyme borreliosis hazard in San Diego County is minimal."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a potentially serious infection which is caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi and is endemic in certain areas of North America, Europe and Asia. Lyme disease vaccine (LYMErix) is an adjuvanted formulation of the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the causative spirochaete. It acts by inducing high titres of anti-OspA antibodies (anti-OspA), which must be present in vaccinated individuals before exposure to B. burgdorferi to provide protection against Lyme disease. Lyme disease vaccine efficacy against Lyme disease was 80% for definite and asymptomatic cases and 76% for definite cases at year 2 using the recommended dosage regimen [30 microg at months 0, 1 and 12 (0, 1, 12 schedule)] in a randomised, double-blind, multicentre trial in 10,936 enrolled adult volunteers who resided in areas of the US endemic for Lyme disease. On the basis of an anti-OspA correlate of protection, Lyme disease vaccine 30 microg was equally effective when administered by a shorter schedule (0, 1, 6 schedule); > or = 90% of adult volunteers developed protective anti-OspA titres with this or the 0, 1, 12 schedule. Although published data are fewer, a 0, 1, 2 schedule has also shown promise in adults. In addition, virtually all children (aged 2 to 15 years) given Lyme disease vaccine 30 microg developed protective anti-OspA titres, but published data are also limited and results of a large paediatric trial are awaited with interest. Long term protection against Lyme disease appears to be possible with Lyme disease vaccine. Although anti-OspA titres decline rapidly after completion of the recommended schedule, booster doses of 30 microg of the vaccine induced protective anti-OspA titres in > or = 96% of adult volunteers when administered 12 and/or 24 months later. Lyme disease vaccine 30 microg is well tolerated: most vaccination-related adverse events were transient and mild or moderate in severity in clinical trials. The most common spontaneously reported adverse event was pain at the injection site in 24% of vaccine recipients (vs 7.6% of the placebo group). The incidence of spontaneously reported, early nonspecific systemic adverse events was <4% but was higher with the vaccine than with placebo for some events (e.g. myalgias, fever and chills but not arthralgia). There appeared to be no association between the vaccine and the incidence of arthritis or any late systemic adverse events. The tolerability profile of Lyme disease vaccine did not appear to vary with the schedule of administration, nor to differ between adults and children. Lyme disease vaccine, an adjuvanted formulation of OspA, protects most adults against Lyme disease when administered by the recommended 0, 1, 12 schedule before disease exposure, and is well tolerated. The optimal schedule(s) of administration, duration of protection against Lyme disease, long term tolerability in adults and potential role in children are not fully defined for this vaccine. Lyme disease vaccine is indicated in North America for active immunisation of adults at moderate to high risk of contracting Lyme disease."

In bloodpool scintigraphy according to an increased activity in comparison to the surrounding tissues. In 694 joints comparison of both scintigraphic modalities was possible, resulting in a 2 x 2 kappa coefficient of 0.93 or 0.97 by using late-phase bone scintigraphy as an anatomical marker. For intra- and interobserver agreement, 2 x 2 kappa coefficients of 0.93 and 0.88 in HIG scintigraphy, respectively 0.96 and 0.90 in blood-pool scintigraphy were calculated. This study shows an excellent agreement in the visualization of synovitis by HIG and bloodpool scintigraphy. Because of its higher objectivity and lower cost, investigation of synovitis should be performed by bloodpool scintigraphy."

Ehrlichia-infected I. scapularis nymphs were fed upon Borrelia-infected mice, and Borrelia-infected I. scapularis nymphs were fed upon Ehrlichia-infected mice. The efficiency with which previously infected nymphal ticks acquired a second pathogen from infected hosts was compared to that of uninfected ticks. An average of 51% +/- 15% of ticks acquired Ehrlichia from infected mice regardless of their prior infection status with Borrelia. An average of 85% +/- 10% of ticks acquired Borrelia from infected mice regardless of their prior infection status with Ehrlichia. Also, we assessed the efficiency with which individual nymphs could transmit either agent alone, or both agents simultaneously, to individual susceptible hosts. An average of 76% +/- 9% of Borrelia-infected ticks and 84% +/- 10% of Ehrlichia-infected ticks transmitted these agents to mice regardless of the presence of the other pathogen. There was no evidence of interaction between the agents of Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in I. scapularis ticks. The presence of either agent in the ticks did not affect acquisition of the other agent from an infected host. Transmission of the agents of Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis by individual ticks was equally efficient and independent. Dually infected ticks transmitted each pathogen to susceptible hosts as efficiently as ticks infected with only one pathogen."

The increased specificity anticipated with sequential testing, however, depends on immunoblot assays and ELISAs being independent tests. To examine whether they are independent, control serum samples were tested with 2 different commercially available IgM ELISAs and with an IgM immunoblot assay kit. The frequency of false-positive IgM immunoblot assays was significantly higher with ELISA-reactive than with ELISA-negative serum samples (P</=.001). In addition, there was a highly significant direct correlation between the number of reactive bands on IgM blotting and the rate of false-positive results by IgM ELISA (P<.0001). These observations demonstrate that IgM ELISAs and IgM immunoblot assays for antibodies to B. burgdorferi are not independent tests. Therefore, when used in sequential testing for Lyme disease, the immunoblot assay should be considered a test that supplements rather than confirms an ELISA."

Patients with persistent posttreatment symptoms of LD had sCD14 levels equivalent to those of healthy controls. Differences in the serum sCD14 levels in patients with various stages of LD are likely to be directly correlated with differences in bacterial burden, suggesting that posttreatment symptoms may not require continued presence of the organism. sCD14 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with any stage of LD were no different from those of control subjects. Levels of synovial fluid sCD14 from patients with Borrelia burgdorferi in their joints were elevated, compared with levels in normal serum, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis."

At euthanasia, single tissues of the antibiotic-treated dogs and multiple tissues of all control dogs were Borrelia-positive by polymerase chain reaction. Viable spirochetes were not recovered from antibiotic-treated dogs. Two antibiotic-treated dogs showed histologic evidence of minimal lesions, whereas all control dogs had mild polyarthritis with periarteritis."

Although 74% of OspA recipients had a reciprocal GIA titer >/=64 after 3 vaccinations, none of the placebo recipients, even those with Lyme disease, had a GIA titer this high. The correlation between GIA and ELISA titers after 3 doses of vaccine was.84; however, more vaccine recipients had an elevated ELISA titer paired with low GIA titer than had a low ELISA titer with a high GIA titer. OspA-vaccine recipients who acquired Lyme disease had significantly lower serum GIA and ELISA titers after 3 immunizations than did age- and sex-matched OspA recipients without Lyme disease. Thus, vaccinated subjects had antibodies to native antigen on viable cells, and antibody assays with this specificity may predict protection of vaccinees against infection."

The aims of this study were to determine the sero-prevalences of antibodies to Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato during 1991-94 in dogs, not clinically suspected to be infected with either of the 2 agents. Samples (n = 611) were selected from a serum bank using a systematic sampling strategy, stratified across the 4-y period. The stored sera had originally been submitted in order to verify or rule out infection with Sarcoptes scabiei. The overall sero-prevalence for Ehrlichia spp. was 17.7% and for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato 3.9% (n = 588). Only a few dogs in the northern part of Sweden were sero-positive for Ehrlichia spp. and none were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. An increased sero-prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. was seen during the years studied. The sero-prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. varied with season. Sero-positivity to both agents increased with age. Both diseases are considered zoonotic, and the increase in sero-prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. over the years may reflect the degree of infection in ticks and may have implications for human health."

At least some of the Bmp proteins are immunogens in infected vertebrate hosts. The genetic organization of the bmp region has been characterized for a variety of B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains by Southern hybridization, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing. All four bmp genes were present in the same relative order in all B. burgdorferi sensu lato low- and high-passage-number isolates. While there were no differences in the relative orders of the bmp genes in these species, variations in DNA sequence in the bmpD-bmpC and bmpC-bmpA intergenic regions were significantly more common than in the corresponding 3' bmpD and bmpC coding regions. The genetic structure of the chromosomal region containing the bmp genes thus appears to be well conserved across different species of B. burgdorferi, but variations in DNA fine structure that prevent PCR primer annealing may occur in this region and make Southern hybridization much more reliable than PCR for detection of the presence of these genes. Our results also suggest that bmp gene products may be used as reagents in the preparation of vaccines and diagnostic assays to protect against and diagnose Lyme disease produced by B. burgdorferi sensu lato."

GAG binding by B. burgdorferi is associated with haemagglutination and we have identified a 26 kDa protein, which we have termed Bgp (Borrelia GAG-binding protein), on the basis of its ability to bind to heparin and erythrocytes. Bgp was found in outer membrane fractions of B. burgdorferi and on the surface of intact bacteria, as assayed by labelling with a membrane-impermeable biotinylating agent or anti-Bgp antibodies. Purified recombinant Bgp agglutinated erythrocytes, binds to the same spectrum of GAGs as the B. burgdorferi strain from which the cloned bgp sequence was obtained, and inhibited B. burgdorferi binding to purified GAGs and to cultured mammalian cells. Thus, Bgp is a strong candidate for a GAG-binding adhesin of B. burgdorferi."

Observational case series. Ten patients with Lyme borreliosis-associated ophthalmologic findings previously reported from the Helsinki University Central Hospital in addition to 10 new cases that have since been diagnosed. INTERVENTION/TESTING: The patients underwent medical and ophthalmologic evaluation. The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, clinical ocular and systemic findings, determinations of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis, the detection of DNA of B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction, and exclusion of other infectious and inflammatory causes. Ocular complaints, presenting ophthalmologic findings, and the stage of Lyme borreliosis were recorded. Four patients presented with a neuro-ophthalmologic disorder, five had external ocular inflammation, 10 patients had uveitis, and one had branch retinal vein occlusion. One patient developed episcleritis and one patient developed abducens palsy within 2 months of the infection incident. In the remaining 14 patients in whom the time of infection was traced, the ocular manifestations appeared in the late stage of Lyme borreliosis. Two patients with a neuro-ophthalmologic disorder and one with external ocular inflammation experienced severe photophobia, whereas the main reported symptom of the patients with uveitis was decreased visual acuity. Four patients with external ocular disease and one with a neuro-ophthalmologic disorder experienced severe periodic ocular or facial pain. Retinal vasculitis developed in seven patients with uveitis. Lyme borreliosis can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, which develop mainly in the late stage of the disease. Photophobia and severe periodic ocular pain can be characteristic symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. In the differential diagnosis of retinal vasculitis, Lyme borreliosis should be taken into account, especially in endemic areas."

In addition, in vitro antimicrobial resistance patterns of Borrelia valaisiana and Borrelia bissettii tick isolates were investigated. The applied test system is based upon color changes that occur in the presence of phenol red and result from the accumulation of nonvolatile acid produced by actively metabolizing spirochetes. After 72 h of incubation, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined from the decrease of absorbance by software-assisted calculation of growth curves. MIC values were lowest for azlocillin (MIC, < or = 0.125 microg/ml), ceftriaxone (MIC range, < or = 0.015-0.06 microg/ ml), and azithromycin (MIC range, < or = 0.015-0.06 microg/ml). Whereas tobramycin (MIC range, 8-64 microg/ml) exhibited little activity, spectinomycin (MIC range, 0.25-2 microg/ml) showed in vitro antimicrobial activity against Borrelia burgdorferi. The MICs of penicillin G for Borrelia afzelii isolates were ten times higher than those for Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia valaisiana, and Borrelia bissettii isolates (P<0.05) and 100 times higher than those for isolates belonging to the genospecies Borrelia garinii (P < 0.05). Further significant differences with respect to the MIC values of the other antimicrobial agents tested were not noted. The colorimetric microdilution method offered the advantages of reliability, reproducibility, and convenience and could handle large numbers of isolates and antibiotics."

A significant local variability of the prevalence of B. burgdorferi was not found. Nine isolates were identified at a genospecies level by immunoblotting with prepared monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). The most prevalent genospecies in ticks was B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) (6 strains). Two tick isolates reacted with Mabs specific to both B. garinii and B. afzelii and one isolate was detected as a mixed culture of B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. garinii. Considerable variability in protein composition among the strains obtained was found to exist. Five B. burgdorferi genospecies-specific Mabs were prepared and used for the identification of spirochaete isolates. Mabs 9B8 and 6C5 reacted with OspA and OspB proteins of B. burgdorferi s.s., while 4D7 and 1D11 recognised OspA protein of B. garinii and 9D2 specifically reacted with the OspB protein of B. afzelii.

We present a simple graphic which incorporates all these measures and admits easily interpreted comparison of two or more diagnostic tests. We show, using likelihood ratios and this graphic, that a test can be superior to a competitor in terms of predictive values while having either sensitivity or specificity smaller. A decision theoretic basis for the interpretation of the graph is given by relating it to the tent graph of Hilden and Glasziou (Statistics in Medicine, 1996). Finally, a brief example comparing two serodiagnostic tests for Lyme disease is presented. Published in 2000 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

The key test reagent developed for this antibody detection system was tannic acid-treated and glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep red blood cells (SRBC) containing Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antigens attached to the outer surface of the SRBC. In order to establish suitable cut-off titers, initial specificity and sensitivity measurements were made using sera from 100 anonymous healthy volunteers and 30 additional pre-determined samples known to be non-reactive or reactive for Lyme disease or syphilis. These results were compared with those obtained using a commercially available ELISA. At titers >/=64, the IHA test had a combined 98% specificity and 100% sensitivity for these 130 serum samples, 30 of which were known positives or negatives, whereas the ELISA was less specific (93%) and much less sensitive (80%). Subsequent testing was performed on sera from 65 patients with the erythema migrans (EM) rash and 20 patients with early disseminated (cardiac/neurologic) symptoms or with Lyme arthritis. At initial presentation, 46-48% of the EM patients had IHA reactivity, with titers >/=128, while 42% were positive in the ELISA. Follow-up testing performed on these EM patients, 8-12 days after receiving antibiotic treatment, revealed that Bb antibodies were detected best by the IHA test (83-86% reactive) relative to the ELISA (81% reactive). Bb antibodies were readily detectable on all of the serum samples from the early disseminated and late stage Lyme disease cases in both assay systems. Based on these results and because of its technical and interpretive simplicity, the IHA test should be considered as a useful and convenient alternative for the serological analysis of Bb infections."

Of these, 27 juveniles of H. flava on Turdus pallidus, Turdus cardis, or Emberiza spodocephala, 2 juveniles of I. persulcatus on T. pallidus, and 1 female H. flava molted from a T. pallidus-derived nymph were positive for the presence of Borrelia by Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly culture passages. In spring, a total of 16 ticks obtained from 102 birds of 21 species were negative for the spirochete. Isolates from 15 ticks were characterized by 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis; all isolates were identified as Borrelia garinii with pattern B/B' based on the previous patterning. According to the intergenic spacer sequences, 2 of 15 isolates, strains Fi14f and Fi24f, were highly similar to B. garinii strains 935T of Korea and ChY13p of Inner Mongolia, China, respectively. These findings indicate that Lyme disease-causing B. garinii may have been introduced to Japan by migratory birds from northeastern China via Korea. Additionally, a case of transstadial transmission of B. garinii from nymph to adult H. flava suggests that the infected H. flava may transmit Borrelia to large animals."

Understanding the techniques for interpreting test results and making decisions based upon those tests represent important tools for decision making for both clinicians and researchers.

A simple example is presented in a step-by-step manner. The principles of interpreting test results are easy to learn and applicable in daily clinical routine. Therefore, dermatologists should be familiar with the concepts outlined in this paper."

We assessed the possible effects of in vitro and in vivo growth on bdr locus structure, searching for recombinational events leading to either deletions or insertions of central repeat units or novel amino- and carboxy-terminus combinations. Our data indicate that, apart from plasmid loss during in vitro cultivation, the bdr paralog loci of strain B31 are stable. This suggests that recombinatorial variation of bdr genes is not essential for persistent mammalian infection."

To determine whether vls sequences are present consistently in low-passage, infectious isolates of B. burgdorferi, 22 blood and erythema migrans biopsy isolates from Lyme disease patients in Westchester County, New York, were examined by Southern blot and PCR analysis. Each of the strains contained a single plasmid varying in size from 21 to 38 kb that hybridized strongly with a vlsE probe based on the B. burgdorferi B31 sequence. In contrast, PCR products were obtained with only 10 of the 22 strains when primers corresponding to the 5' and 3' regions of the B31 vlsE sequence outside the variable cassette region were used. Only 2 of 16 B. burgdorferi-infected tick specimens yielded detectable PCR product. Eight of 10 strains that yielded a PCR product under these conditions were type 1 (a genotype with a high rate of dissemination), according to PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of intergenic rDNA sequences, whereas the isolates that did not yield vlsE PCR products were either type 2 or type 3. Comparison of the sequences of cloned PCR products from the patient isolates indicated a high degree of identity to the B31 sequence, with most of the differences restricted to the hypervariable regions known to undergo sequence variation. Taken together, these results both reinforce previous evidence that vls sequences are present consistently in low-passage Lyme disease spirochetes and indicate that both highly conserved and heterogeneous subgroups exist with regard to vlsE sequences."

		"abstract": "In this study, we characterized seven members of the cp32/18 family of supercoiled plasmids in Borrelia burgdorferi 297. Complete sequence analysis of a 21-kb plasmid (cp18-2) confirmed that the strain 297 plasmids are similar in overall content and organization to their B31 counterparts. Of the 31 open reading frames (ORFs) in cp18-2, only three showed sequence relatedness to proteins with known functions, and only one, a ParA/SopA ortholog, was related to nonborrelial polypeptides. Besides the lipoproteins, none of the ORFs appeared likely to encode a surface-exposed protein. Comparison with the B31 genomic sequence indicated that paralogs for most of the ORFs in cp18-2 can be identified on other genetic elements. cp18-2 was found to lack a 9- to 10-kb fragment present in the 32-kb homologs which, by extrapolation from the B31 cp32 sequences, contains at least 15 genes presumed to be unnecessary for plasmid maintenance. Sequence analysis of the lipoprotein-encoding variable loci provided evidence that recombinatorial processes within these regions may result in the acquisition of exogenous DNA. Pairwise analysis with random shuffling revealed that the multiple lipoproteins (Mlp; formerly designated 2.9 LPs) fall into two distinct homology groups which appear to have arisen by gene fusion events similar to those recently proposed to have generated the three OspE, OspF, and Elp lipoprotein families (D. R. Akins, M. J. Caimano, X. Yang, F. Cerna, M. V. Norgard, and J. D. Radolf, Infect. Immun. 67:1526-1532, 1999). Comparative analysis of the variable regions also indicated that recombination within the loci of each plasmid may occur independently. Last, comparison of variable loci revealed that the cp32/18 plasmid complements of the B31 and 297 isolates differ substantially, indicating that the two strains have been subject to divergent adaptive pressures. In addition to providing evidence for two different types of recombinatorial events involving cp32/18 plasmids, these findings underscore the need for genetic analysis of diverse borrelial isolates in order to elucidate the Lyme disease spirochete's complex parasitic strategies."

The ospE genes are one of several gene families that are flanked by a highly conserved upstream sequence called the upstream homology box, or UHB, element. Earlier analyses in our lab demonstrated that ospE-related genes are characterized by defined hypervariable domains (domains 1 and 2) that are predicted to be hydrophilic, surface exposed, and antigenic. The flanking of hypervariable domain 1 by DNA repeats may indicate that recombination contributes to ospE diversity and thus ultimately to antigenic variation. Using an isogeneic clone of Borrelia burgdorferi B31G (designated B31Gc1), we demonstrate that the ospE-related genes undergo mutation and rearrangement during infection in mice. The mutations that develop during infection resulted in the generation of OspE proteins with altered antigenic characteristics. The data support the hypothesized role of OspE-related proteins in immune system evasion."

A clonal isolate of B. burgdorferi N40 (cN40), which induces disease in C3H/HeN (C3H) mice, was repeatedly passaged in vitro to generate nonpathogenic spirochetes. The passage 75 isolate (N40-75) was infectious for C3H mice but did not cause arthritis or carditis, and spirochetes were at low levels or absent in the joints or hearts, respectively. N40-75 could, however, cause disease in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, suggesting that the response in immunocompetent mice prevented effective spirochete dissemination and the subsequent development of arthritis and carditis. Administration of immune sera at 4 days after spirochete challenge aborted N40-75, but not cN40, infection in SCID mice. A B. burgdorferi genomic expression library was differentially probed with sera from cN40- and N40-75-infected mice, to identify genes that may not be effectively expressed by N40-75 in vivo. N40-75 was defective in the up-regulation of several genes that are preferentially expressed during mammalian infection, including dbpAB, bba64, and genes that map to the cp32 family of plasmids. These data suggest that adaptation and gene expression may be required for B. burgdorferi to effectively colonize the host, evade humoral responses, and cause disease."

Seropositive subjects who had never suffered from clinically manifest Lyme borreliosis or neuroborreliosis showed significantly more often chronic fatigue (p = 0.02) and malaise (p = 0.01) than seronegative recruits. Therefore we believe it is worth examining whether an antibiotic therapy should be considered in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome and positive Borrelia serology."

Recently, cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma has been proposed as a distinct clinical-pathological entity. We report a case of primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma, associated with B burgdorferi infection. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene showed the presence of a monoclonal lymphoproliferation, therefore strengthening the histological diagnosis of a malignant process. B burgdorfer-specific hbb gene sequences were detected by PCR in the lymphoma tissue at diagnosis but not after antibiotic treatment. A nearly complete clinical and histological regression was observed after B burgdorferi eradication, with immunohistochemistry studies showing disappearance of plasma cell differentiation and a marked decline in the number of CD3+ T cells and Ki-67+ cells. Our case confirms the link between B burgdorferi and some cutaneous lymphomas. The disappearance of the microorganism accompanied by the unequivocal decrease of most indicators of active T- and B-cell immune response strongly supported a pathogenetic role for B burgdorferi in sustaining an antigen-driven development and growth of this cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma. Antibiotic therapy (analogous to Helicobacter pylori infection in gastric MALT lymphoma) might be helpful with the aim of averting or at least deferring the indication for more aggressive treatment."

For comparison, synovia were examined from 6 patients with rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis, and from 9 patients with various orthopedic conditions. Among the children with early, untreated JRA, a median of 3 to 8% of inflammatory cells in synovial samples expressed mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha), or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Although a median of 3.9% of the cells expressed mRNA for the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, none had IL-4 mRNA. Most of the patients with late, treated JRA, chronic Lyme arthritis, rheumatoid, or psoriatic arthritis had mRNA for each of these proinflammatory cytokines in about 1% of the cells, whereas mRNA for the antiinflammatory cytokines was less frequent. The inflammatory cell density was much less in the synovium of patients with various orthopedic conditions, but about 1% of the infiltrating cells expressed mRNA for at least one of the proinflammatory cytokines. Patients with early or late JRA or chronic Lyme arthritis have expression of mRNA in synovial tissue primarily for proinflammatory cytokines, with less expression of antiinflammatory cytokines."

In addition, the isolates tested positive in Western blots with species-specific monoclonal antibodies for outer surface protein A and OspB (84c), and the genus-specific, monoclonal antibody to flagellin (H9724). Infectivity studies with several of these isolates were conducted using Mus musculus and Oryzomys palustris and the isolates exhibited markedly different levels of infectivity.

At day 15 and 30 post-infection IL-4 -/- mice produced significantly greater titers of spirochete-specific IgG2a than the wild-type IL-4 +/+ mice, which produced significantly more spirochete-specific IgG1. Following in vitro antigenic stimulation with B. burgdorferi antigen, splenocytes from infected IL-4 -/- and IL-4 +/+ mice displayed similar magnitudes of proliferative responses at day 15 and 30 post-infection. At day 30 antigen-stimulated splenocytes from infected IL-4 -/- mice, however, produced significantly more IFN-gamma than those derived from similarly infected IL-4 +/+ mice, suggesting that Th1-influenced responses predominated in IL-4 -/- mice. Moreover, inflamed hearts from IL-4 -/- mice displayed higher levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha transcripts as compared to IL-4 +/+ mice. At both time points antigen-stimulated splenocytes from IL-4 +/+ and IL-4 -/- mice produced significant amounts of IL-10 but those from IL-4 +/+ mice produced either no or little IL-4. Histopathology demonstrated typical Lyme carditis in both IL-4 +/+ and IL-4 -/- mice at day 15 and day 30. Although Borrelia-infected IL-4 -/- mice developed a more severe carditis on day 30, the carditis resolved by day 50, as it did in IL4 +/+ mice. These results indicate that although IL-4 may help limit the severity of Lyme carditis, its absence does not preclude resolution of cardiac lesions."

Zymography showed MMP-9 activity in 26 of 31 (84%) CSF samples from patients with acute stage 2 Lyme neuroborreliosis, but not in 20 controls with non-inflammatory neurological disorders. Activity of MMP-2 was detected in all CSF samples in both patients with neuroborreliosis and controls, suggesting a constitutive release of MMP-2. Using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) MMP-3 (which can activate MMP-9) was detected in low concentrations in the CSF of 13 of 29 patients with neuroborreliosis, but not in controls. TIMP-1 was increased twofold in CSF samples from patients with neuroborreliosis in comparison with the controls. MMP-9 activity was induced in vitro in a mouse macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7) when stimulated with two different genospecies of B burgdorferi (B garinii, B afzelii ). This MMP-9 activity was reduced in a dose dependent manner when macrophages stimulated with B burgdorferi were coincubated with NF-kappaB SN50, a cell permeable peptide which inhibits the translocation of NF-kappaB into the nucleus of stimulated cells. The data show that (1) MMP-9 activity is present in the CSF of patients with neuroborreliosis, (2) macrophages stimulated with B burgdorferi are a possible source of MMP-9 increase, and (3) activation of NF-kappaB may play a part in the upregulation of MMP-9 by B burgdorferi."

The lipid component of these lipoproteins is relevant for the immunogenicity of Bb-lipoproteins. To characterize the antigenic properties, the native lipid component of lipoproteins was isolated and the detailed molecular structure was analyzed. The molecular structure of the lipoprotein-lipid component turned out to be S(propane-2',-3'diol)-3-thio-2-aminopropanic acid (S-glyceryl-cysteine) with one ester-linked fatty acid, one acetyl group, and one N-terminal amide-bound fatty acid. Fatty acid analysis of the lipid component indicated a heterogeneous composition comprising C16:0, C18:0, C18:1, C18:2, and C 20:0. The antigenicity was tested with in vitro bioassays using human blood-derived dendritic cells (DCs) as antigen-presenting cells and autologous Bb-specific T-cells. We found that human DCs present the lipid component of Bb-lipoproteins via MHC class II inducing an antigen-specific T-cell immune response in vitro."

		"abstract": "We have determined that Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 MI carries 21 extrachromosomal DNA elements, the largest number known for any bacterium. Among these are 12 linear and nine circular plasmids, whose sequences total 610 694 bp. We report here the nucleotide sequence of three linear and seven circular plasmids (comprising 290 546 bp) in this infectious isolate. This completes the genome sequencing project for this organism; its genome size is 1 521 419 bp (plus about 2000 bp of undetermined telomeric sequences). Analysis of the sequence implies that there has been extensive and sometimes rather recent DNA rearrangement among a number of the linear plasmids. Many of these events appear to have been mediated by recombinational processes that formed duplications. These many regions of similarity are reflected in the fact that most plasmid genes are members of one of the genome's 161 paralogous gene families; 107 of these gene families, which vary in size from two to 41 members, contain at least one plasmid gene. These rearrangements appear to have contributed to a surprisingly large number of apparently non-functional pseudogenes, a very unusual feature for a prokaryotic genome. The presence of these damaged genes suggests that some of the plasmids may be in a period of rapid evolution. The sequence predicts 535 plasmid genes >/=300 bp in length that may be intact and 167 apparently mutationally damaged and/or unexpressed genes (pseudogenes). The large majority, over 90%, of genes on these plasmids have no convincing similarity to genes outside Borrelia, suggesting that they perform specialized functions."

The \"molecular mimicry\" hypothesis predicts that during an infection T cells that recognize both a microbial antigen and a related self peptide become activated and cause autoimmune disease. We have systematically examined the recognition of self antigens by HLA-DR4-restricted T cells specific for peptides of the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease. We used the peptide spot synthesis technique for complete peptide substitution analyses of two immunodominant OspA epitopes. Each amino acid residue of the epitopes was substituted with all 20 naturally occurring amino acids and the altered peptides were tested for recognition by a panel of OspA-specific T cells. The binding motifs (supertopes) revealed by these analyses were used to screen public databases for matching human or murine peptides. Several hundred peptides were identified by this search and synthesized. Of these, 28 were recognized by OspA-specific T cells. Thus, T cell cross-reactivity is a common phenomenon and the existence of cross-reactive epitopes alone does not imply molecular mimicry-mediated pathology and autoimmunity."

Two-part project including a community-based longitudinal cohort study and a matched cohort study. Six hundred seventy-eight patients identified from a random sample of all reports of Connecticut residents with suspected Lyme disease submitted to the Connecticut Department of Public Health from 1984-1991 were evaluated in the longitudinal study; for a random subsample of 212 patients from the larger study, 212 age-matched controls without Lyme disease also were enrolled. Self-reports or parents' reports of symptoms and ability to perform certain daily activities since diagnosis of Lyme disease; scores on the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale, for adults, by case-definition status and between patients and controls. Of the 678 patients, 51.6% were female, 34.4% were children, and 64.3% met the national surveillance case definition for Lyme disease. Most patients (85.6%) were treated with antimicrobial agents. Interviews were conducted a median of 51 months after diagnosis (range, 15-135 months). An increased frequency of symptoms (eg, pain, fatigue) or of difficulty with daily activities (eg, performing housework, exercising) was reported by 69% of the patients, although few (19%) of these problems were attributed to Lyme disease. Whenever there was a statistically significant difference in the frequencies of either increased symptoms or increased difficulties with typical activities between those who did or did not meet the surveillance case definition, in all instances the greater frequency of problems was in the group that did not meet the case definition. The frequencies of reports of both increased symptoms and increased difficulties with typical activities among patients who had been diagnosed as having Lyme disease were similar to those among age-matched controls without Lyme disease. In this cohort, although many patients reported increases in symptoms and/or increased difficulties with typical daily activities between 1 and 11 years after diagnosis of Lyme disease, the frequencies of these reports were similar to the frequencies of such reports among age-matched controls without Lyme disease."

B. burgdorferi cells cannot synthesize fatty acids de novo and serum is thought to provide a source of fatty acids and lipids. When B. burgdorferi cells were serum-starved in defined RPMI medium, -90% of the cells formed spherical cysts within 48 h. Cyst formation was inhibited by tetracycline. Cyst opening and recovery of vegetative cells was rapidly induced by the addition of either BSKII or rabbit serum. The percentage of viable cells recovered from cysts ranged from 2.9% to 52-5%. Viability was inversely proportional to cyst age. Protein synthesis by B. burgdorferi during serum starvation was examined by labelling cells with Tran35S-Label and analysing the labelled proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and fluorography. The synthesis of over 20 proteins was induced during serum starvation. Western blots of proteins from vegetative cells and cysts probed with sera from either B. burgdorferi-infected humans or monkeys revealed that several cyst proteins were antigenic. These data suggest that cells of B. burgdorferi, although possessing a small genome and extremely limited biosynthetic capabilities, rapidly respond to conditions of serum starvation by inducing changes in protein synthesis and cell morphology. This study may help explain how cells of B. burgdorferi can survive periods of nutrient deprivation in different hosts and host tissues."

The annual number of days with minimum temperatures above vital bioclimatic thresholds for the tick's life-cycle dynamics were related to tick density in both the early 1980s and the mid-1990s in 20 districts in central and northern Sweden. The winters were markedly milder in all of the study areas in the 1990s as compared to the 1980s. Our results indicate that the reported northern shift in the distribution limit of ticks is related to fewer days during the winter seasons with low minimum temperatures, i.e., below -12 degrees C. At high latitudes, low winter temperatures had the clearest impact on tick distribution. Further south, a combination of mild winters (fewer days with minimum temperatures below -7 degrees C) and extended spring and autumn seasons (more days with minimum temperatures from 5 to 8 degrees C) was related to increases in tick density. We conclude that the relatively mild climate of the 1990s in Sweden is probably one of the primary reasons for the observed increase of density and geographic range of I. ricinus ticks."

		"abstract": "We compared the antibodies to B. burgdorferi in three different populations in order to evaluate the diagnostic reliability of Lyme borreliosis serologic analysis. The subjects included 25 patients with Lyme borreliosis (Group 1); 50 patients with diseases of unknown cause, B. burgdorferi ELISA-positive in serum and without B. burgdorferi infection (Group 2); and 1,251 individuals without Lyme borreliosis (Group 3). All samples were tested for B. burgdorferi B31 and B. afzelii antigens using ELISA. The positive results of the ELISA B. burgdorferi B31 assay were confirmed with Western blot for the same strain. In Group 3, 162 (12.9%) patients were ELISA positive for B. burgdorferi B31, while only 6 (0.6%) patients had IgG ELISA antibodies to B afzelii. Bands in WB were detected in 104 (8.4%) of the Group 3 subjects. The bands found to be most reliable for the identification of strain B. burgdorferi B31 by IgG WB were those representing the 93, 39, 34, and 23-kDa proteins. Our results show that serologic diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is far from clearly established. To date, the only reliable criteria are clinical ones correlated with laboratory evidence."

		"abstract": "B. turicatae, a causative agent of relapsing fever, carries a polymorphic gene family that is homologous to the bdr gene family of the Lyme disease spirochetes (previously referred to as the rep+ or ORF-E gene family). Here we demonstrate that bdr related genes are widely distributed among pathogenic Borrelia species and exist as large, polymorphic, plasmid carried, gene families. Twenty distinct bdr alleles were identified in isolates of the relapsing fever spirochete, B. hermsii, and were localized to linear plasmids. Cloning and sequence analyses demonstrate that the putative Bdr functional domains (i.e. the phosphorylation motifs and the transmembrane C-terminal domain) are conserved across the genus while other regions of these proteins exhibit variability. An assessment of the evolutionary relationships among all known Bdr protein sequences obtained from five pathogenic Borrelia species revealed that there are distinct Bdr sub-families. The recognition of distinct phyletic clusters serves as the basis of a revised and simplified nomenclature for the bdr proteins that can be applied genus wide. At the biological level the delineation of multiple bdr sub-families within isogeneic populations raises the possibility that there may be functional partitioning among alleles. In summary, the distribution and conservation of the Bdr proteins suggests that they are important in the biology/pathogenesis of the Borrelia at the genus wide level."

One SPF pony (pony No. 178) was first exposed to laboratory-reared nymphs without B. burgdorferi infection and 3 weeks later was exposed to B. burgdorferi-infected adult ticks with concurrent dexamethasone treatment for 5 consecutive days. Four uninfected ponies treated with dexamethasone, exposed to laboratory-reared ticks without B. burgdorferi infection served as uninfected controls. Clinical signs, bacteriologic culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacterial DNA, immunologic responses, and gross lesions and histopathologic changes were investigated during the experiment or at necropsy 9 months after tick exposure. In all of the seven challenged ponies, infection with B. burgdorferi was detected from monthly skin biopsies and various tissues at postmortem examination by culture and by PCR. However, pony No. 178 exposed to laboratory-reared nymphs (without B. burgdorferi infection) and challenged with B. burgdorferi-infected adult ticks 2 months later did not develop a B. burgdorferi infection. All of the infected ponies seroconverted. Control ponies and pony No. 178 were negative by culture, PCR, and serology. Except for skin lesions, we failed to induce any significant histopathologic changes in this study. This is the first report of successful tick-induced experimental infection in ponies by exposure to B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. This Lyme disease model will be very useful to evaluate efficacy of vaccines against the Lyme agent and the effect of antibiotic therapy on horses infected with B. burgdorferi."

Here we provide direct evidence that a major surface protein, outer surface protein A (OspA), can induce arthritis. Hamsters were vaccinated with 30, 60, or 120 microg of recombinant OspA (rOspA) in aluminum hydroxide and challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto isolate 297 or C-1-11. Swelling of the hind paws was detected in 100, 100, and 50% of hamsters vaccinated with 30, 60, or 120 microg of rOspA, respectively. In addition, arthritis developed in 57% of hamsters vaccinated with a canine rOspA vaccine after infection with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. When the canine rOspA vaccine was combined with aluminum hydroxide, all vaccinated hamsters developed arthritis after challenge with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Histopathologic examination confirmed the development of severe destructive arthritis in rOspA-vaccinated hamsters challenged with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings suggest that rOspA vaccines should be modified to eliminate epitopes of OspA responsible for the induction of arthritis. Our results are important because an rOspA vaccine in aluminum hydroxide was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in humans."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne infection in Slovenia. Skin disorders are the most frequent clinical manifestations. The aim of the present study was to assess the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of a large number of human Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato isolates and to evaluate any association between the isolates and different clinical manifestations. All 103 strains tested were from patients suffering from the skin disorders of Lyme borreliosis. Skin biopsies, cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples from patients were inoculated into modified Kelly Pettenkofer medium. Protein profiles were determined by SDS-PAGE and species identification and plasmid profiles by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. MluI digestion profiles showed that 87 (84.5%) isolates belonged to B. afzelii, 15 (14.5%) to B. garinii and 1 (1%) to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The number of plasmids in each strain varied from three to seven, and the plasmid size ranged from 15 to 65 kb. Four isolates of B. garinii possessed multiple large plasmids and four isolates had a large plasmid dimer (three B. afzelii and one B. garinii). Isolates showed qualitative and quantitative differences in protein expression. The study found differences in the expression of OspB and OspC proteins between B. afzelii and B. garinii strains. OspB was expressed significantly more often by B. afzelii (78 of 87, 89.6%) than by B. garinii (4 of 15, 26.6%) isolates, while OspC protein was expressed significantly more often by B. garinii (14 of 15, 93.3%) than by B. afzelii (51 of 87, 58.6%) isolates. In Slovenia, B. afzelii causes the majority of skin lesions. The isolates investigated showed plasmid and protein diversity. Heterogeneity of the spirochaetes may be important for virulence, and may have implications for pathogenesis and therapy of the infection. Differences in immunodominant proteins also have an important impact on serological testing and vaccine development."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease-associated spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is maintained in enzootic cycles involving Ixodes ticks and small mammals. Previous studies demonstrated that B. burgdorferi expresses outer surface protein A (OspA) but not OspC when residing in the midgut of unfed ticks. However, after ticks feed on blood, some spirochetes stop making OspA and express OspC. Our current work examined the timing and frequency of OspA and OspC expression by B. burgdorferi in infected Ixodes scapularis nymphs as they fed on uninfected mice and in uninfected I. scapularis larvae and nymphs as they first acquired spirochetes from infected mice. Smears of midguts from previously infected ticks were prepared at 12- or 24-h intervals following attachment through repletion at 96 h, and spirochetes were stained for immunofluorescence for detection of antibodies to OspA and OspC. As shown previously, prior to feeding spirochetes in nymphs expressed OspA but not OspC. During nymphal feeding, however, the proportion of spirochetes expressing OspA decreased, while spirochetes expressing OspC became detectable. In fact, spirochetes rapidly began to express OspC, with the greatest proportion of spirochetes having this protein at 48 h of attachment and then with the proportion decreasing significantly by the time that the ticks had completed feeding. In vitro cultivation of the spirochete at different temperatures showed OspC to be most abundant when the spirochetes were grown at 37 degrees C. Yet, the synthesis of this protein waned with continuous passage at this temperature. Immunofluorescence staining of spirochetes in smears of midguts from larvae and nymphs still attached or having completed feeding on infected mice demonstrated that OspA but not OspC was produced by these spirochetes recently acquired from mice. Therefore, the temporal synthesis of OspC by spirochetes only in feeding ticks that were infected prior to the blood meal suggests that this surface protein is involved in transmission from tick to mammal but not from mammal to tick."

Vaccination with OspA induces an antibody response that makes serologic interpretation of infection with B. burgdorferi difficult, especially by screening tests based on whole-cell preparations of B. burgdorferi. We show that an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto 50772, which lacks the plasmid encoding OspA and OspB, or a full-length recombinant OspC protein can identify patients infected with B. burgdorferi. We found that 69 and 65% of serum samples from patients with case-defined early Lyme borreliosis had anti-B. burgdorferi sensu stricto 50772 and anti-OspC reactivities, respectively. In addition, little or no reactivity was detected with sera obtained from individuals vaccinated with OspA. Unfortunately, 51 and 33% of sera from healthy patients and sera from patients with other illnesses were also reactive against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto 50772 and OspC, respectively. Although these assays can discriminate B. burgdorferi infection from vaccination with OspA, their lack of specificity highlights the necessity for confirming equivocal or positive reactivities with more specific serodiagnostic tests."

All isolates were screened immunologically by indirect immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies to B. burgdorferi-specific outer surface protein A (OspA) (antibodies H5332 and H3TS) and B. burgdorferi-specific OspB (antibodies H6831 and H614), a Borrelia (genus)-specific antiflagellin antibody (H9724), Borrelia hermsii-specific antibodies (H9826 and H4825), and two polyclonal antibodies (one to Borrelia species and another to B. burgdorferi). Six of the isolates were analyzed by exposing Western blots to monoclonal antibodies H5332, H3TS, H6831, and H9724. All isolates were also analyzed by PCR with five pairs of primers known to amplify selected DNA target sequences specifically reported to be present in the reference strain, B. burgdorferi B-31. The protein profiles of six of the isolates (two from ticks, one from a cotton mouse, two from wood rats, and one from a cotton rat) also were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We conclude that the 28 Charleston isolates are B. burgdorferi sensu stricto based on their similarities to the B. burgdorferi B-31 reference strain."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is currently the most frequently reported vector-borne illness in the United States, accounting for more than 95% of such cases. The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations for preventing Lyme disease, including the use of Lyme disease vaccine. Individuals can reduce their risk of Lyme disease by avoiding tick-infested habitats when in endemic areas. If exposure to tick-infested habitats cannot be avoided, individuals may reduce their risk of infection by using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and regularly checking for and removing attached ticks. Morbidity from Lyme disease can be reduced significantly by detecting and treating the infection in its early stages; early and appropriate treatment almost always results in a prompt and uncomplicated cure. A Lyme disease vaccine (LYMErix, SmithKline Beecham, Collegeville, PA) was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 21, 1998, for persons 15 to 70 years of age. This vaccine seems to be safe and effective, but whether its use is cost-effective has yet to be clearly established. Use of this vaccine causes false-positive enzyme immunoassay results for Lyme disease. Lyme disease can be diagnosed in vaccinated persons by immunoblot testing. Decisions about the use of this vaccine should be based on an assessment of a person's risk as determined by activities and behaviors relating to tick exposure in endemic areas. This vaccine should be considered an adjunct to, not a replacement for, the practice of personal protective measures against tick exposure and the early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi-infected ticks were fed on either OspC-immunized mice or normal, nonimmunized mice. After 72 h, the ticks were detached, followed by dissection and subsequent culturing in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelley II medium of the salivary glands from each tick to determine the presence of borreliae. Forty percent (10 of 25) of salivary glands from ticks that had fed on nonimmunized mice were culture positive, while only 7.4% (2 of 27) of salivary glands from ticks that had fed on OspC-immunized mice were culture positive, thus indicating a much reduced borrelial migration from the midgut when the bloodmeal contained anti-OspC antibodies. Fluorescent antibody staining of the corresponding midguts from ticks that had fed on the OspC-immunized mice showed that borreliae were present but did not produce OspC. In contrast, borreliae in midguts from ticks that had fed on normal mice demonstrated substantial ospC expression. This study provides evidence that, during tick feeding on an OspC-immunized host, transmission of borreliae from the tick is prevented; it also suggests that OspC functions in a tick-to-host transmission mechanism."
