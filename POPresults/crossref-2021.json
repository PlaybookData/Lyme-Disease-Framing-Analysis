		"abstract": "Babesiosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by apicomplexan parasites of the genus Babesia. With its increasing incidence worldwide and the risk of human-to-human transmission through blood transfusion, babesiosis is becoming a rising public health concern. The current arsenal for the treatment of human babesiosis is limited and consists of combinations of atovaquone and azithromycin or clindamycin and quinine. These combination therapies were not designed based on biological criteria unique to Babesia parasites, but were rather repurposed based on their well-established efficacy against other apicomplexan parasites. However, these compounds are associated with mild or severe adverse events and a rapid emergence of drug resistance, thus highlighting the need for new therapeutic strategies that are specifically tailored to Babesia parasites. Herein, we review ongoing babesiosis therapeutic and management strategies and their limitations, and further review current efforts to develop new, effective, and safer therapies for the treatment of this disease."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The most commonly reported vector-borne and tick-borne disease in the United States is Lyme disease. Individuals with Lyme disease may present with a wide array of symptoms with resultant musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiac manifestations that may cause them to seek physical therapist services. The symptoms may develop insidiously and with a variable presentation among individuals. Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose individuals early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that individuals may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to individuals for whom referral is recommended."

Lyme carditis is a potentially life-threatening complication after infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. This is shown in the discussed case of a 51-year-old sportive man who registered for a consultation after a brutal syncope. Under antibiotic therapy, the severe conduction disturbances progressively cleared up and a permanent pacemaker could be avoided."

According to ECDC, Poland should be considered as an endemic area. The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin ‘Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018’ . RESULTS. In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

In short order it was discovered that multiple microbes have the potential of triggering mental health issues in children and adolescents, and the nomenclature was updated to Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) [3]. The microbes that thus far have been associated with PANS include herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus, varicella virus, HIV, recurrent sinusitis, Epstein-Barr virus, the common cold, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bartonella henselae [4-6]."

		"abstract": "In recent years, an increase in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease (LD)) has been noted in the world, which causes the need for constant epidemic and clinical alertness. The causative agent of LD is Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, transmitting agents are Ixodes ricinus mites. Migratory erythema appears at the site of mite suction, which is a marker of cutaneous manifestation of LD — an early localized (І) stage of the disease. In the presence of migratory erythema, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is not difficult, but in the absence of the information about tick inoculation, the diagnosis is difficult. Timely detection and treatment of LD is important to prevent chronic disease, its progression with multiorgan lesions and complications, one of which is Borrelious lymphocytoma which refers to pathognomonic cutaneous manifestations of LD as a sign of dissemination (II or III) stage.Borreliosis lymphocytoma is diagnosed by positive serological tests — detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. The localization of borreliosis lymphocytoma — ear lobes, areolas of the nipples of the mammary glands, axillary cavities, occiput, scrotum, rear feet — is of decisive importance for the diagnosis. Treatment of both migratory erythema and borreliosis lymphocytoma consists of antibiotics. A rare case of borreliosis lymphocytoma is described in a patient with the disease duration of more than 15 years with the localization of the pathological process on the skin of the left ear in the area of the lobe and around it. The treatment plan was drawn up in two directions: the first included antibiotics and a synthetic drug that inhibited the activity of T lymphocytes without affecting B lymphocytes; the second one included pathogenetic drugs that increase the production of antibodies, reduce the manifestations of secondary immunodeficiency and have an anti-inflammatory effect. The pictures of the patient in dynamics are presented as she recovers. After the therapy, the patient achieved clinical recovery."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms."

		"abstract": "SUMMARY: Lyme borreliosis is caused by a growing list of related, yet distinct, spirochetes with complex biology and sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms. It may result in a range of clinical manifestations involving different organ systems, and can lead to persistent sequelae in a subset of cases. The pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis is incompletely understood, and laboratory diagnosis, the focus of this review, requires considerable understanding to interpret the results correctly. Direct detection of the infectious agent is usually not possible or practical, necessitating a continued reliance on serologic testing. Still, some important advances have been made in the area of diagnostics, and there are many promising ideas for future assay development. This review summarizes the state of the art in laboratory diagnostics for Lyme borreliosis, provides guidance in test selection and interpretation, and highlights future directions."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common transmissible disease of tick-borne origin. This disease is a significant medical challenge due to the damage to many organs and systems and the tendency to chronicity and long-term disability in the future. Currently, there is an upward trend in the incidence of Lyme disease in Sumy Oblast. Thus, in Ukraine in 2015 the incidence was 7.96 per 100,000 population, and in 2019 it increased to 10.62. The average level of indicators was exceeded in Kyiv Oblast (29.0), Cherkasy Oblast (25.4), Vinnytsia Oblast (23.09), Sumy (25.89) Oblast, and Kyiv (2.54). The peak of tick activity in Ukraine is registered in May and has increased by 4.23 times. The maximum number of patients falls within the working population and causes significant state financial damage. The increase in the number of cases indicates a spread of Lyme disease in Sumy Oblast. In order to prevent the spread, it is necessary to study all possible causes of this disease and find ways to eliminate them. This was the ground for the creation of a unified anonymous questionnaire, which covers the main issues regarding this disease from the standpoint of different population groups. A unified anonymous \"Questionnaire for Lyme disease patients\" contains 16 multiple choice questions and an option for comments. The first group of questions concerned gender, age, and social data of respondents (the largest part of patients fell within the working population – 42.86%). The next group of questions clarified the epidemiological features of this pathology (circumstances, date, time, location, body part bitten). Most often tick bites occurred during walks in the urban forests (42.86% of cases). Most respondents reported that tick bites had happened in June and July (39.29%). Other questions were designed to determine patients' awareness about Lyme borreliosis prevention. The next group of questions was aimed at clarifying the clinical features of the disease (lower extremities were the most frequent site of a tick bite) (46.43%), with erythema dominating among the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (91.07%). According to the anonymous questionnaire, we analyzed and evaluated awareness of diagnosis, clinical signs, and measures of Lyme disease prevention in the patients who were receiving treatment at Municipal Non-Commercial Enterprise of Sumy Regional Council \"Medical Clinical Center of Infectious Diseases and Dermatology Named After Z. Krasovytskyi\" and SSU University Clinic."

Methods: Charts of pediatric and adult patients with heart block (PR interval &gt;300 ms) and positive Lyme serologies hospitalized in Portland, Maine, between January 2010 and December 2018 were analyzed. Data on medical history, presentation, treatment, and outcomes are described. Results: Ten children and 20 adults were admitted for Lyme carditis between June and October. Ninety percent were male, and 87% had no prior cardiac history. Seventeen had outpatient evaluation before admission. Of these, a minority (41%) had Lyme disease suspected in the outpatient setting, and fewer (12%) were initiated on Lyme disease treatment. The most common alternate diagnoses were viral illness and erythema multiforme. More children than adults had disseminated erythema migrans and fever. First-degree heart block was more prevalent in children, and Mobitz type 2 heart block was more prevalent in adults. Ten patients presented with syncope. Proportionately more adults needed temporary pacing. Children had shorter antibiotic durations compared with adults. Of the 30 cases, 27 had improved heart block, while 3 adults required a pacemaker at discharge. Nine children and 14 adults were discharged with a PR 200–300 ms. There was a single death in this series. Conclusions: Cases tended to be younger males. Most patients had some heart block on discharge. Of patients evaluated as outpatients, Lyme disease was suspected in 41%. Improved early recognition and treatment of Lyme disease may decrease Lyme carditis."

We collected data from an experimental group of 252 Lyme disease patients and a control group of 267 healthy individuals. The quality of life and sleep, attention and memory performance were assessed in both groups. Additionally, we investigated depressive symptoms in patients with Lyme disease to examine whether the duration of the disease had an influence on the severity of symptoms shown. Furthermore, various data on the diagnostics and treatment carried out in the patient group were recorded. On average, patients visited almost eight physicians to obtain a diagnosis, and eight years passed between the tick bite and diagnosis (SD ± 7.8); less than half of the sample (46%) received their diagnosis within the first five years after the development of symptoms. It became clear that Lyme disease is often diagnosed very late. It appears that people suffering from Lyme disease have significantly lower quality of life and sleep and show cognitive impairments when it comes to attention and memory. This study shows that 3.1% of Lyme patients were satisfied with their lives and that 37% scored in the lower third of the quality-of-life scale. It was also shown that Lyme patients tend to have depressive symptoms."

Mandatory notification of acute LB manifestations (erythema migrans (EM), neuroborreliosis (NB), and Lyme arthritis (LA)) was implemented in Bavaria on 1 March 2013. We aimed to describe the epidemiological situation and to identify LB risk areas and populations. Therefore, we analyzed LB cases notified from March 2013 to December 2020 and calculated incidence (cases/100,000 inhabitants) by time, place, and person. Overall, 35,458 cases were reported during the study period (EM: 96.7%; NB: 1.7%; LA: 1.8%). The average incidence was 34.3/100,000, but annual incidence varied substantially (2015: 23.2; 2020: 47.4). Marked regional differences at the district level were observed (annual average incidence range: 4–154/100,000). The Bavarian Forest and parts of Franconia were identified as high-risk regions. Additionally, high risk for LB was found in 5–9-year-old males and in 60–69-year-old females. The first group also had the highest risk of a severe disease course. We were able to identify areas and populations in Bavaria with an increased LB risk, thereby providing a basis for targeted measures to prevent LB. Since LB vaccination is currently not available, such measures should comprise (i) avoiding tick bites, (ii) removing ticks rapidly after a bite, and (iii) treating LB early/adequately."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a growing public health problem in Qu&eacute;bec. Its emergence over the last decade is caused by environmental and anthropological factors that favour the survival of Ixodes scapularis, the vector of Lyme disease transmission. The objective of this study was to estimate the speed and direction of Lyme disease emergence in Qu&eacute;bec and to identify spatiotemporal risk patterns. A surface trend analysis was conducted to estimate the speed and direction of its emergence based upon the first detected case of Lyme disease in each municipality in Qu&eacute;bec since 2004. A cluster analysis was also conducted to identify at-risk regions across space and time. These analyses were reproduced for the date of disease onset and date of notification for each case of Lyme disease. It was estimated that Lyme disease is spreading northward in Qu&eacute;bec at a speed varying between 18 and 32 km/year according to the date of notification and the date of disease onset, respectively. A high rate of disease risk was found in seven clusters identified in the south-west of Qu&eacute;bec in the sociosanitary regions of Mont&eacute;r&eacute;gie and Estrie. The results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of Lyme disease in Qu&eacute;bec, which can be used for proactive, targeted interventions by public and clinical health authorities."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

		"abstract": "In recent decades, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in Europe seems to have increased, underpinning a growing public health concern. LB surveillance systems across the continent are heterogeneous, and the spatial and temporal patterns of LB reports have been little documented. In this study, we explored the spatio-temporal patterns of LB cases reported in France from 2016 to 2019, to describe high-risk clusters and generate hypotheses on their occurrence. The space–time K-function and the Kulldorf’s scan statistic were implemented separately for each year to evaluate space–time interaction between reported cases and searching clusters. The results show that the main spatial clusters, of radius size up to 97 km, were reported in central and northeastern France each year. In 2017–2019, spatial clusters were also identified in more southern areas (near the Alps and the Mediterranean coast). Spatio-temporal clustering occurred between May and August, over one-month to three-month windows in 2016–2017 and in 2018–2019. A strong spatio-temporal interaction was identified in 2018 within 16 km and seven days, suggesting a potential local and intense pathogen transmission process. Ongoing improved surveillance and accounting for animal hosts, vectors, meteorological factors and human behaviors are keys to further elucidate LB spatio-temporal patterns."

Case presentation: This report presents a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian female with a remote history of Lyme disease who presented with blurry vision in the right eye. Exam and imaging revealed a right active chorioretinitis and positive Lyme serology. The patient was systemically treated with prednisone and antibiotics. Symptoms initially improved, but she later developed a localized choriocapillaritis in the left eye. Steroids and antibiotics were restarted many times with fluctuating course of the disease. The patient was then started on chronic steroid-sparing immunosuppression, which has controlled the condition without recurrence. Conclusions: The current report presents a unique case of recurrent bilateral chorioretinitis with positive Lyme serology and raises the question of the existence of true Lyme-associated uveitis."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme neuroborreliosis peripheral facial palsy (LNB PFP) and idiopathic PFP, Bell’s palsy (BP), are the most common causes of facial palsy in borrelia-endemic areas and are clinically similar. Early treatment with corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in Bell’s palsy, and antibiotics improve the outcome in LNB. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how the addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment affects the outcome in LNB PFP. Methods: This prospective, open trial with historical controls was conducted at 2 large hospitals in western Sweden between 2011 and 2018. Adults who presented with LNB PFP were included in the study group and were treated with oral doxycycline 200 mg twice daily for 10 days and prednisolone 60 mg once daily for 5 days, then tapered over 5 days. The historical controls were adult patients with LNB PFP included in previous studies and treated with oral doxycycline. Both groups underwent a follow-up lumbar puncture and were followed until complete recovery or for 12 months. Results: Fifty-seven patients were included, 27 in the study group and 30 in the control group. Two patients (7%) in the study group and 6 patients (20%) in the control group suffered from sequelae at the end follow-up. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, either in the proportion of patients with sequelae or in the decline in cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cell count. Conclusions: Adjunctive corticosteroids neither improve nor impair the outcome for patients with LNB PFP treated with doxycycline."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or more over at least three adjacent audiometric frequencies occurring within a 72-h period of time. One of the causes of SSNHL could be the progressive inflammatory state caused by an infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of SSNHL caused by various factors, most importantly those potentially related to Lyme disease. Material and Methods: The study includes a group of 86 patients between the ages of 20 and 70 who were hospitalized due to SSNHL between 2017 and 2018. All of these patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological examination, including audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Results: In this group of 86 patients, nine patients presented with positive antibodies toward Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. This group was treated with antibiotics and experienced partial or complete regression of their deafness. This may suggest a relationship between SSNHL and Lyme disease. Conclusion: Infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi may contribute to the development of inflammatory and angiopathic lesions, which are a possible cause of SSNHL. The longer the duration of the infection, the greater the likelihood of permanent and irreversible changes in the vessels of the cochlea or auditory nerve. Therefore, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi should be performed during the diagnosis of SSNHL as a possible cause of this illness."

The causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, is capable of establishing a persistent infection within the host. This is despite the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. B. burgdorferi utilizes several immune evasion tactics ranging from the regulation of surface proteins, tick saliva, antimicrobial peptide resistance, and the disabling of the germinal center. This review aims to cover the various methods by which B. burgdorferi evades detection and destruction by the host immune response, examining both the innate and adaptive responses. By understanding the methods employed by B. burgdorferi to evade the host immune response, we gain a deeper knowledge of B. burgdorferi pathogenesis and Lyme disease, and gain insight into how to create novel, effective treatments."

It has a geographic distribution that makes it more frequent in certain regions like like North America and Europe. It manifests in a wide range of symptoms but is often under-investigated in patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).   Case Report: In this report, we describe a case presenting with SNHL as a manifestation of neuroborreliosis in a female adult patient suffering from Lyme disease, with multiple metachronous symptoms, including arthritis and seizures. Lyme borreliosis (LB) was clinically diagnosed and supported by positive serologic tests, along with Babesiosis. The patient was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone and azithromycin, in addition to oral atovaquone. Improvement after 4 weeks of IV ceftriaxone was noted in all aspects, including SNHL and arthritis. Conclusion: LB is a possible, but rare, etiology of hearing impairment. It has been documented that if treatment is initiated early, improvement and even complete recovery are possible. Hence, in a patient presenting with SNHL and a high index of suspicion for LB, assessment for LB is warranted."

Prior to the diagnosis of Lyme disease, the patient also met the clinical diagnostic criteria for PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Strep), with serological evidence of three distinct episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis. All three episodes of strep occurred during the 6-months interval between suspected Lyme disease exposure and the onset of multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Her sometimes incapacitating symptoms followed a relapsing and remitting course that impacted her personal, family, social, and academic domains. Over a span of 31 consecutive months of treatment with various antimicrobials and three courses of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) she experienced complete remission and remains symptom free at the time of this publication. Written permission was obtained from the minor patient's mother allowing the submission and publication of this case study."

LD can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve, leading to hearing loss and vertigo/dizziness. Material and Methods: The study included a group of 38 patients between the ages of 20 and 77, who were hospitalized due to vertigo/dizziness between 2018 and 2019. All of the patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological and neurological examination, including video electronystagmography (VENG), in addition to audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of LD. Results: In 20 patients (53%), the Romberg trial was positive (p < 0.001). The degree of vestibular dysfunction as shown by the VENG test was associated with the rate of hearing loss as confirmed by the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test (p = 0.011), and it mainly concerned high-frequency sounds (p = 0.014). Conclusion: Vertigo can be a symptom of LD. It is often associated with labyrinth and hearing-organ damage, which can imply that the inner ear or nerve VIII is dysfunctional in the course of this disease. Antibiotic therapy is effective in reducing otoneurological symptoms."

Serological testing is the primary means of diagnosis but testing approaches differ widely, with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, there is currently no reliable test to determine disease resolution following treatment. A distinct challenge in Lyme disease diagnostics is the variable patterns of human immune response to a plurality of antigens presented by Borrelia spp. during the infection. Thus, multiplexed testing approaches that capture these patterns and detect serological response against multiple antigens may be the key to prompt, accurate Lyme disease diagnosis. In this review, current state-of-the-art multiplexed diagnostic approaches are presented and compared with respect to their diagnostic accuracy and their potential for monitoring response to treatment."

Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host–pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans’ habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

The cost of hospitalization due to LB for one patient in 2018 was estimated to be ~582.39 EUR, which constituted 53.10% of the average monthly salary of that year. In the analyzed period (2008–2018), the number of people treated by medical services due to Lyme disease increased, both in hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care. Although, the costs of hospitalization were the highest of the two, we noticed a change ratio between hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care in favor of the latter."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis (LC) is an early-disseminated manifestation of Lyme disease, most commonly presenting as a high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB). The degree of AVB can fluctuate rapidly within minutes, and progression to third-degree AVB is potentially fatal if not recognized and managed promptly. However, the AVB in LC is often transient and usually resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy. LC should be on the differential diagnosis in young patients presenting with new high-degree AVB and factors that increase the index of suspicion for Lyme disease. The Suspicious Index in Lyme Carditis (SILC) score helps clinicians risk-stratify for LC. A systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of LC minimizes the unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers."

We hypothesize that findings would include more slow wave (Delta/Theta) activity that is consistent with the severity reported dysfunction. Methods: Subjects consisted of four adult females with a physician provided diagnosis of NLD. EEG was recorded from 21 sites during an eyes open and eyes-closed resting conditions. Raw EEG data was made quantifiable (qEEG) through Fourier transformation to determine z-score derived cortical and subcortical slow wave activity. The RBANS was used to assess each subject’s functioning. Results: (See Imaging). Conclusions: NLD subjects within this study all demonstrated elevated subcortical frontal and frontotemporal theta and alpha. Elevation in cortical slow wave activity was found for subjects with greater reported symptomatology and may suggest either less severe course of disease or serve as a recovery marker. RBANS assessment variables were not completely sensitive in detection of subject reported challenges. Implications for conceptualization, treatment, and disease monitoring are highlighted. Directions for future research will also be discussed."

		"abstract": "Bartonellosis is caused by a Gram-negative intracellular bacterium with a zoonotic transmission. The disease, caused by any of several genospecies of Bartonella can range from a benign, self-limited condition to a highly morbid and life-threatening illness. The current standard of care antibiotics are generally effective in acute infection; these include azithromycin or erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, rifampin, and ciprofloxacin. However, treatment of chronic infection remains problematic. We tested six different antibiotics for their ability to stop the growth of Bartonella sp. in the standard insect media and in an enrichment media. All antibiotics (ceftriaxone, doxycycline, gentamycin, azithromycin, ampicillin, and azlocillin) had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) below 0.5 µg/mL in the BAPGM enrichment media but were ineffective at inhibiting growth when the standard insect media was used. Azlocillin was the most potent, with a MIC of 0.01 µg/mL. When Bartonella was tested under intracellular growth conditions, none of the antibiotics were efficacious singly. However, growth inhibition was observed when azlocillin and azithromycin were combined. These studies illustrate the impact of growth medium and intracellular environment on antibiotic susceptibility testing and indicate that azlocillin combined with azithromycin may be an effective drug combination for the treatment of Bartonellosis."

For this reason, affection of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) caused by Lyme disease (LD) can be misdiagnosed as a common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The purpose of this case report of a 25-year old woman presenting to the Departments of Orthodontics and Maxillofacial Surgery with extensive symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder is to illustrate the delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease, which was only made after extensive therapy of the temporomandibular joint. The specialist literature only reports a few cases of patients suffering from Lyme disease with TMJ manifestations. This case report and the relevant literature review aim to emphasize the importance of accurate request of medical history and differential diagnosis of acute TMJ arthritis and arthralgia. Early interdisciplinary diagnosis of Lyme disease and early antibiotic therapy are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary, sometimes invasive, therapies."

		"abstract": "Climate change is facilitating the geographic range expansion of populations of the tick vector of Lyme disease Ixodes scapularis in Canada. Here, we characterize and map the spatio-temporal variability of environments suitable for I. scapularis using Earth observation (EO) data. A simple algorithm for I. scapularis occurrence (cumulative degree-days and forest: CSDF) was developed by combining cumulative annual surface degree-days above 0 °C and forest cover. To map the environmental risk of I. scapularis (risk of I. scapularis: RIS) in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015, CSDF was adjusted using data from an I. scapularis population model. CSDF was validated using cumulative annual degree days >0 °C (CADD) from meteorological stations, and CSDF was strongly associated with CADD (n = 52, R2 > 0.86, p < 0.001). Data on field surveillance for I. scapularis ticks (2008 to 2018) were used to validate the risk maps. The presence of I. scapularis ticks was significantly associated with CSDF, and at a limit of 2800, sensitivity approached 100%. RIS increased over the study period, with the highest values in 2012 and the lowest in 2000. The RIS was on average higher in Ontario and Quebec compared to other provinces, and it was higher in the southern parts of the provinces. The proportion of the populated areas with a positive RIS increased on average in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015. Predicted I. scapularis occurrence identifies areas with a more probable risk of tick bites, Lyme disease, and other I. scapularis-borne diseases, which can help guide targeted surveillance, prevention, and control interventions."

Three etiological agents of human Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia bavariensis, and Borrelia garinii) predominantly utilize two distinct tick species as vectors in Asia (Ixodes persulcatus) and Europe (Ixodes ricinus) but how and in which order they colonized each continent remains unknown. Here, by reconstructing the evolutionary history of 142 Eurasian isolates, we show that all three Borrelia genospecies evolved from an Asian origin, suggesting that successful expansion into Europe resulted through invading a novel vector. The pattern of gene flow between continents is different between genospecies and most likely conditioned by reservoir host association and their dispersal. Our results highlight that Eurasian Lyme borreliosis agents are all capable of geographic expansion through vector shifts, but potentially differ in their capacity as emergent pathogens."

Main outcome measures: Time from Lyme disease diagnosis to consultation for any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis and for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Results: Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 py between 2000 and 2018, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018. In total 929 events of any types of fatigue were observed, i.e. an incidence rate of 307.90 per 10,000 py in the Lyme cohort (282 events) and 165.60 in the comparator cohort (647 events). Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season with highest adjusted HRs in autumn [3.14 (95%CI: 1.92 to 5.13)] and winter [2.23 (1.21 to 4.11)]. Incidence rates of ME/CFS were 11.16 per 10,000 py in Lyme patients (12 events) and 1.20 in comparators (5 events), corresponding to an adjusted HR of 16.95 (5.17 to 55.60). Effect on any types of fatigue and ME/CFS was attenuated 6 months after diagnosis but still clearly visible. Conclusions: UK primary care records provided strong evidence that Lyme disease was associated with acute and chronic fatigue. Albeit weaker, these effects persisted beyond 6 months, suggesting that patients and healthcare providers should remain alert to fatigue symptoms months to years following Lyme disease diagnosis.

		"abstract": "Abstract: There is considerable evidence that some Borrelial (Lyme spirochetal) proteins share significant antigenic properties with several thyroid-related proteins (e.g. TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase) and can induce thyroid autoimmunity, sometimes associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and perhaps also a “destructive thyroiditis” such as “silent” thyroiditis or “Hashitoxicosis.” As an acute illness, Lyme disease may also constitute a “non-thyroidal illness” capable of perturbing thyroid function tests without causing thyroid dysfunction. We report a 22-year old woman admitted with an acute paranoid schizophrenia, thyroid function tests consistent with autoimmunity, transient thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, lid-lag, brisk DTR’s) and a greatly reduced radioiodine uptake. The thyroid was not palpably enlarged, nodular or tender. On screening assay, reactivity was demonstrated to 4 of 13 Borrelial proteins. Anti-Lyme IgM but not IgG, antibodies, were positive. This was consistent with recent Lyme disease infection. Serum TSH (NL: 0.358-3.74 mcU/ml), Free T4 (NL: 0.76-1.46 ng/dl), and Free T3 (NL: 2.18-3.98 pg/ml) were, respectively: Day1: 0.087 mcU/ml (suppressed), 1.52 ng/dl (slightly elevated), 2.07 pg/ml (slightly reduced); Day2: 0.148 (suppressed), 1.18 (normal), no FT3; Day4: 0.827 (normal), no FT4 or FT3; Day5: 1.66 (normal), 0.89 (normal), 1.77 (low). Anti-Tg and Anti-Peroxidase antibodies were both moderately elevated. Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins were not elevated. The radioactive iodine uptake on Day4 was 2.8% (NL: 15-30% at 24 hr). Thyroid ultrasonogram was normal. An attractive explanation is that Lyme disease triggered a “destructive thyroiditis,” perhaps but not necessarily mediated by thyroid autoimmunity. This would account for the brief interval of thyrotoxicosis accompanied by a very low radioiodine uptake. Alternatively, Lyme disease, as an acute process, would expectedly be capable of eliciting the thyroid function abnormalities of “non-thyroidal illnesses” in general, as would acute psychosis, well-known to often resemble Graves’ disease at admission."

		"abstract": "Objectives Early clinical markers of Lyme carditis and other life-threatening prognostic factors due to complications of borreliа infection are still the beginning of active research by scientists. The literature describes a small number of cases of Lyme carditis with arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. Material and methods We reviewed the case of a 14-year-old girl. LC was diagnosed on the basis of history of disease, physical examination, laboratory examination data (positive anti-borrelia IgM in ELISA with confirmation in immunoblot. The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). 2 instrumental methods: (ECG,Echo-cor) were used. Results We described a case of Lyme borreliosis in a 14-year-old girl, accompanied by sinus bradyarrhythmia and pericardial fluid -(hydropericardium) (passed after a course of antibacterial therapy). Analysis of this case indicates early detection and adequate treatment of Lyme carditis in young people with minimal deviations of the cardiogram. A case of Lyme carditis , in a child was confirmed.Echocardiography of the heart (at the time of admission to the hospital andat the time of discharge from the hospital was made. Conclusions 1. Lyme carditis should be suspected in patients with a history of Lyme disease and minimal Electrocardiographic abnormalities , such as sinus bradycardia. 2. For differential diagnosis of Lyme carditis, it is necessary to make ( carry out two-stage serological investigation of blood, especially using antibody screening tests by ELISA with subsequent confirmation by the Western blot assay."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is characterized by a bimodal age distribution and male predominance. We examined trends in reported cases during a 25-year period to describe changes in the populations most affected by Lyme disease in the United States. We examined demographic characteristics of people with confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 1992-2016 through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. We grouped cases into 5-year periods (1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016). We calculated the average annual incidence by age and sex and used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to describe changes in Lyme disease incidence by age and sex over time. We converted patient age at time of illness into patient birth year to ascertain disease patterns according to birth cohorts. The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States doubled from 1992-1996 to 2012-2016 (IRR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.70-1.78) and increased disproportionately among males; IRRs were 39%-89% higher among males than among females for most age groups. During the study period, children aged 5-9 years were most frequently and consistently affected. In contrast, the average age of adults with Lyme disease increased over time; of all adults, people born during 1950-1964 were the most affected by Lyme disease. Our findings suggest that age-related behaviors and susceptibilities may drive infections among children, and the shifting peak among adults likely reflects a probability proportional to the relative size of the baby boom population. These findings can inform targeted and efficient public health education and intervention efforts."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is a human pathogen that is expanding its endemic zones in Europe, emerging in previously unaffected regions. In Austria, increasing incidence in alpine regions in the west has been countered by a decline in traditional endemic areas to the east of the country. Aim: To shed light on the cause of this disparity, we compared the temporal changes of human TBE incidences in all federal provinces of Austria with those of Lyme borreliosis (LB), which has the same tick vector and rodent reservoir. Methods: This comparative analysis was based on the surveillance of hospitalised TBE cases by the National Reference Center for TBE and on the analysis of hospitalised LB cases from hospital discharge records across all of Austria from 2005 to 2018. Results: The incidences of the two diseases and their annual fluctuations were not geographically concordant. Neither the decline in TBE in the eastern lowlands nor the increase in western alpine regions is paralleled by similar changes in the incidence of LB. Conclusion: The discrepancy between changes in incidence of TBE and LB support the contributions of virus-specific factors beyond the mere availability of tick vectors and/or human outdoor activity, which are a prerequisite for the transmission of both diseases. A better understanding of parameters controlling human pathogenicity and the maintenance of TBE virus in its natural vector−host cycle will generate further insights into the focal nature of TBE and can potentially improve forecasts of TBE risk on smaller regional scales."

		"abstract": "Abstract: As opposed to pathogens passively circulating in the body fluids of their host, pathogenic species within the Spirochetes phylum are able to actively coordinate their movement in the host to cause systemic infections. Based on the unique morphology and high motility of spirochetes, we hypothesized that their surface adhesive molecules might be suitably adapted to aid in their dissemination strategies. Designing a system that mimics natural environmental signals, which many spirochetes face during their infectious cycle, we observed that a subset of their surface proteins, particularly Decorin binding protein (Dbp) A/B, can strongly enhance the motility of spirochetes in the extracellular matrix of the host. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we disentangled the mechanistic details of DbpA/B and decorin/laminin interactions. Our results show that spirochetes are able to leverage a wide variety of adhesion strategies through force-tuning transient molecular binding to extracellular matrix components, which concertedly enhance spirochetal dissemination through the host."

		"abstract": "Background: Some subjective symptoms may be reported at all stages of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and may persist for several months after treatment. Nonspecific symptoms without any objective manifestation of LB are sometimes attributed by patients to a possible tick bite. The aim of our study was to explore the perceptions, representations, and experiences that these patients had of their disease and care paths. Methods: We performed a qualitative study through individual interviews (October 2017–May 2018), based on grounded theory, following the COREQ checklist. A balanced sample of patients with diverse profiles was recruited at consultations with general practitioners and infectious disease physicians. Results: Twelve patients were interviewed. Data saturation was reached at the twelfth interview. For codes, 293 were identified, and classified into 5 themes: (1) the experience of disabling nonspecific symptoms, especially pain, causing confusion and fear, (2) long and difficult care paths for the majority of the patients, experienced as an obstacle course, (3) a break with the previous state of health, causing a negative impact on every sphere of the patient’s life, (4) empowerment of the patients and the self-management of their disease, and (5) the strong expression of a desire for change, with better listening, greater recognition of the symptoms, and simpler care paths. Conclusions: This study allows for the understanding of a patient’s behaviours and the obstacles encountered, the way they are perceived, and the necessary solutions. The patients’ expectations identified here could help physicians better understand the doctor–patient relationship in these complex management situations, which would reduce the burden of the disease. The current development of specialised reference centres could help meet the patients’ demands and those of family physicians."

The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. Methods: In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli’s DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. Results: A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Conclusions: Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Lyme disease infection among forestry workers in National Park Offices in South Korea. We enrolled National Park Office forestry workers (NPOFWs) who had worked for ≥1 year. Participants completed questionnaires that addressed various subjects including work types and work hygiene-related factors. Collected serum samples were tested using immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Borrelia antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors of seroprevalence. Of 1,410 NPOFWs, 655 (46.5%) participated in this study, and an overall seroprevalence of Lyme disease antibodies was 8.1%. Analysis showed that always eating meals in woodland (odds ratio (OR), 5.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08–12.52) and raising dogs outside homes (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57–6.75) were significantly associated with Lyme disease infection. This seroprevalence study indicates that Lyme disease is an important disease among NPOFWs in South Korea. These identified modifiable risk factors should be considered while designing preventive strategies for reducing Lyme disease infection among NPOFWs."

For this reason, affection of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) caused by Lyme disease (LD) can be misdiagnosed as a common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). Case presentation: The purpose of this case report of a 25-year-old woman presenting to the Departments of Orthodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with extensive symptoms of temporomandibular disorder is to illustrate the delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease which was only made after extensive therapy of the temporomandibular joint. The specialist literature only reports a few cases of patients suffering from Lyme disease with TMJ manifestations. Conclusion: This case report and the relevant literature review aim to emphasize the importance of accurate request of medical history and differential diagnosis of acute TMJ arthritis and arthralgia. Early interdisciplinary diagnosis of Lyme disease and early antibiotic therapy are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary, sometimes invasive, therapies."

		"abstract": "States that claim responsibility for citizens’ healthcare try to deal with knowledge uncertainties while preserving a duty of care. Production of clinical guidelines in disputed medical conditions or where uncertainty is high, is difficult. Patient groups may advocate non-credentialed evidence, contribute to debates and form alliances with established policy actors. In this context, Lyme disease, especially highly contested ‘chronic’ Lyme disease is a good case with which to examine how official governance institutions are managing diagnostic uncertainty and evidence for tests. The healthcare state has been provoked to develop extensive policy for Lyme disease. In the UK, national Health Technology Assessment agency, NICE, began a consultation process in 2016. NICE and other policy actors are moving towards more participatory modes of decision-making. The article analyses NICE’s recently published guidelines and consultation documents; patient groups’ contributions; observations of consultations and of evidence review processes; and recent Department of Health systematic reviews, including patient group participation. We draw on concepts of participatory governance, patient group activism and guideline involvement. We find an increased level of participation by patient groups in recent policy and evidence review processes, and hence legitimation of them as ‘stakeholders’, alongside a strengthened state position on pre-existing diagnostic and testing standards."

This delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease in the patient we describe resulted in disseminated infection and sixth nerve palsy. We present the use of telemedicine to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease and to provide prompt access to diagnosis and care during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in the future."

Although Bb is also found in the blood of LD patients, far less is known about how neutrophils respond to Bb in the presence of blood. In this study, we employed microfluidic tools to probe the interaction between human neutrophils and Bb and measured the activation of human neutrophils in blood samples from patients. We found that neutrophils migrate vigorously toward Bb in the presence of serum, and this process was complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage or blocking complement receptors decreased neutrophil’s ability to interact with Bb. We also found that spiking Bb directly into the blood from healthy donors induced spontaneous neutrophil motility. This response to Bb was also complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage decreased spontaneous neutrophil motility in Bb-spiked blood. Moreover, we found that neutrophils in blood samples from acute LD patients displayed spontaneous motility patterns similar to those observed in Bb-spiked samples. Neutrophil motility was more robust in blood samples from LD patients than that measured in healthy and ill controls, validating the utility of the microfluidic assay for the study of neutrophil-Bb interactions in the presence of blood."

Design: A clinical case series of patents. Setting: Participants were recruited from a single-site, Lyme disease referral clinic patient population and were evaluated by physical exam, clinical laboratory testing and standardised questionnaires. Participants: Two hundred and twelve participants met study criteria for PTLD, with medical record-confirmed prior Lyme disease as well as current symptoms and functional impact. Results: Exploratory factor analysis classified 30 self-reported symptoms into 6 factors: ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Ocular Disequilibrium’, ‘Infection-Type’, ‘Mood-Related’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Neurologic’. A final latent profile analysis was conducted using ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Mood-Related’ factor-based scores, which produced three emergent symptom profiles, and participants were classified into corresponding subgroups with 59.0%, 18.9% and 22.2% of the sample, respectively. Compared with the other two groups, subgroup 1 had similarly low levels across all factors relative to the sample as a whole, and reported lower rates of disability (1.6% vs 10.0%, 12.8%; q=0.126, 0.035) and higher self-efficacy (median: 7.5 vs 6.0, 5.3; q=0.068,<0.001). Subgroup 2 had the highest ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ factor-based scores (q≤0.001). Subgroup 3 was characterised overall by higher symptom factor-based scores, and reported higher depression (q≤0.001). Conclusions: This analysis identified six symptom factors and three potentially clinically relevant subgroups among patients with well-characterised PTLD. We found that these subgroups were differentiated not only by symptom phenotype, but also by a range of other factors. This may serve as an initial step towards engaging with the symptom heterogeneity that has long been observed among patients with this condition."

Many have argued that a health frame increases engagement, as do visual methodologies including online and interactive platforms, yet to date there has been limited research on audience responses to health messaging using visual interventions. This study explores public attitudes regarding communication tools focused on climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease through six focus groups (n = 61) in rural and urban southern Manitoba, Canada. The results add to the growing evidence of the efficacy of visual and storytelling methods in climate communications and argues for a continuum of mediums: moving from video, text, to maps. Findings underscore the importance of tailoring both communication messages and mediums to increase uptake of adaptive health and environmental behaviours, for some audiences bridging health and climate change while for others strategically decoupling them."

		"abstract": "In children, tick-borne encephalitis and neuroborreliosis are common infections affecting the central nervous system. As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT: Microparasites selectively adapt in some hosts, known as host tropism. Transmitted through ticks and carried mainly by mammals and birds, the Lyme disease (LD) bacterium is a well-suited model to study such tropism. LD bacteria species vary in host ranges through mechanisms eluding characterization. By feeding ticks infected with different LD bacteria species, utilizing feeding chambers and live mice and quail, we found species-level differences of bacterial transmission. These differences localize on the tick blood meal, and complement, a defense in vertebrate blood, and a bacterial polymorphic protein, CspA, which inactivates complement by binding to a host complement inhibitor, FH. CspA selectively confers bacterial transmission to vertebrates that produce FH capable of allele-specific recognition. Phylogenetic analyses revealed convergent evolution as the driver of such findings, which likely emerged during the last glacial maximum. Our results identify LD bacterial determinants of host tropism, defining an evolutionary mechanism that shapes host-microparasite associations."

		"abstract": "We previously isolated and cultivated the novel Rickettsia raoultii strain Jongejan. This prompted us to ask whether this strain is unique or more widely present in Austria. To assess this issue, we retrospectively screened ticks collected from dogs in 2008. Of these collected ticks, we randomly selected 75 (47 females and 28 males) Dermacentor reticulatus, 44 (21 females, 7 males, and 16 nymphs) Haemaphysalis concinna, and 55 (52 females and 3 males) ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. Subsequently, these ticks were individually screened for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using the reverse line blot hybridization assay. In our current study, we detected DNA from the following microbes in D. reticulatus: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia valaisiana, and R. raoultii, all of which were R. raoultii strain Jongejan. In H. concinna, we found DNA of a Babesia sp., Rickettsia helvetica, and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli. Lastly, I. ricinus was positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii/Borrelia bavariensis, B. lusitaniae, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica, Rickettsia monacensis, and Theileria (Babesia) microti DNA. The detection of DNA of the Babesia sp. and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli, both found in H. concinna ticks, is novel for Austria."

		"abstract": "Background: Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods: A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results: Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions: This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

		"abstract": "Background: Most European and American countries recently updated their guidelines on Lyme borreliosis (LB). The aim of this study was to provide a comparative overview of existing guidelines on the treatment of LB in Europe and America and to assess the methodological quality of their elaboration. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and the national databases of scientific societies from 2014 to 2020. Quality was assessed by two independent reviewers using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. Results: Twelve guidelines were included. The scores for the AGREE II domains (median ± IQR) were: overall assessment 100 ± 22, scope and purpose 85 ± 46, stakeholder involvement 88 ± 48, rigour of development 67 ± 35, clarity of presentation 81 ± 36, applicability 73 ± 52 and editorial independence 79% ± 54%. Cohen’s weighted kappa showed a high agreement (K = 0.90, 95%CI 0.84–0.96). Guidelines were quite homogeneous regarding the recommended molecules (mostly doxycycline in the first intention and ceftriaxone in the second intention), their duration (10 to 28 days), and their dosage. The differences were due to the lack of well-conducted comparative trials. The International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) guidelines were the only ones to suggest longer antibiotics based on an expert consensus. Conclusion: European and American guidelines for the treatment of LB were quite homogeneous but based on moderate- to low-evidence studies. Well-conducted comparative trials are needed to assess the best molecules, the optimal duration and the most effective doses."

However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later “febrile patients”) based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

		"abstract": "In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of"

Compared to spirochetemic Slovenian EM patients infected with B. afzelii, US patients with a positive blood culture significantly less often recalled a preceding tick bite at the site of the EM skin lesion, had a shorter duration of EM prior to diagnosis and more often had multiple EM lesions, regional lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, an increased ESR value, a low blood lymphocyte count and detectable borrelia antibodies in acute and convalescent phase blood samples. Similar differences were observed when US patients were compared to Slovenian patients with B. garinii infection, but not all reached statistical significance. The findings are comparable to those previously reported for the corresponding skin culture positive patients and do not support the hypothesis that a higher frequency of spirochetemia at the time of presentation in US patients with EM, compared with European EM patients, is the reason for the observed differences."

At each visit, RNA-sequencing was applied to profile patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in addition to extensive clinical phenotyping. Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications. We show that Lyme patients can be distinguished from the controls as well as from COVID-19 patients, but classification was not successful in distinguishing those patients with early Lyme disease cases that would advance to develop post-treatment persistent symptoms."

We evaluated the response before and after appropriate antibiotic therapy in adolescent and adult subjects with more diverse stages of the illness. Methods: Blood was obtained from patients with clinician-identified Lyme disease with constitutional complaints, erythema migrans, nerve palsy, cardiac abnormality, or arthritis before (n = 68) and 6 weeks (n = 46) and 6 months (n = 45) after therapy. The sera were tested for Lyme disease by standard 2-tiered testing (STTT) and anti–C6 antibodies by ELISA and the levels of IFN-γ in the blood samples were detected by QuantiFERON ELISA. Results: A positive STTT result supported the clinical diagnosis of 37 (54%) subjects and anti-C6 antibodies were detected in 45 (66%) subjects, including 36 (97%) STTT-positive subjects, and the responses often persisted or expanded after antibiotic therapy. IFN-γ was detected in 49 (72%) subjects prior to treatment and the response most often significantly decreased 6 weeks (P = .007) or 6 months (P = .001) after treatment. Conclusions: The QuantiFERON ELISA reliably detected IFN-γ in blood samples from adult and adolescent patients with varying stages of Lyme disease and the response disappeared rapidly after treatment. Additional studies to more critically evaluate clinical utility as a laboratory test for diagnosis and confirmation of effective therapy are warranted."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. While Lyme disease vectors are widespread, high incidence states are concentrated in the Northeast, North Central and Mid-Atlantic regions. Mapping the distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes in ticks may aid in providing data-driven explanations of epidemiological trends and recommendations for targeting prevention strategies to communities at risk. We compiled data from the literature, publicly available tickborne pathogen surveillance databases, and internal CDC pathogen testing databases to map the county-level distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes reported in host-seeking Ixodes pacificus and Ixodes scapularis across the contiguous United States. We report B. burgdorferi s.s.-infected I. scapularis from 384 counties spanning 26 eastern states located primarily in the North Central, Northeastern, and Mid-Atlantic regions, and in I. pacificus from 20 counties spanning 2 western states, with most records reported from northern and north-coastal California. Borrelia mayonii was reported in I. scapularis in 10 counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the North Central United States, where records of B. burgdorferi s.s. were also reported. In comparison to a broad distribution of vector ticks, the resulting map shows a more limited distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes."

The specific aim of this study was to gain a qualitative understanding of frontline and primary care providers’ knowledge and practices for identifying TBDs in patients. Methods: From fall 2018 to spring 2019, three focus groups were conducted with primary care providers practicing in a small-town community endemic to Lyme disease (LD) and with emerging incidence of additional TBDs. A follow up online survey was distributed to urgent and emergency care providers in the small-town community and an academic medical center within the referral network of the local clinical community in spring and summer 2019. Qualitative analysis of focus group data was performed following a grounded theory approach and survey responses were analyzed through the calculation of descriptive statistics. Results: Fourteen clinicians from three primary care practices participated in focus groups, and 24 urgent and emergency care clinicians completed the survey questionnaire. Four overarching themes emerged from focus group data which were corroborated by survey data. Themes highlighted a moderate level of awareness on diagnosis and treatment of LD among participants and limited knowledge of diagnosis and treatment for two other regionally relevant TBDs, anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Providers described challenges and frustrations in counseling patients with strong preconceptions of LD diagnosis and treatment in the context of chronic infection. Providers desired additional point-of-care resources to facilitate patient education and correct misinformation on the diagnosis and treatment of TBDs. Conclusions: Through this small study, it appears that clinicians in the small-town and academic medical center settings are experiencing uncertainties related to TBD recognition, diagnosis, and patient communication. These findings can inform the development of point-of-care resources to aid in patient-provider communication regarding TBDs and inform the development of continuing medical education programs for frontline and primary care providers."

There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Methods: Over a 15-year period (2004–2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of Results: We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with Conclusions: Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis."

Though human infection is mostly transmitted in a limited geography, the range has expanded in recent years. One notable area of recent expansion is in the mountainous region of southwestern Virginia. The ecological factors that facilitate or constrain the range of human Lyme disease in this region remain uncertain. To evaluate this further, we obtained ecological data, including remotely sensed data on forest structure and vegetation, weather data, and elevation. These data were aggregated within the census block groups of a 9,153 km2 area around the cities of Blacksburg and Roanoke, VA, an area with heterogeneous Lyme disease transmission. In this geographic area, 755 individuals were reported to have Lyme disease in the 10 yr from 2006 to 2015, and these cases were aggregated by block group. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to evaluate which environmental variables influenced the abundance of Lyme disease cases. Higher elevation and higher vegetation density had the greatest effect size on the abundance of Lyme disease. Measures of forest edge, forest integrity, temperature, and humidity were not associated with Lyme disease cases. Future southward expansion of Lyme disease into the southeastern states may be most likely in ecologically similar mountainous areas."

Here, we show that a mutation in the Babesia microti mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) that confers resistance to the antibabesial drug ELQ-502 decreases parasite fitness in the arthropod vector. Interestingly, whereas the mutant allele does not affect B. microti fitness during the mammalian blood phase of the parasite life cycle and is genetically stable as parasite burden increases, ELQ-502–resistant mutant parasites developing in the tick vector are genetically unstable with a high rate of the wild-type allele emerging during the nymphal stage. Furthermore, we show that B. microti parasites with this mutation are transmitted from the tick to the host, raising the possibility that the frequency of Cytb resistance mutations may be decreased by passage through the tick vector, but could persist in the environment if present when ticks feed."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick–vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick–host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US."

While historically, the long-term impact of Lyme disease on patients has been controversial, mounting evidence supports the idea that a substantial number of patients experience persistent symptoms following treatment. The research community has largely lacked the necessary funding to properly advance the scientific and clinical understanding of the disease, or to develop and evaluate innovative approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Given the many outstanding questions raised into the diagnosis, clinical presentation and treatment of Lyme disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms that trigger persistent disease, there is an urgent need for more support. This review article summarizes progress over the past 5 years in our understanding of Lyme and tick-borne diseases in the United States and highlights remaining challenges."
