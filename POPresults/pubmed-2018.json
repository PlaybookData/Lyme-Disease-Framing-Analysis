		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an emerging infectious disease in Canada associated with expansion of the geographic range of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis in eastern and central Canada. A scoping review of published research was prioritized to identify and characterize the scientific evidence concerning key aspects of LD to support public health efforts. Prior to initiation of this review, an expert advisory group was surveyed to solicit insight on priority topics and scope. A pre-tested search strategy implemented in eight databases (updated September 2016) captured relevant research. Pre-tested screening and data characterization forms were completed by two independent reviewers and descriptive analysis was conducted to identify topic areas with solid evidence and knowledge gaps. Of 19,353 records screened, 2,258 relevant articles were included in the review under the following six public health focus areas: a) surveillance/monitoring in North America (n=809); b) evaluation of diagnostic tests (n=736); c) risk factors (n=545); d) public health interventions (n=205); e) public knowledge, attitudes and/or perceptions in North America (n=202); and f) the economic burden of LD or cost-benefit of interventions (n=32). The majority of research investigated Borrelia burgdorferi (n=1,664), humans (n=1,154) and Ixodes scapularis (n=459). Sufficient research was identified for potential systematic reviews in four topic areas: a) accuracy of diagnostic tests; b) risk factors for human illness; c) efficacy of LD intervention strategies; and d) prevalence and/or incidence of LD in humans or B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in vertebrate reservoirs or ticks in North America. Future primary research could focus on closing knowledge gaps, such as the role of less studied vertebrate reservoirs in the transmission cycle. Results of this scoping review can be used to quickly identify and summarize relevant research pertaining to specific questions about LD or B. burgdorferi sensu lato in humans, vertebrate hosts or vectors, providing evidence-informed information within timelines that are conducive for public health decision-making."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme disease has increased in many regions of Canada in recent years, including in Ottawa, Ontario. To date there has been limited active tick surveillance in the region. To estimate both the distribution and density of Ixodes scapularis ticks in the city of Ottawa, and the infection rates of ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi (that causes Lyme disease) and other tick-borne pathogens. Between June and October 2017, tick surveillance was conducted by drag sampling at 23 sites in Ottawa municipal parks, recreational trails and forests. Blacklegged ticks were tested for B. burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum using quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols. I. scapularis ticks were found in 16 of the 23 sites (70%). Recreational trails, conservation areas/forests and the provincial park within the city of Ottawa had significantly higher tick densities than municipal parks (p<0.01). Of the 194 adult and 26 nymphal I. scapularis tested, prevalence of infection was 29.5% for B. burgdorferi, 0.45% for B. miyamotoi and 0.91% for A. phagocytophilum. Almost 30% of I. scapularis ticks tested in suburban and rural areas of the city of Ottawa were infected with B. burgdorferi, known to cause Lyme disease. Other types of infection, known to cause anaplasmosis and tick-borne relapsing fever, were also detected, although were very rare. Conducting active tick surveillance at the local level may help to inform risk assessment and public health actions."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and, in most of North America, is transmitted by the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of the geographic range of blacklegged ticks in Ontario, increasing the risk of Lyme disease for Ontarians. To identify the number of cases and incidence rates, as well as the geographic, seasonal and demographic distribution of Lyme disease cases reported in Ontario in 2017, with comparisons to historical trends. Data for confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases with episode dates from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2017, were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). Data included public health unit (PHU) of residence, episode date, age and sex. Population data from Statistics Canada were used to calculate provincial and PHU-specific incidence rates per 100,000 population. The number of cases reported in 2017 by PHU of residence, month of occurrence, age and sex was compared to the 5-year averages for the period 2012-2016. There were 959 probable and confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in Ontario in 2017. This was three times higher than the 5-year (2012-2016) average of 313. The provincial incidence rate for 2017 was 6.7 cases per 100,000 population, although this varied markedly by PHU. The highest incidence rates were found in Leeds-Grenville and Lanark District (128.8 cases per 100,000), Kingston-Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (87.2 cases per 100,000), Hastings and Prince Edward Counties (28.6 cases per 100,000), Ottawa (18.1 cases per 100,000) and Eastern Ontario (13.5 cases per 100,000). Cases occurred mostly from June through September, were most common among males, and those aged 5-14 and 50-69 years. In 2017, Lyme disease incidence showed a marked increase in Ontario, especially in the eastern part of the province. If current weather and climate trends continue, blacklegged ticks carrying tick-borne pathogens, such as those causing Lyme disease, will continue to spread into suitable habitat. Monitoring the extent of this geographic spread will inform future clinical and public health actions to detect and mitigate the impact of Lyme disease in Ontario."

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and laboratory parameters that allow differential diagnosis of septic arthritis from non-septic arthritis in children. Fifty-four pediatric patients with atraumatic isolated knee pain were retrospectively identified at three institutions and diagnosed with septic arthritis (SA, N = 28), Lyme arthritis (LA, N = 11), or transient synovitis (TS, N = 15). Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed to identify which factors were most predictive of SA of the knee. Fever at time of presentation, a negative anti-streptolysin-O (ASO), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) > 40 mm/hr, and C-reactive protein (CRP) > 20 mg/L were the most predictive factors for distinguishing between septic arthritis (SA) and non-septic arthritis (transient synovitis or Lyme arthritis). Elevated ESR and CRP were both significantly higher in patients with SA when compared to TS or LA. When evaluating children with atraumatic isolated knee pain, a combination of the above factors should be utilized when ruling out septic arthritis."

The effective and sustainable control of these arthropod vectors is a puzzling challenge for public health worldwide. In the present review, I attempted to provide a concise and updated overview of the current mosquito and tick research scenario. The wide array of control tools recently developed has been considered, with special reference to those approved by the World Health Organization Vector Control Advisory Group (WHO VCAG), as well as novel ones with an extremely promising potential to be exploited in vector control programs. Concerning mosquitoes, a major focus has been given on genetically modified vectors, eave tubes, attractive toxic sugar baits (ATSB) and biocontrol agents. Regarding ticks, the recent development of highly effective repellents and acaricides (including nanoformulated ones) as well as behavior-based control tools, has been highlighted. In the second part of the review, key research questions about biology and control of mosquitoes and ticks have been critically formulated. A timely research agenda outlining hot issues to be addressed in mosquito and tick research is provided. Overall, it is expected that the present review will contribute to boost research and applications on successful mosquito and tick control strategies, along with an improved knowledge of their biology and ecology."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) is increasing in many countries in Europe, including Poland and Slovakia. The aim of the study was to analyze the exposure to tick bites and undertaking LB prevention activities among students of medical fields of studies in Poland (PL) and Slovakia (SK). The study was conducted among 611 students from Poland (296 students) and Slovakia (315 students). The applied research tool was the questionnaire. It consisted of questions about exposure to ticks (occurrence of an episode of tick bites, bite site, methods used for tick removal) and the frequency of undertaking preventive actions (using repellents, checking the body after returning from green areas). Pearson Chi-square statistics were calculated to assess significant differences between students from the study countries PL/SK and gender in each country. Among surveyed students the episode of a tick bite was reported by 352 persons (57.6%). Students from PL most frequently removed ticks with tweezers with a swift, steady movement (26.6%), while students from SK removed the tick by applying a fatty substance so that it would come off by itself (30.1%). Most of the surveyed students, being outdoors, did not apply ticks repellents (34.7%) or used them rarely (48.9%). At the same time, 49.4% of students stated that they always checked the body to search for any attached tick after returning from green areas. Considering the fact that the surveyed people were the students of medical fields of studies, and in the future became qualified medical personnel, the frequency of using the analyzed methods of prophylaxis of LB appears to be too small. The results obtained can help in the education of students of medical fields."

A large population of outdoor living dogs in Belgrade, Serbia's' capital, present an excellent population for epidemiology study. Blood samples were collected from 111 dogs, including 46 shelter, 31 free roaming, and 34 hunting dogs. Species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) was applied for the molecular detection of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli. A research based SNAP assay (SNAP® M-A, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) that uses genus and species-specific peptides was used to asses Anaplasma spp., A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia spp., E. canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii and Borrelia burgdorferi antibody status. B. canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli antibody status was assessed with an indirect immunofluorescence test (MegaCor Diagnostic, Horbranz, Austria). Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. DNA was not amplified. One quarter of the dogs were A. phagocytophilum, one dog was A. platys, one was E. ewingii and two dogs were B. burgdorferi seroreactive with the SNAP® M-A. Babesia canis or B. gibsoni DNA was amplified by PCR from 16.2% of dogs, whereas 67.6% were seroreactive to one or more Babesia spp. Babesia vogeli was not PCR amplified. We conclude that outdoor dogs in this territory are reservoirs for B. canis and B. gibsoni and are frequently co-exposed to combinations of Anaplasma and Babesia spp."

However, the differential diagnosis can be broad with conditions that mimic this disease and require different evaluation and treatment. This narrative review presents the emergency medicine evaluation and management, as well as important medical conditions that may mimic this disease. Septic arthritis commonly presents with monoarticular joint pain with erythema, warmth, swelling, and pain on palpation and movement. Fever is present in many patients, though most are low grade. Blood testing and imaging may assist with the diagnosis, but the gold standard is joint aspiration. Management includes intravenous antibiotics and orthopedic surgery consult for operative management vs. serial aspirations. Clinicians should consider mimics, such as abscess, avascular necrosis, cellulitis, crystal-induced arthropathies, Lyme disease, malignancy, osteomyelitis, reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and transient synovitis. While monoarticular arthritis can be due to septic arthritis, other medical and surgical conditions present similarly and require different management. It is essential for the emergency clinician to be aware how to diagnose and treat these mimics."

The aim of the cross-sectional study was to analyze the LD incidence on the basis of the presence of specific antibodies in the serum of patients in Eastern Slovakia, and to compare the results of serological ELISA and immunoblot assays. Venous blood with questionnaires was obtained by field sampling of respondents from Eastern Slovakia. Overall, we examined 537 human sera by the ELISA and for confirmation we tested all positive IgG antibodies against the Borrelia immunoblot assay. Our results confirmed the high serum prevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies (17.9% for IgG), while the immunoblot seropositive test was confirmed in 69.8% of responders from ELISA IgG positive sera. Positive antibodies of the IgM class were found in 7.6% of the population under study. Most commonly found were antibodies against VlsE (80.2%), p41 (66.7%), p18 (56.3%), p100 (41.7%), p58 (31.3%), and p39 (30.2%). It should be noted that detection of antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. is only an indirect evidence of the presence of this bacterium in the development of clinical signs of LD in humans. Laboratory LD tests should be performed in accordance with valid standards, positive and uncertain results must be confirmed by the Western Blot/Immunoblot assay."

A group of 261 adults (patients from the Neurological Clinic with possible symptoms of LB and healthy persons with possible working exposure to tick bite: gardeners and soldiers working in afforested areas) were examined in order to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies. Sera were screened by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The respondents completed questionnaires with general demographic, epidemiological and clinical data. We detected 17.2% presence of positive IgG and 5.7% presence of positive IgM antibodies in all investigated groups. Our results confirmed that the following risk factors such as age and gender are significantly associated with the presence of positive specific antibodies against investigated disease. The results of seroprevalence obtained in the present study confirm the possibility of infection with B. burgdorferi among respondents exposed to contact with ticks."

Ixodic tick-borne borreliosis in the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan is characterized by mainly erythematous forms of a disease with a medium-weight current. At the same time some increase in quantity of platelets was noted that could be caused by irritation of a megakaryocytic sprout of bone marrow in the conditions of infectious process and have compensatory character whereas other indicators of CBC and hemostasis at this clinical form practically didn't change. Not numerous cases of the ixodic tick-borne borreliosis non-erythematous forms clinically proceeded more hard, with significantly more expressed toxicinflammatory syndrome. At the same time it was followed by significant shifts in biochemical parameters, indicators of CBC and hemostasis. The clinical laboratory features of erythematous and non-erythematous forms of ixodic tick-borne borreliosis revealed as a result of the conducted researches reflect character of a course of disease and can serve for assessment of severity, the forecast of the infection and justification of this treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an important tick-borne disease which can cause a broad range of symptoms mainly affecting the skin, the nervous system and the joints. This study aims to estimate the incidence of the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium. The incidence of erythema migrans (EM) was estimated through the network of sentinel general practices at 97.6/100,000 inhabitants (uncertainty interval [UI] 82.0-113.0) for the period 2015-2017. This result was used to estimate the incidence of other LB manifestations based on their proportional distribution (ratios) to EM reported in the neighboring countries of Belgium. To estimate these ratios, we performed a systematic review of studies published between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2018 and pooled the results using a random effects meta-analysis. Six studies were retained in the systematic review, and the meta-analysis estimated the occurrence ratios for Lyme neuroborreliosis/EM, Lyme arthritis/EM and other manifestations/EM at 0.024 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.037), 0.022 (95% CI 0.020-0.024) and 0.014 (95% CI 0.012-0.016) respectively. Applying these ratios to the EM incidence in Belgium resulted in an incidence estimation of 2.4/100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 1.5-3.7) for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2.1/100,000 (95% UI 1.7-2.6) for Lyme arthritis and 1.4/100,000 (95% UI 1.1-1.7) for other less frequent manifestations. Some of these LB manifestations, other than EM, are more severe, hence these estimates are essential to assess the health burden and economic cost of LB which would be highly relevant for patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. As both over- and underestimation of different clinical LB manifestations remain possible due to characteristics of the primary surveillance systems and the disease itself, future studies to validate these estimates would be of great value."

Association with and adaption to various hosts most likely correlates with the spirochetes' ability to acquire complement regulator factor H (FH) to overcome the host's innate immune response. Here we assessed binding of serum FH from human and various animals including bovine, cat, chicken, dog, horse, mouse, rabbit, and rat to viable B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana, and B. lusitaniae. Spirochetes ectopically producing CspA orthologs of B. burgdorferi s.s., B. afzelii, and B. spielmanii, CspZ, ErpC, and ErpP, respectively, were also investigated. Our comparative analysis using viable bacterial cells revealed a striking heterogeneity among Lyme disease spirochetes regarding their FH-binding patterns that almost mirrors the serum susceptibility of the respective borrelial genospecies. Moreover, native CspA from B. burgdorferi s.s., B. afzelii, and B. spielmanii as well as CspZ were identified as key ligands of FH from human, horse, and rat origin while ErpP appears to bind dog and mouse FH and to a lesser extent human FH. By contrast, ErpC did not bind FH from human as well as from animal origin. These findings indicate a strong restriction of distinct borrelial proteins toward binding of polymorphic FH of various vertebrate hosts."

Additional diagnostics revealed signs indicative of a recent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. The patient was treated successfully with prednisolone and antibiotics. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown aetiology. This case suggests that an infection with B. burgdorferi, the causal agent of Lyme disease, could act as a trigger for sarcoidosis.

Thrombosis of veins of various localization can be one of them. Thrombosis of the portal vein represents a significant problem too with high morbidity and mortality. The risk factors for splanchnic vein thrombosis include infections, but its relationship with borreliosis has not been studied. А 34-year-old man with chronic helicobacter-associated gastritis and gallstones was hospitalized due to development during the last 11 days of epigastric pain and fever to 38.7 °C after a picnic at the forest without a registered tick bite. The blood leukocytes were increased to 11.2*109/l, lymphocytes 70%, C-reactive protein 34.6 mg/l, procalcitonin 0.195 ng/ml. The multispiral computed tomography of the abdominal cavity revealed thrombosis of portal, lienalis and superior mesenteric veins. D-dimer was 1.98 mcg/ml, antithrombin III 75%. JACK2V617F, oncological, rheumatic, thrombophilia markers, blood and urine cultures were negative. A high concentration of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgM 62.2 U/ml and its increasing to 190 U/ml in dynamics was revealed at the immunofluorescence assay. Anti-Borrelia IgM to OspA, p31 and OspC, p25 were detected at the immunoblotting assay. Anticoagulation, doxycycline, detoxification therapy reduced pain and normalized temperature and inflammation markers. Vein thrombosis was not detected at the control tomography after 2 weeks. Despite that the combination of thrombosis and borreliosis is rare, it is necessary to screen for Borrelia antigens in patients with splanchnic vein thrombosis and fever."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease can lead to neurological, cardiac, and rheumatologic complications when untreated. Timely recognition of the erythema migrans rash of acute Lyme disease by patients and clinicians is crucial to early diagnosis and treatment. Our objective in this study was to develop deep learning approaches using deep convolutional neural networks for detecting acute Lyme disease from erythema migrans images of varying quality and acquisition conditions. This study used a cross-sectional dataset of images to train a model employing a deep convolutional neural network to perform classification of erythema migrans versus other skin conditions including tinea corporis and herpes zoster, and normal, non-pathogenic skin. Evaluation of the machine's ability to classify skin types was also performed on a validation set of images. Machine performance for detecting erythema migrans was further tested against a panel of non-medical humans. Online, publicly available images of both erythema migrans and non-Lyme confounding skin lesions were mined, and combined with erythema migrans images from an ongoing, longitudinal study of participants with acute Lyme disease enrolled in 2016 and 2017 who were recruited from primary and urgent care centers. The final dataset had 1834 images, including 1718 expert clinician-curated online images from unknown individuals with erythema migrans, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, and normal skin. It also included 116 images taken of 63 research participants from the Mid-Atlantic region. Two clinicians carefully annotated all lesion images. A convenience sample of 7 non-medically-trained humans were used as a panel to compare against machine performance. We calculated several performance metrics, including accuracy and Kappa (characterizing agreement with gold standard), as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. For detecting erythema migrans, the machine had an accuracy (95% confidence interval error margin) of 86.53% (2.70), ROCAUC of 0.9510 (0.0171) and Kappa of 0.7143. Our results suggested substantial agreement between machine and clinician criterion standard. Comparison of machine with non-medical expert human performance indicated that the machine almost always exceeded acceptable specificity, and could operate with higher sensitivity. This could have benefits for prescreening prior to physician referral, earlier treatment, and reductions in morbidity."

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector borne zoonosis in the United States (U.S.). While neurologic complications of LD are common, acute transverse myelitis is an exceedingly rare complication. We present a case of a previously healthy 25-year-old man who presented with secondary erythema migrans, aseptic meningitis and clinical features of transverse myelitis including bilateral lower extremity motor and sensory deficits manifesting as weakness and numbness, urinary retention and constipation. Despite negative serum antibodies against Borrelia burgdoferi, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for Borrelia burgdorferi PCR. Following treatment with methylprednisolone and ceftriaxone, he attained complete recovery apart from neurogenic bladder necessitating intermittent self-catheterization. We report rare manifestation of a common disease and emphasize the importance of considering LD in the differential diagnosis of acute transverse myelitis, particularly in residents of endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prominent tick-borne disease with 300,000 cases estimated by CDC every year while ~2,000 cases of babesiosis occur per year in the United States. Simultaneous infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi are now the most common tick-transmitted coinfections in the U.S.A., and they are a serious health problem because coinfected patients show more intense and persisting disease symptoms. B. burgdorferi is an extracellular spirochete responsible for systemic Lyme disease while B. microti is a protozoan that infects erythrocytes and causes babesiosis. Immune status and spleen health are important for resolution of babesiosis, which is more severe and even fatal in the elderly and splenectomized patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of each pathogen on host immune response and consequently on severity of disease manifestations in both young, and 30 weeks old C3H mice. At the acute stage of infection, Th1 polarization in young mice spleen was associated with increased IFN-γ and TNF-α producing T cells and a high Tregs/Th17 ratio. Together, these changes could help in the resolution of both infections in young mice and also prevent fatality by B. microti infection as observed with WA-1 strain of Babesia. In older mature mice, Th2 polarization at acute phase of B. burgdorferi infection could play a more effective role in preventing Lyme disease symptoms. As a result, enhanced B. burgdorferi survival and increased tissue colonization results in severe Lyme arthritis only in young coinfected mice. At 3 weeks post-infection, diminished pathogen-specific antibody production in coinfected young, but not older mice, as compared to mice infected with each pathogen individually may also contribute to increased inflammation observed due to B. burgdorferi infection, thus causing persistent Lyme disease observed in coinfected mice and reported in patients. Thus, higher combined proinflammatory response to B. burgdorferi due to Th1 and Th17 cells likely reduced B. microti parasitemia significantly only in young mice later in infection, while the presence of B. microti reduced humoral immunity later in infection and enhanced tissue colonization by Lyme spirochetes in these mice even at the acute stage, thereby increasing inflammatory arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are two vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks. Both diseases are endemic and have been reported in all regions of the Czech Republic including urban agglomerations, but in varying proportions. Because of the natural conditions in the border areas, the risk of infection is also high for travelers from the neighboring countries such as Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. To gain more information on the epidemiology of LB and TBE in the last decade, we analyzed national surveillance data from 2007 to 2016. Incidence of LB in the Czech Republic was 37.3/100,000 population and year (27.6 - 46.1/100,000). Incidence of TBE incidence was 5.7/100,000 (3.4-8.2/100,000) and declined although the trend was not significant (p = 0.155). Difference between the incidences of LB and TBE was increasing in time. Overall male-to-female ratio was 0.84 and 1.51 for LB and TBE, respectively. The age-specific incidences of both infections have a typical two-peak shape, with the first peak in the age group 5-9 years for LB and 15-19 years for TBE. The second peak for both LB and TBE is in the age group 55-64 years. TBE poses a considerable risk to children < 15 years. Among 39,074 cases of LB, the most common clinical manifestations were erythema migrants 62.1% and Lyme neuroborreliosis 25.1%. All 5969 TBE cases manifested itself by affecting nervous system, namely meningo-encephalitis 47.9%, meningoencephalomyelitis 21.8% and meningitis 19.8%. The data evidence the high chance risk of infection with LB and TBE in the Czech Republic. The incidence of both infections shows a bimodal distribution during the year. LB cases are five to six times as frequent as TBE cases. Over the last years, the incidence of LB has remained roughly stable while TBE has shown a downward trend. The present study is unique in allowing the comparison of the incidence rates of LB and TBE over time and space."

The pharmaco- and immunomodulatory properties of insect and acarine saliva play an essential role in the efficiency of pathogen transmission. The skin as the site where arthropod saliva and pathogens are inoculated - represents the key interface in vector-borne diseases. We identified tick molecules potentially involved in pathogen transmission, using micro-HPLC and mass spectrometry, followed by in vitro assays on human skin cells. Histone H4 isolated from Ixodes ricinus salivary gland extract was identified as a molecule with a dissociating effect on human primary fibroblasts. This histone might be involved in the formation of the feeding pool formed around the tick mouthparts and responsible of tissue necrosis in the vertebrate host. Thanks to its selective antimicrobial activity, it may also sterilize the feeding pool and facilitate transmission of pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato."

In 2014 it was proposed that the genus Borrelia should be separated into two genera; Borrelia Swellengrebel 1907 emend. Adeolu and Gupta 2014 containing RF spirochetes and Borreliella Adeolu and Gupta 2014 containing LB group of spirochetes. In this study we conducted an analysis based on a method that is suitable for bacterial genus demarcation, the percentage of conserved proteins (POCP). We included RF group species, LB group species and two species belonging to intermittent clades, Borrelia turcica Güner et al. 2004 and Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi Loh et al. 2017. These analyses convincingly showed that all groups of spirochetes belong into one genus and we propose to emend, and re-unite all groups in, the genus Borrelia."

PCR with B5S-Bor and 23S-Bor primers resulted in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA amplification among six ticks (4.4%). The detailed analysis based on the DNA sequencing showed the presence of DNA of Borrelia afzelii in four samples; the remaining two represented Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, although their genospecies were not determined. The research confirmed the dominance of Borrelia afzelii genospecies in the ticks from Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake similar research in ticks from other regions of Ukraine. Knowledge in this field can be useful for public health and planning the prevention of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Cranial polyneuropathy is commonly caused by Lyme disease. We discuss the case of a man who presented with cranial nerve deficits causing dysphagia, dysphonia and facial weakness. This diagnostic dilemma stemmed from a workup that ruled out Lyme and vascular causes leading to an expanded search for infectious explanations, which revealed varicella zoster in the cerebrospinal fluid. On review, this phenomenon is rarely reported, but has been observed with a number of herpes family viruses. In emergency department settings, clinical suspicion should be raised for VZV infection even in the absence of rash in patients that present with multiple cranial nerve palsies."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-sucking arthropods that can transmit various pathogenic organisms to host animals and humans, causing serious infectious diseases including Lyme disease. Tick feeding induces innate and acquired immune responses in host animals, depending on the combination of different species of animals and ticks. Acquired tick resistance (ATR) can diminish the chance of pathogen transmission from infected ticks to the host. Hence, the elucidation of cellular and molecular mechanism underlying ATR is important for the development of efficient anti-tick vaccines. In this review article, we briefly overview the history of studies on ATR and summarize recent findings, particularly focusing on the role for basophils in the manifestation of ATR. In several animal species, including cattle, guinea pigs, rabbits and mice, basophil accumulation is observed at the tick re-infestation site, even though the frequency of basophils among cellular infiltrates varies in different animal species, ranging from approximately 3% in mice to 70% in guinea pigs. Skin-resident, memory CD4+ T cells contribute to the recruitment of basophils to the tick re-infestation site through production of IL-3 in mice. Depletion of basophils before the tick re-infestation abolishes ATR in guinea pigs infested with Amblyomma americanum and mice infested with Haemaphysalis longicornis, demonstrating the crucial role of basophils in the manifestation of ATR. The activation of basophils via IgE and its receptor FcεRI is essential for ATR in mice. Histamine released from activated basophils functions as an important effector molecule in murine ATR, probably through promotion of epidermal hyperplasia which interferes with tick attachment or blood feeding in the skin. Accumulating evidence suggests the following scenario. The 1st tick infestation triggers the production of IgE against tick saliva antigens in the host, and blood-circulating basophils bind such IgE on the cell surface via FcεRI. In the 2nd infestation, IgE-armed basophils are recruited to tick-feeding sites and stimulated by tick saliva antigens to release histamine that promotes epidermal hyperplasia, contributing to ATR. Further studies are needed to clarify whether this scenario in mice can be applied to ATR in other animal species and humans."

		"abstract": "In North America, Lyme disease (LD) is caused predominantly by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferisensu stricto, and is transmitted by blacklegged ticks. Long Island, New York, is highly endemic for the disease. The C6 peptide (C6P) is currently used as a screening test for LD in our institution. Our objective was to examine how screening with C6P concorded with diagnosis of LD at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Northport, Long Island. A retrospective chart-review of 2558 C6P tests was performed during the period of 1/1/2010 to 12/31/2016. Patients were categorized by Lyme Disease (LD) or no LD groups. LD group was defined as having an erythema migrans (EM) rash, or ≥ 2 IgM bands or ≥ 5 IgG bands on immunoblot. Out of the 409 patients with positive or equivocal C6P, 181 patients with LD were based on presence of EM, or Western blot IgM and IgG test results; 228 did not have LD. The positive predictive value of C6P was 44.5%. EM was the most common presentation. In the LD group, history of tick bite (P: 0.0001), headache (P: 0.0036), joint swelling (P: 0.0086) and myalgias (P: 0.0005) were more likely to be present. Zip code mapping of our cases mirrored those previously reported in the Suffolk County Department of Health. In our review we encountered a significant number of false positive C6 assays. False positive C6P tests were ordered by primary care physicians (PCP) (37%) followed by neurologists (33%). A history of tick exposure and clinical findings of early Lyme disease such as headaches or joint aches were more likely to denote a true positive C6 peptide test. Rigorous education of physicians about Lyme disease and pitfalls of our available diagnostic tests are needed for their proper utilization."

The scientific literature was systematically searched and the retrieved publications were assessed at the German Cochrane Center (Deutsches Cochrane Zentrum) in Freiburg in the 12 months beginning in March 2014. In addition to the main search terms \"Lyme disease,\" \"neuroborreliosis,\" \"Borrelia,\" and \"Bannwarth,\" 28 further terms relating to neurological manifestations of the disease were used for the search in the Medline and Embase databases and in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In the treatment of early Lyme neuroborreliosis, orally administered doxycycline is well tolerated, and its efficacy is equivalent to that of intravenously administered beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillin G, ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime) (relative risk [RR]: 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.68; 1.42], P = 0.93). 14 days of treatment suffice for early Lyme neuroborreliosis, and 14-21 days of treatment usually suffice for late (chronic) Lyme neuroborreliosis. Lyme neuroborreliosis has a favorable prognosis if treated early. The long-term administration of antibiotics over many weeks or even months for putative chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis with nonspecific symptoms yields no additional benefit and carries the risk of serious adverse effects."

Examination showed right optic atrophy and apparent left optic disc swelling. Workup revealed positive Lyme IgG. Differential diagnosis included optic neuritis and Lyme optic neuropathy, and he was treated with intravenous steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and intravenous ceftriaxone without improvement. Neuro-ophthalmology consultation led to identification of pseudo-optic disc oedema, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was suspected and confirmed by genetic testing. LHON may occur in association with MS, and should be considered in patients with MS with vision loss atypical for optic neuritis.

In a 1-year prospective study, 52 adult Lyme disease patients with erythema migrans and 104 matched control subjects were clinically assessed and completed the BDI-II at study entry and approximately 6 and 12 months later following antibiotic treatment. The mean BDI-II score was significantly higher at the baseline visit among Lyme disease patients compared with controls (P = .002), but no significant differences between the groups were observed at either the 6- or 12-month study visits. Over the course of the study, the mean BDI-II scores decreased an average of approximately 0.22 points per month (P < .0005) for Lyme disease patients, whereas the mean scores changed very little for controls (mean change = -0.02 per month, P = .50). The total number of somatic symptoms, of the 12 symptoms evaluated, strongly and directly correlated with the BDI-II scores at the baseline visit for the Lyme disease patients. The mean BDI-II scores of patients with early Lyme disease significantly exceeded that of matched controls at study entry, but by 6 months the values did not differ significantly. There was a good-to-excellent direct correlation between the BDI-II score and the total number of symptoms, suggesting that the BDI-II scores were reflecting somatic rather than affective depressive symptoms. When using the BDI-II as an assessment tool of patients with Lyme disease, infection-related somatic symptoms per se need to be considered in the interpretation of the results."

In the United States, it is estimated that medication nonadherence is associated with 125 000 deaths, 10% of hospitalizations, and $100 billion in health care services annually. PubMed was searched from January 1, 2000, to September 6, 2018, for English-language randomized clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence. Trials of patients younger than 18 years, trials that used self-report as the primary adherence outcome, and trials with follow-up periods less than 6 months were excluded; 49 trials were included. The most common methods of identifying patients at risk for nonadherence were patient self-report, electronic drug monitors (pill bottles), or pharmacy claims data to measure gaps in supply. Patient self-report is the most practical method of identifying nonadherent patients in the context of clinical care but may overestimate adherence compared with objective methods such as electronic drug monitors and pharmacy claims data. Six categories of interventions, and characteristics of successful interventions within each category, were identified: patient education (eg, recurrent and personalized telephone counseling sessions with health educators); medication regimen management (using combination pills to reduce the number of pills patients take daily); clinical pharmacist consultation for chronic disease co-management (including education, increased frequency of disease monitoring via telephone or in-person follow-up visits, and refill reminders); cognitive behavioral therapies (such as motivational interviewing by trained counselors); medication-taking reminders (such as refill reminder calls or use of electronic drug monitors for real-time monitoring and reminding); and incentives to promote adherence (such as reducing co-payments and paying patients and clinicians for achieving disease management goals). The choice of intervention to promote adherence will depend on feasibility and availability within a practice or health system. Successful interventions that are also clinically practical include using combination pills to reduce daily pill burden, clinical pharmacist consultation for disease co-management, and medication-taking reminders such as telephone calls to prompt refills (maximum observed absolute improvements in adherence of 10%, 15%, and 33%, respectively). Adherence can be assessed and improved within the context of usual clinical care, but more intensive and costly interventions that have demonstrated success will require additional investments by health systems."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia, respectively. The infection affects multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, and the nervous system. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the most dangerous manifestation of Lyme disease, occurring in 10-15% of infected individuals. During the course of the infection, bacteria migrate through the host tissues altering the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways and the immune response, reaching the central nervous system (CNS) within 2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. The early treatment with oral antimicrobials is effective in the majority of patients with LNB. Nevertheless, persistent forms of LNB are relatively common, despite targeted antibiotic therapy. It has been observed that the antibiotic resistance and the reoccurrence of Lyme disease are associated with biofilm-like aggregates in B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, both in vitro and in vivo, allowing Borrelia spp. to resist to adverse environmental conditions. Indeed, the increased tolerance to antibiotics described in the persisting forms of Borrelia spp., is strongly reminiscent of biofilm growing bacteria, suggesting a possible role of biofilm aggregates in the development of the different manifestations of Lyme disease including LNB."

		"abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) acts as a molecular rheostat for the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway of the tick Ixodes scapularis How XIAP activates the IMD pathway in response to microbial infection remains ill defined. Here, we identified the XIAP enzymatic substrate p47 as a positive regulator of the I. scapularis IMD network. XIAP polyubiquitylates p47 in a lysine 63-dependent manner and interacts with the p47 ubiquitin-like (UBX) module. p47 also binds to Kenny (IKKγ/NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)- κB kinase complex. Replacement of the amino acid lysine to arginine within the p47 linker region completely abrogated molecular interactions with Kenny. Furthermore, mitigation of p47 transcription levels through RNA interference in I. scapularis limited Kenny accumulation, reduced phosphorylation of IKKβ (IRD5), and impaired cleavage of the NF-κB molecule Relish. Accordingly, disruption of p47 expression increased microbial colonization by the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum Collectively, we highlight the importance of ticks for the elucidation of paradigms in arthropod immunology. Manipulating immune signaling cascades within I. scapularis may lead to innovative approaches to reducing the burden of tick-borne diseases."

Metabolomics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was explored as a method of differentiating among neurological diseases causing EM using a single CSF sample. 1H NMR metabolomics was applied to CSF samples from 27 patients with a laboratory-confirmed disease, including Lyme disease or West Nile Virus meningoencephalitis, multiple sclerosis, rabies, or Histoplasma meningitis, and 25 controls. Cluster analyses distinguished samples by infection status and moderately by pathogen, with shared and differentiating metabolite patterns observed among diseases. CART analysis predicted infection status with 100% sensitivity and 93% specificity. These preliminary results suggest the potential utility of CSF metabolomics as a rapid screening test to enhance diagnostic accuracies and improve patient outcomes."

		"abstract": "To describe clinical cases with neurological manifestations associated with Borrelia burgdorferi infection in a large cohort of children and adults from Mexico. Patients with neurological manifestation (cranial neuritis, radiculoneuritis, meningitis and encephalomyelitis) were recruited in one pediatric and two general hospitals, during January 2006-December 2015. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were drawn from each patient at inclusion. IgM and IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi were detected using a commercial ELISA test, and confirmed by Western-Blot test (WB) using three different antigens from Borrelia burgdorferi complex. Following CDC criteria were considered true cases with both positive tests. Of 606 patients recruited, 403 (66.5%) were adults and 203 (33.4%) children, 50.5% were male. B. burgdorferi infection was diagnosed in 168 patients (27.7%), 97 adults, mean age 42 ± 14.7 years and 71 children, mean age 9.6 ± 5 years; early disseminated disease occurred in 130 cases (77.4 %) and chronic stage in 38 (22.6 %). A previous tick bite was reported by 21% cases, and 5% recalled an erythema migrans lesion. Polyradiculoneuropathy and encephalomyelitis were the most common manifestations, whereas 14.8% presented an initial Guillain-Barré Syndrome. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was identified in 142 (84%) cases, B. garinii in 14 (8%), B. afzelii in three, and nine cases presented coinfection with two species. Lyme neuroborreliosis is a frequent condition in patients with neurological diseases in Mexico."

Adult patients with PFP who presented at our department between January 2006 and December 2013 qualified for the study if they had undergone lumbar puncture and also been tested for the presence of borrelial IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay. Patients with PFP who had obvious signs/symptoms indicating a disease other than Lyme borreliosis (LB) were excluded. Patients who qualified for the study were classified into three groups according to the clinical and microbiological criteria: those having confirmed LB, those with possible LB, and those with PFP of unknown etiology. Of 589 patients diagnosed with PFP during the eight-year period, 436 patients (240 males, 196 females) with median age 42.5 years (15-87 years) qualified for the study. Among these patients, 64 (14.7%) fulfilled criteria for confirmed LB, 120 (27.5%) had a diagnosis of possible LB, and in 252 (57.8%) the cause of their PFP remained unknown. When compared with patients with unknown cause of PFP, the patients with confirmed LB were older, more often presented in summer, more often reported tick bites, more frequently had LB in the past, more often complained of constitutional symptoms and radicular pain, and more often had bilateral palsy and CSF pleocytosis. Among the patients with possible LB and patients with unknown cause of PFP there were no differences in frequency of constitutional symptoms, radicular pain, bilateral palsy or CSF pleocytosis. Presentation in summer, tick bites, constitutional symptoms and radicular pain, bilateral palsy, and CSF pleocytosis strongly suggest borrelial etiology of PFP."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis vectors several pathogens including Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. Nymphal and larval stages, and the pathogens transmitted by I. scapularis are maintained in a zoonotic cycle involving rodent reservoir hosts, predominantly Peromyscus leucopus. Humans are not reservoir hosts, however, accidental encounters of infected ticks with humans, results in pathogen transmission to the human host. Laboratory models of non-reservoir hosts such as guinea pigs develop a strong immune response to tick salivary proteins and reject ticks upon repeated tick infestations. Anecdotal and scientific evidence suggests that humans that get frequent tick bites might also develop resistance to ticks. Mus musculus, the laboratory model of natural host, does not develop resistance to I. scapularis upon repeated tick infestations. Addressing this dichotomy in vector-host interaction, we present data that suggest that the salivary transcriptome and proteome composition is different in mouse and guinea pig-fed I. scapularis, and that these differences might contribute to differences in host immune responses. These findings reveal a new insight into vector-host interactions and offer a functional paradigm to better understand the phenomenon of acquired tick-resistance."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial disease with polymorphic clinical manifestations (cutaneous, rheumatological, and neurological). In recent years the issue of the diagnosis of this infection has been highly publicized on the Internet and other media in Europe and America. Some patients and physicians may share the perception that the diagnosis of the infection is not reliable in France. We reviewed current European and American guidelines on Lyme disease and performed a methodological evaluation of all guidelines. We retrieved 16 guidelines from seven countries. Our analysis revealed a global consensus regarding diagnosis at each stage of the infection. All guidelines indicate that the diagnosis is currently based on a two-tier serology at all stages of the infection, except for the early localized dermatological presentation known as Erythema migrans. One text of so-called guidelines has discordant recommendations when compared with the other guidelines, possibly explained by its low quality score. Contrary to the intense debate taking place on the Internet and in the European and American media, our analysis shows that the great majority of medical scientific guidelines with a high quality score, agree on the clinical diagnostic methods of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Morgellons disease (MD) is a skin condition associated with Lyme disease (LD) and tick-borne illness. Patients with this skin disorder experience ulcerative lesions that contain multicolored filamentous collagen and keratin inclusions. Infection with various species of Borrelia and other tick-borne pathogens has been detected in tissue and body fluid specimens from MD patients. We sought to explore this association further in a cohort of MD patients. Sera from 30 patients with MD were tested for antibody reactivity to antigens from the Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) group and the relapsing fever Borrelia (RFB) group of spirochetes. Tissue and/or body fluid specimens from these patients were also tested for the presence of Bb and RFB infection using PCR technology. In addition, tissue and body fluid specimens were tested for the presence of Bartonella henselae using PCR, and formalin-fixed skin sections from a subset of patients were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with B. henselae-specific DNA probes. Seroreactivity to Bb, RFB or both was detected in 63% of the cohort, while positive PCR testing for Bb, RFB or both was detected in 53% of the cohort. Overall, 90% of patients tested positive for exposure and/or infection with Borrelia spirochetes. B. henselae infection was detected by PCR in skin sections or body fluids from 20% of the subjects, and B. henselae FISH testing was positive in 30% of the dermatological specimens submitted for study. The study demonstrates an association between MD and positive tests for both Bb and RFB spirochetes. In conjunction with previous studies, our study provides corroborative evidence linking MD to Borrelia infection and tick-borne illness."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease-also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB)-is the most common vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. It may result in substantial morbidity, primarily from persistent Lyme arthritis (LA) that-although treatable-can develop into antibiotic-refractory LA (A-RLA). The aim of this study is to systematically review and evaluate a range of biomarkers for their potential predictive value in the development of A-RLA. We conducted a systematic review of studies examining biomarkers among patients with A-RLA from MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE and Web of Science databases and identified a total of 26 studies for qualitative analysis. All studies were of patient populations from the USA, with the exception of one from Europe. We identified an array of biomarkers that are commonly modulated in the A-RLA compared with subjects with antibiotic-responsive LA. These included a range of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-23, IL-17F, TNFα, IFNγ, CXCL9, CXCL10, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4, CRP), factors along the innate and adaptive immune response pathways (e.g., CD4+ T cells, GITR receptors, OX40 receptors, IL-4+CD4+Th2 cells, IL-17+CD4+ T cells) and an array of miRNA species (e.g., miR-142, miR-17, miR-20a, let-7c and miR-30fam). The evidence base of biologic markers for A-RLA is limited. However, a range of promising biomarkers have been identified. Cytokines and chemokines related to Th17 pathway together with a number of miRNAs species (miR-146a, miR-155 and let-7a) may be promising candidates in the prediction of A-RLA. A panel of multiple biomarkers may yield clinically relevant prediction of the possible resistance at the time of LA first diagnosis. Public Health Agency of Canada."

Genus PCR amplification and sequence analysis of Bartonella and Borrelia 16SsRNA-23SsRNA intergenic regions were performed on DNA extracted from 929 questing adult ticks (671 Ixodes scapularis, 155 Ixodes affinis, and 103 Ixodes pacificus). Overall, 129/929 (13.9%) Ixodes ticks were PCR positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, 48/929 for B. bissettiae whereas 23/929 (2.5%) were PCR positive for a Bartonella henselae. Borrelia bissettiae or B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. henselae co-infections were found in I. affinis from North Carolina at a rate of 4.5%; in a single I. scapularis from Minnesota, but not in I. pacificus. For both bacterial genera, PCR positive rates were highly variable depending on geographic location and tick species, with Ixodes affinis (n = 155) collected from North Carolina, being the tick species with the highest prevalence's for both Borrelia spp. (63.2%) and B. henselae (10.3%). Based on the results of this and other published studies, improved understanding of the enzootic cycle, transmission dynamics, and vector competence of Ixodes species (especially I. affinis) for transmission of Borrelia spp. and B. henselae should be a public health research priority."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne agents comprise medically important infections affecting dogs throughout much of the world. Sensitive detection of antibodies directed at tick-borne disease-causing organisms in dogs is diagnostically important for veterinarians, pets and their owners, and epidemiologically important for public health surveillance. The SNAP 4Dx Plus Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME) identifies antibodies to or infection with multiple tick-borne pathogens and canine heartworm antigen in a single assay. Recently, VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA) was launched as a new assay to detect tick-borne pathogen antibodies and heartworm antigen. In the present study, we evaluated the comparative performance of SNAP 4Dx Plus (SNAP) and FLEX4 Rapid Test (FLEX4) using samples selected based on geographic distributions for canine vector borne diseases, including Borrelia burgdorferi (n = 105), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (160), Anaplasma platys (115), Ehrlichia canis (154), Ehrlichia ewingii (163), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (151) and Dirofilaria immitis (105). Canine vector borne diseases infection status was established for each sample by a combination of reference methods that included necropsy (D. immitis, heartworm disease), Western immunoblotting (B. burgdorferi), immunofluorescence assays (A. phagocytophilum and E. canis) and species-specific ELISAs (A. platys, E. canis, E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis). For comparisons among the 2 assays, samples were evaluated per the manufacturers' instructions for each test kit. By testing each same sample set compared to the defined reference results, sensitivities differed substantially between SNAP and FLEX4, at 95.5 vs. 40.9%, respectively for B. burgdorferi, 97.1% vs. 61.4% for E. canis, 98.2% vs. 59.3% for E. ewingii, 64.3% vs. 35.7% for E. chaffeensis, 84.5% vs. 12.7% for A. phagocytophilum, 83.3% vs. 33.3% for A. platys, and 94.1% vs. 88.2% for D. immitis. Specificities for both rapid assay tests ranged from 98% to 100%. Based upon the comparative results derived from this study, the SNAP test was more sensitive than the FLEX4 test for detection of antibodies to all tick-borne pathogens and heartworm disease (Dirofilaria immitis) antigen in dogs."

		"abstract": "Landscape structure can affect pathogen prevalence and persistence with consequences for human and animal health. Few studies have examined how reservoir host species traits may interact with landscape structure to alter pathogen communities and dynamics. Using a landscape of islands and mainland sites we investigated how natural landscape fragmentation affects the prevalence and persistence of the zoonotic tick-borne pathogen complex Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), which causes Lyme borreliosis. We hypothesized that the prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) would be lower on islands compared to the mainland and B. afzelii, a small mammal specialist genospecies, would be more affected by isolation than bird-associated B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto). Questing (host-seeking) nymphal I. ricinus ticks (n = 6567) were collected from 12 island and 6 mainland sites in 2011, 2013 and 2015 and tested for B. burgdorferi (s.l.). Deer abundance was estimated using dung transects. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was significantly higher on the mainland (2.5%, 47/1891) compared to island sites (0.9%, 44/4673) (P < 0.01). While all four genospecies of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) were detected on the mainland, bird-associated species B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) predominated on islands. We found that landscape structure influenced the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, with a lower prevalence detected among island sites compared to the mainland. This was mainly due to the significantly lower prevalence of small mammal-associated B. afzelii. Deer abundance was not related to pathogen prevalence, suggesting that the structure and dynamics of the reservoir host community underpins the observed prevalence patterns, with the higher mobility of bird hosts compared to small mammal hosts leading to a relative predominance of the bird-associated genospecies B. garinii and generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) on islands. In contrast, the lower prevalence of B. afzelii on islands may be due to small mammal populations there exhibiting lower densities, less immigration and stronger population fluctuations. This study suggests that landscape fragmentation can influence the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, dependent on the biology of the reservoir host."

		"abstract": "The bacteria of the group Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. are the etiological agents of Lyme borreliosis in humans, transmitted by bites of ticks. Improvement of control measures requires a solid framework of the environmental traits driving its prevalence in ticks. We updated a previous meta-analysis of the reported prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. in questing nymphs of Ixodes ricinus with a literature search from January 2010-June 2017. This resulted in 195 new papers providing the prevalence of Bb for 926 geo-referenced records. Previously obtained data (878 records, years 2000-2010) were appended for modelling. The complete dataset contains data from 82,004 questing nymphs, resulting in 558 records of B. afzelii, 404 of B. burgdorferi s.s. (only 80 after the year 2010), 552 of B. garinii, 78 of B. lusitaniae, 61 of B. spielmanii, and 373 of B. valaisiana. We associated the records with explicit coordinates to environmental conditions and to a categorical definition of European landscapes (LANMAP2) looking for a precise definition of the environmental niche of the most reported species of the pathogen, using models based on different classification methods. The most commonly reported species are B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. valaisiana largely overlapping across Europe. Prevalence in ticks is associated with portions of the environmental niche. Highest prevalence occurs in areas of 280°-290° (Kelvin) of mean annual temperature experiencing a small amplitude, steady spring slope, together with high mean values and a moderate spring rise of vegetation vigor. Low prevalence occurs in sites with low and a noteworthy annual amplitude of temperature and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (colder areas with abrupt annual changes of vegetation). Models based on support vector machines provided a correct classification rate of the habitat and prevalence of 89.5%. These results confirm the association of prevalence of the three most commonly reported species of B. burgdorferi s.l. in Europe to parts of the environmental niche and provide a statistically tractable framework for analyzing trends under scenarios of climate change."

In this study, the association between patient age (18⁻44 years, young vs. 45⁻64 years, middle-aged vs. ≥ 65 years, elderly) and disease course, microbiologic characteristics, and the long-term outcome of treatment was investigated prospectively in 1220 adult patients with early LB manifesting as erythema migrans (EM) at a single-center university hospital. Patients were assessed at enrolment and followed-up for 12 months. Age was associated with comorbidities, previous LB, presenting with multiple EM, and seropositivity to borreliae at enrolment. The time to resolution of EM after starting antibiotic treatment was longer in older patients. At 12 months, 59/989 (6.0%) patients showed incomplete response. The odds for incomplete response decreased with time from enrolment (odds ratio (OR) of 0.49, 0.50, and 0.48 for 2-month vs. 14-days, 6-month vs. 2-month, and 12-month vs. 6-month follow-up visits, respectively), but were higher with advancing age (OR 1.57 for middle-aged vs. young, and 1.95 for elderly vs. young), in women (OR 1.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01⁻1.96), in patients who reported LB-associated constitutional symptoms at enrolment (OR 7.69, 95% CI 5.39⁻10.97), and in those who presented with disseminated disease (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.09⁻2.51). The long-term outcome of EM was excellent in patients of all age groups. However, older patients had slower resolution of EM and higher odds for an unfavorable outcome of treatment (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.05⁻2.34 for middle-aged vs. young; and OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.14⁻3.32 for elderly vs. young), manifested predominantly as post-LB symptoms. The presence of LB-associated constitutional symptoms at enrolment was the strongest predictor of incomplete response."

Vaccination is an increasingly common, although controversial, method used in the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs; the reported efficacies of Borrelia burgdorferi vaccines in dogs are highly variable, ranging from 50% to 100%. To determine the efficacy of vaccines for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs in North America. Experimental and observational study designs were eligible for inclusion. The outcome of interest was the reduction of incidence of clinical illness after exposure to B. burgdorferi. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Centre for Agricultural Biosciences Abstracts. Clinical signs were extracted as dichotomous outcomes: lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, and lymphadenopathy. Study quality was assessed using tools from the Cochrane collaboration. In total, 3 observational studies and 13 challenge trials were included. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining 4 clinical signs, a meta-analysis was performed. Compared to unvaccinated dogs, vaccinated dogs had a reduced odds of developing lameness, depression, pyrexia, and anorexia (odds ratio: 0.15-0.23). Based on the quantitative synthesis of results from challenge studies, vaccinated dogs are less likely to develop clinical signs after exposure to B. burgdorferi compared to unvaccinated dogs. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as several shortcomings related to quality and study design were identified. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions."

To determine the prevalence of exposure to T. cruzi, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and infection with Dirofilaria immitis among dogs in shelters across Texas and to identify risk factors for T. cruzi seropositivity. Six hundred and eight dogs. This repeated cross-sectional study was performed by collecting blood from ~30 dogs during each of the 3 visits to 7 shelters. We tested serum for antibodies to T. cruzi using 2 tests in series and for antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and B. burgdorferi and D. immitis antigen using the IDEXX SNAP 4DX Plus point-of-care test. DNA was extracted from blood clots and tested for T. cruzi DNA and strain type via quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). We used logistic regression to assess risk factors. One hundred ten (18.1%) of 608 dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi. Prevalence of exposure to the other vector-borne agents was: Ehrlichia spp. 3.6%; Anaplasma spp. 6.9%; B. burgdorferi 0.2%; and D. immitis infection 16.0%. Six of 559 (1.1%) dogs were qPCR-positive for T. cruzi. T. cruzi seroprevalence was comparable to D. immitis prevalence and higher than seroprevalence of the tick-borne pathogens. T. cruzi is an underrecognized health threat to dogs across Texas and possibly other southern states where triatomine vectors are endemic."

Public health innovations, particularly gene-editing technologies such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) could help to reduce the risk of death in children under the age of five years old. For example, CRISPR-based strategies could reduce infectious disease morbidity by gene editing mosquitoes to prevent transmission of malaria. CRISPR gene editing technology could also help to screen for influenza virus and prevent it from replicating; influenza is a particularly difficult to treat and severe virus causing many deaths in children. The lack of liver, kidney, and heart donations for children on the organ donation waiting list could also benefit from CRISPR. Gene editing of pigs to reduce rejection rates and associated risks of porcine endogenous retroviruses could allow for the utilization of pig organs for transplant. Here we review proposed applications of gene-editing technology in public health and discuss its potential to reduce child mortality and morbidity globally."

		"abstract": "Ixodid ticks are acknowledged as one of the most important hematophagous arthropods because of their ability in transmitting a variety of tick-borne diseases. Mathematical models have been developed, based on emerging knowledge about tick ecology, pathogen epidemiology and their interface, to understand tick population dynamics and tick-borne diseases spread patterns. However, no serious effort has been made to model and assess the impact of host immunity triggered by tick feeding on the distribution of the tick population according to tick stages and on tick population extinction and persistence. Here, we construct a novel mathematical model taking into account the effect of host immunity status on tick population dynamics, and analyze the long-term behaviours of the model solutions. Two threshold values, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], are introduced to measure the reproduction ratios for the tick-host interaction in the absence and presence of host immunity. We then show that these two thresholds (sometimes under additional conditions) can be used to predict whether the tick population goes extinct ([Formula: see text]) and the tick population grows without bound ([Formula: see text]). We also prove tick permanence (persistence and boundedness of the tick population) and the existence of a tick persistence equilibrium if [Formula: see text]. As the host species adjust their immunity to tick infestation levels, they form for the tick population an environment with a carrying capacity very much like that in logistic growth. Numerical results show that the host immune reactions decrease the size of the tick population at equilibrium and apparently reduce the tick-borne infection risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans by blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis. The life cycle of the LD vector, I. scapularis, usually takes two to three years to complete and goes through three stages, all of which are dependent on environmental factors. Increases in daily average temperatures, a manifestation of climate change, might have contributed to an increase in tick abundance via higher rates of tick survival. Additionally, these environmental changes might have contributed to better host availability, which is necessary for tick feeding and life cycle completion. In fact, it has been shown that both tick activity and survival depend on temperature and humidity. In this study, we have examined the relationship between those climatic variables and the reported incidence of LD in 15 states that contribute to more than 95% of reported cases within the Unites States. Using fixed effects analysis for a panel of 468 U.S. counties from those high-incidence states with annual data available for the period 2000-2016, we have found sizable impacts of temperature on the incidence of LD. Those impacts can be described approximately by an inverted U-shaped relationship, consistent with patterns of tick survival and host-seeking behavior. Assuming a 2°C increase in annual average temperature-in line with mid-century (2036-2065) projections from the latest U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA4)-we have predicted that the number of LD cases in the United States will increase by over 20 percent in the coming decades. These findings may help improving preparedness and response by clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers, as well as raising public awareness of the importance of being cautious when engaging in outdoor activities."

		"abstract": "In eastern North America, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causal agents for human and canine Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, respectively. The extensive range expansion of I. scapularis in Ontario is a growing veterinary and public health concern. However, there is limited information on the risk factors associated with I. scapularis carriage on dogs. Within an emerging area for Lyme disease risk in southeastern Ontario, we identified the tick species carried by dogs; determined the prevalence of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. scapularis; and examined associations between pet demographics, travel history, and geographical location and the odds of: a dog carrying I. scapularis relative to other tick species (i.e., case-case design), and a removed I. scapularis being infected with B. burgdorferi. Seven species of ticks were collected from 543 companion dogs at 20 participating veterinary hospitals from April to December 2015. Ixodes scapularis were detected on 85.6% of parasitized dogs, and 7.5% of these dogs were carrying at least one B. burgdorferi-positive tick. Based on a multivariable logistic regression model, the odds of I. scapularis infestation relative to other tick species was significantly higher in fall and spring compared to summer, with closer proximity to Lake Ontario, in female compared to male dogs, in dogs weighing over 30 kg compared to lighter dogs, and in dogs that had not visited a farm in the 7 days prior to tick removal. Based on univariable exact logistic regression models, the odds of B. burgdorferi-positive I. scapularis carriage relative to B. burgdorferi-negative I. scapularis were significantly higher for dogs that traveled in the 14 days prior to tick removal, for those dogs under 1 year of age, and for those weighing less than 10 kg. This case-case study provides information for veterinarians and public health practitioners to help protect dogs and their owners from Lyme disease in southeastern Ontario."

		"abstract": "Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome is an emerging, tick-borne, infectious disease recently discovered in Brazil. This syndrome is similar to Lyme disease, which is common in the United States of America, Europe and Asia; however, Brazilian borreliosis diverges from the disease observed in the Northern Hemisphere in its epidemiological, microbiological, laboratory and clinical characteristics. Polymerase chain reaction procedures showed that Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto spirochete. This bacterium has not yet been isolated or cultured in adequate culture media. In Brazil, this zoonosis is transmitted to humans through the bite of Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera ticks; these vectors do not belong to the usual Lyme disease transmitters, which are members of the Ixodes ricinus complex. The adaptation of Borrelia burgdorferi to Brazilian vectors and reservoirs probably originated from spirochetes with atypical morphologies (cysts or cell-wall-deficient bacteria) exhibiting genetic adjustments, such as gene suppression. These particularities could explain the protracted survival of these bacteria in hosts, beyond the induction of a weak immune response and the emergence of serious reactive symptoms. The aim of the present report is to note differences between Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome and Lyme disease, to help health professionals recognize this exotic and neglected zoonosis."

The narrative review is presented in chronological order in terms of a summary of the history of Lyme disease, the complexities of clinical diagnosis, the problematic interpretation of serologic testing, the conflicting guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic Lyme, and benefits of antibiotic treatment. Despite growing global incidence of the Lyme disease, treatment has not attracted pharmaceutical investment, and the evidence base and international guidelines for treatment and management of chronic Lyme continue to be conflicting and controversial.

		"abstract": "Elucidating which wildlife species significantly contribute to the maintenance of Ixodes ricinus populations and the enzootic cycles of the pathogens they transmit is imperative in understanding the driving forces behind the emergence of tick-borne diseases. Here, we aimed to quantify the relative contribution of four mustelid species in the life-cycles of I. ricinus and Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) in forested areas and to investigate their role in the transmission of other tick-borne pathogens. Road-killed badgers, pine martens, stone martens and polecats were collected in Belgium and the Netherlands. Their organs and feeding ticks were tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens. Ixodes hexagonus and I. ricinus were found on half of the screened animals (n = 637). Pine martens had the highest I. ricinus burden, whereas polecats had the highest I. hexagonus burden. We detected DNA from B. burgdorferi (s.l.) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in organs of all four mustelid species (n = 789), and Neoehrlichia mikurensis DNA was detected in all species, except badgers. DNA from B. miyamotoi was not detected in any of the investigated mustelids. From the 15 larvae of I. ricinus feeding on pine martens (n = 44), only one was positive for B. miyamotoi DNA, and all tested negative for B. burgdorferi (s.l.), N. mikurensis and A. phagocytophilum. The two feeding larvae from the investigated polecats (n = 364) and stone martens (n = 39) were negative for all four pathogens. The infection rate of N. mikurensis was higher in feeding nymphs collected from mustelids compared to questing nymphs, but not for B. burgdorferi (s.l.), B. miyamotoi or A. phagocytophilum. Although all stages of I. ricinus can be found on badgers, polecats, pine and stone martens, their relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus in forested areas is less than 1%. Consequently, the relative contribution of mustelids to the enzootic cycles of I. ricinus-borne pathogens is negligible, despite the presence of these pathogens in organs and feeding ticks. Interestingly, all four mustelid species carried all stages of I. hexagonus, potentially maintaining enzootic cycles of this tick species apart from the cycle involving hedgehogs as main host species."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (borreliosis) is one of the most common vector-borne diseases worldwide. Its incidence and geographic expansion has been steadily increasing in the last decades. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, a heterogeneous group of which three genospecies have been systematically associated to Lyme disease: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. Geographical distribution and clinical manifestations vary according to the species involved. Lyme disease clinical manifestations may be divided into three stages. Early localized stage is characterized by erythema migrans in the tick bite site. Early disseminated stage may present multiple erythema migrans lesions, borrelial lymphocytoma, lyme neuroborreliosis, carditis, or arthritis. The late disseminated stage manifests with acordermatitis chronica atrophicans, lyme arthritis, and neurological symptoms. Diagnosis is challenging due to the varied clinical manifestations it may present and usually involves a two-step serological approach. In the current review, we present a thorough revision of the clinical manifestations Lyme disease may present. Additionally, history, microbiology, diagnosis, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, treatment, and prognosis are discussed."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an infection transferred to humans through bites from infected ticks. Surveillance indicates that the number of LD cases is increasing in the UK, therefore, improved knowledge about reducing transmission from ticks to humans is needed. Eighteen electronic databases were searched and additional web-based searching was conducted, to locate empirical research, published from 2002 onwards. Sixteen studies that evaluated five types of prevention intervention were included: personal protection (n = 4), domestic strategies (landscape modification and chemical pest control) (n = 3), education (n = 6), vaccination (n = 3), and deer-reduction programmes (n = 2). In general the quality of evidence was low. Results suggest that personal protection strategies, including the use of tick repellents and wearing of protective clothes, can prevent tick bites and reduce the incidence of LD among adults. Educational interventions were generally successful for improving adults' knowledge, behavioural beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy for performing tick checks) and preventative behaviour, but for children, the findings were mixed. For adults and children, knowledge changes did not typically translate into a lower incidence of LD. Whilst evidence on vaccination against LD is promising, too few studies were available to reach robust conclusions. There was no evidence of effectiveness for deer culling, and the evidence was inconclusive for applying acaricide (tick poison) to deer's ears and heads. Low-quality evidence suggests that personal protective strategies, that limit exposure to ticks, should continue to be recommended, as should education to encourage the adoption of personal protective strategies; further investigation of education interventions for children, vaccination and deer programmes is needed."

		"abstract": "The nymph of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), the primary North American vector of the causative agent of Lyme disease, must attach to a host by the end of its questing season in order to feed and subsequently molt into an adult. The proper timing of this behavior is critical both for the tick's survival and for perpetuating the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Questing also depletes limited nymphal lipid reserves and increases desiccation risk. Given this tradeoff, questing behavior and its environmental influences can be expressed in a dynamic state variable model. We develop what we believe to be the first such model for a tick, and investigate the influence of climate on nymph fitness predictions. We apply these results to the hypothesized inland migration of I. scapularis from island refugia, evaluating fitness under suboptimal questing strategies and uncertain environmental conditions."

		"abstract": "Online activity-based epidemiological surveillance and forecasting is getting more and more attention. To date, Google search volumes have not been assessed for forecasting of tick-borne diseases. Thus, we performed an analysis of forecasting of the Lyme disease incidence based on the traditional data extended with Google Trends. Data on the weekly incidence of Lyme disease in Germany from 16 June 2013 to 27 May 2018 were obtained from the database of the Robert Koch Institute. Data of Internet searches were obtained from Google Trends searching \"Borreliose\" in Germany for the \"last 5 years\" as a timespan category. Data were split into the training (from 16 June 2013 to 11 June 2017) and validation (from 12 June 2017, to 27 May 2018) data sets. A seasonal autoregressive moving average model, SARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) [52] model was selected to describe the time series of the weekly Lyme incidence. After this, we added the Google Trends data as an external regressor and identified the SARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) [52] model as optimal. We made predictions for the validation interval using these two models and compared predictions with the values of the validation data set. Forecasting for the validation timespan resulted in similar values for the models. Comparing the forecasted values with the reported ones resulted in an residual mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.3763; the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 8.233 for the model without Google searches with an RMSE of 0.3732; and the MAPE was 8.17495 for the Google Trends values-expanded model. The difference between the predictive performances was insignificant (Diebold-Mariano Test, p-value = 0.4152). Google Trends data are a good correlate of the reported incidence of Lyme disease in Germany, but it failed to significantly improve the forecasting accuracy in models based on traditional data."

		"abstract": "An inverse relationship between biodiversity and human health has been termed the 'dilution effect' paradigm. In the case of tick-borne infections such as Lyme disease, the key assumption is that Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato abundance is increased by the loss of less competent (dilution) hosts as biodiversity declines. White-tailed deer play a dual role in the pathogen cycle, as key reproductive hosts for adult ticks and incompetent hosts for the pathogen. While the role of deer as hosts of adult ticks is well established, the extent to which deer also feed immature ticks and reduce the proportion infected is unknown because of logistic constraints in measuring this empirically. We estimated the proportion of larvae that fed on deer in an extremely species-poor community on Block Island, RI, where tick nymphal infection prevalence was found to be lower than expected. In 2014, we measured the density, larval tick burdens, and realized reservoir competence of small mammal and bird hosts on Block Island, RI. In 2015, we measured the infection prevalence of host-seeking Ixodes scapularis nymphs resulting from larvae fed on available hosts in 2014. We back-estimated the proportion of larvae expected to have fed on deer in 2014 (the only unknown parameter) to result in the nymphal infection prevalence observed in 2015. Back-estimation predicted that 29% of larval ticks must have fed on deer to yield the observed 30% nymphal infection prevalence. In comparison, the proportion of larvae feeding on mice was 44% and 27% on birds. Our study identified an influential role of deer in reducing nymphal tick infection prevalence and a potential role as dilution hosts if the reduction in nymphal infection prevalence outweighs the role of deer as tick population amplifiers. Because both deer and competent hosts may increase in anthropogenic, fragmented habitats, the links between fragmentation, biodiversity, and Lyme disease risk may be complex and difficult to predict. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between deer abundance and Lyme disease risk would reduce the efficacy of deer population reduction efforts to control Lyme disease."

Infestation with inanimate pathogens, specifically fibers or filaments, has been controversially termed Morgellons disease by the patients themselves, who believe that this is not a psychiatric disease but rather a new organic condition or a skin manifestation of an infection, such as Lyme disease. A large-scale study by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention on patients presenting with Morgellons clinical manifestations did not find evidence of fibers in the skin nor an association with any infection, including Lyme disease. Once the diagnosis of delusional infestation is made, the cornerstone of treatment is antipsychotics, although this is often quite challenging, as patients are reluctant to take these medications."

To analyze epidemiological data, and to investigate the effects of treatment of patients with ACA. Nine patients were included in the study. All patients had serological examinations (ELISA and Western blot) and histopathological examination of the skin lesions performed. Eight patients had PCR in the skin biopsy performed. The duration of symptoms ranged from 2 months to 2 years. In 7 patients, skin lesions were located on lower limbs, in 2 patients - in a non-typical body area - abdomen. In 1 patient, scleroderma and in 3 patients, diabetes mellitus was diagnosed. Borrelia burgdorferi DNA was detected in 25% of the skin biopsy specimens. IgG anti-B. burgdorferi specific antibodies were present in serum of all patients (confirmed by Western blot). In all cases, the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathological examination. The response to ceftriaxone therapy varied. In 5 cases, the lesions resolved completely, in others they faded. Despite raising awareness of Lyme borreliosis, late forms of the disease such as ACA are still observed. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans skin lesions may be located in non-characteristic areas, e.g. abdominal skin. Symptoms are not irritating or painful, therefore patients do not seek medical help.

In this report, we characterized the role of these conserved molecules in ticks infected with either Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi or tick-borne Langat virus (LGTV), a pathogen closely related to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed no significant changes in oatps gene expression upon infection with B. burgdorferi in unfed ticks. Synchronous infection of unfed nymphal ticks with LGTV in vitro revealed no significant changes in oatps gene expression. However, expression of specific oatps was significantly downregulated upon LGTV infection of tick cells in vitro. Treatment of tick cells with OATP inhibitor significantly reduced LGTV loads, kynurenine amino transferase (kat), a gene involved in the production of tryptophan metabolite xanthurenic acid (XA), levels and expression of several oatps in tick cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics characterization of OATPs from some of the medically important vectors including ticks, mosquitoes and lice revealed the presence of several glycosylation, phosphorylation and myristoylation sites. This study provides additional evidence on the role of arthropod OATPs in vector-intracellular pathogen interactions."

The patient was transported by rotor wing aircraft to a pediatric cardiac intensive care unit where he was ultimately diagnosed with Lyme disease. He was treated with a course of intravenous antibiotics, his heart block resolved, and he was discharged home with a good neurologic outcome."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), is typically transmitted by hard-bodied ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). Whenever this tick-borne zoonosis is mentioned in medical clinics and emergency rooms, it sparks a firestorm of controversy. Denial often sets in, and healthcare practitioners dismiss the fact that this pathogenic spirochetosis is present in their area. For distribution of Bbsl across Canada, we conducted a 4-year, tick⁻host study (2013⁻2016), and collected ticks from avian and mammalian hosts from Atlantic Canada to the West Coast. Overall, 1265 ticks representing 27 tick species belonging to four genera were collected. Of the 18 tick species tested, 15 species (83%) were positive for Bbsl and, of these infected ticks, 6 species bite humans. Overall, 13 of 18 tick species tested are human-biting ticks. Our data suggest that a 6-tick, enzootic maintenance cycle of Bbsl is present in southwestern B.C., and five of these tick species bite humans. Biogeographically, the groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, has extended its home range from central and eastern Canada to southwestern British Columbia (B.C.). We posit that the Fox Sparrow, Passerella iliaca, is a reservoir-competent host for Bbsl. The Bay-breasted Warbler, Setophaga castanea, and the Tennessee Warbler, Vermivora peregrina, are new host records for the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. We provide the first report of a Bbsl-positive Amblyomma longirostre larva parasitizing a bird; this bird parasitism suggests that a Willow Flycatcher is a competent reservoir of Bbsl. Our findings show that Bbsl is present in all provinces, and that multiple tick species are implicated in the enzootic maintenance cycle of this pathogen. Ultimately, Bbsl poses a serious public health contagion Canada-wide."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Electronic health record (EHR)-based research on Lyme disease is limited. We used Geisinger EHR data from 479,344 primary care patients in 38 Pennsylvania counties in 2006-2014 to compare EHR-based Lyme disease incidence rates to surveillance incidence rates, evaluate individual and community risk factors for incident Lyme disease, and to characterize the proportion of cases with diagnoses consistent with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome in the EHR (PTLDSEHR). We primarily identified Lyme disease cases using diagnosis codes, serologic testing order codes, and medication orders but also completed subgroup analyses among those with positive serology and those with both diagnosis code and antibiotic treatment. We compared annual incidence rates from the EHR to surveillance by age, sex, and county. In case-control analyses, we compared cases to randomly selected controls (5:1) frequency-matched on year, age, and sex. We identified 9657 cases of Lyme disease, including 1791 cases with positive serology and 4992 cases with both diagnosis code and antibiotic treatment. Annual incidence rates in the EHR were 4.25-7.43 times higher than surveillance. In adjusted analyses, white non-Hispanic race/ethnicity (vs. black, Hispanic, or other) was associated with higher odds of Lyme disease (odds ratio [OR]: 2.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.73-2.44). Medical Assistance insurance use (always vs. never; OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.68-0.88), and higher community-level socioeconomic deprivation (quartile 4 vs. 1 OR: 0.50 (95% CI: 0.42-0.59) were associated with lower odds of Lyme disease. Within 4-52 weeks after Lyme disease diagnosis, 20.8% (n = 735) of cases with a diagnosis code and treatment had a diagnosis of malaise or fatigue, pain, or cognitive difficulties not present in the past 26 weeks. These results highlight the utility of EHR data for epidemiologic research on Lyme disease for case-finding, surveillance, risk factor evaluation, and characterization of PTLDS using EHR data."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne diseases constitute a major problem for veterinary and public health, especially in tropical regions like Central America. Domestic dogs may be infected with several vector-borne pathogens of zoonotic relevance, which may also severely compromise canine health. To assess the prevalence of canine vector-borne diseases in Nicaragua, 329 dogs from seven cities, which were presented to the veterinarian for various reasons, were included in this study. Dogs were examined clinically and diagnostic blood samples were taken for analysis of packed cell volume (PCV) and presence of microfilariae as well as antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) by use of a commercially available rapid ELISA. To detect current infections, specific PCRs for the detection of E. canis, A. platys and A. phagocytophilum were carried out on blood samples of the respective seropositive dogs. Microfilaremic blood samples, as well as D. immitis antigen positive samples were further subjected to PCR and subsequent sequencing for filarial species identification. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. were present in 62.9% of dogs, while Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence was 28.6%. Antibodies against species of both genera were detected in 24.9% of dogs. Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) antibodies were not detected. Dirofilaria immitis antigen was present in six animals (1.8%), two of which also showed D. immitis microfilariae in buffy coat. In addition to D. immitis, Acanthocheilonema reconditum was identified by PCR and sequencing in two of four additional microfilaremic blood samples, which were tested negative for D. immitis antigen. Current E. canis infections as defined by DNA detection were present in 58.5% of Ehrlichia-seropositive dogs, while 5.3% of Anaplasma-seropositive dogs were PCR-positive for A. platys, 2.2% for A. phagocytophilum and 16.0% for both Anaplasma species. Current E. canis infection had a statistically significant negative impact on PCV, whereas no relationship between infection status and clinical signs of disease could be observed. These results indicate that canine vector-borne diseases are widespread in Nicaragua and that dogs may constitute a reservoir for human infection with E. canis, A. phagocytophilum and D. immitis. Thus, the use of repellents or acaricides to protect dogs from vector-borne diseases is strongly recommended."

		"abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Borrelia cause vector-borne infections like the most important hard tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, Lyme borreliosis (LB), and soft tick or louse transmitted relapsing fevers (RF), prevalent in temperate and tropical areas. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) includes several genospecies and causes LB in humans. In infected patients, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) expresses the BmpA, BmpB, BmpC and BmpD proteins. The role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of LB remains incompletely characterized, but they are, however, closely related to Treponema pallidum PnrA (Purine nucleoside receptor A), a substrate-binding lipoprotein of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family preferentially binding purine nucleosides. Based on 3D homology modeling, the Bmp proteins share the typical fold of the substrate-binding protein family and the ligand-binding properties of BmpA, BmpB and BmpD are highly similar, whereas those of BmpC differ markedly. Nevertheless, these residues are highly conserved within the genus Borrelia and the inferred phylogenetic tree also reveals that the RF Borrelia lack BmpB proteins but has an additional Bmp protein (BmpA2) missing in LB-causing Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Our results indicate that the Bmp proteins could bind nucleosides, although BmpC might have a different ligand-binding specificity and, therefore, a distinct function. Furthermore, the work provides a means for classifying the Bmp proteins and supports further elucidation of the roles of these proteins."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), caused by bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, is the most common vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. A systematic review (SR) was conducted to summarize the global literature on adverse birth outcomes associated with gestational LD in humans. The SR followed an a priori protocol of pretested screening, risk of bias, and data extraction forms. Data were summarized descriptively and random effects meta-analysis (MA) was used where appropriate. The SR identified 45 relevant studies, 29 describing 59 cases reported as gestational LD in the United States, Europe, and Asia (1969-2017). Adverse birth outcomes included spontaneous miscarriage or fetal death (n = 12), newborn death (n = 8), and newborns with an abnormal outcome (e.g. hyperbilirubinemia, respiratory distress and syndactyly) at birth (n = 16). Only one report provided a full case description (clinical manifestations in the mother, negative outcome for the child, and laboratory detection of B. burgdorferi in the child) that provides some evidence for vertical transmission of B. burgdorferi that has negative consequences for the fetus. The results of 17 epidemiological studies are included in this SR. Prevalence of adverse birth outcomes in an exposed population (defined by the authors as: gestational LD, history of LD, tick bites or residence in an endemic area) was compared to that in an unexposed population in eight studies and no difference was reported. A meta-analysis of nine studies showed significantly fewer adverse birth outcomes in women reported to have been treated for gestational LD (11%, 95%CI 7-16) compared to those who were not treated during pregnancy (50%, 95%CI 30-70) providing indirect evidence of an association between gestational LD and adverse birth outcomes. Other risk factors investigated; trimester of exposure, length of LD during pregnancy, acute vs. disseminated LD at diagnosis, and symptomatic LD vs. seropositive women with no LD symptoms during pregnancy were not significantly associated with adverse birth outcomes. This SR summarizes evidence from case studies that provide some limited evidence for transplacental transmission of B. burgdorferi. There was inconsistent evidence for adverse birth outcomes of gestational LD in the epidemiological research, and uncommon adverse outcomes for the fetus may occur as a consequence of gestational LD. The global evidence does not fully characterize the potential impact of gestational LD, and future research that addresses the knowledge gaps may change the findings in this SR. Given the current evidence; prompt diagnosis and treatment of LD during pregnancy is recommended."

A flagella-specific type III secretion system (fT3SS) composed of a membrane-bound export apparatus and a cytosolic ATPase complex is responsible for the assembly of the periplasmic flagella. Here, we deployed cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to visualize the fT3SS machine in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. We show, for the first time, that the cytosolic ATPase complex is attached to the flagellar C-ring through multiple spokes to form the \"spoke and hub\" structure in B. burgdorferi. This structure not only strengthens structural rigidity of the round-shaped C-ring but also appears to rotate with the C-ring. Our studies provide structural insights into the unique mechanisms underlying assembly and rotation of the periplasmic flagella and may provide the basis for the development of novel therapeutic strategies against several pathogenic spirochetes."

PTLDS represents a small subset of patients treated for an erythema migrans (EM) rash with persistent or recurrent symptoms and functional decline. The larger population with chronic Lyme disease is less understood and well defined. Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) is a multifactorial model for treating chronic disease(s), which identifies up to 16 overlapping sources of inflammation and their downstream effects. A patient symptom survey and a retrospective chart review of 200 patients was therefore performed on those patients with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS to identify those variables on the MSIDS model with the greatest potential effect on regaining health. Results indicate that dapsone combination therapy decreased the severity of eight major Lyme symptoms, and multiple sources of inflammation (other infections, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, food allergies/sensitivities, leaky gut, mineral deficiencies, environmental toxins with detoxification problems, and sleep disorders) along with downstream effects of inflammation may all affect chronic symptomatology. In part two of our observational study and review paper, we postulate that the use of this model can represent an important and needed paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease."

		"abstract": "Rickettsia buchneri (formerly Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes scapularis, or REIS) is an obligate intracellular endoparasite of the black-legged tick, the primary vector of Lyme disease in North America. It is noteworthy among the rickettsiae for its relatively large genome (1.8 Mb) and extraordinary proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which comprise nearly 35% of its genome. Previous analysis of the R. buchneri genome identified several integrative conjugative elements named Rickettsiales amplified genomic elements (RAGEs); the composition of these RAGEs suggests that continued genomic invasions by MGEs facilitated the proliferation of rickettsial genes related to an intracellular lifestyle. In this study, we compare the genomic diversity at RAGE loci among sequenced rickettsiae that infect three related Ixodes spp., including two strains of R. buchneri and Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes pacificus strain Humboldt, as well as a closely related species R. tamurae infecting Amblyomma testudinarium ticks. We further develop a novel multiplex droplet digital PCR assay and use it to quantify copy number ratios of chromosomal R. buchneri RAGE-A and RAGE-B to the single-copy gene gltA within natural populations of I. scapularis. Our results reveal substantial diversity among R. buchneri at these loci, both within individual ticks as well as in the I. scapularis population at large, demonstrating that genomic rearrangement of MGEs is an active process in these intracellular bacteria."

		"abstract": "Malaria, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Dengue fever, and Lyme disease are common causes of morbidity and mortality around the world. While arthropod bites may cause local inflammation and discomfort, a greater concern is the potential to develop deadly systemic infection. The use of insect repellents (IR) to prevent systemic infections constitutes a fundamental public health effort. Cost-effectiveness, availability, and high-efficacy against arthropod vectors are key characteristics of an ideal IR. Currently, numerous IRs are available on the market, with DEET (N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) being the most widely used. DEET has an excellent safety profile and remarkable protection against mosquitoes and various other arthropods. Other EPA-registered IR ingredients (permethrin, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, oil of citronella, catnip oil, and 2-undecanone) are alternative IRs of great interest due to some having efficacies comparable to that of DEET. These alternative IRs possess low toxicity and favorable customer experiences in utilization (e.g., cosmetically pleasant, naturally occurring). This review summarizes currently available EPA-registered IRs: the origins, mechanisms of action, side effect profiles, and available formulations will be discussed. This review will enable the clinician to select the best IR option to meet patients' needs and provide the greatest protection from arthropod bites and sequelae."

In Canada, Lyme disease risk has so far been assessed primarily by detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Of Ixodes scapularis ticks collected between 2014 and 2016 in New Brunswick, Canada, 7 were shown to be infected with Borrelia bissettii by nested PCR and sequencing of 5 B. bissettii genes. Since different Borrelia species are associated with different clinical manifestations and are not detected with the same diagnostic tests, the identification of a previously undocumented or underreported pathogenic Borrelia species has important implications for public and veterinary medicine."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes have developed sophisticated means to successfully colonize host tissues and survive in unfavorable environments. Attachment to human cells is thought to be a key step for the establishment of an infection that causes multiple clinical symptoms. Infection of host tissues largely depends on the ability of spirochetes to attach to different cell types. In this study, we examine the ability of spirochetes belonging to seven distinct genospecies (Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. spielmanii, B. bavariensis, B. lusitaniae, and B. valaisiana) to adhere to human keratinocytes. Among the genospecies analyzed, B. valaisiana and B. spielmanii showed the strongest adherence while B. bavariensis, B. garinii and B. afzelii displayed moderate binding activity. By contrast, only a few cells of B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. lusitaniae bound to keratinocytes. Furthermore, intra-species differences have also been observed among B. garinii, B. bavariensis, B. afzelii, and in particular B. valaisiana. To further assess the role of infection-associated borrelial outer surface proteins for mediating interaction to human cells, a non-adherent and non-infectious B. garinii strains producing distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASP) were employed. Interestingly, binding capacity to human keratinocytes increased up to four-fold in B. garinii cells producing ErpC but not CspA, CspZ or ErpP compared to wild-type B. garinii cells lacking CRASPs. Taken together, these data provide evidence that distinct borrelial genospecies differ in their ability to bind to human keratinocytes and, in addition, support a role of ErpC as a potential adhesin of spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Multiple-strain pathogens often establish mixed infections inside the host that result in competition between strains. In vector-borne pathogens, the competitive ability of strains must be measured in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector to understand the outcome of competition. Such studies could reveal the existence of trade-offs in competitive ability between different host types. We used the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii to test for competition between strains in the rodent host and the tick vector, and to test for a trade-off in competitive ability between these two host types. Mice were infected via tick bite with either one or two strains, and these mice were subsequently used to create ticks with single or mixed infections. Competition in the rodent host reduced strain-specific host-to-tick transmission and competition in the tick vector reduced the abundance of both strains. The strain that was competitively superior in host-to-tick transmission was competitively inferior with respect to bacterial abundance in the tick. This study suggests that in multiple-strain vector-borne pathogens there are trade-offs in competitive ability between the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Such trade-offs could play an important role in the coexistence of pathogen strains."

Despite the lack of evidence to validate the effectiveness and safety of marijuana, it is approved to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions in the United States. Furthermore, medical cannabis dispensaries have been making unsubstantiated claims about medical cannabis. It is important for dermatologists to know about the purported use of medical cannabis to help patients navigate this new treatment option, particularly as cannabis becomes legal in Canada in October 2018. We collected and tabulated the dermatologic indications for medical cannabis from Canada, the United States, and Europe. In the United States, dermatologic-approved indications vary by state but include psoriasis, lupus, nail-patella syndrome, and severe pain. Health Canada has listed psoriasis, dermatitis, and pruritus as potential therapeutic uses for cannabis but does not endorse its use for therapeutic purposes. We also surveyed the websites of dispensaries in Canada, the United States, and Europe and found that numerous unsubstantiated claims were being made and advertised to consumers. Dermatologic uses of medical cannabis, as claimed by dispensaries, included treating acne, aging, allergic contact dermatitis, chronic pain, herpes, dermatitis, lupus, Lyme disease, nevi, psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, and melanoma. Psoriasis, dermatitis, and chronic pain were the most commonly cited indications for medical cannabis listed by dispensaries. Our data indicate that the suggested and advertised uses of medical cannabis are largely unsubstantiated. Further research is necessary to validate the indications, effectiveness, and safety of medical cannabis."

		"abstract": "yme disease is transmitted via blacklegged ticks, the spatial spread of which is believed to be primarily via transport on white-tailed deer. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to describe the spatial spread of blacklegged ticks due to deer dispersal. The model turns out to be a system of differential equations with a spatially non-local term accounting for the phenomenon that a questing female adult tick that attaches to a deer at one location may later drop to the ground, fully fed, at another location having been transported by the deer. We first justify the well-posedness of the model and analyze the stability of its steady states. We then explore the existence of traveling wave fronts connecting the extinction equilibrium with the positive equilibrium for the system. We derive an algebraic equation that determines a critical value c* which is at least a lower bound for the wave speed in the sense that, if c<c*, there is no traveling wave front of speed c connecting the extinction steady state to the positive steady state. Numerical simulations of the wave equations suggest that c* is the minimum wave speed. We also carry out some numerical simulations for the original spatial model system and the results seem to confirm that the actual spread rate of the tick population coincides with c*. We also explore the dependence of c* on the dispersion rate of the white tailed deer, by which one may evaluate the role of the deer's dispersion in the geographical spread of the ticks."

In the present survey, we investigated Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia canis, Dirofilaria immitis and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato seroprevalence between three groups of dogs (asymptomatic, suspected and deceased) from continental and coastal regions of Croatia with the commercial point-of-care SNAP®4Dx®Plus for VBPs. The overall prevalence for tested pathogens in dogs was 6.1% with the highest prevalence detected for Anaplasma spp. (4.5%), while the remaining pathogens were found at a prevalence of less than 1% (E. canis 0.6%, B. burgdorferi s.l. 0.4%, D. immitis 0.6%). No statistically significant differences in VBP detection between dog cohorts could be found with the exception of D. immitis in the deceased group. Interestingly, no evidence of D. immitis could be found in the hearts of dogs in this group at necropsy, however. This study provides the first data on the seroprevalence of selected VBPs between dogs of different health statuses in Croatia. The results demonstrate that serological evidence of VBPs alone or in combination with co-infections were found just as frequently in asymptomatic dogs as those with suspected or confirmed evidence of VBP disease, raising questions about the pathogenic potential of these organisms in domesticated dogs."

To review the presentation, management, and time to resolution of heart block due to Lyme disease in previously healthy children. An IRB approved single-center retrospective study was conducted of all patients < 21 years old with confirmed Lyme disease and advanced second or third degree heart block between 2007 and 2017. Twelve patients (100% male) with a mean age of 15.9 years (range 13.2-18.1) were identified. Six patients (50%) had mild to moderate atrioventricular valve regurgitation and all had normal biventricular function. Five patients had advanced second degree heart block and 7 had complete heart block with an escape rate of 20-57 bpm. Isoproterenol was used in 4 patients for 3-4 days and one patient required transvenous pacing for 2 days. Patients were treated with 21 days (n = 6, 50%) or 28 days (n = 6, 50%) of antibiotics. Three patients received steroids for 3-4 days. Advanced heart block resolved in all patients within 2-5 days, and all had a normal PR interval within 3 days to 16 months from hospital discharge. Symptomatic children who present with new high-grade heart block from an endemic area should be tested for Lyme disease. Antibiotic therapy provides quick and complete resolution of advanced heart block within 5 days, while steroids did not appear to shorten the time course in this case series. Importantly, no patients required a permanent pacemaker."

To evaluate the involvement of multiple microbial immune responses in patients experiencing TBD we utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four hundred and thirty-two human serum samples organized into seven categories followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention two-tier Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis guidelines and Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. All patient categories were tested for their immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) responses against 20 microbes associated with TBD. Our findings recognize that microbial infections in patients suffering from TBDs do not follow the one microbe, one disease Germ Theory as 65% of the TBD patients produce immune responses to various microbes. We have established a causal association between TBD patients and TBD associated co-infections and essential opportunistic microbes following Bradford Hill's criteria. This study indicated an 85% probability that a randomly selected TBD patient will respond to Borrelia and other related TBD microbes rather than to Borrelia alone. A paradigm shift is required in current healthcare policies to diagnose TBD so that patients can get tested and treated even for opportunistic infections."

		"abstract": "The incidence of babesiosis, Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases has increased steadily in Europe and North America during the last five decades. Babesia microti is transmitted by species of Ixodes, the same ticks that transmit the Lyme disease-causing spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. B. microti can also be transmitted through transfusion of blood products and is the most common transfusion-transmitted infection in the U.S.A. Ixodes ticks are commonly infected with both B. microti and B. burgdorferi, and are competent vectors for transmitting them together into hosts. Few studies have examined the effects of coinfections on humans and they had somewhat contradictory results. One study linked coinfection with B. microti to a greater number of symptoms of overall disease in patients, while another report indicated that B. burgdorferi infection either did not affect babesiosis symptoms or decreased its severity. Mouse models of infection that manifest pathological effects similar to those observed in human babesiosis and Lyme disease offer a unique opportunity to thoroughly investigate the effects of coinfection on the host. Lyme disease has been studied using the susceptible C3H mouse infection model, which can also be used to examine B. microti infection to understand pathological mechanisms of human diseases, both during a single infection and during coinfections. We observed that high B. microti parasitaemia leads to low haemoglobin levels in infected mice, reflecting the anaemia observed in human babesiosis. Similar to humans, B. microti coinfection appears to enhance the severity of Lyme disease-like symptoms in mice. Coinfected mice have lower peak B. microti parasitaemia compared to mice infected with B. microti alone, which may reflect attenuation of babesiosis symptoms reported in some human coinfections. These findings suggest that B. burgdorferi coinfection attenuates parasite growth while B. microti presence exacerbates Lyme disease-like symptoms in mice."

Previous studies have shown a high rate of 25-97% of persisting anti-borrelial antibodies in patients with treated Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) at follow-up. These studies used immunoblots with antigens from whole-cell sonicates, which could be less specific than modern recombinant antigens. We assessed the seroprevalence of anti-borrelial antibodies in serum from patients with definite LNB and healthy controls with a line immunoblot using highly specific recombinant antigens. We retrospectively identified patients with treated definite LNB who were treated at the Medical Center-University of Freiburg. Serum from LNB patients at a mean follow-up period of 4.9 years (SD: 3.3) and serum from healthy controls were assessed for anti-borrelial antibodies with a line immunoblot with recombinant antigens. A total of 45 patients with definite LNB and 40 healthy controls were included. Ten LNB patients (22.7%) had persisting antibodies (IgG and/or IgM) in serum at follow-up. Serum samples from six healthy controls (15%) were positive for anti-borrelial antibodies (IgG and or IgM). Prevalence of positive IgM or IgG antibodies showed no statistically significant difference between LNB patients at follow-up and healthy controls (IgM p = 0.32, IgG p = 0.54). Immunoblot reactivity patterns at follow-up in LNB patients did not have statistically significant differences from healthy controls. The discrepancy regarding earlier studies reporting higher amounts of LNB patients with persisting antibodies could be due to a higher specificity of the antigens used in recombinant immunoblots compared to other immunoblots (e.g., whole-cell sonicates). The results of our study should be replicated in a larger prospective multi-center study."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis (LC), an early manifestation of Lyme disease that most commonly presents as high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB), usually resolves with antibiotic treatment. When LC is not identified as the cause of AVB, a permanent pacemaker may be inappropriately implanted in a reversible cardiac conduction disorder. The likelihood that a patient's high-degree AVB is caused by LC can be evaluated by clinical characteristics incorporated into a risk stratification tool. A systematic review of all published cases of LC with high-degree AVB, and five cases from the authors' experience, was conducted. The results informed the development of a new risk stratification tool, the Suspicious Index in LC (SILC) score. The SILC score was then applied to each case included in the review. Of the 88 cases included, 51 (58%) were high-risk, 31 (35.2%) intermediate-risk, and 6 (6.8%) low-risk for LC according to the SILC score (sensitivity 93.2%). For the subset of 32 cases that reported on all SILC variables, 24 (75%) cases were classified as high-risk, 8 (25%) intermediate-risk, and 0 low-risk (sensitivity 100%). Specificity could not be assessed (no control group). Notably, 6 of the 11 patients who received permanent pacemakers had reversal of AVB with antibiotic treatment. The SILC risk score and COSTAR mnemonic (constitutional symptoms; outdoor activity; sex = male; tick bite; age < 50; rash = erythema migrans) may help to identify LC in patients presenting with high-degree AVB, and ultimately, minimize the implantation of unnecessary permanent pacemakers."

Using the French National Reference Center for Borrelia database, patients with a positive PCR on synovial fluid for Borrelia were identified. Patient clinical and biological characteristics were reviewed from patient records. Long-term outcomes after treatment were studied through a questionnaire and with follow-up data. Among 357 synovial fluid testing by PCR between 2010 and 2016, 37 (10.4%) were positive for Borrelia. Patients' median age was 36 years (range 6-78) with 61% of men and 28% patients under 18. The presentation was monoarticular in 92% and the knee was involved in 97%. Contrary to the Borrelia species repartition in European ticks, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was the most prevalent species found in synovial fluid (54%) followed by B. azfelii (29%) and B. garinii (17%). Antibiotic treatments were mainly composed of doxycycline (n = 24), ceftriaxone (n = 10) and amoxicillin (n = 6), for a median duration of 4 weeks (range 3-12). Despite a properly conducted treatment, 34% of patients (n = 12) developed persistent synovitis for at least 2 months (median duration 3 months, range 2-16). Among those, 3 developed systemic inflammatory oligo- or polyarthritis in previously unaffected joints with no signs of persistent infection (repeated PCR testing negative), which mandated Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs (DMARD) introduction, leading to remission. In France and contrary to ticks ecology, Lyme arthritis is mainly caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Despite proper antibiotic therapy, roughly one third of patients may present persistent inflammatory synovitis and a small proportion may develop systemic arthritis. In such cases, complete remission can be reached using DMARD."

Using 3 statistical methods for positivity cutoff determinations and scoring criteria, we found increased sensitivities for early Lyme disease when 2 of 6 antigens were positive as compared with the 2 of 3 antigen IgM criteria currently used for second-tier immunoblot scoring. Specificities for negative controls were comparable or superior to using 2 of 3 antigens. These results indicate that IgM sensitivity and specificity of serological testing for Lyme disease in the early stages of illness can be improved by employing antigens that target the initial host antibody responses."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe and its incidence has steadily increased over the last two decades. In the Netherlands alone, more than 20,000 citizens are affected by LB each year. Because of this, two Dutch citizen science projects were started to monitor tick bites. Both projects have collected nearly 50,000 geo-located tick bite reports over the period 2006-2016. The number of tick bite reports per area unit is a proxy of tick bite risk. This risk can also be modelled as the result of the interaction of hazard (e.g. tick activity) and human exposure (e.g. outdoor recreational activities). Multiple studies have focused on quantifying tick hazard. However, quantifying human exposure is a harder task. In this work, we make a first step to map human exposure to ticks by combining tick bite reports with a tick hazard model. Our results show human exposure to tick bites in all forested areas of the Netherlands. This information could facilitate the cooperation between public health specialists and forest managers to create better mitigation campaigns for tick-borne diseases, and it could also support the design of improved plans for ecosystem management."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector borne-disease in the United States (US). While the majority of the Lyme disease patients can be cured with 2⁻4 weeks antibiotic treatment, about 10⁻20% of patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms. While the cause of this condition is unclear, persistent infection was proposed as one possibility. It has recently been shown that B. burgdorferi develops dormant persisters in stationary phase cultures that are not killed by the current Lyme antibiotics, and there is interest in identifying novel drug candidates that more effectively kill such forms. We previously identified some highly active essential oils with excellent activity against biofilm and stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Here, we screened another 35 essential oils and found 10 essential oils (Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Cuminum cyminum L. seeds, Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers, Amyris balsamifera L. wood, Thymus vulgaris L. leaves, Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits, Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. leaves) and the active component of cinnamon bark cinnamaldehyde (CA) at a low concentration of 0.1% have strong activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. At a lower concentration of 0.05%, essential oils of Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass and CA still exhibited strong activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi. CA also showed strong activity against replicating B. burgdorferi, with a MIC of 0.02% (or 0.2 μg/mL). In subculture studies, the top five essential oil hits Allium sativum L. bulbs, Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers, and Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits completely eradicated all B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells at 0.1%, while Cymbopogon martini var. motia Bruno grass, Eucalyptus citriodora Hook. leaves, Amyris balsamifera L. wood, Cuminum cyminum L. seeds, and Thymus vulgaris L. leaves failed to do so as shown by visible spirochetal growth after 21-day subculture. At concentration of 0.05%, only Allium sativum L. bulbs essential oil and CA sterilized the B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture, as shown by no regrowth during subculture, while Pimenta officinalis Lindl. berries, Commiphora myrrha (T. Nees) Engl. resin, Hedychium spicatum Buch.-Ham. ex Sm. flowers and Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. fruits essential oils all had visible growth during subculture. Future studies are needed to determine if these highly active essential oils could eradicate persistent B. burgdorferi infection in vivo."

		"abstract": "Bites with tick-borne pathogens can cause various bacterial, viral, or parasitic diseases in humans. Tick-transmitted diseases are known as contributing factors to the increasing incidence and burden of diseases. The present article investigated the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in South Korea. The incidence and distribution of common tick-borne diseases in Korea (Lyme disease, Q fever, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS]) were investigated and analyzed, using data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) infectious disease reporting system. A literature review was compiled on the current status of uncommon tick-borne diseases (Rickettsia, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis, tularemia, tick-borne encephalitis, and babesiosis). In South Korea, SFTS is an emerging disease, showing a rapid increase in reports since 2012, with high mortality. Likewise, reports of Lyme disease and Q fever cases have also been rapidly increasing during 2012-2017, although caution should be taken when interpreting these results, considering the likely influence of increased physician awareness and reporting of these diseases. Other tick-borne diseases reported in South Korea included spotted fever group rickettsiae, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Bartonella, and babesiosis. Evidences on human infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever were recently unavailable, but both need constant monitoring."

		"abstract": "Bacteria of Rickettsiaceae and Anaplasmataceae families include disease agents spread by Ixodes ricinus ticks, the most common tick vector in Europe. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence and co-infection prevalence of particular tick-transmitted Rickettsiales members: Rickettsia spp. (further referred as Rs), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap), and \"Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis\" (CNM) in I. ricinus ticks in two types of areas, different in terms of human impact: natural and urban. Using additional data, we aimed at investigating co-occurrence of these Rickettsiales with Borreliella spp. A total of 4189 tick specimens, 2363 from the urban area (Warsaw park and forests) and 1826 from the natural area (forests and park in the vicinity of National Parks), were tested for the presence of Rickettsiales DNA by PCRs. The prevalence of selected Rickettsiales was twice higher in urban than natural areas (13.2% vs. 6.9%, respectively). In total ticks, the prevalence of Rs, Ap, and CNM was 6.5%, 5.3%, and 3.6% in urban areas vs. 4.4%, 1.1%, and 2.1% in natural areas, respectively. Co-infections of Rickettsiales were also more prevalent in urban areas (2.6% vs. 0.3%, respectively). The most common Rs was R. helvetica; also R. monacensis and novel \"Candidatus Rickettsia mendelii\" were detected. Positive association between Ap and CNM infections was discovered. Rickettsiales bacteria occurrence was not associated with Borreliella occurrence, but co-infections with these two groups were more common in ticks in urban areas. In conclusion, three groups of Rickettsiales constituted the important part of the tick pathogen community in Poland, especially in the urbanized central Poland (Mazovia). In the Warsaw agglomeration, there is a greater risk of encountering the I. ricinus tick infected with Rickettsiales and co-infected with Lyme spirochaetes, in comparison to natural areas. This finding raises the question whether cities might in fact be the hot spots for TBDs."

		"abstract": "Prevention of Lyme disease in dogs in North America depends on effective vaccination against infection by the tick vector-born spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Most vaccines effectively prevent spirochete transmission to dogs during tick feeding based on immunization with the outer-surface lipoprotein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi. More recently, vaccines containing additional OspC protein moieties have been introduced. These are designed to enhance protection by forming a second line of defense within the vertebrate host, where OspC expression replaces OspA as the dominant surface antigen. However, supportive data for demonstration of OspC mediated protection is still lacking. Since OspA immunogenicity is of paramount importance to protection against spirochete transmission; this study was designed to compare the immunogenicity of two commercially available vaccines against the Borrelia burgdorferi OspA. We further characterized OspA antigen fractions of these vaccines with respect to their biochemical and biophysical properties. Two groups of beagle dogs (n = 9) were administered either: (1) a nonadjuvanted/monovalent, recombinant OspA vaccine (Recombitek® Lyme) or (2) an adjuvanted, recombinant OspA /OspC chimeric fusion vaccine (Vanguard® crLyme). The onset of the anti-OspA antibody response elicited by the nonadjuvanted/monovalent OspA vaccine was significantly earlier than that for the bivalent OspA /OspC vaccine and serum borreliacidal activity was significantly greater at all post-vaccination time points. As expected, only dogs inoculated with the bivalent OspA/OspC vaccine mounted a humoral anti-OspC response. However, only three out of nine dogs in that group had a positive response. Comparison of the OspA vaccine structures revealed that the OspA in the nonadjuvanted/monovalent vaccine was primarily in the lipidated form, eluting (SEC-HPLC) at a high molecular weight, suggestive of micelle formation. Conversely, the OspA moiety of the OspA/OspC vaccine was found to be nonlipidated and eluted as the monomeric protein. We hypothesize that these structural differences may account for the superior immunogenicity of the nonadjuvanted monovalent recombinant OspA vaccine in dogs over the adjuvanted OspA fraction of the OspA/OspC vaccine."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease arises from infection with pathogenic Borrelia species. In Canada, current case definition for confirmed Lyme disease requires serological confirmation by both a positive first tier ELISA and confirmatory second tier immunoblot (western blot). For surveillance and research initiatives, this requirement is intentionally conservative to exclude false positive results. Consequently, this approach is prone to false negative results that lead to underestimation of the number of people with Lyme disease. The province of New Brunswick (NB), Canada, can be used to quantify under-detection of the disease as three independent data sets are available to generate an estimate of the true human disease prevalence and incidence. First, detailed human disease incidence is available for the US states and counties bordering Canada, which can be compared with Canadian disease incidence. Second, published national serology results and well-described sensitivity and specificity values for these tests are available and deductive reasoning can be used to query for discrepancies. Third, high-density tick and canine surveillance data are available for the province, which can be used to predict expected human Lyme prevalence. Comparison of cross-border disease incidence suggests a minimum of 10.2 to 28-fold under-detection of Lyme disease (3.6% to 9.8% cases detected). Analysis of serological testing predicts the surveillance criteria generate 10.4-fold under-diagnosis (9.6% cases detected) in New Brunswick for 2014 due to serology alone. Calculation of expected human Lyme disease cases based on tick and canine infections in New Brunswick indicates a minimum of 12.1 to 58.2-fold underestimation (1.7% to 8.3% cases detected). All of these considerations apply generally across the country and strongly suggest that public health information is significantly under-detecting and under-reporting human Lyme cases across Canada. Causes of the discrepancies between reported cases and predicted actual cases may include undetected genetic diversity of Borrelia in Canada leading to failed serological detection of infection, failure to consider and initiate serological testing of patients, and failure to report clinically diagnosed acute cases. As these surveillance criteria are used to inform clinical and public health decisions, this under-detection will impact diagnosis and treatment of Canadian Lyme disease patients."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria borrelia burgdorferi and is spread primarily through the bite of a tick. There is considerable uncertainty in the medical community regarding the best approach to treating patients with Lyme disease who do not respond fully to short-term antibiotic therapy. These patients have persistent Lyme disease symptoms resulting from lack of treatment, under-treatment, or lack of response to their antibiotic treatment protocol. In the past, treatment trials have used small restrictive samples and relied on average treatment effects as their measure of success and produced conflicting results. To provide individualized care, clinicians need information that reflects their patient population. Today, we have the ability to analyze large data bases, including patient registries, that reflect the broader range of patients more typically seen in clinical practice. This allows us to examine treatment variation within the sample and identify groups of patients that are most responsive to treatment. Using patient-reported outcome data from the MyLymeData online patient registry, we show that sub-group analysis techniques can unmask valuable information that is hidden if averages alone are used. In our analysis, this approach revealed treatment effectiveness for up to a third of patients with Lyme disease. This study is important because it can help open the door to more individualized patient care using patient-centered outcomes and real-world evidence."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most widely reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Its incidence is rapidly increasing, and disease symptoms can be debilitating. The need to understand the biology of the disease agent, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is thus evermore pressing. Despite important advances in B. burgdorferi genetics, the array of molecular tools available for use in this organism remains limited, especially for cell biological studies. Here, we adapt a palette of bright and mostly monomeric fluorescent proteins for versatile use and multicolor imaging in B. burgdorferi We also characterize two novel antibiotic selection markers and establish the feasibility of their use in conjunction with extant markers. Last, we describe a set of promoters of low and intermediate strengths that allow fine-tuning of gene expression levels. These molecular tools complement and expand current experimental capabilities in B. burgdorferi, which will facilitate future investigation of this important human pathogen. To showcase the usefulness of these reagents, we used them to investigate the subcellular localization of BB0323, a B. burgdorferi lipoprotein essential for survival in the host and vector environments. We show that BB0323 accumulates at the cell poles and future division sites of B. burgdorferi cells, highlighting the complex subcellular organization of this spirochete.IMPORTANCE Genetic manipulation of the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi remains cumbersome, despite significant progress in the field. The scarcity of molecular reagents available for use in this pathogen has slowed research efforts to study its unusual biology. Of interest, B. burgdorferi displays complex cellular organization features that have yet to be understood. These include an unusual morphology and a highly fragmented genome, both of which are likely to play important roles in the bacterium's transmission, infectivity, and persistence. Here, we complement and expand the array of molecular tools available for use in B. burgdorferi by generating and characterizing multiple fluorescent proteins, antibiotic selection markers, and promoters of varied strengths. These tools will facilitate investigations in this important human pathogen, as exemplified by the polar and midcell localization of the cell envelope regulator BB0323, which we uncovered using these reagents."

As an effective public health response requires accurate information on disease distribution and areas of risk, this study aims to establish the geographic distribution of I. scapularis and its associated pathogen, B. burgdorferi, in northwestern Ontario. We assessed five years of active and passive tick surveillance data in northwestern Ontario. Between 2013 and 2017, 251 I. scapularis were submitted through passive surveillance. The submission rate increased over time, and the proportion infected with B. burgdorferi was 13.5%. Active tick surveillance from 2014 to 2016 found few I. scapularis specimens. In 2017, 102 I. scapularis were found in 10 locations around the city of Kenora; 60% were infected with B. burgdorferi, eight tested positive for A. phagocytophilum, and one for POWV. I. scapularis ticks were found in 14 locations within the Northwestern Health Unit area, with seven locations containing B. burgdorferi-positive ticks. We found abundant I. scapularis populations in the southern portion of northwestern Ontario and northward expansion is expected. It is recommended that I. scapularis populations continue to be monitored and mitigation strategies should be established for rural northern communities."

		"abstract": "Arthropods are small invertebrate animals, among which some species are hematophagous. It is during their blood meal that they can transmit pathogenic microorganisms that they may be harboring to the vertebrate host that they parasitize, which in turn will potentially develop a vector-borne disease. The transmission may occur directly through their bite, but also through contaminated feces. Zoonotic diseases, diseases that can naturally be transmitted between humans and animals, are a considerable part of emerging diseases worldwide, and a major part of them are vector-borne. Research and public attention has long been focused on malaria and mosquito-borne arboviruses, and bacterial vector-borne diseases remains today a neglected field of medical entomology. Despite the emphasis on Lyme disease in recent decades, and despite the major outbreaks caused by bacteria in the last few centuries, this field has in fact been poorly explored and is therefore relatively poorly known, other than the most famous examples such as the plague and epidemic typhus outbreaks. Here we propose to review the state of knowledge of bacterial agents transmitted by arthropod vectors."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes possess a unique periplasmic flagellar motor component called the collar. However, little is known about the composition or function of the flagellar collar proteins. To identify a collar protein, we have inactivated almost all genes annotated as motility-related in the Borrelia burgdorferi genome and identified only FlbB, which comprises the base of the collar. Since the major components of the collar complex remained unidentified, we took advantage of a protein-protein interaction map developed in another spirochete, Treponema pallidum to identify proteins of unknown function that could be collar proteins. Subsequently, using various comprehensive approaches, we identified a tetratricopeptide repeat protein BB0236 as a potential candidate for the collar. Biochemical assays indicated that FlbB interacts with BB0236. Furthermore, ∆bb0236 mutant analyses indicated that BB0236 is crucial for collar structure assembly, cellular morphology, motility, orientation of periplasmic flagella and assembly of other flagellar structures. Moreover, using comparative motor analyses, we propose how the collar structure is assembled in B. burgdorferi. Together, our studies provide new insights into the organization and the complex assembly inherent to the unique spirochetal collar structure."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most commonly reported tick-borne disease in Germany. In 9/16 states, notification of erythema migrans (EM), acute neuroborreliosis (NB) and Lyme arthritis (LA) is mandatory. We describe incidence measures, time trends, geographical distribution and frequencies of manifestations to better understand LB epidemiology and target prevention measures. We used cases notified in the 9 states and confirmed by local health offices, 2013-2017, to calculate incidences by time, place and person. Altogether, we observed 56,446 cases. Disease onset peaked yearly in July. Incidence ranged from 26/100,000 (2015) to 41/100,000 (2013) with mean annual incidences 2013-2017 on district level between 0.5/100,000 and 138/100,000. Median age was 54 years with peaks in boys (5-9 years, mean incidence 36/100,000) and women (50-69 years, mean incidence 57/100,000). 95% experienced EM only, 2.7% NB and 2.1% LA. 54% were female, but more men had NB (56%) and LA (53%, p < 0.001). Hospitalisation was recorded for 10% of LA and 71% of NB cases. LB remains an important public health concern in Germany with marked regional variation. To facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, health authorities should raise awareness among physicians and promote prevention strategies among the general population: tick-bite-protection, prompt tick removal and medical consultation."

Her initial laboratory evaluation was consistent with Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone (SIADH) but was otherwise unremarkable. MRI of the spine revealed bilateral diffuse nerve root enhancement from at least C6 to the conus level, suggesting an inflammatory process. Lumbar puncture demonstrated high protein (629 mg/dL) with marked pleocytosis (363 cells/mcL) incompatible with albuminocytological dissociation typically seen in Guillain-Barre syndrome. A thorough diagnostic evaluation was undertaken to explore potential infectious, malignant and autoimmune conditions.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. As the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the USA, LD affects 300,000 human cases each year. LD is caused by inoculation of the bacterial spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, from an infected tick. If not treated quickly and completely, the bacteria disseminate from the tick's biting site into multiple organs including the joints, heart, and brain. Thus, the best outcome from medical intervention can be expected with early detection and treatment with antibiotics, prior to multi-organ dissemination. In the absence of a characteristic rash, LD is diagnosed using serological testing involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by western blotting, which is collectively known as the two-tier algorithm. These assays detect host antibodies against the bacteria, but are hampered by low sensitivity, which can miss early LD cases. This review discusses the application of some current assays for diagnosing LD clinically, thus providing a foundation for exploring newer techniques being developed in the laboratory for more sensitive detection of early LD."

		"abstract": "Wearing of permethrin treated clothing is becoming more prevalent in military and outdoor occupational and recreational settings, as a personal protection measure against vector borne diseases transmitted through arthropods (e.g., malaria, Lyme disease). The goal of the study was to prospectively examine permethrin exposure among new U.S. Army recruits who had just been issued permethrin-treated uniforms over a 10-week military training period and whether individual body composition (percent body fat, %BF) and physical workload (total energy expenditure, TEE) influenced the exposure. Exposure was assessed by quantification in urine of three permethrin metabolites, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), and cis- and trans-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. Although there was individual variability, urinary concentrations and estimated dose levels decreased over the 10-week period. Mixed models demonstrated that 10% higher %BF was significantly associated with 4.42% higher 3-PBA concentrations and a 10% higher daily TEE was significantly associated with a 10.57% higher 3-PBA concentrations. Additional factors influencing exposure included sex, number of uniform launderings, and wear- time (hours per previous day)."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spirochetes are tick-borne Gram-negative bacteria that cause disease in humans and animals. Although many studies have focused on Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease, recent studies have examined the role of Relapsing Fever Borrelia (RFB) in human disease. In this pilot study, we have evaluated serological reactivity against Bb and RFB in patients residing in California. Serological testing for reactivity to Bb and RFB antigens was performed in 543 patients with suspected tick-borne illness using a Western blot technique. Further evaluation of a subset of 321 patients residing in California was obtained. Serum samples were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies reactive with Bb and RFB, and samples were classified by county of residence according to Bb reactivity alone, RFB reactivity alone, and dual reactivity against Bb and RFB. Seroreactivity was ranked in counties with the highest absolute number and the highest prevalence of positive samples. Of the 543 total serum samples, 32% were positive for Bb, 22% were positive for RFB, and 7% were positive for both Bb and RFB. Of the 321 serum samples from patients residing in California, 33% were positive for Bb, 27% were positive for RFB, and 11% were positive for both Bb and RFB. In the California cohort, the highest rates of positive serological testing for Bb were found in Santa Clara, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties, while the highest rates of positive serological testing for RFB were found in Santa Clara, Alameda, Marin, and San Francisco counties. The highest rates of dual reactivity against Bb and RFB were found in Contra Costa, Alameda, and San Francisco counties. Among the 24 counties with patients who were tested, Bb seropositivity alone was found in four counties, RFB seropositivity alone was found in two counties, and seropositivity for both Bb and RFB was found in 14 counties. Results of this pilot study suggest that seroreactivity against Bb and RFB is widespread in California, and dual exposure to Bb and RFB may complicate the diagnosis of tick-borne disease. Greater awareness of RFB and broader screening for this tick-borne infection is warranted."

		"abstract": "There is controversy whether non-specific symptoms can be related to previous Lyme borreliosis (LB). Positive serology can be considered a proxy for previous or persistent LB. We assessed non-specific symptoms and serology in patients suspected of LB referred to a Lyme centre. Included were adult patients who visited a Lyme centre between 2008 and 2014. Before medical consultation, serum samples were taken and questionnaires on non-specific symptoms completed. The prevalence of non-specific symptoms was calculated for patients with positive and negative IgG serology. Logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for an association between positive serology and non-specific symptoms. Of 1439 included patients, 31.6% (455/1439) had positive serology. The most common non-specific symptoms were severe fatigue (61.4%, 883/1439), sleep disturbances (54.8%, 789/1439) and stiffness of neck/back (52.6%, 757/1439). The prevalence of severe fatigue was 53.0% (241/455) in patients with positive serology vs. 65.2% (642/984) in patients with negative serology (OR = 0.74; 95% CI, 0.58-0.94). The prevalence of sleep disturbances was respectively 46.2% (210/455) vs. 58.8% (579/984) (OR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.58-0.93). The prevalence of stiffness of neck/back was respectively 47.7% (217/455) vs. 54.9% (540/984) (OR = 0.85; 95% CI, 0.67-1.06). In patients referred to a Lyme centre, non-specific symptoms did not occur more frequently in patients with positive serology compared to patients with negative serology. Hence, a questionnaire on non-specific symptoms cannot be used for identifying patients with possible post-LB symptoms in clinical practice."

This amino sugar is required for cell wall synthesis, and is a component of the complex growth medium used for in vitro propagation. When cultured without free GlcNAc, B. burgdorferi cells exhibit a unique biphasic growth pattern. We hypothesized that genes involved in the GlcNAc starvation response would be differentially expressed when compared to cells cultured in complete medium, and investigated this using transcriptomics. Twenty-one genes were differentially regulated in wild-type and starvation-adapted cells cultured without GlcNAc compared to wild-type cells cultured with GlcNAc. Of those, three genes involved in carbohydrate utilization were upregulated: bbb04 (chbC) encoding a subunit of the chitobiose transporter, bb0629 (fruA-2) encoding a putative carbohydrate transporter and bb0644 (nanE) encoding a putative GlcNAc-6-phosphate-2-epimerase predicted to catalyze the conversion of N-acetylmannosamine-6-phosphate (ManNAc-6-P) to GlcNAc-6-P. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm differential expression of select genes, and substitution of free GlcNAc with free ManNAc resulted in growth to high cell density, suggesting B. burgdorferi cells can utilize free ManNAc for cell wall synthesis and energy production."

To conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) of all randomized clinical trials on various antibiotic agents and treatment modalities in early cutaneous LB. Electronic searches in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were conducted from inception until July 2017. The reference lists of the included studies were hand searched, authors were contacted, and ongoing trials were searched at ClinicalTrials.gov. One reviewer screened the titles and abstracts of the 9975 reports identified by the electronic searches. Full-text copies of 161 potentially relevant articles were obtained, and 2 reviewers independently assessed those articles for inclusion. Adults with a physician-confirmed early localized skin infection who were treated with antibiotics of any dose or duration were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data on study, patient, and intervention characteristics. Network meta-analyses on treatment effects and adverse outcomes were calculated with a frequentist approach using the R package netmeta. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation guidance for NMA was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Treatment effects for response to treatment (resolution of symptoms) and treatment-related adverse events. Overall, 19 studies (2532 patients) were included. The mean patient age ranged between 37 and 56 years, and the percentage of female patients ranged from 36% to 60%. The antibiotics investigated were doxycycline, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, azithromycin, penicillin V, and minocycline. Pooled effect sizes from NMAs did not suggest any significant differences in treatment response by antibiotic agent (eg, amoxicillin vs doxycycline odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.41-3.87), dose, or duration (eg, doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 3 weeks, vs doxycycline, 200 mg/d for 2 weeks, odds ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.49-3.34). Treatment failures were rare at both 2 months (4%; 95% CI, 2%-5%) and 12 months (2%, 95% CI, 1%-3%) after treatment initiation. There were also no differences in the effect sizes among antibiotic agents and treatment modalities for treatment-related adverse outcomes, which were generally mild to moderate. Certainty of evidence was categorized as low and very low mostly because of imprecision, indirectness, and study limitations (high risk of bias) of the included studies. This NMA suggests that neither the antibiotic agent nor treatment modality contributed to comparative effectiveness or drug-related adverse outcomes. This finding is relevant for physicians treating patients with LB and for patient decision making."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (borreliosis) is a tick-borne bacterial infection caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdoferi, transmitted by hard-backed Ixodes ticks. Actual numbers of cases are increasing and it appears that the distribution across the UK is widening; however, it occurs most frequently in area of woodland, with temperate climate. It typically presents in mid to late summer. Lyme disease is a multisystem disease. The nervous system is the second most commonly affected system after the skin. Other systemic manifestations, such as carditis, keratitis, uveitis and inflammatory arthritis, rarely occur in European Lyme disease. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has updated its guidelines on the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease. Here, we highlight important aspects of this guidance and provide a more detailed review of the clinical spectrum of neuroborreliosis, illustrated by cases we have seen."

A lumbar puncture excluded the condition of Neuroborreliosis. The diagnostic workup included: an MRI scan, a 18F-FDG PET, a 123I-ioflupane-SPECT, an amyloid-β PET, a specific genetic analysis, and a neuropsychological evaluation. Based on our investigation, the patient was diagnosed with probable behavioral-frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), whereas in the previous years, the patient had been considered firstly as a case of Post-Treatment-Lyme Disease and, secondly, a psychiatric patient. We believe that, in the present case, such initial symptoms of Borrelia infection may have superimposed on those of bvFTD rather than playing as a contributory cause."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis is an uncommon presentation of the early-disseminated phase of Lyme disease, although it is recognizable and often curable. Because of its rarity, diagnosing Lyme carditis requires a high level of suspicion, especially when young patients in certain endemic areas present with symptoms of bradycardia and/or evidence of high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Temporary cardiac pacing along with antibiotic therapy has been shown to aid in the management of Lyme carditis until symptoms and conduction blocks have resolved. Herein, we report two cases of Lyme carditis-induced AV block that were successfully managed and reversed with temporary cardiac pacing and antibiotics. In order to monitor for any late sequela that may arise, we also recommend close follow-up for patients treated for Lyme carditis with high-degree AV block. <Learning objective: Lyme carditis manifests as a conduction system disease, predominantly involving the atrioventricular (AV) node. It can present without the classical signs of Lyme disease. It is critical to have a high suspicion of Lyme carditis in patients who present with symptoms of bradycardia or high-degree AV block in high prevalence areas. Early initiation of antibiotics, along with external temporary pacing, dramatically improves mortality rates. Close follow-up is important in patients that develop high-degree AV block.>."

		"abstract": "In recent years, the known distribution of vector-borne diseases in Europe has changed, with much new information also available now on the status of vectors in the United Kingdom (UK). For example, in 2016, the UK reported their first detection of the non-native mosquito Aedes albopictus, which is a known vector for dengue and chikungunya virus. In 2010, Culex modestus, a principal mosquito vector for West Nile virus was detected in large numbers in the Thames estuary. For tick-borne diseases, data on the changing distribution of the Lyme borreliosis tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, has recently been published, at a time when there has been an increase in the numbers of reported human cases of Lyme disease. This paper brings together the latest surveillance data and pertinent research on vector-borne disease in the UK, and its relevance to public health. It highlights the need for continued vector surveillance systems to monitor our native mosquito and tick fauna, as well as the need to expand surveillance for invasive species. It illustrates the importance of maintaining surveillance capacity that is sufficient to ensure accurate and timely disease risk assessment to help mitigate the UK's changing emerging infectious disease risks, especially in a time of climatic and environmental change and increasing global connectivity."

		"abstract": "This article presents an overview of the current diagnosis and management of two spirochetal infections of the nervous system, neuroborreliosis (Lyme disease) and neurosyphilis, focusing on similarities and differences. Although neuroborreliosis was first identified almost a century ago, much confusion remains about how to accurately diagnose this quite treatable nervous system infection. Well-established diagnostic tools and therapeutic regimens exist for neurosyphilis, which has been well-known for centuries. Serologic testing targeting the C6 antigen may simplify diagnostic testing in neuroborreliosis while improving accuracy. Historically, screening for syphilis has used a reaginic test followed by a treponeme-specific assay; alternative approaches, including use of well-defined recombinant antigens, may improve sensitivity without sacrificing specificity. In neuroborreliosis, measurement of the chemokine CXCL13 in CSF may provide a useful marker of disease activity in the central nervous system. Lyme disease causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and mononeuropathy multiplex. Cognitive symptoms, occurring either during (encephalopathy) or after infection (posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome) are rarely, if ever, due to central nervous system infection. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is not antibiotic responsive. Syphilis causes meningitis, cranial neuritis, chronic meningovascular syphilis, tabes dorsalis, and parenchymal neurosyphilis. The organism remains highly sensitive to penicillin, but residua of chronic infection may be irreversible."

We sought to identify health disparities associated with Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis, two of the most pervasive tickborne diseases within the United States. We used general linear mixed models to measure associations between county-level disease incidence and six variables representing racial/ethnic and socioeconomic characteristics of counties (percent white non-Hispanic; percent with a bachelors degree or higher; percent living below the poverty line; percent unemployed; percent of housing units vacant; per capita number of property crimes). Two ecological variables important to tick demography (percent forest cover; density of white-tailed deer) were included in secondary analyses to contextualize findings. Analyses included data from 2,695 counties in 37 states and the District of Columbia during 2007-2013. Each of the six variables was significantly associated with the incidence of one or both diseases, but the direction and magnitude of associations varied by disease. Results suggested that the incidence of Lyme disease was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and more educated persons and lower poverty and crime rates; the incidence of human monocytic ehrlichiosis was highest in counties with relatively higher proportions of white and less educated persons, higher unemployment rates and lower crime rates. The percentage of housing units vacant was a strong positive predictor for both diseases with a magnitude of association comparable to those between incidence and the ecological variables. Our findings indicate that racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in disease incidence appear to be epidemiologically important features of Lyme disease and human monocytic ehrlichiosis in the United States. Steps to mitigate encroachment of wild flora and fauna into areas with vacant housing might be warranted to reduce disease risk."

Sheep is considered a natural reservoir for B. burgdorferi and plays a pivotal role in disease transmission and the expansion of natural foci. An epidemiological investigation of B. burgdorferi in sheep is essential for prevention and control of Lyme disease. In this study, we developed a recombinant outer surface protein C (OspC)-based ELISA for serological study of B. burgdorferi in sheep with a specificity and sensitivity of 84.4% and 86.2%, respectively. A total of 972 collected serum samples from the Northeast China regions in 2015 and 2016 were determined with positive rates of 5.8% and 12.2%, respectively. Thus, specific pathogen-free sheep were infected with B. burgdorferi SZ strain to study on the secretion of specificity antibody against OspC. It revealed that specific antibody was detected on day 5 postinoculation and sustained in a high level for ∼28 days, the peak occurred at ∼13 days. Taken together, the result indicated that the established ELISA is capable for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological study on B. burgdorferi in sheep at the early stage of infection and detecting the specific antibody during the secretion period."

Though traditional tetracycline antibiotic therapy is generally prescribed for Lyme disease, still 10%-20% of patients treated with current antibiotic therapy still show lingering symptoms. In order to identify new drugs, we have evaluated four cephalosporins as a therapeutic alternative to commonly used antibiotics for the treatment of Lyme disease by using microdilution techniques like minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). We have determined the MIC and MBC of four drugs for three Borrelia burgdorferi s.s strains namely CA8, JLB31 and NP40. The binding studies were performed using in silico analysis. The MIC order of the four drugs tested is cefoxitin (1.25 µM/mL) > cefamandole (2.5 µM/mL), > cefuroxime (5 µM/mL) > cefapirin (10 µM/mL). Among the drugs that are tested in this study using in vivo C3H/HeN mouse model, cefoxitin effectively kills B. burgdorferi. The in silico analysis revealed that all four cephalosporins studied binds effectively to B. burgdorferi proteins, SecA subunit penicillin-binding protein (PBP) and Outer surface protein E (OspE). Based on the data obtained, cefoxitin has shown high efficacy killing B. burgdorferi at concentration of 1.25 µM/mL. In addition to it, cefoxitin cleared B. burgdorferi infection in C3H/HeN mice model at 20 mg/kg."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector for the bacterium causing Lyme disease in eastern North America and for other medically important pathogens. This species is vulnerable to attack by fungal pathogens and arthropod predators, but the impacts of interactions between biocontrol agents have not been examined. The biocontrol agent Met52®, containing the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium brunneum (=M. anisopliae), controls blacklegged ticks with efficacy comparable to chemical acaricides. The brush-legged wolf spider Schizocosa ocreata is a predator of I. scapularis that reduces their survival under field conditions. We conducted a field microcosm experiment to assess the compatibility of Met52 and S. ocreata as tick biocontrol agents. We compared the fits of alternative models in predicting survival of unfed (flat) and blood-fed (engorged) nymphs. We found the strongest support for a model that included negative effects of Met52 and S. ocreata on flat nymph survival. We found evidence for interference between biocontrol agents, with Met52 reducing spider survival, but we did not find a significant interaction effect between the two agents on nymph survival. For engorged nymphs, low recovery rates resulted in low statistical power to detect possible effects of biocontrol agents. We found that nymph questing activity was lower when the spider was active above the leaf litter than when the spider was unobserved. This provides the first evidence that predation cues might affect behavior important for tick fitness and pathogen transmission. This study presents field microcosm evidence that the biopesticide Met52 and spider Schizocosa ocreata each reduced survival of blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis. Met52 reduced spider survival. Potential interference between Met52 and the spider should be examined at larger scales, where overlap patterns may differ. Ticks were more likely to quest when the spider was inactive, suggesting the ticks changed their behavior to reduce danger."

		"abstract": "Prokaryote restriction modification (RM) systems serve to protect bacteria from potentially detrimental foreign DNA. Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation by the methyltransferase (MTase) components of RM systems can also have effects on transcriptome profiles. The type strain of the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi B31, possesses two RM systems with N6-methyladenosine (m6A) MTase activity, which are encoded by the bbe02 gene located on linear plasmid lp25 and bbq67 on lp56. The specific recognition and/or methylation sequences had not been identified for either of these B. burgdorferi MTases, and it was not previously known whether these RM systems influence transcript levels. In the current study, single-molecule real-time sequencing was utilized to map genome-wide m6A sites and to identify consensus modified motifs in wild-type B. burgdorferi as well as MTase mutants lacking either the bbe02 gene alone or both bbe02 and bbq67 genes. Four novel conserved m6A motifs were identified and were fully attributable to the presence of specific MTases. Whole-genome transcriptome changes were observed in conjunction with the loss of MTase enzymes, indicating that DNA methylation by the RM systems has effects on gene expression. Genes with altered transcription in MTase mutants include those involved in vertebrate host colonization (e.g., rpoS regulon) and acquisition by/transmission from the tick vector (e.g., rrp1 and pdeB). The results of this study provide a comprehensive view of the DNA methylation pattern in B. burgdorferi, and the accompanying gene expression profiles add to the emerging body of research on RM systems and gene regulation in bacteria.IMPORTANCE Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America and is classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as an emerging infectious disease with an expanding geographical area of occurrence. Previous studies have shown that the causative bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, methylates its genome using restriction modification systems that enable the distinction from foreign DNA. Although much research has focused on the regulation of gene expression in B. burgdorferi, the effect of DNA methylation on gene regulation has not been evaluated. The current study characterizes the patterns of DNA methylation by restriction modification systems in B. burgdorferi and evaluates the resulting effects on gene regulation in this important pathogen."

		"abstract": "In a world where climate change, vector expansion, human activity, and pathogen dispersal do not respect boundaries, the human⁻animal⁻pathogen interface has become less defined. Consequently, a One Health approach to disease surveillance and control has generated much interest across several disciplines. This systematic review evaluates current global research on the use of domestic dogs as sentinels for human infectious disease, and critically appraises how this may be applied within Canada. Results highlighted a bias in research from high- and middle-income-economy countries, with 35% of the studies describing data from the Latin America/Caribbean region, 25% from North America, and 11% from the European/Central Asia region. Bacteria were the most studied type of infectious agent, followed by protozoa, viruses, helminths, and fungi. Only six out of 142 studies described disease in Canada: four researched a variety of pathogens within Indigenous communities, one researched Borrelia burgdorferi in British Columbia, and one researched arboviruses in Quebec. Results from this review suggest that dogs could provide excellent sentinels for certain infectious-disease pathogens in Canada, yet are currently overlooked. Further research into the use of dog-sentinel surveillance is specifically recommended for California serogroup viruses, Chikungunya virus, West Nile virus, Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., and Dirofilaria immitis."

		"abstract": "In Maryland, Lyme disease (LD) is the most widely reported tickborne disease. All laboratories and healthcare providers are required to report LD cases to the local health department. Given the large volume of LD reports, the nuances of diagnosing and reporting LD, and the effort required for investigations by local health department staff, surveillance for LD is burdensome and subject to underreporting. To determine the degree to which misclassification occurs in Maryland, we reviewed medical records for a sample of LD reports from 2009. We characterized what proportion of suspected and \"not a case\" reports could be reclassified as confirmed or probable once additional information was obtained from medical record review, explored the reasons for misclassification, and determined multipliers for a more accurate number of LD cases. We reviewed medical records for reports originally classified as suspected (n = 44) and \"not a case\" (n = 92). Of these 136 records, 31 (23%) suspected cases and \"not a case\" reports were reclassified. We calculated multipliers and applied them to the case counts from 2009, and estimate an additional 269 confirmed and probable cases, a 13.3% increase. Reasons for misclassification fell into three general categories: lack of clinical or diagnostic information from the provider; surveillance process errors; and incomplete information provided on laboratory reports. These multipliers can be used to calculate a better approximation of the true number of LD cases in Maryland, but these multipliers only account for underreporting due to misclassification, and do not account for cases that are not reported at all (e.g., LD diagnoses based on erythema migrans alone that are not reported) or for cases that are not investigated. Knowing that misclassification of cases occurs during the existing LD surveillance process underscores the complexities of LD surveillance, which further reinforces the need to find alternative approaches to LD surveillance."

		"abstract": "Borrelia are tick-borne bacteria that in humans are the aetiological agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. Here we present the first genomes of B. turcica and B. tachyglossi, members of a recently described and rapidly expanding Borrelia clade associated with reptile (B. turcica) or echidna (B. tachyglossi) hosts, transmitted by hard ticks, and of unknown pathogenicity. Borrelia tachyglossi and B. turcica genomes are similar to those of relapsing fever Borrelia species, containing a linear ~ 900 kb chromosome, a single long (> 70 kb) linear plasmid, and numerous short (< 40 kb) linear and circular plasmids, as well as a suite of housekeeping and macronutrient biosynthesis genes which are not found in Lyme disease Borrelia. Additionally, both B. tachyglossi and B. turcica contain paralogous vsp and vlp proteins homologous to those used in the multiphasic antigen-switching system used by relapsing fever Borrelia to evade vertebrate immune responses, although their number was greatly reduced compared to human-infectious species. However, B. tachyglossi and B. turcica chromosomes also contain numerous genes orthologous to Lyme disease Borrelia-specific genes, demonstrating a unique evolutionary, and potentially phenotypic link between these groups. Borrelia tachyglossi and B. turcica genomes also have unique genetic features, including degraded and deleted tRNA modification genes, and an expanded range of macronutrient salvage and biosynthesis genes compared to relapsing fever and Lyme disease Borrelia. These genomes and genomic comparisons provide an insight into the biology and evolutionary origin of these Borrelia, and provide a valuable resource for future work."

Environmental factors are known to influence regional and seasonal incidence of Lyme disease and possibly the endemicity of the disease to the northeastern and upper mid-western regions of the United States. With a goal to understand the impact of environmental temperature on microbial communities within the tick, we investigated the bacterial microbiome of colony-reared I. scapularis ticks statically incubated at different temperatures (4, 20, 30, and 37°C) at a constant humidity in a controlled laboratory setting by comparison of sequenced amplicons of the bacterial 16S V4 rRNA gene to that of the untreated baseline controls. The microbiomes of colony-reared I. scapularis males were distinct than that of females, which were entirely dominated by Rickettsia. In silico removal of Rickettsia sequences from female data revealed the underlying bacterial community, which is consistent in complexity with those seen among male ticks. The bacterial community composition of these ticks changes upon incubation at 30°C for a week and 37°C for more than 5 days. Moreover, the male ticks incubated at 30 and 37°C exhibited significantly different bacterial diversity compared to the initial baseline microbiome, and the change in bacterial diversity was dependent upon duration of exposure. Rickettsia-free data revealed a significantly different bacterial diversity in female ticks incubated at 37°C compared to that of 4 and 20°C treatments. These results provide experimental evidence that environmental temperature can impact the tick bacterial microbiome in a laboratory setting."

Such a possibility would seem to exist but various factors, as discussed in this perspective, make this less likely to occur. Nonetheless, if not done already, safeguards need to be put in place at blood collection and dispensing facilities, possibly with the assistance of diagnostic microbiology and immunology laboratories, to ensure that the potential for the transfer of the Lyme disease spirochete through a blood transfusion remains a theoretical consideration rather than a real possibility."

		"abstract": "The post-translational modification of proteins has been shown to be extremely important in prokaryotes. Using a highly sensitive mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach, we have characterized the acetylome of B. burgdorferi. As previously reported for other bacteria, a relatively low number (5%) of the potential genome-encoded proteins of B. burgdorferi were acetylated. Of these, the vast majority were involved in central metabolism and cellular information processing (transcription, translation, etc.). Interestingly, these critical cell functions were targeted during both ML (mid-log) and S (stationary) phases of growth. However, acetylation of target proteins in ML phase was limited to single lysine residues while these same proteins were acetylated at multiple sites during S phase. To determine the acetyl donor in B. burgdorferi, we used mutants that targeted the sole acetate metabolic/anabolic pathway in B. burgdorferi (lipid I synthesis). B. burgdorferi strains B31-A3, B31-A3 ΔackA (acetyl-P- and acetyl-CoA-) and B31-A3 Δpta (acetyl-P+ and acetyl-CoA-) were grown to S phase and the acetylation profiles were analyzed. While only two proteins were acetylated in the ΔackA mutant, 140 proteins were acetylated in the Δpta mutant suggesting that acetyl-P was the primary acetyl donor in B. burgdorferi. Using specific enzymatic assays, we were able to demonstrate that hyperacetylation of proteins in S phase appeared to play a role in decreasing the enzymatic activity of at least two glycolytic proteins. Currently, we hypothesize that acetylation is used to modulate enzyme activities during different stages of growth. This strategy would allow the bacteria to post-translationally stimulate the activity of key glycolytic enzymes by deacetylation rather than expending excessive energy synthesizing new proteins. This would be an appealing, low-energy strategy for a bacterium with limited metabolic capabilities. Future work focuses on identifying potential protein deacetylase(s) to complete our understanding of this important biological process."

		"abstract": "While the prevalence of human pathogens has been quantified in ticks in Adair County, Missouri, the prevalence of residents acquiring tick-borne diseases and seeking medical treatment has not. A public survey (n=109) revealed that 96% of respondents reported finding attached ticks on their person; of these, 38% developed symptoms post tick bite; of these, 55% reported consultation with a health care provider. Overall, 89% of practitioners surveyed had treated at least one patient for tick-borne disease. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease were the most common illnesses diagnosed, however, the only confirmed cases reported by Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services from 2013-2017 were ehrlichiosis. Results from these surveys indicate that exposure to ticks is common and ehrlichiosis infections are likely underdiagnosed while Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease are likely overdiagnosed."

		"abstract": "In most patients with Lyme arthritis (LA), antibiotic therapy results in Borrelia burgdorferi pathogen elimination, tissue repair, and return to homeostasis. However, despite spirochetal killing, some patients develop proliferative synovitis, characterised by synovial hyperplasia, inflammation, vascular damage, and fibrosis that persists for months to several years after antibiotic treatment, called postinfectious LA. In this study, we characterised the transcriptomes of postinfectious LA patients' synovial tissue, the target tissue of the immune response. High-throughput RNA sequencing to a depth of ~30 million reads per sample was used to profile gene expression in synovial tissue from 14 patients with postinfectious LA, compared with eight patients with other types of chronic inflammatory arthritis and five with minimally inflammatory osteoarthritis (OA). Synovium from postinfectious LA and other inflammatory arthritides shared gene signatures associated with antigen presentation, innate immune responses, and cell-mediated immune activation, whereas these responses were diminished in OA synovium. Unique to postinfectious LA was a particularly robust interferon-gamma (IFNγ) signature. Moreover, this heightened IFNγ signature inversely correlated with expression of genes involved in repair of damaged tissue, including genes associated with stromal cell proliferation and differentiation, neovascularisation, and extracellular matrix synthesis, which were markedly suppressed in postinfectious LA. Transcriptional observations were confirmed by cytokine profiling, histologic analyses, and clinical correlations. We propose that in patients with postinfectious LA, overexpression of IFNγ in synovium prevents appropriate repair of tissue damaged by B. burgdorferi infection, blocking return to tissue homeostasis long after completion of antibiotic therapy and resolution of active infection."

A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings. Recognizing erythema migrans is important in making the diagnosis of Lyme disease so that antibiotics can be initiated promptly. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, which is due to a hypersensitivity reaction, presents with annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions. Treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness. Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders, and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers. Annular lesions occur less commonly in persons with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare."

Here we discuss a case report of three PM carriers: two monozygotic twins (aged 8 years) harboring an FMR1 allele with 150-180 CGG repeats, with no cognitive or intellectual issues but diagnosed with depression, mood instability and ADHD, and their mother (asymptomatic carrier with 78 CGG repeats). Fibroblasts and lymphocytes from the twins presented a generalized OXPHOS deficit, altered mitochondrial network, accumulation of depolarized mitochondria, and increased mitochondrial ROS production, outcomes distinct and more severe than the mother's ones, suggesting the involvement of modulatory effects mediated by CGG expansion, X-activation ratio, sex hormones and epigenetic factors (chronic inflammation, consequence of Lyme disease). The degree of the severity of MD appeared to segregate with the morbidity of the phenotype. The mitochondrial ROS-mediated HIF-1α stabilization was identified as a key player at contributing to the MD, pointing it as a novel target for future therapeutical intervention."

		"abstract": "Calprotectin is a potent antimicrobial that inhibits the growth of pathogens by tightly binding transition metals such as Mn and Zn, thereby preventing their uptake and utilization by invading microbes. At sites of infection, calprotectin is abundantly released from neutrophils, but calprotectin is also present in non-neutrophil cell types that may be relevant to infections. We show here that in patients infected with the Lyme disease pathogen Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi, calprotectin is produced in neutrophil-free regions of the skin, in both epidermal keratinocytes and in immune cells infiltrating the dermis, including CD68 positive macrophages. In culture, B. burgdorferi's growth is inhibited by calprotectin, but surprisingly, the mechanism does not involve the classical withholding of metal nutrients. B. burgdorferi cells exposed to calprotectin cease growth with no reduction in intracellular Mn and no loss in activity of Mn enzymes including the SodA superoxide dismutase. Additionally, there is no obvious loss in intracellular Zn. Rather than metal depletion, we find that calprotectin inhibits B. burgdorferi growth through a mechanism that requires physical association of calprotectin with the bacteria. By comparison, calprotectin inhibited E. coli growth without physically interacting with the microbe, and calprotectin effectively depleted E. coli of intracellular Mn and Zn. Our studies with B. burgdorferi demonstrate that the antimicrobial capacity of calprotectin is complex and extends well beyond simple withholding of metal micronutrients."

		"abstract": "This study assessed cost-effectiveness of a potential anti-tick vaccine that would protect against both Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in a highly endemic setting of Slovenia. A Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of a vaccine with potential combined protection against LB and TBE from the societal perspective. The model expressed time in annual cycles, followed a target population through their lifetime, and applied an annual discounting of 3%. A target population entered the model in a susceptible state, with time dependent probabilities to acquire LB/TBE. Disease manifestations were either resolved within one cycle, or a patient developed LB/TBE sequelae. The vaccination consisted of initial immunization and one revaccination. Estimates of LB/TBE direct and indirect costs, and data on natural course of LB/TBE were obtained from Slovenian databases. Effectiveness of the vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was derived from studies on existing TBE and LB vaccines, while utility estimates were collected from various literature sources. A vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was predicted to have an incremental cost of €771,300 per 10,000 vaccinated persons, an incremental utility of 17QALYs and a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 46,061€/QALY. Vaccine cost, effectiveness and discount rates were identified as the most influential model parameters. A wholesale price for a vaccine shot of €9.13 would lead to cost savings followed by health gains for the vaccination strategy. The base-case ICER was below commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness, indicating that a combined LB/TBE vaccine might be a cost-effective option in Slovenia. With early Health Technology Assessment becoming increasingly important, this analysis still represents a rare example of cost-effectiveness assessment prior to market authorisation. Although obviously in such a situation some key parameters are unknown, our model sets up a tool to analyse pharmacoeconomic criteria that can help development of a cost-effective health technology, in this case a combined tick-borne diseases vaccine."

We aimed to assess the first year of activity of this care pathway. We included all patients managed in the AMDPL pathway from November 1, 2016 to October 31, 2017. The first step was a dedicated Lyme disease consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Following this consultation, the LB diagnosis was either confirmed and adequate treatment was prescribed, or a differential diagnosis was established and patients received adequate management, or further investigations were required and patients were offered multidisciplinary management as part of a day hospitalization. A total of 468 patients were included. LB diagnosis was confirmed in 15% of patients (69/468), 49% of patients received a differential diagnosis, and 26% (122/468) of patients had the LB diagnosis ruled out without receiving any other diagnosis. This is to our knowledge the first multidisciplinary center implemented in France for the management of patients presenting with LB suspicion related to polymorphous signs and symptoms. Several diagnoses could be confirmed or corrected, although some symptoms and complaints could not be explained. This cohort could improve our knowledge of LB and its differential diagnoses."

		"abstract": "The study compares diagnostic parameters of different commercial serological kits based on three different antigen types and correlates test results with the status of the patient's Borrelia infection. In total, 8 IgM and 8 IgG kits were tested, as follows: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Euroimmun) based on whole-cell antigen, 3 species-specific enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (TestLine), Liaison chemiluminescence (DiaSorin), ELISA-Viditest (Vidia), EIA, and Blot-Line (TestLine) using recombinant antigens. All tests were performed on a panel of 90 samples from patients with clinically characterized borreliosis (53 with neuroborreliosis, 32 with erythema migrans, and 5 with arthritis) plus 70 controls from blood donors and syphilis patients. ELISA based on whole-cell antigens has superior sensitivity and superior negative predictive value and serves as an excellent screening test, although its specificity and positive predictive values are low. Species-specific tests have volatile parameters. Their low sensitivity and low negative predictive value handicap them in routine diagnostics. Tests with recombinant antigens are characterized by high specificity and high positive predictive value and have a wide range of use in diagnostic practice. Diagnostic parameters of individual tests depend on the composition of the sample panel. Only a small proportion of contradictory samples giving both negative and positive results is responsible for discrepancies between test results. Correlation of test results with the patient's clinical state is limited, especially in the erythema migrans group with high proportions of negative and contradictory results. In contrast, IgG test results in the neuroborreliosis group, which are more concordant, show acceptable agreement with Borrelia status."

Several studies of positive serology to Borrelia burgdorferi and several cases of Lyme disease have been reported in Peru in the last two decades. New information suggests that new species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato do exist in South America, and possibly in Peru. Future genetic and microbiology studies in this part of the continent, not only in cases with an indeterminate Western blot but in vectors and possible reservoirs as well, are necessary to measure the extent and clinical implications of these new Borrelia species."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, encounters two disparate host environments during its enzootic life cycle, Ixodes ticks and mammalian hosts. B. burgdorferi has a small genome that encodes a streamlined cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling system comprising a single diguanylate cyclase, Rrp1, and two phosphodiesterases. This system is essential for spirochete survival in ticks, in part because it controls the expression of the glp operon involved in glycerol utilization. In this study, we showed that a B. burgdorferi c-di-GMP receptor, PlzA, functions as both a positive and a negative regulator for glp expression. Deletion of plzA or mutation in plzA that impaired c-di-GMP binding abolished glp expression. On the other hand, overexpression of plzA resulted in glp repression, which could be rescued by simultaneous overexpression of rrp1. plzA overexpression in the rrp1 mutant, which is devoid of c-di-GMP, or overexpression of a plzA mutant incapable of c-di-GMP binding further enhanced glp repression. Combined results suggest that c-di-GMP-bound PlzA functions as a positive regulator, whereas ligand-free PlzA acts as a negative regulator for glp expression. Thus, PlzA of B. burgdorferi with a streamlined c-di-GMP signaling system not only controls multiple targets, as previously envisioned, but has also evolved different modes of action.IMPORTANCE The Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, has a simple cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling system essential for adaptation of the pathogen to the complicated tick environment. The c-di-GMP effector of B. burgdorferi, PlzA, has been shown to regulate multiple cellular processes, including motility, osmolality sensing, and nutrient utilization. The findings of this study demonstrate that PlzA not only controls multiple targets but also has different functional modalities, allowing it to act as both positive and negative regulator of the glp operon expression. This work highlights how bacteria with a small genome can compensate for the limited regulatory repertoire by increasing the complexity of targets and modes of action in their regulatory proteins."

		"abstract": "Ticks are cosmopolitan vectors of numerous diseases, and detection of various pathogens in ticks can help to assess their distribution. In the current study, 528 adult ticks were collected from grazing animals or the ground in ten different Mongolian provinces. Dermacentor nuttalli constituted 76.1% of them and was found in all ecozones except the eastern desert. Dermacentor marginatus (8.3%), Dermacentor silvarum (1.1%) and Ixodes persulcatus (3.0%) were found in the northern forest areas and Hyalomma asiaticum (11.4%) only in the southern (semi-)desert. Of these, 359 ticks were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR was carried out to detect various pathogens. Anaplasma spp. was found in D. marginatus and D. nuttalli (2.5% positive each), including flagged specimen and identified as Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Borrelia spp. were found in 2.5% of the ticks (mostly in I. persulcatus) and identified as Borrelia garinii. Babesia spp. (40%) identified as Babesia caballi were detected in all five tick species including flagged Dermacentor spp. and I. persulcatus, and 3.5% of the ticks (all species except D. silvarum) were positive for Theileria spp. identified as Theileria equi. The piroplasms were found in all provinces. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not detected. The results highlight the high risk of equine piroplasmosis in Mongolia, which is a concern for both the nomadic population who rely on horses for transport and for conservation of Przewalski's horses in Mongolia. In addition, zoonotic agents such as the avian B. garinii and A. phagocytophilum were also detected, outlining a high risk for exposed humans."

Forests continue to be reservoirs for infectious diseases and their vectors - a disservice. We examine how this disservice undermines the potential recreational services by measuring the human response to environmental risk using exogenous variation in the risk of contracting Lyme Disease. We find evidence that individuals substitute away from spending time outdoors when there is greater risk of Lyme Disease infection. Individuals facing a higher risk of infection substitute away from outdoor leisure. On average individuals spent 1.54 fewer minutes outdoors at the average, 72 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), confirmed cases of Lyme Disease. We estimate lost outdoor recreation of 9.41 hours per year per person in an average county in the North Eastern United States and an aggregate welfare loss on the order $2.8 billion to $5.0 billion per year."

To facilitate this defined lifestyle, B. burgdorferi has evolved a gene regulatory network that ensures transmission between those hosts, along with specific adaptations to niches within each host. Several regulatory proteins are known to be essential for the bacterium to complete these critical tasks, but interactions between regulators had not previously been investigated in detail, due to experimental uses of different strain backgrounds and growth conditions. To address that deficit in knowledge, the transcriptomic impacts of four critical regulatory proteins were examined in a uniform strain background. Pairs of mutants and their wild-type parent were grown simultaneously under a single, specific culture condition, permitting direct comparisons between the mutant strains. Transcriptomic analyses were strand-specific, and assayed both coding and noncoding RNAs. Intersection analyses identified regulatory overlaps between regulons, including transcripts involved in carbohydrate and polyamine metabolism. In addition, it was found that transcriptional units such as ospC and dbpBA, which were previously observed to be affected by alternative sigma factors, are transcribed by RNA polymerase using the housekeeping sigma factor, RpoD."

Here, we describe a novel protocol for differentiating Lyme strains on the basis of deep sequencing of the hypervariable outer surface protein C locus (ospC). Improving upon the traditional DNA-DNA hybridization method, the next-generation sequencing-based protocol is high throughput, quantitative, and able to detect new pathogen strains. We applied the method to more than one hundred infected Ixodes scapularis ticks collected from New York State, USA, in 2015 and 2016. An analysis of strain distributions within individual ticks suggests an overabundance of multiple infections by five or more strains, inhibitory interactions among coinfecting strains, and the presence of a new strain closely related to Borreliella bissettiae A supporting bioinformatics pipeline has been developed. The newly designed pair of universal ospC primers target intergenic sequences conserved among all known Lyme pathogens. The protocol could be used for culture-free identification and quantification of Lyme pathogens in wildlife and potentially in clinical specimens."

LB causes immune and metabolic effects that result in a gradually developing spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, usually presenting with significant comorbidity which may include developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders, schizoaffective disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety disorders (panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, intrusive symptoms), eating disorders, decreased libido, sleep disorders, addiction, opioid addiction, cognitive impairments, dementia, seizure disorders, suicide, violence, anhedonia, depersonalization, dissociative episodes, derealization and other impairments. Screening assessment followed by a thorough history, comprehensive psychiatric clinical exam, review of systems, mental status exam, neurological exam and physical exam relevant to the patient's complaints and findings with clinical judgment, pattern recognition and knowledgeable interpretation of laboratory findings facilitates diagnosis. Psychotropics and antibiotics may help improve functioning and prevent further disease progression. Awareness of the association between LB and neuropsychiatric impairments and studies of their prevalence in neuropsychiatric conditions can improve understanding of the causes of mental illness and violence and result in more effective prevention, diagnosis and treatment."

Twenty-four individuals (13 males), mean age 43.5 ± 18.2 years, with strong clinical suspicion of neuroborreliosis, were referred to the Department of Ophthalmology by the Department of Infectious Diseases at Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. All subjects underwent serological and CSF analysis. A structured history taking and a detailed ophthalmological examination were performed prospectively. Diagnosis for neuroborreliosis was confirmed as definite in 16, possible in two and negative in four individuals, while two had unknown diagnosis. The majority (n = 14/18) with definite and possible diagnoses had ophthalmological symptoms and/or findings either in history or at examination. The most common findings were visual disturbance, diplopia, red eyes, photophobia, facial palsy with palpebral diastasis, strabismus and sixth nerve palsy. The number of symptoms and findings was correlated with immunoglobulin G (IgG)/IgM in CSF (r = 0.6, p = 0.009/0.016; Spearman's correlation). All subjects improved, except one with initially fulminant papilloedema, who still suffered from optic disc atrophy and affected visual fields at the last follow-up. The majority of patients diagnosed with neuroborreliosis had ophthalmological symptoms and/or findings. Facial palsy with palpebral diastasis was a common finding. Onset of diplopia and/or sixth nerve affection may be a first sign of neuroborreliosis. Number of ophthalmological findings was correlated with the CSF antibody titre. Ticks are becoming more widespread and abundant, resulting in a higher incidence of neuroborreliosis. Hence, the knowledge of ophthalmological symptoms and findings is of great importance."

		"abstract": "Elevated population levels of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman) can drastically alter forest ecosystems and negatively impact society through human interactions such as deer vehicle collisions. It is currently difficult to estimate deer populations at multiple scales ranging from stand, county, state, and regional levels. This presents a challenge as natural resource managers develop silvicultural prescriptions and forest management practices aimed at successfully regenerating tree species in the face of deer browsing. This study utilized measurements of deer browse impact from the new tree regeneration indicator developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program. Seedling and sapling abundance and other plot-level characteristics were analyzed across three states (Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin) in the Great Lakes Region of the United States. Socio-environmental datasets (Lyme disease cases, deer vehicle collisions, and deer density estimates) were used in conjunction with FIA data to determine their predictive power in estimating deer browse impacts by county. Predictions from random forests models indicate that using Lyme disease case reports, the number of deer-vehicle collisions, deer density estimates, and forest inventory information correctly predicted deer browse impact 70-90% of the time. Deer-vehicle collisions per county ranked highly important in the random forests for predicting deer browse impacts in all three states. Lyme disease cases ranked high in importance for the Lake States combined and for Minnesota and Wisconsin, separately. Results show the effectiveness of predicting deer browse impacts using a suite of freely available forest inventory and other socio-environmental information."

Borrelia pathogens are commonly transmitted via arthropod vectors such as ticks, mites, or lice. Here, we report the molecular screening of LD group Borrelia sp. from ticks (Acari: Ixodidae) collected from rodents trapped in recreational forests and a semiurban residential area in the Selangor state in Malaysia. Of 156 adult ticks surveyed, 72 ticks were determined as positive for Borrelia sp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All Borrelia PCR-positive ticks belonged to the Ixodes granulatus Supino species. Borrelia sp. was not detected in other tick species examined, including Dermacentor sp. and Amblyomma sp. ticks. Thirteen Borrelia PCR-positive tick samples were selected for further sequence analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of partial flaB gene sequences revealed that the Borrelia sp. were closely related to the LD group borreliae, Borrelia yangtzensis; a novel Borrelia genospecies reported in East Asian countries including Japan, Taiwan, and China. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Borrelia sp. related to Borrelia yangtzensis detected in Malaysia and Southeast Asia. The zoonotic potential of the Borrelia sp. reported here merits further investigation, as it may explain the previously reported serological evidence for borrelial infections in Malaysia."

We present the first analytic evaluation of the automated Borrelia B31 ViraChip IgM and IgG microarray immunoblot (MIB) assays (Viramed Biotech AG, Planegg, Germany) in comparison to two different, semiautomated blot assays for LD, including the Borrelia B31 ViraStripe IgM and IgG line immunoassays (LIAs) (Viramed) and the MarDx Borrelia burgdorferi IgM and IgG Western blot (WB) assays (Trinity Biotech, Carlsbad, CA), using prospectively collected sera (n = 411) and archived, clinically characterized samples (n = 91). We show comparable overall agreement (>84%) of the ViraChip MIB assays against the two aforementioned LD blot methods. The ViraChip MIB assays were also compared to a consensus standard, whereby samples were classified as positive or negative for IgM or IgG to B. burgdorferi if the analyte-matched ViraStripe LIA or MarDx WB assay were positive or negative, respectively. The ViraChip IgM and IgG MIB assays showed >93% positive, negative, and overall agreement versus these consensus criteria. The ViraChip MIB assays were associated with a time savings of 28 min to process one full batch of samples compared to the time required for the ViraStripe LIAs. The ViraChip MIB assays can be programmed and performed on an open-system, automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) processor, negating the need for assay-specific equipment and enabling laboratories to consolidate LD testing onto a single platform. We conclude that the ViraChip IgM and IgG MIB assays may be added to the repertoire of supplemental, second-tier blot testing systems for diagnosis of LD."

As for the black-legged tick, I. scapularis Say, global warming may also favor northward expansion of other species of medically important ticks. The aims of this study were to determine (1) current diversity and abundance of ticks of public health significance other than I. scapularis, (2) sex and age of the human population bitten by these ticks (3), and the seasonal and geographic pattern of their occurrence. From 2007 to 2015, twelve tick species other than I. scapularis were submitted in the Québec passive tick surveillance program. Of these 9243 ticks, 91.2% were Ixodes cookei, 4.1% were Dermacentor variabilis, 4.0% were Rhipicephalus sanguineus and 0.7% were Amblyomma americanum. The combined annual proportion of submitted I. cookei, D. variabilis, R. sanguineus and A. americanum ticks in passive surveillance rose from 6.1% in 2007 to 16.0% in 2015 and an annual growing trend was observed for each tick species. The number of municipalities where I. cookei ticks were acquired rose from 104 to 197 during the same period. Of the 862 people bitten by these ticks, 43.3% were I. cookei ticks removed from children aged < 10 years. These findings demonstrate the need for surveillance of all the tick species of medical importance in Québec, particularly because climate may increase their abundance and geographic ranges, increasing the risk to the public of the diseases they transmit."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans (EM) rashes once considered pathognomonic of Lyme disease (LD) have been reported following bites of arthropods that do not transmit LD and in areas with no LD. Also, EM rashes have been reported in association with organisms other than members of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. Arthropod saliva has chemicals that have effects on the host and pathogen transmission. Tick saliva has protein families similar to spiders and scorpions and even substances homologous to those found in snakes and other venomous animals. Ticks \"invertebrate pharmacologists\" have a sophisticated arsenal of chemicals that assist in blood feeding, pathogen transmission, and suppressing host defenses. No organisms have been isolated from many EM rashes. We propose that tick salivary toxins may play a role in the causation of rashes and laboratory abnormalities in tick-borne diseases. The role of tick salivary toxins needs further exploration. Cases of Lyme-like EM rashes referred to as STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness) following bites of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, in the United States have been reported predominantly in Southeastern Missouri and a few in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and one case each in Mississippi and Long Island, New York. Although there is one report of Borrelia lonestari in a patient with a rash, biopsies of 31 cases of STARI, with cultures and PCR, failed to show a relationship. Distribution of A. americanum, whose bites are associated with STARI, now extends along the East Coast of the United States, including New Jersey, up to the Canadian border. As far as we are aware, there have been no prior reports of Lyme-like rashes in New Jersey. In this study, we present case examples of 2 Lyme-like rashes, variations of EM rashes, and a brief review of studies that suggest a role of tick salivary toxins in tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. Antibiotic therapy of early acute infection is effective for most patients, but 10 to 20% go on to develop posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The nature of PTLDS remains unknown, but currently approved antibiotics for the treatment of Lyme disease do not appear to impact these symptoms after they have developed. We reason that minimizing the time the pathogen interacts with the host will diminish the probability of developing PTLDS, irrespective of its nature. This calls for an efficient eradication of the pathogen during acute infection. In search of a superior killing antibiotic, we examined approved antibiotics for their ability to kill B. burgdorferi Vancomycin proved more effective in killing the pathogen in vitro than ceftriaxone, the standard of care for disseminated B. burgdorferi infection. Both compounds were also the most effective in killing stationary-phase cells. This is surprising, given that inhibitors of cell wall biosynthesis are known to only kill growing bacteria. We found that peptidoglycan synthesis continues in stationary-phase cells of B. burgdorferi, explaining this paradox. A combination of vancomycin and gemifloxacin sterilized a stationary-phase culture of B. burgdorferi Examination of the action of antibiotics in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice showed that doxycycline, a standard of care for uncomplicated acute infection, did not clear the pathogen. In contrast, both ceftriaxone and vancomycin cleared the infection. A trial examining the early use of more potent antibiotics on the development of PTLDS may be warranted."

Despite being a top international tourist destination, few sources describe the spectrum of infectious diseases acquired among travellers to the USA. We performed a descriptive analysis summarizing demographic and travel characteristics, and clinical diagnoses among non-US-resident international travellers seen during or after travel to the USA at a GeoSentinel clinic from 1 January 1997 through 31 December 2016. There were 1222 ill non-US-resident travellers with 1393 diagnoses recorded during the 20-year analysis period. Median age was 40 (range 0-86 years); 52% were female. Patients visited from 63 countries and territories, most commonly Canada (31%), Germany (14%), France (9%) and Japan (7%). Travellers presented with a range of illnesses; skin and soft tissue infections of unspecified aetiology were the most frequently reported during travel (29 diagnoses, 14% of during-travel diagnoses); arthropod bite/sting was the most frequently reported after travel (173 diagnoses, 15% after-travel diagnoses). Lyme disease was the most frequently reported arthropod-borne disease after travel (42, 4%). Nonspecific respiratory, gastrointestinal and systemic infections were also among the most frequently reported diagnoses overall. Low-frequency illnesses (<2% of cases) made up over half of diagnoses during travel and 41% of diagnoses after travel, including 13 cases of coccidioidomycosis and mosquito-borne infections like West Nile, dengue and Zika virus diseases. International travellers to the USA acquired a diverse array of mostly cosmopolitan infectious diseases, including nonspecific respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic and systemic infections comparable to what has been reported among travellers to low- and middle-income countries. Clinicians should consider the specific health risks when preparing visitors to the USA and when evaluating and treating those who become ill."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the commonest vector-borne disease in the North America. It is an inflammatory disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. The role of the inflammatory processes mediated by prostaglandins (PGs), thromboxanes and leukotrienes (LTs) in LB severity and symptoms resolution is yet to be elucidated. We aim to systematically review and evaluate the role of PGs and related lipid mediators in the induction and resolution of inflammation in LB. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE(R), Embase and Embase Classic to identify cell-culture, animal and human studies reporting the changes in PGs and related lipid mediators of inflammation during the course of LB. We identified 18 studies to be included into this systematic review. The selected reports consisted of seven cell-culture studies, seven animal studies, and four human studies (from three patient populations). Results from cell-culture and animal studies suggest that PGs and other lipid mediators of inflammation are elevated in LB and may contribute to disease development. The limited number of human studies showed that subjects with Lyme meningitis, Lyme arthritis (LA) and antibiotic-refractory LA had increased levels of an array of PGs and lipid mediators (e.g., LTB4, 8-isoPGF2α, and phospholipases A2 activity). Levels of these markers were significantly reduced following the treatment with antibiotics or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Dysregulation of prostaglandins and related lipid mediators may play a role in the etiology of LB and persistence of inflammation that may lead to long-term complications. Further investigation into the precise levels of a wide range of PGs and related factors is critical as it may propose novel markers that can be used for early diagnosis."

In the present study, an extensive bioinformatics pipeline was established to predict new candidates that can be used for vaccine development including building the protein-protein interaction network based on orthologues of experimentally verified protein-protein interaction networks, elucidation of the proteins involved in the immune response, selection of the topologically-interesting proteins and their prioritization based on their antigenicity. Proteomic network analysis yielded an interactome network with 120 nodes with 97 interactions. Proteins were selected to obtain a subnet containing only the borrelial membrane proteins and immune-related host proteins. This strategy resulted in the selection of 15 borrelial targets, which were subjected to extensive bioinformatics analysis to predict their antigenic properties. Based on the strategy applied in this study the proteins encoded by erpX (ErpX proteins, UniProt ID: H7C7L6), erpL (ErpL protein, UniProt ID: H7C7M3) and erpY (ErpY protein, UniProt ID: Q9S0D9) are suggested as a novel set of vaccine targets to control Lyme disease. Moreover, five different tools were used to validate their antigenicity regarding B-cells. The combination of all these proteins in a vaccine should allow improved protection against Borrelia infection."

Urine represents an easily obtained clinical sample that can be applied for diagnostic purposes. However, few studies have explored urine for biomarkers of ELD. In this study, metabolomics approaches were applied to evaluate small molecule metabolites in urine from patients with ELD (n = 14), infectious mononucleosis (n = 14) and healthy controls (n = 14). Metabolic biosignatures for ELD versus healthy controls and ELD versus infectious mononucleosis were generated using untargeted metabolomics. Pathway analyses and metabolite identification revealed the dysregulation of several metabolic processes in ELD as compared to healthy controls or mononucleosis, including metabolism of tryptophan. Linear discriminant analyses demonstrated that individual metabolic biosignatures can correctly discriminate ELD from the other patient groups with accuracies of 71 to 100%. These data provide proof-of-concept for use of urine metabolites as biomarkers for diagnostic classification of ELD."

		"abstract": "This is for the year 2016 subsequent annual analysis of the situation of infectious and parasitic diseases in Poland as part of the Epidemiological Chronicle of the Epidemiological Review. Its purpose is to summarize the collective incidence of infectious diseases and to indicate potential threats to the health of populations from communicable diseases occurring in Poland. The basic source of epidemiological information for this summary is a summary of data from reports of the State Sanitary Inspection, contained in the annual bulletins “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2016” and “Protective Vaccination in Poland in 2016” (1, 2). Supplementary sources are detailed assessments of the epidemiological situation of selected infectious diseases that make up the socalled Epidemiological Chronicle. Data on deaths were obtained from materials of the Department of Demographic and Labor Market Research of the Central Statistical Office regarding deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases registered in Poland in 2015 and in earlier years. The most numerous group among infectious diseases subject to epidemiological surveillance are upper respiratory tract infections classified as “influenza and influenza - like disease”. In 2016, the number this category cases was 4 316 823 (11 233.9 / 100 000). In relation to incidence in 2015, it was an increase of 12.4%, and in relation to the median from 2010-2014 by 196.5%. In 2016, the incidence of intestinal infections of salmonellosis etiology increased compared to the previous year by 16.0%, and in relation to the median from 2010-2014 was higher 19.1%. This is a deviation from the downward trend of these infections observed over last decades. A serious epidemiological problem is the high incidence of infection caused by Clostridium difficile. In 2016, 8 716 (22.7 / 100,000) of these cases were reported, which resulted in 540 deaths. In comparison with the previous year, it was a non-significant decline in incidence by 2.8%, but in comparison with the median from 2010-2014 it was an increase of 56.4%. In 2015, the high incidence of norovirus induced intestinal infection persisted. 3 706 cases were reported (9.64/ 100 000), which is significantly higher than in 2015 (by 2%), but in relation to the median from 2010-2014 it was an increase of 136.6%. Among viral intestinal infections in children, rotavirus infections are still a particularly important problem. Despite the decrease in incidence in comparison with 2015 by 37.3%, the number of cases in 2016 was 21 258 (55.3 / 100,000), which is a serious epidemiological problem. A high percentage of these incidents were infection related to the medical care. In the group of infections and intestinal intoxication, which cause diarrhea in children under 2 years, in 2016 there was a decrease from the previous year of 11.7%, but in relation to the median from 2010-2014 it was an increase of 25.7%. In 2016 number of reported cases of pertussis was 6 828 (17.8 / 100 00), which represented a rise in incidence compared to the previous year by 37.9%, and compared to the median from 2010-2014 by as much as 225%. The year 2016 was another year of decreasing the incidence of rubella. 1105 cases were reported (2.88 / 100 000), what in comparison with the previous year was a decrease of 44.9%, and in relation to the median of 2010-2014 by 81.2%. No congenital rubella was reported. For many years, Poland has been free of native measles. The measles cases are infections imported from abroad and secondary cases of people who have contacted them in the country. In 2016, cases were 133 (0.35 / 100 000). The number of invasive infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2016 was 967. In comparison with 2015, it was a non-significant decrease of 1.2%. In 2016, there were 3 806 (9.9 / 100 000) reported cases of hepatitis B, which in relation to the median of 2010- 2014 is an increase of 141.0%. Number of newly diagnosed cases of hepatitis C was 4 261 (11.1 / 100 000), which in relation to the median from 2010-2014 is an increase of 88.2%. This increase in incidence remains in a relationship. with the introduction in 2014 of a new, more sensitive case definition. 21 200 cases of Lyme disease were reported (55.2 / 100 000), which in comparison with the previous year, is an increase of 55.7%. As compared to the median of 2010-2014 it was increase by 132.1%. In 2016, number of cases of newly diagnosed HIV was 1318 (3.43 / 100 000). And number of reported AIDS cases was 102. The increase in the incidence of HIV infection was not significant. The number of cases of AIDS fell by 20.3% as compared to the previous year. Registered cases of malaria refer to people who have been infected abroad in endemic countries. There were 38 such cases in 2016. In 2015, no diphtheria, poliomyelitis, rabies and viral hemorrhagic fevers were found in Poland except for dengue, of which 41 cases of infections acquired in endemic areas were reported for epidemiological surveillance. The number of deaths from infectious and parasitic diseases in 2016 was 2 242 people. The share of deaths from these causes in the total number of deaths in Poland (388 009) was 0.58%. The highest number of deaths was caused by tuberculosis – 543 and intestinal infections caused by Clostridium difficile – 540."

		"abstract": "Accurate laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (BB), is difficult and yet important to prevent serious disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presently recommends a screening test for serum antibodies followed by confirmation with a more specific Western blot (WB) test to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against antigens in whole cell lysates of BB. Borrelia species related to BB cause tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). TBRF is increasingly recognized as a health problem in the US and occurs in areas where Lyme disease is prevalent. The two groups of Borrelia share related antigens. We have developed a modified WB procedure termed the Lyme immunoblots (IBs) using recombinant antigens from common strains and species of the BB sensu lato complex for serological diagnosis of Lyme disease. A reference collection of 178 sera from 26 with and 152 patients without Lyme disease were assessed by WB and IB in a blinded manner using either criteria for positive antibody reactions recommended by the CDC or criteria developed in-house. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values obtained with the reference sera suggest that the Lyme IB is superior to the Lyme WB for detection of specific antibodies in Lyme disease. The Lyme IB showed no significant reaction with rabbit antisera produced against two Borrelia species causing TBRF in the US, suggesting that the Lyme IB may be also useful for excluding TBRF."

		"abstract": "Next-generation sequencing approaches have revolutionized genomic medicine and enabled rapid diagnosis for several diseases. These approaches are widely used for pathogen detection in several infectious diseases. Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease, which affects multiple organs. The causative organism is a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by ticks. Lyme disease can be treated easily if detected early, but its diagnosis is often delayed or is incorrect leading to a chronic debilitating condition. Current confirmatory diagnostic tests for Lyme disease rely on detection of antigens derived from B. burgdorferi, which are prone to both false positives and false negatives. Instead of focusing only on the human host for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, one could also attempt to identify the vector (tick) and the causative organism carried by the tick. Since all ticks do not transmit Lyme disease, it can be informative to accurately identify the tick from the site of bite, which is often observed by the patient and discarded. However, identifying ticks based on morphology alone requires a trained operator and can still be incorrect. Thus, we decided to take a molecular approach by sequencing DNA and RNA from a tick collected from an individual bitten by the tick. Using next-generation sequencing, we confirmed the identity of the tick as a dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and did not identify any pathogenic bacterial sequences, including Borrelia species. Despite the limited availability of nucleotide sequences for many types of ticks, our approach correctly identified the tick species. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of tick-borne infections, which can also be extended to other zoonotic diseases."
