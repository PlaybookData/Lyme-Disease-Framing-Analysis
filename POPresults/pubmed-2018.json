		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme disease has increased in many regions of Canada in recent years, including in Ottawa, Ontario. To date there has been limited active tick surveillance in the region. To estimate both the distribution and density of Ixodes scapularis ticks in the city of Ottawa, and the infection rates of ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi (that causes Lyme disease) and other tick-borne pathogens. Between June and October 2017, tick surveillance was conducted by drag sampling at 23 sites in Ottawa municipal parks, recreational trails and forests. Blacklegged ticks were tested for B. burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum using quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols. I. scapularis ticks were found in 16 of the 23 sites (70%). Recreational trails, conservation areas/forests and the provincial park within the city of Ottawa had significantly higher tick densities than municipal parks (p<0.01). Of the 194 adult and 26 nymphal I. scapularis tested, prevalence of infection was 29.5% for B. burgdorferi, 0.45% for B. miyamotoi and 0.91% for A. phagocytophilum. Almost 30% of I. scapularis ticks tested in suburban and rural areas of the city of Ottawa were infected with B. burgdorferi, known to cause Lyme disease. Other types of infection, known to cause anaplasmosis and tick-borne relapsing fever, were also detected, although were very rare. Conducting active tick surveillance at the local level may help to inform risk assessment and public health actions."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and, in most of North America, is transmitted by the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis. Climate change has contributed to the expansion of the geographic range of blacklegged ticks in Ontario, increasing the risk of Lyme disease for Ontarians. To identify the number of cases and incidence rates, as well as the geographic, seasonal and demographic distribution of Lyme disease cases reported in Ontario in 2017, with comparisons to historical trends. Data for confirmed and probable Lyme disease cases with episode dates from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2017, were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). Data included public health unit (PHU) of residence, episode date, age and sex. Population data from Statistics Canada were used to calculate provincial and PHU-specific incidence rates per 100,000 population. The number of cases reported in 2017 by PHU of residence, month of occurrence, age and sex was compared to the 5-year averages for the period 2012-2016. There were 959 probable and confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in Ontario in 2017. This was three times higher than the 5-year (2012-2016) average of 313. The provincial incidence rate for 2017 was 6.7 cases per 100,000 population, although this varied markedly by PHU. The highest incidence rates were found in Leeds-Grenville and Lanark District (128.8 cases per 100,000), Kingston-Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (87.2 cases per 100,000), Hastings and Prince Edward Counties (28.6 cases per 100,000), Ottawa (18.1 cases per 100,000) and Eastern Ontario (13.5 cases per 100,000). Cases occurred mostly from June through September, were most common among males, and those aged 5-14 and 50-69 years. In 2017, Lyme disease incidence showed a marked increase in Ontario, especially in the eastern part of the province. If current weather and climate trends continue, blacklegged ticks carrying tick-borne pathogens, such as those causing Lyme disease, will continue to spread into suitable habitat. Monitoring the extent of this geographic spread will inform future clinical and public health actions to detect and mitigate the impact of Lyme disease in Ontario."

		"abstract": "Data concerning combined molecular and serological prevalence of emerging canine tick-borne pathogens in Serbia are lacking. A large population of outdoor living dogs in Belgrade, Serbia's' capital, present an excellent population for epidemiology study. Blood samples were collected from 111 dogs, including 46 shelter, 31 free roaming, and 34 hunting dogs. Species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) was applied for the molecular detection of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli. A research based SNAP assay (SNAP® M-A, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) that uses genus and species-specific peptides was used to asses Anaplasma spp., A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia spp., E. canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii and Borrelia burgdorferi antibody status. B. canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli antibody status was assessed with an indirect immunofluorescence test (MegaCor Diagnostic, Horbranz, Austria). Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. DNA was not amplified. One quarter of the dogs were A. phagocytophilum, one dog was A. platys, one was E. ewingii and two dogs were B. burgdorferi seroreactive with the SNAP® M-A. Babesia canis or B. gibsoni DNA was amplified by PCR from 16.2% of dogs, whereas 67.6% were seroreactive to one or more Babesia spp. Babesia vogeli was not PCR amplified. We conclude that outdoor dogs in this territory are reservoirs for B. canis and B. gibsoni and are frequently co-exposed to combinations of Anaplasma and Babesia spp."

		"abstract": "For a differentiation of clinical forms of ixodic tick-borne borreliosis clinical laboratory assessment of features of the most often defined hemostasis and complete blood count (CBC) indicators is carried out. Ixodic tick-borne borreliosis in the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan is characterized by mainly erythematous forms of a disease with a medium-weight current. At the same time some increase in quantity of platelets was noted that could be caused by irritation of a megakaryocytic sprout of bone marrow in the conditions of infectious process and have compensatory character whereas other indicators of CBC and hemostasis at this clinical form practically didn't change. Not numerous cases of the ixodic tick-borne borreliosis non-erythematous forms clinically proceeded more hard, with significantly more expressed toxicinflammatory syndrome. At the same time it was followed by significant shifts in biochemical parameters, indicators of CBC and hemostasis. The clinical laboratory features of erythematous and non-erythematous forms of ixodic tick-borne borreliosis revealed as a result of the conducted researches reflect character of a course of disease and can serve for assessment of severity, the forecast of the infection and justification of this treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an important tick-borne disease which can cause a broad range of symptoms mainly affecting the skin, the nervous system and the joints. This study aims to estimate the incidence of the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium. The incidence of erythema migrans (EM) was estimated through the network of sentinel general practices at 97.6/100,000 inhabitants (uncertainty interval [UI] 82.0-113.0) for the period 2015-2017. This result was used to estimate the incidence of other LB manifestations based on their proportional distribution (ratios) to EM reported in the neighboring countries of Belgium. To estimate these ratios, we performed a systematic review of studies published between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2018 and pooled the results using a random effects meta-analysis. Six studies were retained in the systematic review, and the meta-analysis estimated the occurrence ratios for Lyme neuroborreliosis/EM, Lyme arthritis/EM and other manifestations/EM at 0.024 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.037), 0.022 (95% CI 0.020-0.024) and 0.014 (95% CI 0.012-0.016) respectively. Applying these ratios to the EM incidence in Belgium resulted in an incidence estimation of 2.4/100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 1.5-3.7) for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2.1/100,000 (95% UI 1.7-2.6) for Lyme arthritis and 1.4/100,000 (95% UI 1.1-1.7) for other less frequent manifestations. Some of these LB manifestations, other than EM, are more severe, hence these estimates are essential to assess the health burden and economic cost of LB which would be highly relevant for patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. As both over- and underestimation of different clinical LB manifestations remain possible due to characteristics of the primary surveillance systems and the disease itself, future studies to validate these estimates would be of great value."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prominent tick-borne disease with 300,000 cases estimated by CDC every year while ~2,000 cases of babesiosis occur per year in the United States. Simultaneous infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi are now the most common tick-transmitted coinfections in the U.S.A., and they are a serious health problem because coinfected patients show more intense and persisting disease symptoms. B. burgdorferi is an extracellular spirochete responsible for systemic Lyme disease while B. microti is a protozoan that infects erythrocytes and causes babesiosis. Immune status and spleen health are important for resolution of babesiosis, which is more severe and even fatal in the elderly and splenectomized patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of each pathogen on host immune response and consequently on severity of disease manifestations in both young, and 30 weeks old C3H mice. At the acute stage of infection, Th1 polarization in young mice spleen was associated with increased IFN-γ and TNF-α producing T cells and a high Tregs/Th17 ratio. Together, these changes could help in the resolution of both infections in young mice and also prevent fatality by B. microti infection as observed with WA-1 strain of Babesia. In older mature mice, Th2 polarization at acute phase of B. burgdorferi infection could play a more effective role in preventing Lyme disease symptoms. As a result, enhanced B. burgdorferi survival and increased tissue colonization results in severe Lyme arthritis only in young coinfected mice. At 3 weeks post-infection, diminished pathogen-specific antibody production in coinfected young, but not older mice, as compared to mice infected with each pathogen individually may also contribute to increased inflammation observed due to B. burgdorferi infection, thus causing persistent Lyme disease observed in coinfected mice and reported in patients. Thus, higher combined proinflammatory response to B. burgdorferi due to Th1 and Th17 cells likely reduced B. microti parasitemia significantly only in young mice later in infection, while the presence of B. microti reduced humoral immunity later in infection and enhanced tissue colonization by Lyme spirochetes in these mice even at the acute stage, thereby increasing inflammatory arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are two vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks. Both diseases are endemic and have been reported in all regions of the Czech Republic including urban agglomerations, but in varying proportions. Because of the natural conditions in the border areas, the risk of infection is also high for travelers from the neighboring countries such as Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. To gain more information on the epidemiology of LB and TBE in the last decade, we analyzed national surveillance data from 2007 to 2016. Incidence of LB in the Czech Republic was 37.3/100,000 population and year (27.6 - 46.1/100,000). Incidence of TBE incidence was 5.7/100,000 (3.4-8.2/100,000) and declined although the trend was not significant (p = 0.155). Difference between the incidences of LB and TBE was increasing in time. Overall male-to-female ratio was 0.84 and 1.51 for LB and TBE, respectively. The age-specific incidences of both infections have a typical two-peak shape, with the first peak in the age group 5-9 years for LB and 15-19 years for TBE. The second peak for both LB and TBE is in the age group 55-64 years. TBE poses a considerable risk to children < 15 years. Among 39,074 cases of LB, the most common clinical manifestations were erythema migrants 62.1% and Lyme neuroborreliosis 25.1%. All 5969 TBE cases manifested itself by affecting nervous system, namely meningo-encephalitis 47.9%, meningoencephalomyelitis 21.8% and meningitis 19.8%. The data evidence the high chance risk of infection with LB and TBE in the Czech Republic. The incidence of both infections shows a bimodal distribution during the year. LB cases are five to six times as frequent as TBE cases. Over the last years, the incidence of LB has remained roughly stable while TBE has shown a downward trend. The present study is unique in allowing the comparison of the incidence rates of LB and TBE over time and space."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis/Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and is one of the most common vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks. A total of 136 Ixodes ricinus ticks, collected in the Ternopil (Ukraine) region, including 126 adults (70 females and 56 males), and 10 nymphs were examined. The identification of the species and their developmental form was based on morphological characteristics. PCR with B5S-Bor and 23S-Bor primers resulted in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA amplification among six ticks (4.4%). The detailed analysis based on the DNA sequencing showed the presence of DNA of Borrelia afzelii in four samples; the remaining two represented Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, although their genospecies were not determined. The research confirmed the dominance of Borrelia afzelii genospecies in the ticks from Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake similar research in ticks from other regions of Ukraine. Knowledge in this field can be useful for public health and planning the prevention of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia, respectively. The infection affects multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, and the nervous system. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the most dangerous manifestation of Lyme disease, occurring in 10-15% of infected individuals. During the course of the infection, bacteria migrate through the host tissues altering the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways and the immune response, reaching the central nervous system (CNS) within 2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. The early treatment with oral antimicrobials is effective in the majority of patients with LNB. Nevertheless, persistent forms of LNB are relatively common, despite targeted antibiotic therapy. It has been observed that the antibiotic resistance and the reoccurrence of Lyme disease are associated with biofilm-like aggregates in B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, both in vitro and in vivo, allowing Borrelia spp. to resist to adverse environmental conditions. Indeed, the increased tolerance to antibiotics described in the persisting forms of Borrelia spp., is strongly reminiscent of biofilm growing bacteria, suggesting a possible role of biofilm aggregates in the development of the different manifestations of Lyme disease including LNB."

		"abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) acts as a molecular rheostat for the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway of the tick Ixodes scapularis How XIAP activates the IMD pathway in response to microbial infection remains ill defined. Here, we identified the XIAP enzymatic substrate p47 as a positive regulator of the I. scapularis IMD network. XIAP polyubiquitylates p47 in a lysine 63-dependent manner and interacts with the p47 ubiquitin-like (UBX) module. p47 also binds to Kenny (IKKγ/NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)- κB kinase complex. Replacement of the amino acid lysine to arginine within the p47 linker region completely abrogated molecular interactions with Kenny. Furthermore, mitigation of p47 transcription levels through RNA interference in I. scapularis limited Kenny accumulation, reduced phosphorylation of IKKβ (IRD5), and impaired cleavage of the NF-κB molecule Relish. Accordingly, disruption of p47 expression increased microbial colonization by the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum Collectively, we highlight the importance of ticks for the elucidation of paradigms in arthropod immunology. Manipulating immune signaling cascades within I. scapularis may lead to innovative approaches to reducing the burden of tick-borne diseases."

In recent years the issue of the diagnosis of this infection has been highly publicized on the Internet and other media in Europe and America. Some patients and physicians may share the perception that the diagnosis of the infection is not reliable in France. We reviewed current European and American guidelines on Lyme disease and performed a methodological evaluation of all guidelines. We retrieved 16 guidelines from seven countries. Our analysis revealed a global consensus regarding diagnosis at each stage of the infection. All guidelines indicate that the diagnosis is currently based on a two-tier serology at all stages of the infection, except for the early localized dermatological presentation known as Erythema migrans. One text of so-called guidelines has discordant recommendations when compared with the other guidelines, possibly explained by its low quality score. Contrary to the intense debate taking place on the Internet and in the European and American media, our analysis shows that the great majority of medical scientific guidelines with a high quality score, agree on the clinical diagnostic methods of Lyme disease."

Patients with this skin disorder experience ulcerative lesions that contain multicolored filamentous collagen and keratin inclusions. Infection with various species of Borrelia and other tick-borne pathogens has been detected in tissue and body fluid specimens from MD patients. We sought to explore this association further in a cohort of MD patients. Sera from 30 patients with MD were tested for antibody reactivity to antigens from the Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) group and the relapsing fever Borrelia (RFB) group of spirochetes. Tissue and/or body fluid specimens from these patients were also tested for the presence of Bb and RFB infection using PCR technology. In addition, tissue and body fluid specimens were tested for the presence of Bartonella henselae using PCR, and formalin-fixed skin sections from a subset of patients were tested using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with B. henselae-specific DNA probes. Seroreactivity to Bb, RFB or both was detected in 63% of the cohort, while positive PCR testing for Bb, RFB or both was detected in 53% of the cohort. Overall, 90% of patients tested positive for exposure and/or infection with Borrelia spirochetes. B. henselae infection was detected by PCR in skin sections or body fluids from 20% of the subjects, and B. henselae FISH testing was positive in 30% of the dermatological specimens submitted for study. The study demonstrates an association between MD and positive tests for both Bb and RFB spirochetes. In conjunction with previous studies, our study provides corroborative evidence linking MD to Borrelia infection and tick-borne illness."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne agents comprise medically important infections affecting dogs throughout much of the world. Sensitive detection of antibodies directed at tick-borne disease-causing organisms in dogs is diagnostically important for veterinarians, pets and their owners, and epidemiologically important for public health surveillance. The SNAP 4Dx Plus Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME) identifies antibodies to or infection with multiple tick-borne pathogens and canine heartworm antigen in a single assay. Recently, VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test (Abaxis, Inc., Union City, CA) was launched as a new assay to detect tick-borne pathogen antibodies and heartworm antigen. In the present study, we evaluated the comparative performance of SNAP 4Dx Plus (SNAP) and FLEX4 Rapid Test (FLEX4) using samples selected based on geographic distributions for canine vector borne diseases, including Borrelia burgdorferi (n = 105), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (160), Anaplasma platys (115), Ehrlichia canis (154), Ehrlichia ewingii (163), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (151) and Dirofilaria immitis (105). Canine vector borne diseases infection status was established for each sample by a combination of reference methods that included necropsy (D. immitis, heartworm disease), Western immunoblotting (B. burgdorferi), immunofluorescence assays (A. phagocytophilum and E. canis) and species-specific ELISAs (A. platys, E. canis, E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis). For comparisons among the 2 assays, samples were evaluated per the manufacturers' instructions for each test kit. By testing each same sample set compared to the defined reference results, sensitivities differed substantially between SNAP and FLEX4, at 95.5 vs. 40.9%, respectively for B. burgdorferi, 97.1% vs. 61.4% for E. canis, 98.2% vs. 59.3% for E. ewingii, 64.3% vs. 35.7% for E. chaffeensis, 84.5% vs. 12.7% for A. phagocytophilum, 83.3% vs. 33.3% for A. platys, and 94.1% vs. 88.2% for D. immitis. Specificities for both rapid assay tests ranged from 98% to 100%. Based upon the comparative results derived from this study, the SNAP test was more sensitive than the FLEX4 test for detection of antibodies to all tick-borne pathogens and heartworm disease (Dirofilaria immitis) antigen in dogs."

		"abstract": "Landscape structure can affect pathogen prevalence and persistence with consequences for human and animal health. Few studies have examined how reservoir host species traits may interact with landscape structure to alter pathogen communities and dynamics. Using a landscape of islands and mainland sites we investigated how natural landscape fragmentation affects the prevalence and persistence of the zoonotic tick-borne pathogen complex Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), which causes Lyme borreliosis. We hypothesized that the prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) would be lower on islands compared to the mainland and B. afzelii, a small mammal specialist genospecies, would be more affected by isolation than bird-associated B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto). Questing (host-seeking) nymphal I. ricinus ticks (n = 6567) were collected from 12 island and 6 mainland sites in 2011, 2013 and 2015 and tested for B. burgdorferi (s.l.). Deer abundance was estimated using dung transects. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was significantly higher on the mainland (2.5%, 47/1891) compared to island sites (0.9%, 44/4673) (P < 0.01). While all four genospecies of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) were detected on the mainland, bird-associated species B. garinii and B. valaisiana and the generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) predominated on islands. We found that landscape structure influenced the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, with a lower prevalence detected among island sites compared to the mainland. This was mainly due to the significantly lower prevalence of small mammal-associated B. afzelii. Deer abundance was not related to pathogen prevalence, suggesting that the structure and dynamics of the reservoir host community underpins the observed prevalence patterns, with the higher mobility of bird hosts compared to small mammal hosts leading to a relative predominance of the bird-associated genospecies B. garinii and generalist genospecies B. burgdorferi (s.s.) on islands. In contrast, the lower prevalence of B. afzelii on islands may be due to small mammal populations there exhibiting lower densities, less immigration and stronger population fluctuations. This study suggests that landscape fragmentation can influence the prevalence of a zoonotic pathogen, dependent on the biology of the reservoir host."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, a tick-borne disease, is endemic to some parts of North America and is an emerging disease in other parts of the world. Vaccination is an increasingly common, although controversial, method used in the prevention of Lyme disease in dogs; the reported efficacies of Borrelia burgdorferi vaccines in dogs are highly variable, ranging from 50% to 100%. To determine the efficacy of vaccines for prevention of Lyme disease in dogs in North America. Experimental and observational study designs were eligible for inclusion. The outcome of interest was the reduction of incidence of clinical illness after exposure to B. burgdorferi. Electronic databases searched were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Centre for Agricultural Biosciences Abstracts. Clinical signs were extracted as dichotomous outcomes: lameness, anorexia, pyrexia, depression, and lymphadenopathy. Study quality was assessed using tools from the Cochrane collaboration. In total, 3 observational studies and 13 challenge trials were included. None of the challenge trials assessed lymphadenopathy, but for each of the remaining 4 clinical signs, a meta-analysis was performed. Compared to unvaccinated dogs, vaccinated dogs had a reduced odds of developing lameness, depression, pyrexia, and anorexia (odds ratio: 0.15-0.23). Based on the quantitative synthesis of results from challenge studies, vaccinated dogs are less likely to develop clinical signs after exposure to B. burgdorferi compared to unvaccinated dogs. These results should be interpreted with caution, however, as several shortcomings related to quality and study design were identified. Future studies should focus on larger sample sizes in field conditions."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne diseases have an adverse impact on health of dogs, and infected dogs can be sentinels for human infection. Infection with Trypanosoma cruzi, an agent of Chagas disease, causes fatal heart disease in dogs across the southern United States but has been neglected from wide-scale prevalence studies. To determine the prevalence of exposure to T. cruzi, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, and infection with Dirofilaria immitis among dogs in shelters across Texas and to identify risk factors for T. cruzi seropositivity. Six hundred and eight dogs. This repeated cross-sectional study was performed by collecting blood from ~30 dogs during each of the 3 visits to 7 shelters. We tested serum for antibodies to T. cruzi using 2 tests in series and for antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., and B. burgdorferi and D. immitis antigen using the IDEXX SNAP 4DX Plus point-of-care test. DNA was extracted from blood clots and tested for T. cruzi DNA and strain type via quantitative polymerase chain reactions (qPCR). We used logistic regression to assess risk factors. One hundred ten (18.1%) of 608 dogs were seropositive for T. cruzi. Prevalence of exposure to the other vector-borne agents was: Ehrlichia spp. 3.6%; Anaplasma spp. 6.9%; B. burgdorferi 0.2%; and D. immitis infection 16.0%. Six of 559 (1.1%) dogs were qPCR-positive for T. cruzi. T. cruzi seroprevalence was comparable to D. immitis prevalence and higher than seroprevalence of the tick-borne pathogens. T. cruzi is an underrecognized health threat to dogs across Texas and possibly other southern states where triatomine vectors are endemic."

		"abstract": "Ixodid ticks are acknowledged as one of the most important hematophagous arthropods because of their ability in transmitting a variety of tick-borne diseases. Mathematical models have been developed, based on emerging knowledge about tick ecology, pathogen epidemiology and their interface, to understand tick population dynamics and tick-borne diseases spread patterns. However, no serious effort has been made to model and assess the impact of host immunity triggered by tick feeding on the distribution of the tick population according to tick stages and on tick population extinction and persistence. Here, we construct a novel mathematical model taking into account the effect of host immunity status on tick population dynamics, and analyze the long-term behaviours of the model solutions. Two threshold values, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], are introduced to measure the reproduction ratios for the tick-host interaction in the absence and presence of host immunity. We then show that these two thresholds (sometimes under additional conditions) can be used to predict whether the tick population goes extinct ([Formula: see text]) and the tick population grows without bound ([Formula: see text]). We also prove tick permanence (persistence and boundedness of the tick population) and the existence of a tick persistence equilibrium if [Formula: see text]. As the host species adjust their immunity to tick infestation levels, they form for the tick population an environment with a carrying capacity very much like that in logistic growth. Numerical results show that the host immune reactions decrease the size of the tick population at equilibrium and apparently reduce the tick-borne infection risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. It is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted to humans by blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis. The life cycle of the LD vector, I. scapularis, usually takes two to three years to complete and goes through three stages, all of which are dependent on environmental factors. Increases in daily average temperatures, a manifestation of climate change, might have contributed to an increase in tick abundance via higher rates of tick survival. Additionally, these environmental changes might have contributed to better host availability, which is necessary for tick feeding and life cycle completion. In fact, it has been shown that both tick activity and survival depend on temperature and humidity. In this study, we have examined the relationship between those climatic variables and the reported incidence of LD in 15 states that contribute to more than 95% of reported cases within the Unites States. Using fixed effects analysis for a panel of 468 U.S. counties from those high-incidence states with annual data available for the period 2000-2016, we have found sizable impacts of temperature on the incidence of LD. Those impacts can be described approximately by an inverted U-shaped relationship, consistent with patterns of tick survival and host-seeking behavior. Assuming a 2°C increase in annual average temperature-in line with mid-century (2036-2065) projections from the latest U.S. National Climate Assessment (NCA4)-we have predicted that the number of LD cases in the United States will increase by over 20 percent in the coming decades. These findings may help improving preparedness and response by clinicians, public health professionals, and policy makers, as well as raising public awareness of the importance of being cautious when engaging in outdoor activities."

		"abstract": "Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome is an emerging, tick-borne, infectious disease recently discovered in Brazil. This syndrome is similar to Lyme disease, which is common in the United States of America, Europe and Asia; however, Brazilian borreliosis diverges from the disease observed in the Northern Hemisphere in its epidemiological, microbiological, laboratory and clinical characteristics. Polymerase chain reaction procedures showed that Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto spirochete. This bacterium has not yet been isolated or cultured in adequate culture media. In Brazil, this zoonosis is transmitted to humans through the bite of Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus genera ticks; these vectors do not belong to the usual Lyme disease transmitters, which are members of the Ixodes ricinus complex. The adaptation of Borrelia burgdorferi to Brazilian vectors and reservoirs probably originated from spirochetes with atypical morphologies (cysts or cell-wall-deficient bacteria) exhibiting genetic adjustments, such as gene suppression. These particularities could explain the protracted survival of these bacteria in hosts, beyond the induction of a weak immune response and the emergence of serious reactive symptoms. The aim of the present report is to note differences between Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome and Lyme disease, to help health professionals recognize this exotic and neglected zoonosis."

A narrative review was conducted and designed to present a broad perspective on Lyme disease, and describe its history and development in terms of clinical care and public health implications. A structured literature search was conducted based on the question; what is currently known about Lyme disease? The narrative review is presented in chronological order in terms of a summary of the history of Lyme disease, the complexities of clinical diagnosis, the problematic interpretation of serologic testing, the conflicting guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic Lyme, and benefits of antibiotic treatment. Despite growing global incidence of the Lyme disease, treatment has not attracted pharmaceutical investment, and the evidence base and international guidelines for treatment and management of chronic Lyme continue to be conflicting and controversial. The challenges of this immune mediated tick borne disease for public health policy and clinical practice are summarised, alongside directions for future research."

		"abstract": "Elucidating which wildlife species significantly contribute to the maintenance of Ixodes ricinus populations and the enzootic cycles of the pathogens they transmit is imperative in understanding the driving forces behind the emergence of tick-borne diseases. Here, we aimed to quantify the relative contribution of four mustelid species in the life-cycles of I. ricinus and Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) in forested areas and to investigate their role in the transmission of other tick-borne pathogens. Road-killed badgers, pine martens, stone martens and polecats were collected in Belgium and the Netherlands. Their organs and feeding ticks were tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens. Ixodes hexagonus and I. ricinus were found on half of the screened animals (n = 637). Pine martens had the highest I. ricinus burden, whereas polecats had the highest I. hexagonus burden. We detected DNA from B. burgdorferi (s.l.) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in organs of all four mustelid species (n = 789), and Neoehrlichia mikurensis DNA was detected in all species, except badgers. DNA from B. miyamotoi was not detected in any of the investigated mustelids. From the 15 larvae of I. ricinus feeding on pine martens (n = 44), only one was positive for B. miyamotoi DNA, and all tested negative for B. burgdorferi (s.l.), N. mikurensis and A. phagocytophilum. The two feeding larvae from the investigated polecats (n = 364) and stone martens (n = 39) were negative for all four pathogens. The infection rate of N. mikurensis was higher in feeding nymphs collected from mustelids compared to questing nymphs, but not for B. burgdorferi (s.l.), B. miyamotoi or A. phagocytophilum. Although all stages of I. ricinus can be found on badgers, polecats, pine and stone martens, their relative contribution to the life-cycle of I. ricinus in forested areas is less than 1%. Consequently, the relative contribution of mustelids to the enzootic cycles of I. ricinus-borne pathogens is negligible, despite the presence of these pathogens in organs and feeding ticks. Interestingly, all four mustelid species carried all stages of I. hexagonus, potentially maintaining enzootic cycles of this tick species apart from the cycle involving hedgehogs as main host species."

Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, a heterogeneous group of which three genospecies have been systematically associated to Lyme disease: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. Geographical distribution and clinical manifestations vary according to the species involved. Lyme disease clinical manifestations may be divided into three stages. Early localized stage is characterized by erythema migrans in the tick bite site. Early disseminated stage may present multiple erythema migrans lesions, borrelial lymphocytoma, lyme neuroborreliosis, carditis, or arthritis. The late disseminated stage manifests with acordermatitis chronica atrophicans, lyme arthritis, and neurological symptoms. Diagnosis is challenging due to the varied clinical manifestations it may present and usually involves a two-step serological approach. In the current review, we present a thorough revision of the clinical manifestations Lyme disease may present. Additionally, history, microbiology, diagnosis, post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, treatment, and prognosis are discussed."

Surveillance indicates that the number of LD cases is increasing in the UK, therefore, improved knowledge about reducing transmission from ticks to humans is needed. Eighteen electronic databases were searched and additional web-based searching was conducted, to locate empirical research, published from 2002 onwards. Sixteen studies that evaluated five types of prevention intervention were included: personal protection (n = 4), domestic strategies (landscape modification and chemical pest control) (n = 3), education (n = 6), vaccination (n = 3), and deer-reduction programmes (n = 2). In general the quality of evidence was low. Results suggest that personal protection strategies, including the use of tick repellents and wearing of protective clothes, can prevent tick bites and reduce the incidence of LD among adults. Educational interventions were generally successful for improving adults' knowledge, behavioural beliefs (e.g., self-efficacy for performing tick checks) and preventative behaviour, but for children, the findings were mixed. For adults and children, knowledge changes did not typically translate into a lower incidence of LD. Whilst evidence on vaccination against LD is promising, too few studies were available to reach robust conclusions. There was no evidence of effectiveness for deer culling, and the evidence was inconclusive for applying acaricide (tick poison) to deer's ears and heads. Low-quality evidence suggests that personal protective strategies, that limit exposure to ticks, should continue to be recommended, as should education to encourage the adoption of personal protective strategies; further investigation of education interventions for children, vaccination and deer programmes is needed."

		"abstract": "The nymph of the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), the primary North American vector of the causative agent of Lyme disease, must attach to a host by the end of its questing season in order to feed and subsequently molt into an adult. The proper timing of this behavior is critical both for the tick's survival and for perpetuating the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Questing also depletes limited nymphal lipid reserves and increases desiccation risk. Given this tradeoff, questing behavior and its environmental influences can be expressed in a dynamic state variable model. We develop what we believe to be the first such model for a tick, and investigate the influence of climate on nymph fitness predictions. We apply these results to the hypothesized inland migration of I. scapularis from island refugia, evaluating fitness under suboptimal questing strategies and uncertain environmental conditions."

Data were split into the training (from 16 June 2013 to 11 June 2017) and validation (from 12 June 2017, to 27 May 2018) data sets. A seasonal autoregressive moving average model, SARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) [52] model was selected to describe the time series of the weekly Lyme incidence. After this, we added the Google Trends data as an external regressor and identified the SARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) [52] model as optimal. We made predictions for the validation interval using these two models and compared predictions with the values of the validation data set. Forecasting for the validation timespan resulted in similar values for the models. Comparing the forecasted values with the reported ones resulted in an residual mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.3763; the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 8.233 for the model without Google searches with an RMSE of 0.3732; and the MAPE was 8.17495 for the Google Trends values-expanded model. The difference between the predictive performances was insignificant (Diebold-Mariano Test, p-value = 0.4152). Google Trends data are a good correlate of the reported incidence of Lyme disease in Germany, but it failed to significantly improve the forecasting accuracy in models based on traditional data."

		"abstract": "An inverse relationship between biodiversity and human health has been termed the 'dilution effect' paradigm. In the case of tick-borne infections such as Lyme disease, the key assumption is that Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato abundance is increased by the loss of less competent (dilution) hosts as biodiversity declines. White-tailed deer play a dual role in the pathogen cycle, as key reproductive hosts for adult ticks and incompetent hosts for the pathogen. While the role of deer as hosts of adult ticks is well established, the extent to which deer also feed immature ticks and reduce the proportion infected is unknown because of logistic constraints in measuring this empirically. We estimated the proportion of larvae that fed on deer in an extremely species-poor community on Block Island, RI, where tick nymphal infection prevalence was found to be lower than expected. In 2014, we measured the density, larval tick burdens, and realized reservoir competence of small mammal and bird hosts on Block Island, RI. In 2015, we measured the infection prevalence of host-seeking Ixodes scapularis nymphs resulting from larvae fed on available hosts in 2014. We back-estimated the proportion of larvae expected to have fed on deer in 2014 (the only unknown parameter) to result in the nymphal infection prevalence observed in 2015. Back-estimation predicted that 29% of larval ticks must have fed on deer to yield the observed 30% nymphal infection prevalence. In comparison, the proportion of larvae feeding on mice was 44% and 27% on birds. Our study identified an influential role of deer in reducing nymphal tick infection prevalence and a potential role as dilution hosts if the reduction in nymphal infection prevalence outweighs the role of deer as tick population amplifiers. Because both deer and competent hosts may increase in anthropogenic, fragmented habitats, the links between fragmentation, biodiversity, and Lyme disease risk may be complex and difficult to predict. Furthermore, a nonlinear relationship between deer abundance and Lyme disease risk would reduce the efficacy of deer population reduction efforts to control Lyme disease."

In this report, we characterized the role of these conserved molecules in ticks infected with either Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi or tick-borne Langat virus (LGTV), a pathogen closely related to tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed no significant changes in oatps gene expression upon infection with B. burgdorferi in unfed ticks. Synchronous infection of unfed nymphal ticks with LGTV in vitro revealed no significant changes in oatps gene expression. However, expression of specific oatps was significantly downregulated upon LGTV infection of tick cells in vitro. Treatment of tick cells with OATP inhibitor significantly reduced LGTV loads, kynurenine amino transferase (kat), a gene involved in the production of tryptophan metabolite xanthurenic acid (XA), levels and expression of several oatps in tick cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics characterization of OATPs from some of the medically important vectors including ticks, mosquitoes and lice revealed the presence of several glycosylation, phosphorylation and myristoylation sites. This study provides additional evidence on the role of arthropod OATPs in vector-intracellular pathogen interactions."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), is typically transmitted by hard-bodied ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). Whenever this tick-borne zoonosis is mentioned in medical clinics and emergency rooms, it sparks a firestorm of controversy. Denial often sets in, and healthcare practitioners dismiss the fact that this pathogenic spirochetosis is present in their area. For distribution of Bbsl across Canada, we conducted a 4-year, tick⁻host study (2013⁻2016), and collected ticks from avian and mammalian hosts from Atlantic Canada to the West Coast. Overall, 1265 ticks representing 27 tick species belonging to four genera were collected. Of the 18 tick species tested, 15 species (83%) were positive for Bbsl and, of these infected ticks, 6 species bite humans. Overall, 13 of 18 tick species tested are human-biting ticks. Our data suggest that a 6-tick, enzootic maintenance cycle of Bbsl is present in southwestern B.C., and five of these tick species bite humans. Biogeographically, the groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, has extended its home range from central and eastern Canada to southwestern British Columbia (B.C.). We posit that the Fox Sparrow, Passerella iliaca, is a reservoir-competent host for Bbsl. The Bay-breasted Warbler, Setophaga castanea, and the Tennessee Warbler, Vermivora peregrina, are new host records for the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. We provide the first report of a Bbsl-positive Amblyomma longirostre larva parasitizing a bird; this bird parasitism suggests that a Willow Flycatcher is a competent reservoir of Bbsl. Our findings show that Bbsl is present in all provinces, and that multiple tick species are implicated in the enzootic maintenance cycle of this pathogen. Ultimately, Bbsl poses a serious public health contagion Canada-wide."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne diseases constitute a major problem for veterinary and public health, especially in tropical regions like Central America. Domestic dogs may be infected with several vector-borne pathogens of zoonotic relevance, which may also severely compromise canine health. To assess the prevalence of canine vector-borne diseases in Nicaragua, 329 dogs from seven cities, which were presented to the veterinarian for various reasons, were included in this study. Dogs were examined clinically and diagnostic blood samples were taken for analysis of packed cell volume (PCV) and presence of microfilariae as well as antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) by use of a commercially available rapid ELISA. To detect current infections, specific PCRs for the detection of E. canis, A. platys and A. phagocytophilum were carried out on blood samples of the respective seropositive dogs. Microfilaremic blood samples, as well as D. immitis antigen positive samples were further subjected to PCR and subsequent sequencing for filarial species identification. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. were present in 62.9% of dogs, while Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence was 28.6%. Antibodies against species of both genera were detected in 24.9% of dogs. Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) antibodies were not detected. Dirofilaria immitis antigen was present in six animals (1.8%), two of which also showed D. immitis microfilariae in buffy coat. In addition to D. immitis, Acanthocheilonema reconditum was identified by PCR and sequencing in two of four additional microfilaremic blood samples, which were tested negative for D. immitis antigen. Current E. canis infections as defined by DNA detection were present in 58.5% of Ehrlichia-seropositive dogs, while 5.3% of Anaplasma-seropositive dogs were PCR-positive for A. platys, 2.2% for A. phagocytophilum and 16.0% for both Anaplasma species. Current E. canis infection had a statistically significant negative impact on PCV, whereas no relationship between infection status and clinical signs of disease could be observed. These results indicate that canine vector-borne diseases are widespread in Nicaragua and that dogs may constitute a reservoir for human infection with E. canis, A. phagocytophilum and D. immitis. Thus, the use of repellents or acaricides to protect dogs from vector-borne diseases is strongly recommended."

		"abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Borrelia cause vector-borne infections like the most important hard tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, Lyme borreliosis (LB), and soft tick or louse transmitted relapsing fevers (RF), prevalent in temperate and tropical areas. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) includes several genospecies and causes LB in humans. In infected patients, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) expresses the BmpA, BmpB, BmpC and BmpD proteins. The role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of LB remains incompletely characterized, but they are, however, closely related to Treponema pallidum PnrA (Purine nucleoside receptor A), a substrate-binding lipoprotein of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family preferentially binding purine nucleosides. Based on 3D homology modeling, the Bmp proteins share the typical fold of the substrate-binding protein family and the ligand-binding properties of BmpA, BmpB and BmpD are highly similar, whereas those of BmpC differ markedly. Nevertheless, these residues are highly conserved within the genus Borrelia and the inferred phylogenetic tree also reveals that the RF Borrelia lack BmpB proteins but has an additional Bmp protein (BmpA2) missing in LB-causing Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Our results indicate that the Bmp proteins could bind nucleosides, although BmpC might have a different ligand-binding specificity and, therefore, a distinct function. Furthermore, the work provides a means for classifying the Bmp proteins and supports further elucidation of the roles of these proteins."

		"abstract": "Multiple-strain pathogens often establish mixed infections inside the host that result in competition between strains. In vector-borne pathogens, the competitive ability of strains must be measured in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector to understand the outcome of competition. Such studies could reveal the existence of trade-offs in competitive ability between different host types. We used the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii to test for competition between strains in the rodent host and the tick vector, and to test for a trade-off in competitive ability between these two host types. Mice were infected via tick bite with either one or two strains, and these mice were subsequently used to create ticks with single or mixed infections. Competition in the rodent host reduced strain-specific host-to-tick transmission and competition in the tick vector reduced the abundance of both strains. The strain that was competitively superior in host-to-tick transmission was competitively inferior with respect to bacterial abundance in the tick. This study suggests that in multiple-strain vector-borne pathogens there are trade-offs in competitive ability between the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Such trade-offs could play an important role in the coexistence of pathogen strains."

To evaluate the involvement of multiple microbial immune responses in patients experiencing TBD we utilized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Four hundred and thirty-two human serum samples organized into seven categories followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention two-tier Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis guidelines and Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. All patient categories were tested for their immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) responses against 20 microbes associated with TBD. Our findings recognize that microbial infections in patients suffering from TBDs do not follow the one microbe, one disease Germ Theory as 65% of the TBD patients produce immune responses to various microbes. We have established a causal association between TBD patients and TBD associated co-infections and essential opportunistic microbes following Bradford Hill's criteria. This study indicated an 85% probability that a randomly selected TBD patient will respond to Borrelia and other related TBD microbes rather than to Borrelia alone. A paradigm shift is required in current healthcare policies to diagnose TBD so that patients can get tested and treated even for opportunistic infections."

		"abstract": "The incidence of babesiosis, Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases has increased steadily in Europe and North America during the last five decades. Babesia microti is transmitted by species of Ixodes, the same ticks that transmit the Lyme disease-causing spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. B. microti can also be transmitted through transfusion of blood products and is the most common transfusion-transmitted infection in the U.S.A. Ixodes ticks are commonly infected with both B. microti and B. burgdorferi, and are competent vectors for transmitting them together into hosts. Few studies have examined the effects of coinfections on humans and they had somewhat contradictory results. One study linked coinfection with B. microti to a greater number of symptoms of overall disease in patients, while another report indicated that B. burgdorferi infection either did not affect babesiosis symptoms or decreased its severity. Mouse models of infection that manifest pathological effects similar to those observed in human babesiosis and Lyme disease offer a unique opportunity to thoroughly investigate the effects of coinfection on the host. Lyme disease has been studied using the susceptible C3H mouse infection model, which can also be used to examine B. microti infection to understand pathological mechanisms of human diseases, both during a single infection and during coinfections. We observed that high B. microti parasitaemia leads to low haemoglobin levels in infected mice, reflecting the anaemia observed in human babesiosis. Similar to humans, B. microti coinfection appears to enhance the severity of Lyme disease-like symptoms in mice. Coinfected mice have lower peak B. microti parasitaemia compared to mice infected with B. microti alone, which may reflect attenuation of babesiosis symptoms reported in some human coinfections. These findings suggest that B. burgdorferi coinfection attenuates parasite growth while B. microti presence exacerbates Lyme disease-like symptoms in mice."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe and its incidence has steadily increased over the last two decades. In the Netherlands alone, more than 20,000 citizens are affected by LB each year. Because of this, two Dutch citizen science projects were started to monitor tick bites. Both projects have collected nearly 50,000 geo-located tick bite reports over the period 2006-2016. The number of tick bite reports per area unit is a proxy of tick bite risk. This risk can also be modelled as the result of the interaction of hazard (e.g. tick activity) and human exposure (e.g. outdoor recreational activities). Multiple studies have focused on quantifying tick hazard. However, quantifying human exposure is a harder task. In this work, we make a first step to map human exposure to ticks by combining tick bite reports with a tick hazard model. Our results show human exposure to tick bites in all forested areas of the Netherlands. This information could facilitate the cooperation between public health specialists and forest managers to create better mitigation campaigns for tick-borne diseases, and it could also support the design of improved plans for ecosystem management."

		"abstract": "Bites with tick-borne pathogens can cause various bacterial, viral, or parasitic diseases in humans. Tick-transmitted diseases are known as contributing factors to the increasing incidence and burden of diseases. The present article investigated the epidemiology of tick-borne diseases in South Korea. The incidence and distribution of common tick-borne diseases in Korea (Lyme disease, Q fever, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome [SFTS]) were investigated and analyzed, using data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) infectious disease reporting system. A literature review was compiled on the current status of uncommon tick-borne diseases (Rickettsia, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, bartonellosis, tularemia, tick-borne encephalitis, and babesiosis). In South Korea, SFTS is an emerging disease, showing a rapid increase in reports since 2012, with high mortality. Likewise, reports of Lyme disease and Q fever cases have also been rapidly increasing during 2012-2017, although caution should be taken when interpreting these results, considering the likely influence of increased physician awareness and reporting of these diseases. Other tick-borne diseases reported in South Korea included spotted fever group rickettsiae, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, tularemia, Bartonella, and babesiosis. Evidences on human infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever were recently unavailable, but both need constant monitoring."

In 9/16 states, notification of erythema migrans (EM), acute neuroborreliosis (NB) and Lyme arthritis (LA) is mandatory. We describe incidence measures, time trends, geographical distribution and frequencies of manifestations to better understand LB epidemiology and target prevention measures. We used cases notified in the 9 states and confirmed by local health offices, 2013-2017, to calculate incidences by time, place and person. Altogether, we observed 56,446 cases. Disease onset peaked yearly in July. Incidence ranged from 26/100,000 (2015) to 41/100,000 (2013) with mean annual incidences 2013-2017 on district level between 0.5/100,000 and 138/100,000. Median age was 54 years with peaks in boys (5-9 years, mean incidence 36/100,000) and women (50-69 years, mean incidence 57/100,000). 95% experienced EM only, 2.7% NB and 2.1% LA. 54% were female, but more men had NB (56%) and LA (53%, p < 0.001). Hospitalisation was recorded for 10% of LA and 71% of NB cases. LB remains an important public health concern in Germany with marked regional variation. To facilitate early diagnosis and treatment, health authorities should raise awareness among physicians and promote prevention strategies among the general population: tick-bite-protection, prompt tick removal and medical consultation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. As the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the USA, LD affects 300,000 human cases each year. LD is caused by inoculation of the bacterial spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, from an infected tick. If not treated quickly and completely, the bacteria disseminate from the tick's biting site into multiple organs including the joints, heart, and brain. Thus, the best outcome from medical intervention can be expected with early detection and treatment with antibiotics, prior to multi-organ dissemination. In the absence of a characteristic rash, LD is diagnosed using serological testing involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by western blotting, which is collectively known as the two-tier algorithm. These assays detect host antibodies against the bacteria, but are hampered by low sensitivity, which can miss early LD cases. This review discusses the application of some current assays for diagnosing LD clinically, thus providing a foundation for exploring newer techniques being developed in the laboratory for more sensitive detection of early LD."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spirochetes are tick-borne Gram-negative bacteria that cause disease in humans and animals. Although many studies have focused on Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease, recent studies have examined the role of Relapsing Fever Borrelia (RFB) in human disease. In this pilot study, we have evaluated serological reactivity against Bb and RFB in patients residing in California. Serological testing for reactivity to Bb and RFB antigens was performed in 543 patients with suspected tick-borne illness using a Western blot technique. Further evaluation of a subset of 321 patients residing in California was obtained. Serum samples were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies reactive with Bb and RFB, and samples were classified by county of residence according to Bb reactivity alone, RFB reactivity alone, and dual reactivity against Bb and RFB. Seroreactivity was ranked in counties with the highest absolute number and the highest prevalence of positive samples. Of the 543 total serum samples, 32% were positive for Bb, 22% were positive for RFB, and 7% were positive for both Bb and RFB. Of the 321 serum samples from patients residing in California, 33% were positive for Bb, 27% were positive for RFB, and 11% were positive for both Bb and RFB. In the California cohort, the highest rates of positive serological testing for Bb were found in Santa Clara, Alameda, and Contra Costa counties, while the highest rates of positive serological testing for RFB were found in Santa Clara, Alameda, Marin, and San Francisco counties. The highest rates of dual reactivity against Bb and RFB were found in Contra Costa, Alameda, and San Francisco counties. Among the 24 counties with patients who were tested, Bb seropositivity alone was found in four counties, RFB seropositivity alone was found in two counties, and seropositivity for both Bb and RFB was found in 14 counties. Results of this pilot study suggest that seroreactivity against Bb and RFB is widespread in California, and dual exposure to Bb and RFB may complicate the diagnosis of tick-borne disease. Greater awareness of RFB and broader screening for this tick-borne infection is warranted."

Actual numbers of cases are increasing and it appears that the distribution across the UK is widening; however, it occurs most frequently in area of woodland, with temperate climate. It typically presents in mid to late summer. Lyme disease is a multisystem disease. The nervous system is the second most commonly affected system after the skin. Other systemic manifestations, such as carditis, keratitis, uveitis and inflammatory arthritis, rarely occur in European Lyme disease. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has updated its guidelines on the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease. Here, we highlight important aspects of this guidance and provide a more detailed review of the clinical spectrum of neuroborreliosis, illustrated by cases we have seen."

		"abstract": "In recent years, the known distribution of vector-borne diseases in Europe has changed, with much new information also available now on the status of vectors in the United Kingdom (UK). For example, in 2016, the UK reported their first detection of the non-native mosquito Aedes albopictus, which is a known vector for dengue and chikungunya virus. In 2010, Culex modestus, a principal mosquito vector for West Nile virus was detected in large numbers in the Thames estuary. For tick-borne diseases, data on the changing distribution of the Lyme borreliosis tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, has recently been published, at a time when there has been an increase in the numbers of reported human cases of Lyme disease. This paper brings together the latest surveillance data and pertinent research on vector-borne disease in the UK, and its relevance to public health. It highlights the need for continued vector surveillance systems to monitor our native mosquito and tick fauna, as well as the need to expand surveillance for invasive species. It illustrates the importance of maintaining surveillance capacity that is sufficient to ensure accurate and timely disease risk assessment to help mitigate the UK's changing emerging infectious disease risks, especially in a time of climatic and environmental change and increasing global connectivity."

The patient quickly improved after appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against babesiosis was started. This case illustrates the importance of basic microbiology, including epidemiology and common vectors, when creating a differential diagnosis. Because the Ixodes scapularis tick can harbour and transmit multiple parasites simultaneously, the possibility of coinfection should be considered in any patient not responding to appropriate initial medical therapy."

Here we present the first genomes of B. turcica and B. tachyglossi, members of a recently described and rapidly expanding Borrelia clade associated with reptile (B. turcica) or echidna (B. tachyglossi) hosts, transmitted by hard ticks, and of unknown pathogenicity. Borrelia tachyglossi and B. turcica genomes are similar to those of relapsing fever Borrelia species, containing a linear ~ 900 kb chromosome, a single long (> 70 kb) linear plasmid, and numerous short (< 40 kb) linear and circular plasmids, as well as a suite of housekeeping and macronutrient biosynthesis genes which are not found in Lyme disease Borrelia. Additionally, both B. tachyglossi and B. turcica contain paralogous vsp and vlp proteins homologous to those used in the multiphasic antigen-switching system used by relapsing fever Borrelia to evade vertebrate immune responses, although their number was greatly reduced compared to human-infectious species. However, B. tachyglossi and B. turcica chromosomes also contain numerous genes orthologous to Lyme disease Borrelia-specific genes, demonstrating a unique evolutionary, and potentially phenotypic link between these groups. Borrelia tachyglossi and B. turcica genomes also have unique genetic features, including degraded and deleted tRNA modification genes, and an expanded range of macronutrient salvage and biosynthesis genes compared to relapsing fever and Lyme disease Borrelia. These genomes and genomic comparisons provide an insight into the biology and evolutionary origin of these Borrelia, and provide a valuable resource for future work."

		"abstract": "While the prevalence of human pathogens has been quantified in ticks in Adair County, Missouri, the prevalence of residents acquiring tick-borne diseases and seeking medical treatment has not. A public survey (n=109) revealed that 96% of respondents reported finding attached ticks on their person; of these, 38% developed symptoms post tick bite; of these, 55% reported consultation with a health care provider. Overall, 89% of practitioners surveyed had treated at least one patient for tick-borne disease. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease were the most common illnesses diagnosed, however, the only confirmed cases reported by Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services from 2013-2017 were ehrlichiosis. Results from these surveys indicate that exposure to ticks is common and ehrlichiosis infections are likely underdiagnosed while Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease are likely overdiagnosed."

		"abstract": "This study assessed cost-effectiveness of a potential anti-tick vaccine that would protect against both Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in a highly endemic setting of Slovenia. A Markov model was developed to estimate cost-effectiveness of a vaccine with potential combined protection against LB and TBE from the societal perspective. The model expressed time in annual cycles, followed a target population through their lifetime, and applied an annual discounting of 3%. A target population entered the model in a susceptible state, with time dependent probabilities to acquire LB/TBE. Disease manifestations were either resolved within one cycle, or a patient developed LB/TBE sequelae. The vaccination consisted of initial immunization and one revaccination. Estimates of LB/TBE direct and indirect costs, and data on natural course of LB/TBE were obtained from Slovenian databases. Effectiveness of the vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was derived from studies on existing TBE and LB vaccines, while utility estimates were collected from various literature sources. A vaccine with potential combined protection against LB/TBE was predicted to have an incremental cost of €771,300 per 10,000 vaccinated persons, an incremental utility of 17QALYs and a base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 46,061€/QALY. Vaccine cost, effectiveness and discount rates were identified as the most influential model parameters. A wholesale price for a vaccine shot of €9.13 would lead to cost savings followed by health gains for the vaccination strategy. The base-case ICER was below commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness, indicating that a combined LB/TBE vaccine might be a cost-effective option in Slovenia. With early Health Technology Assessment becoming increasingly important, this analysis still represents a rare example of cost-effectiveness assessment prior to market authorisation. Although obviously in such a situation some key parameters are unknown, our model sets up a tool to analyse pharmacoeconomic criteria that can help development of a cost-effective health technology, in this case a combined tick-borne diseases vaccine."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, encounters two disparate host environments during its enzootic life cycle, Ixodes ticks and mammalian hosts. B. burgdorferi has a small genome that encodes a streamlined cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling system comprising a single diguanylate cyclase, Rrp1, and two phosphodiesterases. This system is essential for spirochete survival in ticks, in part because it controls the expression of the glp operon involved in glycerol utilization. In this study, we showed that a B. burgdorferi c-di-GMP receptor, PlzA, functions as both a positive and a negative regulator for glp expression. Deletion of plzA or mutation in plzA that impaired c-di-GMP binding abolished glp expression. On the other hand, overexpression of plzA resulted in glp repression, which could be rescued by simultaneous overexpression of rrp1. plzA overexpression in the rrp1 mutant, which is devoid of c-di-GMP, or overexpression of a plzA mutant incapable of c-di-GMP binding further enhanced glp repression. Combined results suggest that c-di-GMP-bound PlzA functions as a positive regulator, whereas ligand-free PlzA acts as a negative regulator for glp expression. Thus, PlzA of B. burgdorferi with a streamlined c-di-GMP signaling system not only controls multiple targets, as previously envisioned, but has also evolved different modes of action.IMPORTANCE The Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, has a simple cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling system essential for adaptation of the pathogen to the complicated tick environment. The c-di-GMP effector of B. burgdorferi, PlzA, has been shown to regulate multiple cellular processes, including motility, osmolality sensing, and nutrient utilization. The findings of this study demonstrate that PlzA not only controls multiple targets but also has different functional modalities, allowing it to act as both positive and negative regulator of the glp operon expression. This work highlights how bacteria with a small genome can compensate for the limited regulatory repertoire by increasing the complexity of targets and modes of action in their regulatory proteins."

		"abstract": "Ticks are cosmopolitan vectors of numerous diseases, and detection of various pathogens in ticks can help to assess their distribution. In the current study, 528 adult ticks were collected from grazing animals or the ground in ten different Mongolian provinces. Dermacentor nuttalli constituted 76.1% of them and was found in all ecozones except the eastern desert. Dermacentor marginatus (8.3%), Dermacentor silvarum (1.1%) and Ixodes persulcatus (3.0%) were found in the northern forest areas and Hyalomma asiaticum (11.4%) only in the southern (semi-)desert. Of these, 359 ticks were subjected to DNA extraction and PCR was carried out to detect various pathogens. Anaplasma spp. was found in D. marginatus and D. nuttalli (2.5% positive each), including flagged specimen and identified as Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Borrelia spp. were found in 2.5% of the ticks (mostly in I. persulcatus) and identified as Borrelia garinii. Babesia spp. (40%) identified as Babesia caballi were detected in all five tick species including flagged Dermacentor spp. and I. persulcatus, and 3.5% of the ticks (all species except D. silvarum) were positive for Theileria spp. identified as Theileria equi. The piroplasms were found in all provinces. Tick-borne encephalitis virus was not detected. The results highlight the high risk of equine piroplasmosis in Mongolia, which is a concern for both the nomadic population who rely on horses for transport and for conservation of Przewalski's horses in Mongolia. In addition, zoonotic agents such as the avian B. garinii and A. phagocytophilum were also detected, outlining a high risk for exposed humans."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans (EM) rashes once considered pathognomonic of Lyme disease (LD) have been reported following bites of arthropods that do not transmit LD and in areas with no LD. Also, EM rashes have been reported in association with organisms other than members of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. Arthropod saliva has chemicals that have effects on the host and pathogen transmission. Tick saliva has protein families similar to spiders and scorpions and even substances homologous to those found in snakes and other venomous animals. Ticks \"invertebrate pharmacologists\" have a sophisticated arsenal of chemicals that assist in blood feeding, pathogen transmission, and suppressing host defenses. No organisms have been isolated from many EM rashes. We propose that tick salivary toxins may play a role in the causation of rashes and laboratory abnormalities in tick-borne diseases. The role of tick salivary toxins needs further exploration. Cases of Lyme-like EM rashes referred to as STARI (Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness) following bites of the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum, in the United States have been reported predominantly in Southeastern Missouri and a few in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, and one case each in Mississippi and Long Island, New York. Although there is one report of Borrelia lonestari in a patient with a rash, biopsies of 31 cases of STARI, with cultures and PCR, failed to show a relationship. Distribution of A. americanum, whose bites are associated with STARI, now extends along the East Coast of the United States, including New Jersey, up to the Canadian border. As far as we are aware, there have been no prior reports of Lyme-like rashes in New Jersey. In this study, we present case examples of 2 Lyme-like rashes, variations of EM rashes, and a brief review of studies that suggest a role of tick salivary toxins in tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Accurate laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (BB), is difficult and yet important to prevent serious disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presently recommends a screening test for serum antibodies followed by confirmation with a more specific Western blot (WB) test to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against antigens in whole cell lysates of BB. Borrelia species related to BB cause tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). TBRF is increasingly recognized as a health problem in the US and occurs in areas where Lyme disease is prevalent. The two groups of Borrelia share related antigens. We have developed a modified WB procedure termed the Lyme immunoblots (IBs) using recombinant antigens from common strains and species of the BB sensu lato complex for serological diagnosis of Lyme disease. A reference collection of 178 sera from 26 with and 152 patients without Lyme disease were assessed by WB and IB in a blinded manner using either criteria for positive antibody reactions recommended by the CDC or criteria developed in-house. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values obtained with the reference sera suggest that the Lyme IB is superior to the Lyme WB for detection of specific antibodies in Lyme disease. The Lyme IB showed no significant reaction with rabbit antisera produced against two Borrelia species causing TBRF in the US, suggesting that the Lyme IB may be also useful for excluding TBRF."

		"abstract": "Next-generation sequencing approaches have revolutionized genomic medicine and enabled rapid diagnosis for several diseases. These approaches are widely used for pathogen detection in several infectious diseases. Lyme disease is a tick-borne infectious disease, which affects multiple organs. The causative organism is a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by ticks. Lyme disease can be treated easily if detected early, but its diagnosis is often delayed or is incorrect leading to a chronic debilitating condition. Current confirmatory diagnostic tests for Lyme disease rely on detection of antigens derived from B. burgdorferi, which are prone to both false positives and false negatives. Instead of focusing only on the human host for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, one could also attempt to identify the vector (tick) and the causative organism carried by the tick. Since all ticks do not transmit Lyme disease, it can be informative to accurately identify the tick from the site of bite, which is often observed by the patient and discarded. However, identifying ticks based on morphology alone requires a trained operator and can still be incorrect. Thus, we decided to take a molecular approach by sequencing DNA and RNA from a tick collected from an individual bitten by the tick. Using next-generation sequencing, we confirmed the identity of the tick as a dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis, and did not identify any pathogenic bacterial sequences, including Borrelia species. Despite the limited availability of nucleotide sequences for many types of ticks, our approach correctly identified the tick species. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates the potential of next-generation sequencing in the diagnosis of tick-borne infections, which can also be extended to other zoonotic diseases."

Despite the rising recognition and occurrence of tick-borne disease in Latin America, serology has proven to be inconclusive in detecting suspected LD cases. Recently, new B.b.s.l. strains or new related species have been described in Brazil, Uruguay, and Chile. This could explain the lack of confirmatory tests, such as indeterminate Western blots (WBs) and polymerase chain reactions, in detecting suspected LD cases in this region of the world.

The spectrum of diseases caused by tick-borne pathogens has not been objectively evaluated in this region for clinical management and for comparison with other regions globally where tick-transmitted diseases are common. Based on clinical symptoms, PCR, indirect immunofluorescent assay and (or) blood smear, we identified and described tick-borne diseases from patients with recent tick bite seen at Mudanjiang Forestry Central Hospital. From May 2010 to September 2011, 42% (75/180) of patients were diagnosed with a specific tick-borne disease, including Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, human babesiosis and spotted fever group rickettsiosis. When we compared clinical and laboratory features to identify factors that might discriminate tick-transmitted infections from those lacking that evidence, we revealed that erythema migrans and neurological manifestations were statistically significantly differently presented between those with and without documented aetiologies (P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.003). Twelve patients (6.7%, 12/180) were co-infected with two tick-borne pathogens. We demonstrated the poor ability of clinicians to identify the specific tick-borne disease. In addition, it is necessary to develop specific laboratory assays for optimal diagnosis of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The distribution, abundance and seasonal activity of vector species, such as ticks and mosquitoes, are key determinants of vector-borne disease risk, and are strongly influenced by abiotic and habitat conditions. Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I. pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis, competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I. pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D. occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America."

		"abstract": "Introduced Siberian chipmunks Eutamias sibiricus have been reported to be important reservoirs for human Lyme disease, as they may host high numbers of hard ticks carrying Borrelia spp. and other pathogens. In the present study, we assessed the prevalence of Borrelia spp. and other pathogenic bacteria in ectoparasite arthropod species infesting Siberian chipmunks and coexisting native small rodents. Small rodents were trapped with Sherman traps in Veneto (NE Italy), where the largest Italian populations of chipmunks occur. A total of 14 individual ticks were found on 223 rodents, with 6 more ticks obtained from stored dead chipmunks from the same study area. Ectoparasites were screened for pathogens by molecular analyses including species-specific PCR amplifications. Rickettsia monacensis, Borrelia lusitaniae, and Anaplasma platys were present in the parasites of both native rodents and introduced chipmunks. The present findings suggest a role for the invasive species E. sibiricus in the maintenance of the Ixodes ricinus life cycle, which may result in the modification of the transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens. Moreover, the presence of Rickettsia in urban populations of chipmunks may represent a serious risk for human health and should be investigated further."

The causative agent of BMD is transmitted by Ixodes ticks, which are also vectors of Lyme disease borreliae. In this study, we examined 459 cases of clinically suspected Lyme disease (LD group), and found twelve cases that were seropositive for the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) antigen derived from B. miyamotoi. The retrospective surveillance revealed that the seroprevalence of anti-GlpQ in the LD group was significantly higher than in a healthy cohort. Seropositive cases were observed from spring through autumn when ticks are active, and the cases were geographically widespread, being found in Hokkaido-Tohoku, Kanto, Chubu, Kinki, and Kyushu-Okinawa regions. Seropositive cases for GlpQ were most frequent in the Chubu region (6.3%) where B. miyamotoi has been found in Ixodes ticks. Out of the twelve cases that were found in the LD group, three cases exhibited concomitant seropositivity to Lyme disease borreliae by western blot assay. This is the first report of serological surveillance for BMD in Japan, and we conclude that BMD occurs nationwide."

These include five bacteria (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia mayonii, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis), one protozoan (Babesia microti) and one virus (Powassan). We sought to assess the prevalence and distribution of these pathogens in host-seeking nymphs collected throughout Minnesota, a state on the northwestern edge of the tick's expanding range, where reported cases of I. scapularis-borne diseases have increased in incidence and geographic range over the past decade. Among the 1240 host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs that we screened from 64 sites, we detected all seven pathogens at varying frequencies. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was the most prevalent and geographically widespread, found in 25.24% of all nymphs tested. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti were also geographically widespread, but they were less prevalent than Bo. burgdorferi s.s. (detected in 6.29% and 4.68% of ticks, respectively). Spatial clusters of sites with high prevalence for these three pathogens were identified in the north-central region of the state. Prevalence was less than 1.29% for each of the remaining pathogens. Two or more pathogens were detected in 90 nymphs (7.26%); coinfections with Bo. burgdorferi s.s. and either A. phagocytophilum (51 nymphs, 4.11%) or Ba. microti (43 nymphs, 3.47%) were the most common combinations. The distribution and density of infected ticks mirrors the distribution of notifiable tick-borne diseases in Minnesota and provides information on the distribution and prevalence of recently described human pathogens."

The sera were investigated by multiplex phosphorescence analysis (PHOSPHAN) for IgM to Bb C6, recombinant OspC and VlsE proteins, and IgG to C6 from Bb, B. garinii (Bg), and B. afzelii (Ba). Detection of Bb C6 IgM/IgG provided effective serologic confirmation of ITBB in both EM and EMF patients early after disease onset. In the EM-free patients, however, this test needed to be supplemented with detection of VlsE IgM in convalescent-phase sera due to delay in development of the antibody responses for C6 IgG. In general, positive PHOSPHAN reactions were observed in 81.9% and 86.7% of the EM and EMF patients, respectively, as well as in 59 of 65 (90.8%) patients, whose blood contained B. burgdorferi sensu lato DNA. Additional detection of IgG to Bg C6 or Ba C6 had no significant contribution to serologic diagnosis of ITBB in both patient groups."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis ticks harbor a variety of microorganisms, including eukaryotes, bacteria and viruses. Some of these can be transmitted to and cause disease in humans and other vertebrates. Others are not pathogenic, but may impact the ability of the tick to harbor and transmit pathogens. A growing number of studies have examined the influence of bacteria on tick vector competence but the influence of the tick virome remains less clear, despite a surge in the discovery of tick-associated viruses. In this study, we performed shotgun RNA sequencing on 112 individual adult I. scapularis collected in Wisconsin, USA. We characterized the abundance, prevalence and co-infection rates of viruses, bacteria and eukaryotic microorganisms. We identified pairs of tick-infecting microorganisms whose observed co-infection rates were higher or lower than would be expected, or whose RNA levels were positively correlated in co-infected ticks. Many of these co-occurrence and correlation relationships involved two bunyaviruses, South Bay virus and blacklegged tick phlebovirus-1. These viruses were also the most prevalent microorganisms in the ticks we sampled, and had the highest average RNA levels. Evidence of associations between microbes included a positive correlation between RNA levels of South Bay virus and Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent. These findings contribute to the rationale for experimental studies on the impact of viruses on tick biology and vector competence."

Testing data were obtained by a retrospective review utilizing searchable data from a laboratory information system archive. Testing for tick-borne infections (TBI) increased 5.3-fold over an 11-year time period and the number of positive test results increased threefold. Annual rates for Lyme serology positivity varied from 14% to 29% and for western blot confirmation from 26% to 48%. Test volumes and the number of positive results increased for all TBI endemic to our region. Our results confirm national trends suggesting increasing rates of TBI and substantially increased testing. This may reflect a greater incidence of TBI in our region and/or increased awareness of these infections."

		"abstract": "Seasonal variation in spatial distribution and pathogen prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) influences human population risk of Lyme disease in peri-urban built environments. Parks, gardens, playgrounds, school campuses and neighborhoods represent a significant risk for Lyme disease transmission. From June 2012 through May 2014, ticks were collected using 1 m² corduroy cloths dragged over low-lying vegetation parallel to walkways with high human foot traffic. DNA was extracted from ticks, purified and presence of B. burgdorferi assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Summer is reported as the time of highest risk for Lyme disease transmission in the United States and our results indicate a higher tick density of 26.0/1000 m² in summer vs. 0.2/1000 m² to 10.5/1000 m² in spring and fall. However, our findings suggest that tick infection rate is proportionally higher during the fall and spring than summer (30.0⁻54.7% in fall and 36.8⁻65.6% in spring vs. 20.0⁻28.2% in summer). Seasonal variation in infected tick density has significant implications for Lyme disease transmission as people are less likely to be aware of ticks in built environments, and unaware of increased infection in ticks in spring and fall. These factors may lead to more tick bites resulting in Lyme infection."

Dog caretakers reported having found embedded ticks on their bodies 5.83 times more than environment-only controls. Zoonotic Lyme disease, first in the United States for morbidity due to a vector-borne infection, has dramatically expanded its geographic range over the last two decades. This finding emphasizes the increased risk of tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease, based on dog exposure and in areas of disease emergence."

		"abstract": "The relapsing fever spirochete, Borrelia miyamotoi, is increasingly recognized as a cause of human illness (hard tick-borne relapsing fever) in the United States. We previously demonstrated that single nymphs of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, can transmit B. miyamotoi to experimental hosts. However, two recent epidemiological studies from the Northeastern United States indicate that human cases of hard tick-borne relapsing fever peak during late summer, after the spring peak for nymphal tick activity but coincident with the peak seasonal activity period of larval ticks in the Northeast. These epidemiological findings, together with evidence that B. miyamotoi can be passed from infected I. scapularis females to their offspring, suggest that bites by transovarially-infected larval ticks can be an important source of human infection. To demonstrate experimentally that transovarially-infected larval I. scapularis ticks can transmit B. miyamotoi, outbred Mus musculus CD1 mice were exposed to 1 or 2 potentially infected larvae. Individual fed larvae and mouse blood taken 10 d after larvae attached were tested for presence of B. miyamotoi DNA, and mice also were examined for seroreactivity to B. miyamotoi 8 wk after tick feeding. We documented B. miyamotoi DNA in blood from 13 (57%) of 23 mice exposed to a single transovarially-infected larva and in 5 (83%) of 6 mice exposed to two infected larvae feeding simultaneously. All 18 positive mice also demonstrated seroreactivity to B. miyamotoi. Of the 11 remaining mice without detectable B. miyamotoi DNA in their blood 10 d after infected larvae attached, 7 (64%) had evidence of spirochete exposure by serology 8 wk later. Because public health messaging for risk of exposure to Lyme disease spirochetes focuses on nymphal and female I. scapularis ticks, our finding that transovarially-infected larvae effectively transmit B. miyamotoi should lead to refined tick-bite prevention messages."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens are increasing their range and incidence in North America as a consequence of numerous factors including improvements in diagnostics and diagnosis, range expansion of primary vectors, changes in human behavior, and an increasing understanding of the diversity of species of pathogens that cause human disease. Public health agencies have access to human incidence data on notifiable diseases e.g., Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and often local pathogen prevalence in vector populations. However, data on exposure to vectors and pathogens can be difficult to determine e.g., if disease does not occur. We report on an investigation of exposure to ticks and tick-borne bacteria, conducted at a national scale, using citizen science participation. 16,080 ticks were submitted between January 2016 and August 2017, and screened for B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti. These data corroborate entomologic investigations of tick distributions in North America, but also identify patterns of local disease risk and tick contact with humans throughout the year in numerous species of ticks and associated pathogens."

We report a case of tick-borne relapsing fever in a 54 year-old man in Morocco with a history of hiking, who was hospitalized for an isolated fever. On admission, the clinical examination showed no specific signs. The laboratory assessment showed inflammatory syndrome with disturbance of the liver function. The blood culture was sterile. Serology was negative for HIV and Lyme disease, as were all the rest of the paraclinical tests. The patient's course was marked by spontaneous resolution of the fever and then, seven days later, the onset of a new episode of fever. Malaria was suspected and a blood sample was sent to the parasitology department. The thick smear and blood smear stained with May-Grünwald Giemsa showed the presence of spirochetes. Tick-borne relapsing fever was diagnosed and the patient responded favorably to treatment by cycline drugs. This disease is poorly known and should be considered in cases of presence of intermittent fever without a specific clinical-laboratory picture, according to epidemiological context. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of spirochetes on thick smear and blood or cerebrospinal fluid smear stained with MGG."

This tick-borne disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which includes B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, the main species found in North America, and B. afzelii and B. garinii, which are primarily responsible for the disease in Eurasia. Currently, research on Lyme disease has focused mainly on B. burgdorferi while B. afzelii and B. garinii, which cause disease with distinctly different symptoms, are less studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate B. afzelii BO23 and B. garinii CIP 103362 as model organisms to study Eurasian Lyme disease. To begin our analyses, we sequenced, annotated the chromosomes of both species and compared them to B. burgdorferi strain B31. We also assayed shuttle vector, pBSV2, for transformation efficacy and demonstrated that these strains can be cultured on solid media. In addition, we characterized how physicochemical parameters (e.g., oxygen, osmolarity, oxidative stress) affect both growth and motility of the bacteria. Finally, we describe each strain's antibiotic susceptibility and accessed their ability to infect mice. In conclusion, B. afzelii BO23 was more practical for in vitro and in vivo studies than B. garinii CIP 103362."

The currently recommended approach for laboratory support of the diagnosis of Lyme disease is a standard two-tiered (STT) algorithm comprised of an enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) or immunofluorescence assay (IFA), followed by Western blotting (WB). The STT algorithm has low sensitivity in early infection, and there are drawbacks associated with the WB use in practice. Modified two-tiered (MTT) algorithms have been shown to improve the sensitivity of the testing in early disease while maintaining high specificity. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, A. Pegalajar-Jurado et al. (J Clin Microbiol 56:e01943-17, 2018, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.01943-17) report the results of their evaluation of the Liaison VlsE CLIA, the Captia B. burgdorferi IgG/IgM EIA, and the C6 B. burgdorferi (Lyme) EIA as MTT algorithms compared with results with the STT algorithm using the same tests as the first-tier test and the ViraStripe IgM and IgG WBs as the second-tier test. The results showed that all MTT algorithms had higher sensitivities than STT algorithms and were highly specific. These results showed that MTT approaches are a valid alternative to the currently recommended STT algorithm for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease, opening the door for the development of rapid diagnostics and point-of-care testing that can provide diagnostic information during the initial patient visit."

		"abstract": "Although Ixodes scapularis and other related tick species are considered prolific vectors for a number of important human diseases, many aspects of their biology, microbial interactions, and immunity are largely unknown; in particular, how these ancient vectors recognize invading pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi and influence their persistence. The analysis of the Ixodes genome and a limited set of transcriptomic data have established that ticks encode many components of classical immune pathways; yet at the same time, they lack many key orthologs of these recognition networks. Therefore, whether a given immune pathway is active in Ixodes ticks and how precisely they exert its microbicidal functions are only incompletely delineated. A few recent studies have suggested that classical pathways like the Janus Kinase/Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) as well as immunodeficiency (IMD) pathways are fully functional in I. scapularis, and upon challenge with microbes, generate potent microbicidal responses against diverse tick-borne pathogens including B. burgdorferi. These studies also highlight novel concepts of vector immunity that include both a direct and an indirect mode of recognition of pathogens, as well as the influence of the gut microbiome, which ultimately dictates the outcome of a robust microbicidal response. Further understanding of how Ixodes ticks recognize and suppress invading microbes like B. burgdorferi will enrich our fundamental knowledge of vector immunobiology, thereby contributing to the development of future interventions to better control the tick-borne pathogen."

The disease is most prevalent in forested areas endemic for Ixodes tick, which transmits the spirochete. Here, we describe a case of Lyme meningoencephalitis masquerading as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) which initially presented with urinary incontinence, gait instability, and neurological decline. Due to its non-specific symptoms and low incidence, Lyme meningoencephalitis causing NPH like syndrome poses a diagnostic conundrum for clinicians. Awareness of this disease entity is key for prompt diagnosis and treatment."

		"abstract": "Activation of the classical complement pathway occurs to varying degrees within strains of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, which contain a group of pathogenic spirochetes that cause tick-borne Lyme borreliosis, including the agent of Lyme disease in the United States, B. burgdorferi. Despite this information, details related to the control of B. burgdorferi by the classical pathway are not clear. To address this question, we infected C1qα-/- mice, which cannot assemble the C1 complex and thus fail to activate the classical pathway, with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. Using bioluminescent in vivo imaging, we found that C1qα-/- mice harbored more B. burgdorferi following 10 days of infection relative to their isogenic C57BL/6 parent. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that C1qα-/- mice harbored significantly more B. burgdorferi than parent mice did within lymph nodes, skin, heart, and joints. The increased B. burgdorferi load in C1qα-/- mice was observed at 21 and 28 days of infection, consistent with the classical pathway promoting complement-dependent, antibody-mediated killing following the development of a B. burgdorferi-specific humoral immune response. In addition, circulating borrelial-specific IgM was higher in C1qα-/- mice relative to their parent mouse strain and did not decrease at 21 and 28 days post-infection, indicating that IgG class switching was delayed in C1qα-/- mice. At day 28, both Borrelia-specific IgG1 and IgG3 levels were higher in infected C1qα-/- mice, but that these antibodies were not sufficient to control borrelial infection in the absence of the classical pathway. Furthermore, the lack of C1q also altered the balance of the Th1/Th2 response, as both circulating Th1 (MIP-1α, IL-2, IL-12, and TNFα), Th2 (IL-4, IL-10, and MCP-1), and Th17 (IL-17) cytokines were elevated in infected C1qα-/- mice. These data imply that C1q and the classical pathway play important roles in controlling borrelial infection via antibody and complement-dependent killing, as well as altering both antibody maturation processes and the T cell response following exposure to infectious B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The tick-borne pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi is responsible for approximately 300,000 Lyme disease (LD) cases per year in the United States. Recent increases in the number of LD cases, in addition to the spread of the tick vector and a lack of a vaccine, highlight an urgent need for designing and developing an efficacious LD vaccine. Identification of protective epitopes that could be used to develop a second-generation (subunit) vaccine is therefore imperative. Despite the antigenicity of several lipoproteins and integral outer membrane proteins (OMPs) on the B. burgdorferi surface, the spirochetes successfully evade antibodies primarily due to the VlsE-mediated antigenic variation. VlsE is thought to sterically block antibody access to protective epitopes of B. burgdorferi However, it is highly unlikely that VlsE shields the entire surface epitome. Thus, identification of subdominant epitope targets that induce protection when they are made dominant is necessary to generate an efficacious vaccine. Toward the identification, we repeatedly immunized immunocompetent mice with live-attenuated VlsE-deleted B. burgdorferi and then challenged the animals with the VlsE-expressing (host-adapted) wild type. Passive immunization and Western blotting data suggested that the protection of 50% of repeatedly immunized animals against the highly immune-evasive B. burgdorferi was antibody mediated. Comparison of serum antibody repertoires identified in protected and nonprotected animals permitted the identification of several putative epitopes significantly associated with the protection. Most linear putative epitopes were conserved between the main pathogenic Borrelia genospecies and found within known subdominant regions of OMPs. Currently, we are performing immunization studies to test whether the identified protection-associated epitopes are protective for mice."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most frequently reported zoonotic tick-borne disease worldwide, and the number of infected humans is increasing. Lyme disease (or Lyme borreliosis) is an affection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, sensu lato. Lyme disease is also reported as a variety of misleading clinical symptomatologies. Infected patient's blood serology is the most currently test used for its diagnosis. However, serology has a low sensitivity, which ranges from 34% to 70%. Thus, there are numerous subsequent false-negative diagnoses despite an active clinical infection profile. Therefore, alternative and more sensitive techniques are required to detect the antigens or nucleic acids of Borrelia. Actually, the most appropriate methodological approach seems to be the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). However, PCR will detect the only \"visible\" part available of the targeted DNA presence in the blood of the infected patients. Consequently PCR alone will not be conclusive enough to reach the final diagnosis. Considering the ability of Borrelia to invade host cells, we hypothesize that a selective lysis of all blood cells should improve the diagnostic sensitivity of the detection of Borrelia by PCR in whole blood, and subsequently reduce the false-negative diagnostic rate, thus improving the patient's diagnosis and therapeutic management."

Two serum samples from one patient showed neutralizing antibodies against TBE virus. The patient with severe and progressive encephalitis had a history of tick bite in Hokkaido in 2012.

All assays were optimized to the same thermocycling condition and had a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction. The assays remained sensitive when used to test canine and equine blood DNA samples spiked with known amounts of synthetic DNA (gBlock) control template. The assays were specific, as evidenced by lack of cross reaction to non-target gBlock or other pathogens commonly tested in veterinary diagnostic labs. With appropriate Ct cutoff values for positive samples and negative controls and the melting temperature (TM) ranges established in the present study, the QPCR panel is suitable for accurate, convenient and rapid screening and confirmation of tick-borne pathogens in animals."

The growth of international tourism including in rural and remote places increasingly exposes travelers to tick bite. Our aim was to review the main tick-borne infectious diseases reported in travelers in the past 5 years. In recent years, tick-borne bacterial diseases have emerged in travelers including spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses, borrelioses, and diseases caused by bacteria of the Anaplasmataceae family. African tick-bite fever, due to Rickettsia africae, is the most frequent agent reported in travelers returned from Sub-Saharan areas. Other SFG agents are increasingly reported in travelers, and clinicians should be aware of them. Lyme disease can be misdiagnosed in Southern countries. Organisms causing tick-borne relapsing fever are neglected pathogens worldwide, and reports in travelers have allowed the description of new species. Infections due to Anaplasmataceae bacteria are more rarely described in travelers, but a new species of Neoehrlichia has recently been detected in a traveler. The treatment of these infections relies on doxycycline, and travelers should be informed before the trip about prevention measures against tick bites."

		"abstract": "Emergence of tick-borne diseases is impacting humans and livestock across the Northern Hemisphere. There are, however, large regional variations in number of cases of tick-borne diseases. Some areas have surprisingly few cases of disease compared to other regions. The aim here is to provide a first step towards a better understanding of such contrasting regional patterns of disease emergences at the northern distribution range of Ixodes ricinus in Europe. We compare disease incidence, vector abundance and pathogen prevalence in eastern and western Norway differing in the number of tick-borne disease cases. First, we analysed the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in humans, tick-borne fever (anaplasmosis) in sheep and anaplasmosis and babesiosis in cattle to verify if incidence differed. Secondly, we analysed extensive field data on questing tick density, pathogen prevalence, as well as the broad spatial pattern of human and livestock distribution as it may relate to tick exposure. The incidences of all diseases were lower in eastern, compared to western, Norway, but this was most marked for the livestock diseases. While the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) in ticks was similar in the two regions, the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum was markedly lower in eastern, compared to western, Norway. We found overall a lower abundance of questing nymphs in the east. In the east, there were cases of babesiosis in cattle where anaplasmosis was absent, suggesting absence of the pathogen rather than differences in exposure to ticks as part of the explanation for the much lower incidence of anaplasmosis in eastern Norway. Many factors contribute to different disease incidence across ecosystems. We found that regional variation in tick-borne disease incidence may be partly linked to vector abundance and pathogen prevalence, but differently for human and livestock diseases. Further studies are needed to determine if there is also regional variation in specific genospecies and strain frequencies differing in pathogenicity."

In HIV-positive patients in whom a serological diagnostics is complicated due to reduced positive predictive value, a method where the microorganism is detected directly is of great value. Therefore, we performed a molecular study to ascertain the prevalence and incidence of tick-borne infections in HIV-infected persons in Poland, an endemic area for Ixodes ricinus ticks. Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood of tested patients. Detection of tick-borne pathogens was performed by amplification and sequencing of different loci. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses of obtained nucleotide sequences were performed. Serum samples were analyzed for antibodies against tick-borne pathogens by using commercial tests in all patients. Among 148 studied blood samples from HIV-infected patients, two cases (1.4%) of infection with tick-borne pathogen were reported. No symptoms of tick-borne infection were observed in these cases. In one case a patient was infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum - the agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) and in the other with Borrelia garinii. Our study revealed the first case of HIV positive patient infected with A. phagocytophilum. Asymptomatic tick-borne infection can occur in HIV-positive patients. The detailed history of tick bites, especially in endemic tick areas, should be considered as part of anamnesis in routine clinical care of HIV-positive patients."

Furthermore, a specific Reverse Line Blot (RLB) protocol for detection of B. miyamotoi and simultaneous differentiation of B. burgdorferi (s.l.) geno-species was established. Overall, 24.0% (505/2100) of ticks collected in the city of Hanover were infected with Borrelia. In detail, 35.4% (203/573) of adult ticks [38.5% females (111/288) and 32.3% males (92/285)] and 19.8% nymphs (302/1527) were infected, representing consistent infection rates over the 10-year monitoring period. Geno-species differentiation using RLB determined B. miyamotoi in 8.9% (45/505) of positive ticks. Furthermore, a significant decrease in B. afzelii and B. spielmanii infection rates from 2010 to 2015 was observed. Co-infections with Rickettsia spp. and A. phagocytophilum increased between 2010 and 2015 (7.3 vs 10.9% and 0.3 vs 1.1%, respectively). Long-term monitoring is an essential part of public health risk assessment to capture data on pathogen occurrence over time. Such data will reveal shifts in pathogen geno-species distribution and help to answer the question whether or not climate change influences tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector of tick-borne zoonotic bacteria. It transmits spirochaetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. Although spatial differences in the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens have been intensively studied, seasonal (within-year) fluctuations in the prevalence of these pathogens within sites are often overlooked. We analyzed the occurrence and seasonal dynamics of Ixodes ricinus in an urban forest in Bratislava, Slovakia. Furthemore, we examined temporal trends in the community structure of B. burgdorferi s.l., A. phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. in questing and bird-feeding ticks. The total prevalence for B. burgdorferi s.l. in questing I. ricinus was 6.8%, involving six genospecies with the dominance of bird-associated B. garinii and B. valaisiana.A. phagocytophilum, R. helvetica and R. monacensis occurred in 5.9%, 5.0% and 0.2% of questing ticks, respectively. In total, 12.5% and 4.4% of bird-feeding I. ricinus ticks carried B. burgdorferi s.l. and R. helvetica. The total prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in our study site was two times lower than the mean prevalence for Europe. In contrast, A. phagocytophilum prevalence was significantly higher compared to those in other habitats of Slovakia. Our results imply that tick propagation and the transmission, suppression and seasonal dynamics of tick-borne pathogens at the study site were primarily shaped by abundance and temporal population fluctuations in ruminant and bird hosts."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne infections have been increasing steadily over the years, with co-infections with Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti/divergens emerging as a serious health problem. B. burgdorferi is a spirochetal bacterium that causes Lyme disease while protozoan pathogens belonging to Babesia species are responsible for babesiosis. Currently used serological tests do not always detect acute Lyme disease or babesiosis, and fail to differentiate cured patients from those who get re-infected. This is a major problem for proper diagnosis particularly in regions endemic for tick-borne diseases. Microscopy based evaluation of babesiosis is confirmatory but is labor intensive and insensitive such that many asymptomatic patients remain undetected and donate blood resulting in transfusion transmitted babesiosis. We conducted multiplex qPCR for simultaneous diagnosis of active Lyme disease and babesiosis in 192 blood samples collected from a region endemic for both diseases. We document qPCR results obtained from testing of each sample three times to detect infection with each pathogen separately or together. Results for Lyme disease by qPCR were also compared with serological tests currently used for Lyme disease when available. Considering at least two out of three test results for consistency, 18.2% of patients tested positive for Lyme disease, 18.7% for co-infection with B. burgdorferi and B. microti and 6.3% showed only babesiosis. With an 80% sensitivity for detection of Lyme disease, and ability to detect co-infection with B. microti, multiplex qPCR can be employed for diagnosis of these diseases to start appropriate treatment in a timely manner."

		"abstract": "Changes to the community ecology of hosts for zoonotic pathogens, particularly rodents, are likely to influence the emergence and prevalence of zoonotic diseases worldwide. However, the complex interactions between abiotic factors, pathogens, vectors, hosts, and both food resources and predators of hosts are difficult to disentangle. Here we (1) use 19 yr of data from six large field plots in southeastern New York to compare the effects of hypothesized drivers of interannual variation in Lyme disease risk, including the abundance of acorns, rodents, and deer, as well as a series of climate variables; and (2) employ landscape epidemiology to explore how variation in predator community structure and forest cover influences spatial variation in the infection prevalence of ticks for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and two other important tick-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Acorn-driven increases in the abundance of mice were correlated with a lagged increase in the abundance of questing nymph-stage Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Lyme disease bacteria. Abundance of white-tailed deer 2 yr prior also correlated with increased density of infected nymphal ticks, although the effect was weak. Density of rodents in the current year was a strong negative predictor of nymph density, apparently because high current abundance of these hosts can remove nymphs from the host-seeking population. Warm, dry spring or winter weather was associated with reduced density of infected nymphs. At the landscape scale, the presence of functionally diverse predator communities or of bobcats, the only obligate carnivore, was associated with reduced infection prevalence of I. scapularis nymphs with all three zoonotic pathogens. In the case of Lyme disease, infection prevalence increased where coyotes were present but smaller predators were displaced or otherwise absent. For all pathogens, infection prevalence was lowest when forest cover within a 1 km radius was high. Taken together, our results suggest that a food web perspective including bottom-up and top-down forcing is needed to understand drivers of tick-borne disease risk, a result that may also apply to other rodent-borne zoonoses. Prevention of exposure based on ecological indicators of heightened risk should help protect public health."

		"abstract": "Most emerging infectious diseases of humans are transmitted to humans from other animals. The transmission of these \"zoonotic\" pathogens is affected by the abundance and behavior of their wildlife hosts. However, the effects of infection with zoonotic pathogens on behavior of wildlife hosts, particularly those that might propagate through ecological communities, are not well understood. Borrelia burgdorferi is a bacterium that causes Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the USA and Europe. In its North American range, the pathogen is most frequently transmitted among hosts through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). Using sham and true vaccines, we experimentally manipulated infection load with this zoonotic pathogen in its most competent wildlife reservoir host, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus, and quantified the effects of infection on mouse foraging behavior, as well as levels of mouse infestation with ticks. Mice treated with the true vaccine had 20% fewer larval blacklegged ticks infesting them compared to mice treated with the sham vaccine, a significant difference. We observed a nonsignificant trend for mice treated with the true vaccine to be more likely to visit experimental foraging trays (20%-30% effect size) and to prey on gypsy moth pupae (5%-20% effect size) compared to mice treated with the sham vaccine. We observed no difference between mice on true- versus sham-vaccinated grids in risk-averse foraging. Infection with this zoonotic pathogen appears to elicit behavioral changes that might reduce self-grooming, but other behaviors were affected subtly or not at all. High titers of B. burgdorferi in mice could elicit a self-reinforcing feedback loop in which reduced grooming increases tick burdens and hence exposure to tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "An increasing number of studies have investigated the consequences of biodiversity loss for the occurrence of vector-borne diseases such as Lyme borreliosis, the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. As host species differ in their ability to transmit the Lyme borreliosis bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. to ticks, increased host diversity can decrease disease prevalence by increasing the proportion of dilution hosts, host species that transmit pathogens less efficiently. Previous research shows that Lyme borreliosis risk differs between forest types and suggests that a higher diversity of host species might dilute the contribution of small rodents to infect ticks with B. afzelii, a common Borrelia genospecies. However, empirical evidence for a dilution effect in Europe is largely lacking. We tested the dilution effect hypothesis in 19 Belgian forest stands of different forest types along a diversity gradient. We used empirical data and a Bayesian belief network to investigate the impact of the proportion of dilution hosts on the density of ticks infected with B. afzelii, and identified the key drivers determining the density of infected ticks, which is a measure of human infection risk. Densities of ticks and B. afzelii infection prevalence differed between forest types, but the model indicated that the density of infected ticks is hardly affected by dilution. The most important variables explaining variability in disease risk were related to the density of ticks. Combining empirical data with a model-based approach supported decision making to reduce tick-borne disease risk. We found a low probability of a dilution effect for Lyme borreliosis in a north-western European context. We emphasize that under these circumstances, Lyme borreliosis prevention should rather aim at reducing tick-human contact rate instead of attempting to increase the proportion of dilution hosts."

We assessed the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antibodies and investigated, using an integrated landscape approach, the individual and environmental factors associated with the seroprevalence of Bb in Belgian forestry workers, a high-risk group in Belgium. A group of 310 Belgian forest workers was examined to assess the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies. Using principal component analysis and binary logistic regression, the joint effects of individual characteristics and environmental characteristics were examined. Sixty-seven of the 310 workers were seropositive for Lyme disease (LD), leading to a seroprevalence of 21.6%. The seroprevalence was higher among forest workers visiting forests more frequently (P = 0.003) or who reported over 100 tick bites (P-value < 0.001). The intensity of tick bites and the use of protection measures against tick bites have a positive impact on LD seroprevalence while the quantity of shadow from trees at ground level had a negative one. This study showed that forest workers are a population at risk for LD and, by extension, at risk for various tick-borne diseases. In addition to the role of the environment, our results also showed the importance of considering exposure when predicting the risk of infection by Bb."

		"abstract": "The rapid geographical spread of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) worldwide has recently provoked significant concerns amongst public health authorities. Tick-borne pathogens are maintained in enzootic cycles involving ticks and wild animal hosts, with epizootic spread to other mammals, including livestock and humans. Despite the increasing public health concern, current TBD diagnostic tests and treatments are inadequate, and predictive models of future risks posed by TBDs are limited by the heterogeneity of environmental, vector, and host factors, even in neighboring regions. In recent years, infections resulting in severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), Japanese spotted fever, and the scrub typhus pathogens have been reported frequently in addition to traditional TBDs in Japan. The Japanese archipelago is extremely elongated from north to south and its climate varies considerably, creating remarkable regional differences in tick species. The importance of continuous surveillance of TBDs has been growing in terms of geopathology - studies dealing with the relationships between geographic factors and the causes of specific diseases - in Japan and neighboring areas among eastern Asian countries, including China and Korea. In this review, we summarize detailed information regarding the history and epidemic status of human TBDs in Japan."

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of tick-borne pathogens of medical importance in questing ticks collected from five recreationally used islands along the Norwegian coastline. Furthermore, since coinfection may affect the disease severity, this study aimed to determine the extent of coinfection in individual ticks or co-localization of tick-borne pathogens. In all, 4158 questing Ixodes ricinus ticks were analyzed. For detection of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), nymphs (3690) were analyzed in pools of ten. To detect Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, 468 nymphs were analyzed individually. A total of five nymph pools was infected with TBEV, giving an overall prevalence of 0.14%. In the individually analyzed ticks, B. burgdorferi s. l. (15.6%), Candidatus N. mikurensis (11%), A. phagocytophilum (1.4%) and B. miyamotoi (0.9%) were detected. Coinfection was found in 3.3% of the ticks, and the only dual infection observed was with B. afzelii and Candidatus N. mikurensis. This association was significantly higher than what would occur by random chance."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever still remains a neglected disease and little is known on its reservoir, tick vector and physiopathology in the vertebrate host. The disease occurs in temperate as well as tropical countries. Relapsing fever borreliae are spirochaetes, members of the Borreliaceae family which also contain Lyme disease spirochaetes. They are mainly transmitted by Ornithodoros soft ticks, but some species are vectored by ixodid ticks. Traditionally a Borrelia species is associated with a specific vector in a particular geographical area. However, new species are regularly described, and taxonomical uncertainties deserve further investigations to better understand Borrelia vector/host adaptation. The medical importance of Borrelia miyamotoi, transmitted by Ixodes spp., has recently spawned new interest in this bacterial group. In this review, recent data on tick-host-pathogen interactions for tick-borne relapsing fevers is presented, with special focus on B. miyamotoi."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is an emerging relapsing fever (RF) Borrelia species that is reported to cause human disease in regions in which Lyme borreliosis is endemic. We recently showed that B. miyamotoi tick isolates are resistant to amoxicillin in vitro; however, clinical isolates have not been studied. Therefore, our aim was to show the antimicrobial susceptibility of recently obtained clinical isolates of B. miyamotoi A dilution series of various antibiotics was made in modified Kelly-Pettenkofer medium with 10% fetal calf serum. The susceptibilities of different B. miyamotoi clinical, B. miyamotoi tick, RF Borrelia, and Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato isolates were tested by measuring MICs through colorimetric changes and by counting motile spirochetes by dark-field microscopy after 72 h of incubation. The ceftriaxone and azithromycin MIC ranges of the six B. miyamotoi clinical isolates tested were 0.03 to 0.06 mg/liter and 0.0016 to 0.0032 mg/liter, respectively. These values are similar to MICs for RF Borrelia strains and B. miyamotoi tick isolates. All tested RF Borrelia strains were susceptible to doxycycline (microscopic MIC range, 0.0625 to 0.25 mg/liter). In contrast to the MICs of the tested B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains and in line with our previous findings, the amoxicillin MICs (range, 8 to 32 mg/liter) of all RF Borrelia strains, including B. miyamotoi clinical isolates, were above the clinical breakpoint for resistance (≤4 mg/liter). Clinical isolates of B. miyamotoi are highly susceptible to doxycycline, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone in vitro Interestingly, as described previously for tick isolates, amoxicillin shows poor in vitro activity against B. miyamotoi clinical isolates."

		"abstract": "The life cycle of spirochetes of the genus Borrelia includes complex networks of vertebrates and ticks. The tripartite association of Borrelia-vertebrate-tick has proved ecologically successful for these bacteria, which have become some of the most prominent tick-borne pathogens in the northern hemisphere. To keep evolutionary pace with its double-host life history, Borrelia must adapt to the evolutionary pressures exerted by both sets of hosts. In this review, we attempt to reconcile functional, phylogenetic, and ecological perspectives to propose a coherent scenario of Borrelia evolution. Available empirical information supports that the association of Borrelia with ticks is very old. The major split between the tick families Argasidae-Ixodidae (dated some 230-290 Mya) resulted in most relapsing fever (Rf) species being restricted to Argasidae and few associated with Ixodidae. A further key event produced the diversification of the Lyme borreliosis (Lb) species: the radiation of ticks of the genus Ixodes from the primitive stock of Ixodidae (around 217 Mya). The ecological interactions of Borrelia demonstrate that Argasidae-transmitted Rf species remain restricted to small niches of one tick species and few vertebrates. The evolutionary pressures on this group are consequently low, and speciation processes seem to be driven by geographical isolation. In contrast to Rf, Lb species circulate in nested networks of dozens of tick species and hundreds of vertebrate species. This greater variety confers a remarkably variable pool of evolutionary pressures, resulting in large speciation of the Lb group, where different species adapt to circulate through different groups of vertebrates. Available data, based on ospA and multilocus sequence typing (including eight concatenated in-house genes) phylogenetic trees, suggest that ticks could constitute a secondary bottleneck that contributes to Lb specialization. Both sets of adaptive pressures contribute to the resilience of highly adaptable meta-populations of bacteria."

		"abstract": "The rRNA genes of Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi are unusually organized; the spirochete has a single 16S rRNA gene that is more than 3 kb from a tandem pair of 23S-5S rRNA operons. We generated an rnc null mutant in B. burgdorferi that exhibits a pleiotropic phenotype, including decreased growth rate and increased cell length. Here, we demonstrate that endoribonuclease III (RNase III) is, as expected, involved in processing the 23S rRNA in B. burgdorferi The 5' and 3' ends of the three rRNAs were determined in the wild type and rncBb mutants; the results suggest that RNase III in B. burgdorferi is required for the full maturation of the 23S rRNA but not for the 5S rRNA nor, curiously, for the 16S rRNA.IMPORTANCE Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne zoonosis in the Northern Hemisphere, is caused by the bacterium Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi, a member of the deeply branching spirochete phylum. B. burgdorferi carries a limited suite of ribonucleases, enzymes that cleave RNA during processing and degradation. Several ribonucleases, including RNase III, are involved in the production of ribosomes, which catalyze translation and are a major target of antibiotics. This is the first study to dissect the role of an RNase in any spirochete. We demonstrate that an RNase III mutant is viable but has altered processing of rRNA."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is widely reported in the USA, Central Europe, South East Asia and Latin America. Until recently, no scientific report regarding Lyme disease in Nepal had been published. A 32-year-old, previously healthy female visited the hospital with a history of joint pains, fatigue, neck stiffness, tingling sensation and headache. She was initially treated for typhoid fever, brucellosis and malaria, but did not show significant improvement. Doxycycline was prescribed empirically for 3 weeks for the treatment of suspected tick-borne illness. A two-tiered immunoglobulin laboratory testing confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi. She developed post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome after completion of antibiotic therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Lyme disease in Nepal and probably the first documented case of post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome in Asia. Lyme disease might have been overlooked in Nepal and, therefore, patients having clinical signs and symptoms similar to Lyme disease should not be disregarded in differential diagnosis."

Since 2015 a multidisciplinary group has been established in Sacco Hospital for the management of the patients affected by Lyme disease (LD). A retrospective evaluation (2015-2017) was performed for LD in non-endemic areas. Retrospective analysis of all 1000 samples for 800 patients screened for LD antibodies at the Sacco Hospital in 3 years (2015-2017). Clinical and epidemiological data were collected and compared with the serological results. Among the 800 patients screened, 134 of them were diagnosed with borreliosis during 2015 (37 cases), 2016 (31 cases) and 2017 (66 cases). Localized LD was diagnosed 100 out of 134 cases (69%): in most of them (N.=63) erythema migrans has been documented; in 37 out of 100 it was not possible to detect it. In only three cases, patients complained of different clinical symptoms such as headache, arm and facial pain respectively. 23 out of 134 cases (16%) showed a persistence of serological positivity and symptoms with osteomuscular involvement and fatigue, despite the therapy (late LD). In that same study 11 out of 134 patients (7%) received a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. Our data reported a high percentage of LD infection (19%) in a non-endemic area. The definition of a Multidisciplinary Working Group and a clinical care pathway allowed a better clinical management of LD cases treated in Sacco Hospital, Milan."

Retrospective LD chart reviews analyzed aggressiveness, compared 50 homicidal with 50 non-homicidal patients, and analyzed homicides. Most aggression with LD was impulsive, sometimes provoked by intrusive symptoms, sensory stimulation or frustration and was invariably bizarre and senseless. About 9.6% of LD patients were homicidal with the average diagnosis delay of 9 years. Postinfection findings associated with homicidality that separated from the non-homicidal group within the 95% confidence interval included suicidality, sudden abrupt mood swings, explosive anger, paranoia, anhedonia, hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, disinhibition, nightmares, depersonalization, intrusive aggressive images, dissociative episodes, derealization, intrusive sexual images, marital/family problems, legal problems, substance abuse, depression, panic disorder, memory impairments, neuropathy, cranial nerve symptoms, and decreased libido. Seven LD homicides included predatory aggression, poor impulse control, and psychosis. Some patients have selective hyperacusis to mouth sounds, which I propose may be the result of brain dysfunction causing a disinhibition of a primitive fear of oral predation. LD and the immune, biochemical, neurotransmitter, and the neural circuit reactions to it can cause impairments associated with violence. Many LD patients have no aggressiveness tendencies or only mild degrees of low frustration tolerance and irritability and pose no danger; however, a lesser number experience explosive anger, a lesser number experience homicidal thoughts and impulses, and much lesser number commit homicides. Since such large numbers are affected by LD, this small percent can be highly significant. Much of the violence associated with LD can be avoided with better prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of LD."

It is important to understand the most typical circumstances in which people might become infected with<i> Borrelia burgdorferi</i>. This knowledge will help to prepare health education programmes aimed at the prevention of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases. The aim of the study was to determine the percentage of ticks infected with <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> sensu lato, depending on the circumstances of getting bitten. The research material consisted of ticks acquired from people who had been bitten, and questionnaires completed by these people. 510 ticks were acquired from 257 females and 253 males. Following delivery of a tick for testing, the stage of its development was determined and a molecular assay of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> DNA performed. A positive result of the nested-PCR test was obtained in 78 ticks, which represents 15.30% of all ticks. The infected ticks were collected from male (41 ticks - 52.56%) and female subjects (37 ticks - 47.44%). The biggest number of infected ticks were collected in autumn (54 ticks - 69.23%) and from people who had been into forests (44 ticks - 56.41%). Among the people from whom the infected ticks were acquired, the dominating group included persons over 16 years of age (53 persons - 67.95%) and children aged 0-5 years (16 persons - 20.51%). One in four infected ticks were acquired from the southwestern (20 ticks - 25.64%) and eastern regions of Poland (21 ticks - 26.92%). Infestation of ticks infected with Lyme disease spirochete in this study proved to be variable and depend on the season, the area of tick attack and the region in Poland. The results of the study clearly show that ticks infected with <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> inhabit all regions of Poland. The results are consistent with National Institute of Hygiene data which indicates that Lyme disease cases are recorded in all regions of Poland."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is one of the most common tick-borne diseases caused by several Borrelia species of spirochetes. Ixodes scapularis is responsible for the transmission of LD in the northeastern United States. The rate of infection varies with the duration of tick attachment to the host; however, this information may be unknown. In skin biopsies, it is often difficult to identify spirochetes. Testing of ticks is not routinely performed. Treatment is established by clinical presentation. To test paraffin-embedded I. scapularis ticks for Borrelia by different methods. We examined 20 paraffin-embedded ticks by silver stain, immunohistochemical (IHC) and direct immunofluorescent (DIF) methods and compared the percentage of positivity with DIF results from the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. The results were similar by DIF, which proved to be the most sensitive method, followed by the silver stain and IHC. We found that the identification of spirochetes in paraffin-embedded ticks was less difficult than in tissue with a comparable turnaround time to that of a routine biopsy. Timely identification of Borrelia in ticks may influence the clinical management of the patients."

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND Babesiosis is an emerging, tick-borne zoonosis caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Babesia. Babesia microti is the main pathogen causing human disease and is endemic in the northeastern and upper midwestern parts of the USA. Severity of infection ranges from mild, self-limited, febrile viral-like illness accompanied by nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening infection complicated by severe hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal or/and hepatic failure. Splenic rupture (SR) is a very rare but life-threatening complication of severe B. microti infection. CASE REPORT A 79-year-old female farmer from Wisconsin, USA was admitted during summer with hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous splenic rupture. She was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and underwent emergent splenectomy. Postoperatively, she recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 4. However, she was re-admitted on postoperative day 10 for febrile hemolytic anemia. Further exposure history was obtained and was significant for multiple tick bites 8 weeks preceding the index hospitalization. She was promptly diagnosed with babesiosis and Lyme disease co-infection. She responded favorably to 10 days of azithromycin and atovaquone and 21 days of oral doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS Despite its rare occurrence, SR due to B. microti infection is a dreaded complication that can rapidly progress to hemorrhagic shock and death. In contrast to other complications of babesiosis, SR is not correlated with parasite burden or immune status of the affected host. Babesiosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in patients from endemic areas presenting with atraumatic splenic rupture."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is a bacterial infection transmitted by the black-legged tick (Ixodes scapularis) in eastern North America. It is an emerging disease in Canada due to the expanding range of its tick vector. Environmental risk maps for LD, based on the distribution of the black-legged tick, have focused on coarse determinants such as climate. However, climatic factors vary little within individual health units, the level at which local public health decision-making takes place. We hypothesize that high-resolution environmental data and routinely collected passive surveillance data can be used to develop valid models for tick occurrence and provide insight into ecological processes affecting tick presence at fine scales. We used a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to build a habitat suitability model for I. scapularis in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada using georeferenced occurrence points from passive surveillance data collected between 2013 and 2016 and high-resolution land cover and elevation data. We evaluated our model using an independent tick presence/absence dataset collected through active surveillance at 17 field sites during the summer of 2017. Our model showed a good ability to discriminate positive sites from negative sites for tick presence (AUC = 0.878 ± 0.019, classification accuracy = 0.835 ± 0.020). Heavily forested suburban and rural areas in the west and southwest of Ottawa had higher predicted suitability than the more agricultural eastern areas. This study demonstrates the value of passive surveillance data to model local-scale environmental risk for the tick vector of LD at sites of interest to public health. Given the rising incidence of LD and other emerging vector-borne diseases in Canada, our findings support the ongoing collection of these data and collaboration with researchers to provide a timely and accurate portrait of evolving public health risk."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete transmitted by several ixodid tick species. It causes a relapsing fever in humans and is currently considered as an emerging pathogen. In Europe, B. miyamotoi seems to occur at low prevalence in Ixodes ricinus ticks but has a wide distribution. Here we report the first detection of B. miyamotoi in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in two independent studies conducted in 2016 in the north-eastern and north-western Alps, Italy. Three out of 405 nymphs (0.74%) tested positive for Borrelia miyamotoi. In particular, B. miyamotoi was found in 2/365 nymphs in the western and in 1/40 nymphs in the eastern alpine area. These are the first findings of B. miyamotoi in Italy. Exposure to B. miyamotoi and risk of human infection may occur through tick bites in northern Italy. Relapsing fever caused by Borrelia miyamotoi has not yet been reported in Italy, but misdiagnoses with tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis or other relapsing fever can occur. Our findings suggest that B. miyamotoi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients originating from Lyme borreliosis endemic regions. The distribution of this pathogen and its relevance to public health need further investigation."

Serodiagnosis by measuring antibodies against glycerophosphodiester-phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) has been performed experimentally but has not been extensively clinically validated. Because we had previously shown the differential expression of antigenic variable major proteins (Vmps) in B. miyamotoi, our aim was to study antibody responses against GlpQ and Vmps in PCR-proven BMD patients and controls. We assessed seroreactivity against GlpQ and four Vmps in a well-described, longitudinal cohort of sera from BMD patients (n=182), healthy blood donors (n=136) and controls (n=68). All samples were tested by ELISA and positive sera were tested by western blot, and antibody dynamics and diagnostic value were assessed. IgM antibodies against GlpQ and Vmps peaked between 11 and 20 days, and IgG between 21 and 50 days, after disease onset. Various combinations of GlpQ and Vmps increased sensitivity and/or specificity compared to single antigens. Notably, the GlpQ or variable large protein (Vlp)-15/16 combination yielded a sensitivity of 94.7% (95% CI: 75.4-99.7) 11-20 days after disease onset and a specificity of 96.6% (92.7-98.4) for IgM. A specificity of 100% (97.8-100) for IgM, and 98.3% for IgG (95.2-100), was found when positivity was defined as reactivity to GlpQ and any Vmp, with maximum sensitivities of 79% (56.7-91.5) for IgM and 86.7% (62.1-97.6) for IgG. We clearly demonstrate here the diagnostic potential of these seromarkers. Our findings will facilitate future epidemiological and clinical studies on BMD and lead to the development of a serologic test to be used in clinical practice."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) and other Ixodes ricinus-borne diseases (TBDs) are diseases that emerge from interactions of humans and domestic animals with infected ticks in nature. Nature, environmental and health policies at (inter)national and local levels affect the risk, disease burden and costs of TBDs. Knowledge on ticks, their pathogens and the diseases they cause have been increasing, and resulted in the discovery of a diversity of control options, which often are not highly effective on their own. Control strategies involving concerted actions from human and animal health sectors as well as from nature managers have not been formulated, let alone implemented. Control of TBDs asks for a \"health in all policies\" approach, both at the (inter)national level, but also at local levels. For example, wildlife protection and creating urban green spaces are important for animal and human well-being, but may increase the risk of TBDs. In contrast, culling or fencing out deer decreases the risk for TBDs under specific conditions, but may have adverse effects on biodiversity or may be societally unacceptable. Therefore, in the end, nature and health workers together must carry out tailor-made control options for the control of TBDs for humans and animals, with minimal effects on the environment. In that regard, multidisciplinary approaches in environmental, but also medical settings are needed. To facilitate this, communication and collaboration between experts from different fields, which may include patient representatives, should be promoted."

Block randomization was processed in blocks of six. Patients were assigned to receive one of three antibiotic treatments for 14 days: phenoxymethylpenicillin (PCV), amoxicillin, or doxycycline. The primary outcome was the duration of EM in days in the three treatment groups. Patients kept a diary for the 14 days of treatment, in which they registered concomitant symptoms and side effects. The patients consulted their GP after 14 days of treatment and had a 1-year follow-up to monitor any development of disseminated Lyme borreliosis (LB). EMs with a duration of more than 14 days were followed until resolution. ClinicalTrials.govNCT01368341 and EU Clinical Trials Register 2010-023747-15. One hundred and eighty eight patients (PCV: n = 56, amoxicillin: n = 64, doxycycline: n = 68) were included by 44 Norwegian general practitioners (GPs) from June 2011 to November 2013. Follow-up was completed by December 2014. The median duration of EM was altogether 14 days (range 3-293). For the PCV group median duration was 14 days (range 5-91), for amoxicillin 13 days (range 4-179) and for doxycycline 14 days (range 3-293). The duration of EM did not differ significantly between the three antibiotic groups (p 0.277). None of the patients developed disseminated LB within the 1-year follow-up. We did not find 14 days of PCV, doxycycline, and amoxicillin treatments to differ in effectiveness or safety in the treatment of clinically diagnosed EM in primary care."

		"abstract": "The geographical distribution of Ixodes scapularis and Amblyomma maculatum ticks is poorly understood in Kentucky. We conducted a convenience survey of wildlife species (white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), elk (Cervus canadensis) and black bears (Ursus americanus)) for ticks from October 2015 to January 2017. We detected four tick species including Amblyomma americanum, Dermacentor albipictus, I. scapularis and A. maculatum. Although the former two tick species were previously known to be widely distributed in Kentucky, we also found that I. scapularis and A. maculatum were also widespread. Because of the limited data available for pathogens from I. scapularis and A. maculatum, we tested them for Borrelia and Rickettsia spp. by polymerase chain reaction assays. Prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Rickettsia parkeri were 11% and 3%, respectively. These data indicate that public health measures are important to prevent tick-borne diseases in Kentucky."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America and Europe, and on-going surveillance is required to monitor the spread of the tick vectors as their populations expand under the influence of climate change. Active surveillance involves teams of researchers collecting ticks from field locations with the potential to be sites of establishing tick populations. This process is labor- and time-intensive, limiting the number of sites monitored and the frequency of monitoring. Citizen science initiatives are ideally suited to address this logistical problem and generate high-density and complex data from sites of community importance. In 2014, the same region was monitored by academic researchers, public health workers, and citizen scientists, allowing a comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each type of surveillance effort. Four community members persisted with tick collections over several years, collectively recovering several hundred ticks. Although deviations from standard surveillance protocols and the choice of tick surveillance sites makes the incorporation of community-generated data into conventional surveillance analyses more complex, this citizen science data remains useful in providing high-density longitudinal tick surveillance of a small area in which detailed ecological observations can be made. Most importantly, partnership between community members and researchers has proven a powerful tool in educating communities about of the risk of tick-vectored diseases and in encouraging tick bite prevention."

		"abstract": "The emergence of the vector Ixodes scapularis in Ontario, Canada poses a significant public health risk. Both passive and active surveillance approaches have been employed by public health professionals (i.e., government employees) to monitor for the range expansion of this tick. Field surveillance using drag sampling for questing ticks is a recognized and effective method to identify reproducing tick populations. The degree of effort (i.e., number of visits per site) can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance, but increased effort conflicts with the cost to public health for field surveillance. Here we developed an indicator to determine the likelihood of I. scapularis establishment based on field sampling results. Field data from two established populations of I. scapularis in Ontario were incorporated with previous analyses of surveillance data to create the indicator, which is in the form of a scoring system. The life stage(s) collected, overall abundance and past surveillance findings from a site are all considered and a level is assigned for the likelihood of I. scapularis establishment based on current field sampling results. The likelihood levels are non-zero (i.e., no I. scapularis detected, but risk still present due to adventitious ticks), low, medium or high, and recommendations for future surveillance and public health measures are provided. The indicator was validated against field sampling results from five other established sites in the province and correctly categorized all five areas as high likelihood of establishment. The indicator was also applied to field sampling results from 36 sites of unknown status that were visited twice during the period of 2014-2016. There was substantial agreement of levels between measurements, as calculated using a weighted kappa. The indicator can assist public health professionals with the interpretation of field sampling results and direct their efforts for ongoing surveillance and public health interventions for I. scapularis-borne diseases, including Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "By draining resources, microparasites can negatively affect the host fitness, which in turn can result in reduced transmission when virulence leads to reductions in host population size. Therefore, for a microparasite to persist in nature, the level of harm it can do to its host is expected to be limited. We tested this hypothesis for tick-borne Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) infections in the blackbird Turdus merula, one of the most important avian reservoir hosts in Europe. Experimental and observational data were combined to examine the physiological effects caused by B. burgdorferi s.l. infection in blackbirds. Pathogen-free blackbirds were exposed to B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected Ixodes ricinus and I. frontalis nymphs, and compared with a control group (exposed to naïve laboratory-derived I. ricinus nymphs). Their physiological status was evaluated before and after infection with B. burgdorferi s.l., through a set of immunological (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, haptoglobin, white blood cell count and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio), oxidative stress (glutathione peroxidase activity, protein carbonyls and nitric oxide) and general body condition variables (body condition, glucose and haematocrit). Infected males showed higher levels of oxidative damage to proteins (increased levels of protein carbonyls), decreased glutathione peroxidase activity and increased body mass. Infected females had higher levels of glutathione peroxidase activity after infection by B. burgdorferi s.l. than the control group. No significant effects of B. burgdorferi s.l. infection were detected on erythrocyte sedimentation rate, haptoglobin, heterophil/lymphocyte ratio, nitric oxide, glucose and haematocrit. The first experimental study on the effects of B. burgdorferi s.l. on its avian reservoir hosts shows that these bacteria may inflict non-negligible physiological costs. We speculate that during energetically demanding periods, these physiological costs may reduce host fitness and affect pathogen transmission."

It is possible that unknown tick-borne organisms underlie a subset of undiagnosed illness in wildlife, domesticated species, and humans. Our study lends support to the One Health concept by highlighting the prevalence of three blood-borne organisms in wild lemurs living in close proximity to domesticated species and humans. Previously, our team identified three novel, presumably tick-borne, intravascular organisms, belonging to the genera Babesia, Borrelia, and Neoehrlichia, circulating in two of Madagascar's lemur species. Here, we extend our previous observation by developing a targeted molecular surveillance approach aimed at determining the prevalence of these organisms in lemurs. Using quantitative PCR, we provide Babesia, Borrelia, and Neoehrlichia prevalence data for 76 individuals comprising four lemur species located in eastern Madagascar. Our results indicate a high prevalence (96%) of Babesia across sampled individuals with lower prevalences for Neoehrlichia (36%) and Borrelia (14.5%). In light of our results, we recommend additional studies of these tick-borne organisms to determine pathogenicity and assess zoonotic potency to other animals and humans in Madagascar."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne disease in the US and Europe. No potent human vaccine is currently available. The innate immune complement system is vital to host defense against pathogens, as complement activation on the surface of spirochetes results in bacterial killing. Complement system is inhibited by the complement regulator factor H (FH). To escape killing, B. burgdorferi produces an outer surface protein CspZ that binds FH to inhibit complement activation on the cell surface. Immunization with CspZ alone does not protect mice from infection, which we speculate is because FH-binding cloaks potentially protective epitopes. We modified CspZ by conjugating to virus-like particles (VLP-CspZ) and eliminating FH binding (modified VLP-CspZ) to increase immunogenicity. We observed greater bactericidal antibody titers in mice vaccinated with modified VLP-CspZ: A serum dilution of 1:395 (modified VLP-CspZ) vs 1:143 (VLP-CspZ) yielded 50% borreliacidal activity. Immunizing mice with modified VLP-CspZ cleared spirochete infection, as did passive transfer of elicited antibodies. This work developed a novel Lyme disease vaccine candidate by conjugating CspZ to VLP and eliminating FH-binding ability. Such a strategy of conjugating an antigen to a VLP and eliminating binding to the target ligand can serve as a general model for developing vaccines against other bacterial infectious agents."

		"abstract": "The emerging relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia (B.) miyamotoi is transmitted by ixodid ticks and causes the so-called hard tick-borne relapsing fever or B. miyamotoi disease (BMD). More recently, we identified a surface-exposed molecule, CbiA exhibiting complement binding and inhibitory capacity and rendering spirochetes resistant to complement-mediated lysis. To gain deeper insight into the molecular principles of B. miyamotoi-host interaction, we examined CbiA as a plasmin(ogen) receptor that enables B. miyamotoi to interact with the serine protease plasmin(ogen). Recombinant CbiA was able to bind plasminogen in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, lysine residues appear to play a crucial role in the protein-protein interaction as binding of plasminogen was inhibited by the lysine analog tranexamic acid as well as increasing ionic strength. Of relevance, plasminogen bound to CbiA can be converted by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPa) to active plasmin which cleaved both, the chromogenic substrate S-2251 and its physiologic substrate fibrinogen. Concerning the involvement of specific amino acids in the interaction with plasminogen, lysine residues located at the C-terminus are frequently involved in the binding as reported for various other plasminogen-interacting proteins of Lyme disease spirochetes. Lysine residues located within the C-terminal domain were substituted with alanine to generate single, double, triple, and quadruple point mutants. However, binding of plasminogen to the mutated CbiA proteins was not affected, suggesting that lysine residues distant from the C-terminus might be involved in the interaction."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are the most common vector-borne diseases in the United States, with serology being the primary method of diagnosis. We developed the first multiplex, array-based assay for serodiagnosis of tick-borne diseases called the TBD-Serochip. The TBD-Serochip was designed to discriminate antibody responses to 8 major tick-borne pathogens present in the United States, including Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Rickettsia rickettsii, Heartland virus and Powassan virus. Each assay contains approximately 170,000 12-mer linear peptides that tile along the protein sequence of the major antigens from each agent with 11 amino acid overlap. This permits accurate identification of a wide range of specific immunodominant IgG and IgM epitopes that can then be used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and integrate differential diagnosis into a single assay. To test the performance of the TBD-Serochip, we examined sera from patients with confirmed Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Powassan virus disease. We identified a wide range of specific discriminatory epitopes that facilitated accurate diagnosis of each disease. We also identified previously undiagnosed infections. Our results indicate that the TBD-Serochip is a promising tool for a differential diagnosis not available with currently employed serologic assays for TBDs."

		"abstract": "With the resurgence of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens such as Powassan virus, understanding what distinguishes vectors from non-vectors, and predicting undiscovered tick vectors is a crucial step towards mitigating disease risk in humans. We aimed to identify intrinsic traits that predict which Ixodes tick species are confirmed or strongly suspected to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens. We focused on the well-studied tick genus Ixodes from which many species are known to transmit zoonotic diseases to humans. We apply generalized boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240 species of Ixodes ticks to learn what intrinsic features distinguish zoonotic vectors from non-vector species. In addition to better understanding the biological underpinnings of tick vectorial capacity, the model generates a per species probability of being a zoonotic vector on the basis of intrinsic biological similarity with known Ixodes vector species. Our model predicted vector status with over 91% accuracy, and identified 14 Ixodes species with high probabilities (80%) of transmitting infections from animal hosts to humans on the basis of their traits. Distinguishing characteristics of zoonotic tick vectors of Ixodes tick species include several anatomical structures that influence host seeking behavior and blood-feeding efficiency from a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vectors. Overall, these results suggest that zoonotic tick vectors are most likely to be those species where adult females hold a fecundity advantage by producing more eggs per clutch, which develop into larvae that feed on a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vector species. These larvae develop into nymphs whose anatomy are well suited for more efficient and longer feeding times on soft-bodied hosts compared to non-vectors, leading to larger adult females with greater fecundity. In addition to identifying novel, testable hypotheses about intrinsic features driving vectorial capacity across Ixodes tick species, our model identifies particular Ixodes species with the highest probability of carrying zoonotic diseases, offering specific targets for increased zoonotic investigation and surveillance."

		"abstract": "Delaware is among the top 10 states in the United States with the highest incidence for Lyme disease. The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) therefore has been working diligently to prevent and control tick-borne diseases through a variety of interventions including awareness campaigns and educational programs. To assess if tick-borne disease related information is reaching Delawareans through these programs, DPH in collaboration with Delaware State University administered an anonymous survey to 1755 participants in all three of Delaware counties during May 2017. The questionnaire assessed individuals' general knowledge about tick-borne diseases and performance of selected tick-borne disease prevention methods Overall, participants' knowledge of tick-borne diseases was poor; only 38.4% of respondents stated that ticks were problematic in Delaware and only 12.7% of respondents \"strongly agreed\" that Lyme disease is a problem in Delaware. A little over half of the respondents (51.6%) indicated having seen advertisements/infomercials/flyers for protection from ticks or the disease agents spread by ticks; the most common places for viewing these advertisements were doctor's offices and through social media. The reported frequency of performing preventive behaviors was variable and disparities were observed by age, race, gender and county of residence. Existing public health communication efforts on tick-borne diseases in Delaware do not appear to be having the desired effect. This study provides important baseline information to rethink communication channels for education and more effectively guide future tick-borne disease awareness campaigns."

Here we summarise data collected through surveillance during 2010-2016, and compare with previous TSS data from 2005 to 2009, particularly in relation to the primary Lyme borreliosis vector Ixodes ricinus. 4173 records were submitted, constituting >14,000 ticks; 97% were endemic tick records (13,833 ticks of 11 species), with an additional 97 records of imported ticks (438 ticks of 17 species). Tick submissions were mainly from veterinary professionals (n = 1954; 46.8%) and members of the public and amateur entomologists (n = 1600; 38.3%), as well as from academic institutions (n = 249; 6.0%), wildlife groups (n = 239; 5.7%) and health professionals (n = 131; 3.1%). The most commonly reported hosts of endemic ticks were dogs (n = 1593; 39.1% of all records), humans (n = 835; 20.5%) and cats (n = 569; 14%). New host associations were recorded for a number of tick species. Ixodes ricinus was the most frequently recorded endemic tick species (n = 2413; 59.2% of all records), followed by I. hexagonus (n = 1355; 33.2%), I. canisuga (n = 132; 3.2%) and I. frontalis (n = 56; 1.4%), with other species each making up <1% total records. 81% of I. ricinus recorded from humans were nymphs, whereas 93.4% of I. ricinus from companion animals were adults. Recent TSS records of I. ricinus in the UK add a considerable amount of new presence data for this species, particularly in the southern regions of England, and confirm that this species is widespread across the UK. The scheme remains a valuable method of collecting continuous national distribution data on ticks from a variety of host species."

Southeastern states accounted for 1500 of over 28,000 confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in the United States during 2015. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is maintained in small mammal reservoirs and vectored to new hosts by ixodid ticks. This study examined ecological relationships of the B. burgdorferi/vector/reservoir system in order to understand the dynamics of Lyme disease risk in Kentucky. Small mammals were captured using live traps from November 2014 to October 2015. Ticks were removed and blood and tissue collected from small mammals were screened for B. burgdorferi DNA by PCR with primers specific to the OspA gene. Prevalence of B. burgdorferi (21.8%) in Kentucky small mammals was comparable to the lowest recorded prevalence in regions where Lyme disease is endemic. Moreover, infestation of small mammals by Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of B. burgdorferi, was rare, while Dermacentor variabilis comprised the majority of ticks collected. These findings provide ecological insight into the relative paucity of Lyme disease in Kentucky."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) spend the majority of their life cycle off host, typically in woodland habitat, but require a blood meal at each of three life stages (larva, nymph, adult) to reach maturity and reproduce. Blood feeding usually lasts for several days each time and as blood is imbibed, a range of known pathogens from the host may also be acquired. Using next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we examined the influence of host blood meal on the internal bacterial community within nymphal blacklegged ticks across host-seeking, feeding, blood meal digestion, and after molting into the adult stage. Results demonstrate bacterial community structuring across host and ticks with 287 taxa found exclusively in ticks, suggesting the field environment plays a significant role in shaping the internal tick microbiome. A decrease in bacterial diversity was noted from unfed nymphs through feeding/digestion and after molting into adults, suggesting that bacterial species are lost during the corresponding physiological changes. The similarity in biochemical pathways across the different tick categories suggests that the loss of bacterial taxa does not mirror a large change in microbial function. Ticks likely lose bacterial taxa after feeding, but continual exposure to bacteria from the field environment counters this loss."

Over 90% of US cases occur in northeasternstates from Maine to Virginia, and in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. Infection also takes place in northern California and Oregon. Lyme borreliosis is also diagnosed in parts of Europe, China, and Japan. The white-footed mouse is the primary animal reservoir for B. burgdorferi in the U.S. and the preferred host for nymphal and larval forms of the deer tick. Deer are hosts for the adult ticks but do not carry the spirochete. Signs and symptomsof infection occur in 3 stages; early localized, typified by erythema migrans; early disseminated with a flu-like syndrome, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations; and late, characteristically with arthritis. Although, the term 'Chronic Lyme Disease' has been assigned to many patients with a variety of unexplained symptoms, experts in the field question the validity of this diagnosis and warn against prolonged unproven antimicrobial therapies. Diagnosis relies upon clinical evaluation and is supported by serologic testing using a 2-step process which requires careful interpretation. Treatmentvaries with stage of disease, but normally includes doxycycline, amoxicillin,and ceftriaxone. Currently, no preventative vaccine is available. In some geographic areas, patients may be confected with Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma since the same Ixodes ticks transmit these pathogens."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the primary vector to humans in the eastern United States of the deer tick virus lineage of Powassan virus (Powassan virus disease); the protozoan parasite Babesia microti (babesiosis); and multiple bacterial disease agents including Anaplasma phagocytophilum (anaplasmosis), Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia mayonii (Lyme disease), Borrelia miyamotoi (relapsing fever-like illness, named Borrelia miyamotoi disease), and Ehrlichia muris eauclairensis (a minor causative agent of ehrlichiosis). With the notable exception of Powassan virus, which can be transmitted within minutes after attachment by an infected tick, there is no doubt that the risk of transmission of other I. scapularis-borne pathogens, including Lyme disease spirochetes, increases with the length of time (number of days) infected ticks are allowed to remain attached. This review summarizes data from experimental transmission studies to reinforce the important disease-prevention message that regular (at least daily) tick checks and prompt tick removal has strong potential to reduce the risk of transmission of I. scapularis-borne bacterial and parasitic pathogens from infected attached ticks. The most likely scenario for human exposure to an I. scapularis-borne pathogen is the bite by a single infected tick. However, recent reviews have failed to make a clear distinction between data based on transmission studies where experimental hosts were fed upon by a single versus multiple infected ticks. A summary of data from experimental studies on transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes (Bo. burgdorferi and Bo. mayonii) by I. scapularis nymphs indicates that the probability of transmission resulting in host infection, at time points from 24 to 72 h after nymphal attachment, is higher when multiple infected ticks feed together as compared to feeding by a single infected tick. In the specific context of risk for human infection, the most relevant experimental studies therefore are those where the probability of pathogen transmission at a given point in time after attachment was determined using a single infected tick. The minimum duration of attachment by single infected I. scapularis nymphs required for transmission to result in host infection is poorly defined for most pathogens, but experimental studies have shown that Powassan virus can be transmitted within 15 min of tick attachment and both A. phagocytophilum and Bo. miyamotoi within the first 24 h of attachment. There is no experimental evidence for transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes by single infected I. scapularis nymphs to result in host infection when ticks are attached for only 24 h (despite exposure of nearly 90 experimental rodent hosts across multiple studies) but the probability of transmission resulting in host infection appears to increase to approximately 10% by 48 h and reach 70% by 72 h for Bo. burgdorferi. Caveats to the results from experimental transmission studies, including specific circumstances (such as re-attachment of previously partially fed infected ticks) that may lead to more rapid transmission are discussed."

		"abstract": "Forests in urban landscapes differ from their rural counterparts in ways that may alter vector-borne disease dynamics. In urban forest fragments, tick-borne pathogen prevalence is not well characterized; mitigating disease risk in densely-populated urban landscapes requires understanding ecological factors that affect pathogen prevalence. We trapped blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) nymphs in urban forest fragments on the East Coast of the United States and used multiplex real-time PCR assays to quantify the prevalence of four zoonotic, tick-borne pathogens. We used Bayesian logistic regression and WAIC model selection to understand how vegetation, habitat, and landscape features of urban forests relate to the prevalence of B. burgdorferi (the causative agent of Lyme disease) among blacklegged ticks. In the 258 nymphs tested, we detected Borrelia burgdorferi (11.2% of ticks), Borrelia miyamotoi (0.8%) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (1.9%), but we did not find Babesia microti (0%). Ticks collected from forests invaded by non-native multiflora rose (Rosa multiflora) had greater B. burgdorferi infection rates (mean = 15.9%) than ticks collected from uninvaded forests (mean = 7.9%). Overall, B. burgdorferi prevalence among ticks was positively related to habitat features (e.g. coarse woody debris and total understory cover) favorable for competent reservoir host species. Understory structure provided by non-native, invasive shrubs appears to aggregate ticks and reservoir hosts, increasing opportunities for pathogen transmission. However, when we consider pathogen prevalence among nymphs in context with relative abundance of questing nymphs, invasive plants do not necessarily increase disease risk. Although pathogen prevalence is greater among ticks in invaded forests, the probability of encountering an infected tick remains greater in uninvaded forests characterized by thick litter layers, sparse understories, and relatively greater questing tick abundance in urban landscapes."

		"abstract": "Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne arbovirus presenting a public health threat in North America. POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection. IMPORTANCE Approximately 100 cases of POWV disease were reported in the United States over the past 10 years. Most cases have occurred in the Northeast (52) and Great Lakes (45) regions (https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html). The prevalence of POWV in ticks and mammals is increasing, and POWV poses an increasing threat in a greater geographical range. In areas of the Northeast and Midwest where Lyme disease is endemic, POWV testing is recommended for patients with a recent tick bite, patients with Lyme disease who have been treated with antibiotics, or patients with a tick exposure who have tested negative for Lyme disease or other tick-borne illnesses and have persistent symptoms consistent with posttreatment Lyme disease. Testing could also benefit patients with tick exposure and unexplained neurologic symptoms and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients with known tick exposure. Until now, diagnostic testing for Powassan virus has not been commercially available and has been limited to patients presenting with severe, neurologic complications. The lack of routine testing for Powassan virus in patients with suspected tick-borne disease means that little information is available regarding the overall prevalence of the virus and the full spectrum of clinical symptoms associated with infection. As Ixodes scapularis is the tick vector for Powassan virus and multiple other tick-borne pathogens, including the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, the clinical presentations and long-term outcomes of Powassan virus infection and concurrent infection with other tick-borne disease pathogens remain unknown."

In addition to an accelerated rate of discovery of I. scapularis-borne pathogens over the past two decades, the geographic range of the tick, and incidence and range of I. scapularis-borne disease cases, have increased. Despite knowledge of when and where humans are most at risk of exposure to infected ticks, control of I. scapularis-borne diseases remains a challenge. Human vaccines are not available, and we lack solid evidence for other prevention and control methods to reduce human disease. The way forward is discussed."

Information on risk factors for Lyme arthritis, facial palsy, carditis, and meningitis is limited but could facilitate disease recognition and elucidate pathophysiology. Patients from high-incidence states treated for LD during 2005-2014 were identified in a nationwide insurance claims database using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code for LD (088.81), antibiotic treatment history, and clinically compatible codiagnosis codes for LD manifestations. Among 88022 unique patients diagnosed with LD, 5122 (5.8%) patients with 5333 codiagnoses were identified: 2440 (2.8%) arthritis, 1853 (2.1%) facial palsy, 534 (0.6%) carditis, and 506 (0.6%) meningitis. Patients with disseminated LD had lower median age (35 vs 42 years) and higher male proportion (61% vs 50%) than nondisseminated LD. Greatest differential risks included arthritis in males aged 10-14 years (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-4.2), facial palsy (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.6-2.7) and carditis (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.6-3.6) in males aged 20-24 years, and meningitis in females aged 10-14 years (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 2.1-5.5) compared to the 55-59 year referent age group. Males aged 15-29 years had the highest risk for complete heart block, a potentially fatal condition. The risk and manifestations of disseminated LD vary by age and sex. Provider education regarding at-risk populations and additional investigations into pathophysiology could enhance early case recognition and improve patient management."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus has considerable impact on the health of humans and other terrestrial animals because it transmits several tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) such as B. burgdorferi (sensu lato), which causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). Small forest patches of agricultural landscapes provide many ecosystem services and also the disservice of LB risk. Biotic interactions and environmental filtering shape tick host communities distinctively between specific regions of Europe, which makes evaluating the dilution effect hypothesis and its influence across various scales challenging. Latitude, macroclimate, landscape and habitat properties drive both hosts and ticks and are comparable metrics across Europe. Therefore, we instead assess these environmental drivers as indicators and determine their respective roles for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus. We sampled I. ricinus and measured environmental properties of macroclimate, landscape and habitat quality of forest patches in agricultural landscapes along a European macroclimatic gradient. We used linear mixed models to determine significant drivers and their relative importance for nymphal and adult B. burgdorferi prevalence. We suggest a new prevalence index, which is pool-size independent. During summer months, our prevalence index varied between 0 and 0.4 per forest patch, indicating a low to moderate disservice. Habitat properties exerted a fourfold larger influence on B. burgdorferi prevalence than macroclimate and landscape properties combined. Increasingly available ecotone habitat of focal forest patches diluted and edge density at landscape scale amplified B. burgdorferi prevalence. Indicators of habitat attractiveness for tick hosts (food resources and shelter) were the most important predictors within habitat patches. More diverse and abundant macro- and microhabitat had a diluting effect, as it presumably diversifies the niches for tick-hosts and decreases the probability of contact between ticks and their hosts and hence the transmission likelihood. Diluting effects of more diverse habitat patches would pose another reason to maintain or restore high biodiversity in forest patches of rural landscapes. We suggest classifying habitat patches by their regulating services as dilution and amplification habitat, which predominantly either decrease or increase B. burgdorferi prevalence at local and landscape scale and hence LB risk. Particular emphasis on promoting LB-diluting properties should be put on the management of those habitats that are frequently used by humans. In the light of these findings, climate change may be of little concern for LB risk at local scales, but this should be evaluated further."

Seabirds are important reservoir hosts of some members of the Bbsl complex in the Northern Hemisphere, and some evidence suggests this may be true of penguins in the Southern Hemisphere. While the Bbsl complex has not been detected in Australia, a novel Borrelia species ('Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi') was recently sequenced from native ticks (Ixodes holocyclus and Bothriocroton concolor) parasitising echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus), suggesting unidentified borreliae may be circulating amongst native wildlife and their ticks. In the present study, we investigated whether ticks parasitising little penguins (Eudyptula novaehollandiae) harbour native or introduced Borrelia bacteria. We chose this penguin species because it is heavily exploited by ticks during the breeding season, lives in close proximity to other potential reservoir hosts (including native wildlife and migratory seabirds), and is known to be infected with other tick-borne pathogens (Babesia). We screened over 230 penguin ticks (Ixodes spp.) from colonies in south-eastern Australia, and found no evidence of Borrelia DNA. The apparent absence or rarity of the bacterium in south-eastern Australia has important implications for identifying potential tick-borne pathogens in an understudied region."

While her pancytopenia was initially attributed to tick-borne illness, peripheral flow cytometry showed 7% myeloblasts, and a bone marrow biopsy confirmed 60% blasts. The patient was ultimately diagnosed with acute myelogenous leukemia, in addition to early, localized Lyme disease. This case highlights the differential diagnosis for pancytopenia, cytopenia patterns for different tick-borne illnesses, the risk of premature closure in internal medicine, and management of Lyme disease in hosts with altered immunity."

Geographic expansion of LB in the United States and discovery of emerging Borrelia pathogens underscores the importance of surveillance for disease-causing Borrelia. De-identified clinical specimens, submitted by providers throughout the United States, for patients suspected of LB, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, or babesiosis were screened using a Borrelia genus-level TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Borrelia species and sequence types (STs) were characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) utilizing next-generation sequencing. Among 7292 specimens tested, 5 Borrelia species were identified: 2 causing LB, B. burgdorferi (n = 25) and B. mayonii (n = 9), and 3 RF borreliae, B. hermsii (n = 1), B. miyamotoi (n = 8), and Candidatus B. johnsonii (n = 1), a species previously detected only in the bat tick, Carios kelleyi. ST diversity was greatest for B. burgdorferi-positive specimens, with new STs identified primarily among synovial fluids. These results demonstrate that broad PCR screening followed by MLST is a powerful surveillance tool for uncovering the spectrum of disease-causing Borrelia species, understanding their geographic distribution, and investigating the correlation between B. burgdorferi STs and joint involvement. Detection of Candidatus B. johnsonii in a patient with suspected tickborne disease suggests this species may be a previously undetected cause of illness in humans exposed to bat ticks."

We used ticks collected from hunter-killed white-tailed deer in New Jersey in 2002 to examine the prevalence and distribution of four pathogens transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, the blacklegged tick. Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Babesia microti, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (the agents of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, respectively) was highest in the Coastal Plain and lowest in the northwestern Skylands region. These patterns correspond well with the historically observed northward expansion of I. scapularis within New Jersey and the comparatively recent increase in human cases of these pathogens in the northern part of the state. Additionally, we provide evidence that Borrelia miyamotoi, a relatively new emerging pathogen and agent of relapsing fever, was widespread (though not common) throughout the state in 2002. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced awareness of tick-borne diseases other than Lyme and implementation of large-scale tick surveillance in endemic regions."

		"abstract": "The incidence and geographic range of tick-borne illness associated with Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus have dramatically increased in recent decades. Anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Borrelia spirochete infections, including Lyme borreliosis, account for tens of thousands of reported cases of tick-borne disease every year. Assays that reliably detect pathogens in ticks allow investigators and public health agencies to estimate the geographic distribution of human pathogens, assess geographic variation in their prevalence, and evaluate the effectiveness of prevention strategies. As investigators continue to describe new species within the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex and to recognize some Ixodes-borne Borrelia species as human pathogens, assays are needed to detect and differentiate these species. Here we describe an algorithm to detect and differentiate pathogens in unfed I. scapularis and I. pacificus nymphs including Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia mayonii, and Borrelia miyamotoi. The algorithm comprises 5 TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction assays and 3 sequencing protocols. It employs multiple targets for each pathogen to optimize specificity, a gene target for I. scapularis and I. pacificus to verify tick-derived DNA quality, and a pan-Borrelia target to detect Borrelia species that may emerge as human disease agents in the future. We assess the algorithm's sensitivity, specificity, and performance on field-collected ticks."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a common tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States, where infection is most prevalent in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. Although classically associated with erythema migrans, Lyme disease caused by Borrelia species found in Europe may also present with other cutaneous findings. Here we report the case of a girl who was clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease based on her history of recent travel and the appearance of an areolar lymphocytoma; this was confirmed by testing. Testing for European Lyme disease does not follow the testing algorithm that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends and may be easily missed. Our case serves as an important reminder that common infections can have varying presentations depending on their region of acquisition and may require specialized testing for accurate diagnosis."

		"abstract": "The distribution of I. scapularis, the tick vector of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, has been expanding over the last two decades in the north-central United States in parallel with increasing incidence of human cases of Lyme disease in that region. However, assessments of residential risk for exposure to ticks are lacking from this region. Here, we measured the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs in two suburban and two rural public recreational sites located in Washington County, Minnesota as well as in nearby residential properties. We sought to compare tick densities across land use types and to identify environmental factors that might impact nymphal density. We also assessed the prevalence of infection in the collected ticks with Lyme disease spirochetes (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. mayonii), and other I. scapularis-borne pathogens including B. miyamotoi, Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Similar to studies from the eastern United States, on residential properties, I. scapularis nymphal densities were highest in the ecotonal areas between the forest edge and the lawn. Residences with the highest densities of nymphs were more likely to have a higher percentage of forest cover, log piles, and signs of deer on their property. In recreational areas, we found the highest nymphal densities both in the wooded areas next to trails as well as on mowed trails. Among the 303 host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs tested for pathogens, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, A. phagocytophilum and B. miyamotoi were detected in 42 (13.8%), 14 (4.6%), and 2 (0.6%) nymphs, respectively."

It had not been reported from Spain, but its wide distribution and the presence of the tick-vector (Ixodes ricinus) made us suspect its circulation. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of Borrelia spp. in I. ricinus in Spain. A total of 652 I. ricinus nymphs collected in northern Spain were processed. The DNA was extracted using incubations with ammonium hydroxide. Borrelia spp. DNA was amplified using Borrelia-specific PCR assays (glpQ, 16S rRNA and flagellin genes). B. miyamotoi was amplified in 4 specimens, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in 27 (8 Borrelia afzelii, 7 Borrelia garinii, 8 Borrelia lusitaniae, 3 Borrelia valaisiana and 1 B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). B. miyamotoi should be considered in the differential diagnoses of patients with confirmed or suspected tick-bite in Spanish endemic areas for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Prevention of tick-borne diseases requires an understanding of when and where exposure to ticks is most likely. We used an epidemiologic approach to define these parameters for residents of a Lyme-endemic region. Two persons in each of 500 Connecticut households were asked to complete a log each night for one week during June, 2013. Participants recorded their whereabouts in 15min increments (indoors, outdoors in their yard, outdoors on others' private property, or outdoors in public spaces) and noted each day whether they found a tick on themselves. Demographic and household information was also collected. Logs were completed for 934 participants in 471 households yielding 51,895 time-place observations. Median participant age was 49 years (range 2-91 years); 52% were female. Ninety-one participants (9.8%) reported finding a tick during the week, with slightly higher rates among females and minors. Household factors positively associated with finding a tick included having indoor/outdoor pets (odds ratio (OR)=1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-2.9), the presence of a bird feeder in the yard (OR=1.9; CI:1.2-3.2), and presence of an outdoor dining area (OR=2.2; CI:1.1-4.3). Individual factors associated with finding a tick on a given day were bathing or showering (OR=3.7; CI:1.3-10.3) and hours spent in one's own yard (OR=1.2, CI:1.1-1.3). Nineteen participants found ticks on multiple days, more than expected assuming independence (p<0.001). Participants who found ticks on multiple days did not spend more time outdoors but were significantly more likely to be male than those finding ticks on a single day (p<0.03). Our findings suggest that most tick exposures in the study area occurred on private property controlled by the respective homeowner. Interventions that target private yards are a logical focus for prevention efforts."

Although this spirochete was known long before the discovery of the Lyme disease (LD) spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, basic methods to facilitate the study of B. hermsii have lagged behind. One important technique to expedite the study of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of B. hermsii would be a reliable method to grow and clone these bacteria in solid medium, which we now describe. We have defined the solidifying agent, plating temperature, oxygen concentration, and pH for the efficient plating of two species of RF spirochetes, B. hermsii and Borrelia turicatae. Importantly, this technique allowed us to successfully isolate virulent, clonal cell lines of spirochetes, and to enumerate and isolate viable B. hermsii from infected mouse blood and tick tissues. Our results also demonstrate the value of testing a range of several environmental variables to increase the efficiency of bacterial isolation, which may be helpful for researchers working on other prokaryotes that are intractable for in vitro growth."

		"abstract": "Climate change has already impacted the transmission of a wide range of vector-borne diseases in Europe, and it will continue to do so in the coming decades. Climate change has been implicated in the observed shift of ticks to elevated altitudes and latitudes, notably including the Ixodes ricinus tick species that is a vector for Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change is also thought to have been a factor in the expansion of other important disease vectors in Europe: Aedes albopictus (the Asian tiger mosquito), which transmits diseases such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya, and Phlebotomus sandfly species, which transmits diseases including Leishmaniasis. In addition, highly elevated temperatures in the summer of 2010 have been associated with an epidemic of West Nile Fever in Southeast Europe and subsequent outbreaks have been linked to summer temperature anomalies. Future climate-sensitive health impacts are challenging to project quantitatively, in part due to the intricate interplay between non-climatic and climatic drivers, weather-sensitive pathogens and climate-change adaptation. Moreover, globalisation and international air travel contribute to pathogen and vector dispersion internationally. Nevertheless, monitoring forecasts of meteorological conditions can help detect epidemic precursors of vector-borne disease outbreaks and serve as early warning systems for risk reduction."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the FDA-approved C6 peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) currently used to diagnose Lyme disease may potentially serve as a diagnostic test for B. miyamotoi infections. Serum specimens from 30 patients from the northeastern United States with B. miyamotoi infection established by a polymerase chain reaction assay of a blood specimen were tested using the C6 ELISA. To reduce confounding with Borrelia burgdorferi coinfection, 6 sera were excluded: 3 from patients with a positive Western immunoblot for antibodies to B. burgdorferi and 3 from patients for whom immunoblot testing had not been performed. Twenty-two of 24 (91.7% [95% confidence interval, 73.0%-98.8%]) evaluable B. miyamotoi patients were C6 ELISA reactive, principally on a convalescent-phase serum specimen. C6 ELISA index values were often well above the positive cutoff value of 1.1, exceeding 4 in 11 of the 22 (50.0%) C6 ELISA-reactive patients. Although previously regarded as a highly specific test for Lyme disease, the C6 ELISA is also regularly reactive on convalescent-phase serum samples of patients from the northeastern United States with B. miyamotoi infection."

Detection of Bb DNA using PCR is promising, but clinical utility is hampered by low diagnostic sensitivity. We aimed to examine whether diagnostic sensitivity can be improved by the use of larger cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volumes and faster handling of samples. Patients who underwent CSF examination for LNB were included. We collected two millilitres of CSF for PCR analysis, extracted DNA from the pellets within 24 h and analysed the eluate by two real-time PCR protocols (16S rRNA and OspA). Patients who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for LNB were classified as LNB cases and the rest as controls. Bb DNA in CSF was detected by PCR in seven of 28 adults with LNB. Two were Bb antibody negative. No Bb DNA was detected in CSF from 137 controls. Diagnostic sensitivity was 25% and specificity 100%. There was a non-significant trend towards larger CSF sample volume, faster handling of the sample, shorter duration of symptoms, and higher CSF cell count in the PCR-positive cases. We did not find that optimized handling of CSF increased diagnostic sensitivity of PCR in adults with LNB. However, our case series is small and we hypothesize that the importance of these factors will be clarified in further studies with larger case series and altered study design. PCR for diagnosis of LNB may be useful in cases without Bb antibodies due to short duration of symptoms."

Borrelia DNA was detected in 7/73 (9.6%) biopsies with GA and in 1/36 (2.8 %) biopsies with morphea, while Chlamydiales DNA was found in 53/73 (72.6%) biopsies with GA and 25/34 (73.4%) biopsies with morphea. All Borrelia DNA-positive GA samples were also positive for Chlamydiales DNA. The Chlamydiales sequences detected in GA were heterogeneous and contained Waddliaceae and Rhabdochlamydiaceae bacteria, which are also present in Ixodes ricinus ticks, while the Chlamydiales sequences detected in morphea closely resembled those found in healthy skin. In conclusion, tick-mediated infections can trigger GA in some cases, while correlation of either Borrelia or Chlamydiales with morphea is unlikely."

		"abstract": "Ticks possess components of a primordial complement system that presumably play a role in the interaction of the tick immune system with tick-borne pathogens and affect their transmission. Here we characterized a novel complement component, tagged as IrC2/Bf, from the hard tick Ixodes ricinus, the principal vector of Lyme disease in Europe. IrC2/Bf is a multi-domain molecule composed of 5-7 CCP modules, varied by alternative splicing, followed by a von Willebrand factor A domain and a C-terminal trypsin-like domain. The primary structure and molecular architecture of IrC2/Bf displays the closest homology to the C3-complement component convertases described in horseshoe crabs. The irc2/bf gene is mainly expressed in the tick fat body associated with the trachea and, as determined by western blotting, the protein is present in low amounts in tick hemolymph. Expression of irc2/bf mRNA was significantly up-regulated in response to the intra-hemocoelic injection of the yeast Candida albicans and all tested Borrelia sp. strains (B. burgdorferi NE5264, B. burgdorferi CB26, B. garinii MSLB, B. afzelii CB43), but was not affected by injection of model Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria or the aseptic injection control. In-line with these results, RNAi-mediated silencing of irc2/bf inhibited phagocytosis of B. afzelii and C. albicans but not the other bacteria. Tissue expression profiles, specific responses to microbial challenges, and patterns of phagocytic phenotypes upon RNAi silencing observed for IrC2/Bf match well with the previously reported characteristics of I. ricinus C3-related molecule 1 (IrC3-1). Therefore we presume that IrC2/Bf functions as a convertase in the same complement activation pathway protecting ticks against yeast and Borrelia infection."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is the leading tick-borne disease in the United States with approximately 300,000 cases diagnosed annually. Disease occurs in stages beginning localized infection at the site of a tick bite and progresses to disseminated infection when antibiotic treatment is not administered in a timely manner. A multi-systemic infection develops following dissemination to numerous immunoprotective tissues, such as the heart, bladder, and joints, resulting in late Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi undergoes dynamic genetic regulation throughout mammalian infection and defining the exact role of virulence genes at distinct stages of disease is challenging. The murine model allows for the characterization of the pathogenic function of genes in B. burgdorferi, but traditional end point studies limit the ability to gather data throughout an infection study and greatly increase the required number of mice. Molecular genetic techniques to evaluate and quantitate B. burgdorferi infection are laborious and costly. To partly circumvent these issues, a codon optimized firefly luciferase, under the control of a constitutive borrelial promoter, was introduced into B. burgdorferi enabling the characterization of mutant or modified strains under in vitro growth conditions and throughout murine infection. The detection of bioluminescent B. burgdorferi is highly sensitive and allows for the repeated real-time quantitative evaluation of borrelial load during murine infection. Furthermore, bioluminescence has also been utilized to evaluate alteration in tissue localization and tissue-specific gene expression of B. burgdorferi. In this chapter, we describe the generation of bioluminescent borrelial strains along with methods for in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo B. burgdorferi studies."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is maintained in nature by a tick-rodent infection cycle where it traverses and colonizes a variety of host and vector tissues. A tick-borne murine model has been developed to study Lyme disease in the laboratory, which has a substantial impact in advancing our knowledge of spirochete infectivity and pathogenesis. Here, we detail a microinjection-based method for rapid and efficient infection of ticks with B. burgdorferi. While laboratory generation of B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs via natural larval engorgement on infected hosts and subsequent molting could take several weeks to months, the microinjection-based infection procedure requires only a few hours to generate infected ticks and allows introduction of defined quantities of spirochetes, including mutant isolates that are attenuated for infection in mice and thus cannot be naturally acquired by ticks. We also describe a quantitative PCR-based protocol for the measurement of B. burgdorferi in tick and murine hosts targeting spirochete RNA that is highly efficient, reproducible, and a better surrogate of active infection."

The methods presented here are meant for genotyping directly from ticks and from blood and tissue samples from vertebrates."

We screened 255 Amblyomma variegatum ticks and 148 Rhipicephalus microplus ticks from Zebu cattle in Madagascar for Borrelia-specific DNA. Borrelia spp. DNA was detected in 21 Amblyomma variegatum ticks and 2 Rhipicephalus microplus ticks. One Borrelia found in one Rhipicephalus microplus showed close relationship to Borrelia theileri based on genetic distance and phylogenetic analyses on 16S rRNA and flaB sequences. The borreliae from Amblyomma variegatum could not be identified due to very low quantities of present DNA reflected by high cycle threshold values in real-time-PCR. It is uncertain whether these low numbers of Borrelia spp. are sufficient for transmission of infection from ticks to humans. In order to determine whether spirochaete infections are relevant in humans, blood samples of 1009 patients from the highlands of Madagascar with fever of unknown origin were screened for Borrelia spp. - and in addition for Leptospira spp. - by real-time PCR. No target DNA was detected, indicating a limited relevance of these pathogens for humans in the highlands of Madagascar."

		"abstract": "Due to the problem of tick-borne diseases, there is a need to better understand the importance of different host species in maintaining enzootic disease cycles. We explored the utility of stable isotope analysis to identify the larval hosts of questing ixodid ticks. In laboratory experiments, we used Ixodes scapularis and two host species that are important in the Lyme disease system in eastern North America. First, we tested how effectively a short-term dietary tracer (13C in corn) was reflected in molted ticks. Second, we attempted to identify the host species (either white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) or eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus)), based on the isotopic signature of the ticks that had fed on them. The corn isotopic signal was easily detectable in the ticks that fed on corn-diet hosts despite the brief feeding period (96h). However, we were not able to differentiate between flat Ixodes scapularis nymphs that had fed as larvae on mice vs. those fed on chipmunks. Isotopic signatures of fur from mice and chipmunks were also indistinguishable, probably due to the similar diets of these two species in the wild. We conclude that, while stable isotope analysis of ticks may not be able to distinguish between ecologically similar host species, it may be useful in sorting ticks to the level of feeding guild of the host."

Currently, a large volume of diagnostic testing for LB is reported, whereas the incidence of clinically relevant disease manifestations is low. This indicates overuse of diagnostic testing for LB with implications for patient care and cost-effective health management. The recommendations provided in this review are intended to support both the clinical diagnosis and initiatives for a more rational use of laboratory testing in patients with clinically suspected LB. This is a narrative review combining various aspects of the clinical and laboratory diagnosis with an educational purpose. The literature search was based on existing systematic reviews, national and international guidelines and supplemented with specific citations. The main recommendations according to current European case definitions for LB are as follows. Typical erythema migrans should be diagnosed clinically and does not require laboratory testing. The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis requires laboratory investigation of the spinal fluid including intrathecal antibody production, and the remaining disease manifestations require testing for serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Testing individuals with non-specific subjective symptoms is not recommended, because of a low positive predictive value."

The spatiotemporal dynamics in the prevalence of these pathogens have not yet been fully elucidated, but probably depend on the spatiotemporal population dynamics of small rodents. We aimed to evaluate the effect of different forest types on the density of infected nymphs in different years and to obtain more knowledge about the spatial and temporal patterns of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. We analysed unfed nymphal ticks from 22 stands of four different forest types in Belgium in 2009, 2010, 2013 and 2014 and found that the density of nymphs in general and the density of nymphs infected with B. afzelii and B. miyamotoi varied yearly, but without temporal variation in the infection prevalence. The yearly variation in density of infected nymphs in our study thus seems to be caused most by the variation in the density of nymphs, which makes it a good predictor of disease risk. The risk for rodent-associated tick-borne diseases also varied between forest types. We stress the need to elucidate the contribution of the host community composition to tick-borne disease risk."

		"abstract": "To review infectious diseases that may cause autonomic dysfunction. Review of published papers indexed in medline/embase. Autonomic dysfunction has been reported in retrovirus (human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human T-lymphotropic virus), herpes viruses, flavivirus, enterovirus 71 and lyssavirus infections. Autonomic dysfunction is relatively common in HIV-infected patients and heart rate variability is reduced even in early stages of infection. Orthostatic hypotension, urinary dysfunction and hypohidrosis have been described in tropical spastic paraparesis patients. Varicella zoster reactivation from autonomic ganglia may be involved in visceral disease and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Autonomic and peripheral nervous system dysfunction may happen in acute tick-borne encephalitis virus infections. Hydrophobia, hypersalivation, dyspnea, photophobia, and piloerection are frequently observed in human rabies. Autonomic dysfunction and vagal denervation is common in Chagas disease. Neuronal depopulation occurs mainly in chagasic heart disease and myenteric plexus, and megacolon, megaesophagus and cardiomyopathy are common complications in the chronic stage of Chagas disease. Parasympathetic autonomic dysfunction precedes left ventricle systolic dysfunction in Chagas disease. A high prevalence of subclinical autonomic neuropathy in leprosy patients has been reported, and autonomic nerve dysfunction may be an early manifestation of the disease. Autonomic dysfunction features in leprosy include anhidrosis, impaired sweating function, localised alopecia ,and reduced heart rate variability. Urinary retention and intestinal pseudo-obstruction have been described in Lyme disease. Diphtheritic polyneuropathy, tetanus and botulism are examples of bacterial infections releasing toxins that affect the autonomic nervous system. Autonomic dysfunction may be responsible for additional morbidity in some infectious diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spirochaetes, which are able to disseminate from the tick-bite site to distant organs. Mouse models are widely used to study LB and especially Lyme arthritis (LA), but only a few whole-animal in vivo imaging studies on the pathogenesis of B. burgdorferi infection in mice have been published so far. The existing imaging techniques have their drawbacks and, therefore, novel tools to complement the array of available LB imaging methodologies are needed. The applicability of positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was evaluated as a method to monitor LB and especially LA in the C3H/HeN mouse model infected with wild-type B. burgdorferi N40 bacteria. The imaging results were compared with the traditional LA analysis methods, such as tibiotarsal joint swelling and histopathological assessment of joint inflammation. PET/CT imaging provided high-resolution images with quantitative information on the spatial and temporal distribution of the [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) tracer in B. burgdorferi-infected mice. The [18F]FDG accumulated in the affected joints and activated lymph nodes of infected mice, while the tracer signal could not be visualized in these organs in uninfected control animals. Importantly, in vivo PET/CT imaging data were in agreement with the histopathological scoring of inflammation of mouse joints. PET/CT imaging with [18F]FDG is a reliable method to longitudinally monitor the development and progression of B. burgdorferi infection-induced inflammation in vivo in mouse joints."

		"abstract": "We examined whether pet ownership increased the risk for tick encounters and tickborne disease among residents of three Lyme disease-endemic states as a nested cohort within a randomized controlled trial. Information about pet ownership, use of tick control for pets, property characteristics, tick encounters and human tickborne disease were captured through surveys, and associations were assessed using univariate and multivariable analyses. Pet-owning households had 1.83 times the risk (95% CI = 1.53, 2.20) of finding ticks crawling on and 1.49 times the risk (95% CI = 1.20, 1.84) of finding ticks attached to household members compared to households without pets. This large evaluation of pet ownership, human tick encounters and tickborne diseases shows that pet owners, whether of cats or dogs, are at increased risk of encountering ticks and suggests that pet owners are at an increased risk of developing tickborne disease. Pet owners should be made aware of this risk and be reminded to conduct daily tick checks of all household members, including the pets, and to consult their veterinarian regarding effective tick control products."

		"abstract": "Adults with the tick-borne disease human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA) have a spectrum of acute febrile illnesses that, if untreated, might be severe. Clinical presentation and outcomes of children with HGA have been poorly described. A retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the frequency, presentation, and outcomes of pediatric patients with HGA between 1994 and 2015 in a region of Wisconsin in which HGA is highly endemic. Patients with related International Classification of Diseases Ninth and Tenth Revision (ICD-9 and ICD-10, respectively) codes or positive HGA laboratory test results were evaluated and classified as having had confirmed, probable, or suspected HGA on the basis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) case definition. The Fisher's exact and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used in statistical comparisons. Of 187 children identified with possible HGA, 17 (9%) had confirmed, 75 (40%) had probable, and 91 (49%) had suspected infections. The number of cases rose sharply in 2010 and has remained between 16 and 36 cases per year since that time. A minority of children with confirmed or probable infections had elevated liver transaminase levels (33%), leukopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia (17%), or anemia (8%); 6 (7%) of these children required hospitalization. Children with evidence of concurrent HGA and Lyme disease (27% of confirmed or probable cases) had a higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio, 6.55 [95% confidence interval, 1.11-38.78]). None of these children had life-threatening disease or died. Evidence suggests that the frequency of HGA in children is increasing. Although most children had mild disease, doxycycline remains the treatment of choice, because outcome data for children without treatment remains limited."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), anaplasmosis, babesiosis and other tick-borne diseases (TBDs) attributed to Ixodes ticks are thought to be widely underreported in the United States. To identify TBD cases diagnosed in 2009, but not reported to the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), diagnostic and procedural billing codes suggestive of tick-borne diseases were used to select medical charts for retrospective review in medical facilities serving residents of a highly endemic county in Minnesota. Of 444 illness events, 352 (79%) were not reported. Of these, 102 (29%) met confirmed or probable surveillance case criteria, including 91 (26%) confirmed LD cases with physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM). For each confirmed and probable LD, probable anaplasmosis and confirmed babesiosis case reported to MDH in 2009, 2.8, 1.3, 1.2 and 1.0 cases were likely diagnosed, respectively. These revised estimates provide a more accurate assessment and better understanding of the burden of these diseases in a highly endemic county."
