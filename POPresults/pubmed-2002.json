		"abstract": "A greater understanding of the rate at which emerging disease advances spatially has both ecological and applied significance. Analyzing the spread of vector-borne disease can be relatively complex when the vector's acquisition of a pathogen and subsequent transmission to a host occur in different life stages. A contemporary example is Lyme disease. A long-lived tick vector acquires infection during the larval blood meal and transmits it as a nymph. We present a reaction-diffusion model for the ecological dynamics governing the velocity of the current epidemic's spread. We find that the equilibrium density of infectious tick nymphs (hence the risk of human disease) can depend on density-independent survival interacting with biotic effects on the tick's stage structure. The local risk of infection reaches a maximum at an intermediate level of adult tick mortality and at an intermediate rate of juvenile tick attacks on mammalian hosts. If the juvenile tick attack rate is low, an increase generates both a greater density of infectious nymphs and an increased spatial velocity. However, if the juvenile attack rate is relatively high, nymph density may decline while the epidemic's velocity still increases. Velocities of simulated two-dimensional epidemics correlate with the model pathogen's basic reproductive number (R0), but calculating R0 involves parameters of both host infection dynamics and the vector's stage-structured dynamics."

Positive significant correlations at p < 0.05 were found in all states between early summer disease incidence and the June moisture index in the region two years prior. These correlations may reflect an enhanced nymphal Ixodes scapularis survival under wetter conditions. In some states, significant correlations were observed related to warmer winter weather a year and a half prior to disease incidence, which may have been due to higher survival and activity levels of the white-footed mouse, an important host for I. scapularis ticks."

An understanding of this complex interplay will, hopefully, allow the development of new tools to block transmission of tick-borne agents."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis and other ticks in the Ixodes ricinus complex may transmit multiple pathogens, but research on coinfections has been limited. Coinfections occur with varying frequency in ticks, but single infections are more common than dual infections. The proportion of I. scapularis or I. ricinus ticks coinfected with both Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Anaplasma phagocytophila is generally low, ranging from < 1% to 6% in six geographic areas. A higher prevalence of tick coinfection (26%) has been reported in Westchester County, New York. Genetic variants of the human disease-causing strain of A. phagocytophila are present in some tick populations, and they may affect the risk of coinfection or clinical illness. The proportion of Ixodes ticks coinfected with B. burgdorferi and Babesia microti has ranged from 2% in New Jersey to 19% on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. In humans, cross-sectional seroprevalence studies have found markers of dual infection in 9-26% of patients with a tick-borne infection, but such studies often fail to distinguish simultaneous coinfection from sequential infections. Several studies have prospectively assessed the occurrence of acute coinfection. Among patients with a confirmed tick-borne infection, coinfection rates as high as 39% have been reported. The most commonly recognized coinfection in most of the eastern United States is Lyme borreliosis (LB) and babesiosis, accounting for approximately 80% of coinfections. LB and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis coinfections are less common, occurring in 3-15% of patients with a tick-borne infection in Connecticut or Wisconsin. Studies of clinical outcomes suggest that patients with acute Babesia coinfection have more severe symptoms and a longer duration of illness than patients with LB alone, but the risk of spirochete dissemination is similar. Coinfections can modify the immune response and alter the severity of arthritis in animal models. Future coinfection research should focus on long-term clinical outcomes, the role of genetic variants, immunologic effects, and the potential role of Bartonella species as tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Some patients have persistence of profound fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias without arthritis, dysesthesia/paresthesia, and mood and memory disturbances after standard courses of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. This constellation of symptoms has been variously referred to as \"chronic Lyme disease,\" \"post-Lyme disease syndrome,\" and \"post-treatment chronic Lyme disease.\" Persistent symptoms have been reported in patients who are seropositive for IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi as well as in patients who are seronegative. The cause or causes of persistent symptoms in these patients have not been clearly defined and are controversial. Because of the temporal association of these symptoms with infection with B. burgdorferi, some patients have been treated with prolonged courses of antibiotics. Case reports and uncontrolled trials have reported the efficacy of prolonged antibiotic therapy, often with relapse of the symptoms after discontinuation of therapy. To date, only one randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of antibiotic therapy for these patients has been published. An abstract of a second placebo-controlled trial of antibiotic therapy in a smaller cohort has also been presented. This paper will describe this patient population in detail and will review the clinical, microbiological, and selected biochemical and immunologic parameters and their responses to antibiotic treatment in the setting of a controlled trial."

		"abstract": "Among Borrelia spirochetes carried by hard ticks belonging to the various Ixodes species, at least 10 species can be distinguished. Of these, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is involved in human Lyme borreliosis in North America and Europe, and Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii in human disease in Europe and Asia. The pathogenetic significance of the other species is uncertain. Although some of the Borrelia species are restricted to certain tick species, Ixodes ricinus, the vector of Lyme borreliosis in Europe, can be infested by at least five different species, including all three pathogenic species. There is evidence that different Borrelia species are preferentially found in different hosts: In Europe, B. afzelii is frequently found in small mammals, whereas B. garinii and Borrelia valaisiana are often found in birds. This could very well be related to differential sensitivity of these species to complement-mediated bactericidal activity of different hosts. Borrelial complement regulator acquiring proteins, among them OspE or Erp proteins, bind to host factor H and related proteins, and this binding protects against activation of complement by the spirochetal surface. The binding is different for proteins originating from different species and is also depending on the host origin of factor H. In Europe, B. garinii is mainly found in neuroborreliosis, whereas in skin disease B. afzelii is more frequently found. The reason is unclear. The majority of human sera cross-react between proteins of different Borrelia species, but some sera react only with proteins from one of the species. This holds especially for reactivity with OspC. A vaccine against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto has been licensed, but was recently redrawn from the market because of commercial reasons. A vaccine protecting against all three pathogenic species is not yet available."

		"abstract": "Nervous system involvement in Lyme borreliosis is a much-feared, often-misunderstood disorder. Both the peripheral and central nervous systems may be involved, typically in a multifocal, patchy fashion, perhaps suggesting a vasocentric mechanism. Clinical manifestations vary widely, depending on the site and severity of involvement. Although neurologic manifestations observed in Europe differ somewhat from those reported in the United States, there are also striking similarities, permitting some generalization of information obtained in each population. In general, diagnosis of neurologic disease requires objective evidence of nervous system damage, and must be differentiated from both psychiatric disorders and metabolic encephalopathies, both of which typically occur in the absence of significant neurologic damage or infection. Laboratory confirmation of nervous system involvement by Borrelia burgdorferi has limitations. However, neurophysiologic testing of the peripheral nervous system, imaging of the neuraxis, and examination of the cerebrospinal fluid can all be informative. In contrast, to date functional brain imaging has been of limited specificity. Treatment with one of several straightforward antimicrobial regimens, typically 2-4 weeks in duration, generally results in microbiologic cure. Although some symptoms may persist after this, the data do not suggest that these are responsive to further antimicrobial therapy."

Several methods have been developed for direct detection of B. burgdorferi in infected vectors, host tissues, and clinical specimens from patients with Lyme borreliosis. These include microscope-based assays, antigen detection assays, in vitro cultivation, and nucleic acid-based detection of B. burgdorferi. The sensitivity and specificity of these methods depend on various factors and are also variable among laboratories. To date, only in vitro cultivation of B. burgdorferi has been widely accepted to confirm clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Nevertheless, various polymerase chain reaction-based molecular assays have shown increasing significance in the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis because of their high sensitivity, specificity, and capability for quantification and typing of spirochetes in clinical specimens. In this review, the currently available methods for direct detection of B. burgdorferi in clinical samples and quantitative analysis of spirochete load in different biological sources are discussed."

		"abstract": "Vaccination with Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein (Osp) A can induce a protective response against Lyme disease and serves as a model to understand the generation of protective immune responses against the spirochete. The innate response to pathogens is activated by specific Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular patterns. TLR2 is of particular interest for B. burgdorferi research because TLR2 recognizes several pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including lipoproteins. TLR2 may form heterodimers with TLR6 to identify diacylated lipoproteins, while TLR2 works in concert with TLR1 to recognize triacylated lipoproteins such as OspA. We will discuss the role of TLR1/2 in the development of responses to OspA in TLR1-and TLR2-deficient mice, and in selected individuals that received the OspA vaccine. While > 95% of human OspA-based Lyme disease vaccine recipients develop OspA antibodies, a very small group of individuals did not develop detectable humoral responses against OspA. We demonstrated that this hyporesponsiveness to OspA vaccination was associated with decreased cell surface expression of TLR1. Moreover, TLR1- and TLR2-deficient mice did not develop significant levels of OspA antibodies following vaccination with OspA, providing a correlation with human hyporesponsiveness to OspA. These data suggest that defects in the TLR1/2 signaling pathway are associated with an impaired ability to generate antibodies following immunization with OspA lipoprotein."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), the agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted to the host during the blood meal of Ixodes ticks. In most unfed ticks, spirochetes are present in the midgut and migrate during blood feeding to the salivary glands, from which they are transmitted to the host via saliva. In the present study, the efficiency of Ixodes ricinus ticks to transmit B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) and their infectivity for mice were examined in relation to the duration of the blood meal. In addition, we investigated whether these two Borrelia species can penetrate intact skin. Three modes of infection of mice were studied: tick-bite infection, inoculation of tick homogenates, and transcutaneous infection by topical application of tick homogenates on mouse skin. Transmission of B. burgdorferi sl from I. ricinus nymphs to mouse increased with duration of tick attachment. B. afzelii-infected ticks start to transmit infection earlier (< or = 48 h) than B. burgdorferi ss-infected ticks. As previously shown for B. burgdorferi ss in Ixodes scapularis, B. burgdorferi ss and B. afzelii in unfed I. ricinus were noninfectious for mice when tick homogenates were inoculated. However, the inoculation of homogenates of ticks fed for 24 h readily produced infection in mice. Therefore, B. burgdorferi ss and B. afzelii spirochetes are potentially infectious in the tick before natural transmission can occur. None of the mice (n = 33) became infected by transcutaneous transmission when tick homogenates were applied on mouse skin, showing that B. burgdorferi ss and B. afzelii are unable to penetrate intact skin, in contrast to relapsing fever spirochetes. This study also shows that B. afzelii is transmitted by I. ricinus to the host earlier than B. burgdorferi ss and that I. ricinus seems to be a more efficient vector of B. afzelii than B. burgdorferi ss."

Serum samples of patients suspected to suffer from Lyme borreliosis were used to validate the protein chip platform using biotinylated peptide AAOspC8 molecules as the test probes. Various experimental parameters such as the effect of concentration of probes, targets, temperature of incubation, and their effect on the resulting signal-to-noise ratio are described in detail. Highly specific protein interaction data with a high signal-to-noise ratio were obtained with serum sample solutions as low as 1 microL/spot (1/10 diluted)."

Illustrated by the German town of Lohr a. M. (Bavaria), the prevalence of TBE-virus and Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks was investigated and compared, and the respective risk of contracting disease from a bite assessed. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a total of 1657 ticks obtained from five different biotopes around Lohr were examined for the TBE-virus, and 408 ticks for Borrelia burgdorferi. The results were compared with earlier findings in other regions of Germany. The risk of contracting illness was estimated on the basis of transmission and manifestation rates, together with epidemiological data from the region. The prevalence of TBE-virus was 0.12% (95% CI: 0.05-0.44%) in the ticks investigated. This is comparable with that in 4 other regions rated as TBE-risk regions, but significantly lower than that in rated high-risk regions. Borrelia burgdorferi was detected in 14.9% (11.8-19.0%) of adult ticks, roughly twice the prevalence found in nymphs (7.2%, range 4.6-11.7%). On the basis of these prevalences, the risk of contracting meningitis/encephalitis from a tick bite is about 1:10,000, and the risk for Lyme Borreliosis is about 1:100, the latter requiring that the tick remains attached for at least 2-3 days."

Questionnaires regarding frequency of tick bites, symptoms of the disease in an acute phase and symptoms likely associated with previous infection were collected from 131 residents of Białowieza village, who suffered from Lyme disease in the past. Lower prevalence of erythema migrans and significantly higher prevalence of arthritis was demonstrated in the group of persons with the highest frequency of tick bites. Evaluation of symptoms that can be related to previous Lyme disease showed significant increase of arthralgia, myalgia, ischialgia, sleep and concentration difficulties in persons with higher frequency of tick bites. These results demonstrate, that multiple exposures to B. burgdorferi promote manifestation of the disease in the form of arthritis, and less frequently lead to the development of erythema migrans."

Rates of infection were determined both for nonvaccinated dogs and those that had been vaccinated with a whole-cell B. burgdorferi bacterin (Lyme Vax, Fort Dodge Animal Health) before 6 months of age and were boostered annually. Vaccinated dogs had an infection rate of 5% (8 of 163), whereas 64% (25 of 39) of the non-vaccinated dogs were positive for B. burgdorferi antibodies. The preventable fraction, determined by comparing infection rates in unvaccinated and vaccinated dogs, was 92.2% (95% confidence interval: 84.3% to 96.3%). In addition, screening of nonvaccinated dogs at six Connecticut clinics (Middletown, Portland, Essex, Old Lyme, Durham, and Marlborough) with the C6 ELISA test revealed infection rates ranging from 41% to 73%, demonstrating a high level of infected dogs in the area. It was concluded that emphasis should be placed on vaccinating young dogs at risk for Lyme disease before they are exposed to infected ticks. Results of this study support the value of immunization with this whole-cell Lyme disease bacterin for dogs at risk for infection by B. burgdorferi."

Three lizard species, the broad-headed skink Eumeces laticeps, southeastern 5-lined skink Eumeces inexpectatus, and eastern glass lizard Ophisaurus ventralis, were severely infested with larvae and nymphs of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. Ticks were not found on any of the other reptile species. Overall, 80% of 65 E. inexpectatus examined were parasitized by a mean intensity of 21.5 larvae and 88% were parasitized by a mean intensity of 4.8 nymphs. Corresponding figures for E. laticeps (n=56) were 93% and 51.3 for larvae and 89% and 7.4 for nymphs, and for O. ventralis (n=3) were 67% and 22.5 for larvae and 100% and 21.3 for nymphs. Larvae and nymphs attached along the lateral grooves of O. ventralis. Nymphs attached mainly behind the ears and in the foreleg axillae whereas larvae mainly attached to these sites and on the hindlegs in Eumeces spp. Seasonally, both larvae and nymphs were recorded on lizards from April through October. A unimodal larval peak was recorded in May or June. Seasonal data for nymphs did not reveal any distinct peaks but small bimodal peaks in mean intensities may have occurred (one in early summer, the other in late summer) suggesting that some ticks complete their life cycle in one year, and others in two years, on St. Catherine's Island. Potential epidemiological consequences of these findings with respect to Lyme disease in the southeastern United States are briefly addressed."

		"abstract": "To determine whether direct passage of spirochetes between co-feeding vector ticks contributes to the likelihood that the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia afzelii will perpetuate in nature, we compared the effects of time and space on transmission efficiency between simultaneously feeding ticks. The likelihood of co-feeding transmission increases with duration of attachment of the infecting tick. Co-feeding transmission becomes less efficient as distance from the infecting tick increases. Approximately 6 times as many ticks acquire infection when feeding on infected mice than when co-feeding with infected ticks. Both subadult stages of the wood tick Ixodes ricinus infrequently co-infest mice and voles in nature; on approximately 1 in 20 small rodents, larvae co-feed with spirochete-infected nymphs. Because only 1 in 100 larvae in nature appear to acquire spirochetal infection when co-feeding with infected nymphs, perpetuation of B. afzelii depends largely on horizontal transmission of such pathogens from previously infected mice to noninfected larvae."

In the summer season in the years of 2000-2001 a total of 439 Culex (Culex) pipiens pipiens larvae were collected from a barrel of rainwater in the Obrany holiday area of Brno city (East Moravia, Czech Republic). The larvae midgut was observed under dark-field microscopy. Ten DFM positive samples (2.28%) were further analysed using the single-tube nested PCR method for the presence of flagellum DNA sequence specific for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, of which 5 were positive. Borrelian positivity of Culex (C.) pipiens pipiens larvae was 1.14%. One spirochete isolated strain in BSK-H medium was obtained. PCR detection for borrelian DNA of the isolated strain was negative. From these results we can conclude that a low percentage Borreliae can be also found in mosquito larvae and are likely to survive into imago stage."

In dogs, B. burgdorferi s.l. has been implicated as a cause of various disorders often resembling those observed in human borreliosis, including polyarthropathy, anorexia, malaise, and neurological dysfunction. In areas infested with I. ricinus, and I. dammini in the USA and known to be endemic for Lyme disease, veterinarians may suspect borreliosis in dogs with limb/joint disorders. In serological diagnosis, it should be considered that the occurrence of even specific antibodies does not necessarily mean the active disease or primary exposition to the pathogen. Studies on antibody titers in the sera of dogs either naturally or experimentally infected, and on their associations with clinical symptoms, indicate the same limitations of serological tests as in the diagnostic of human Lyme disease; therefore, PCR is the most appropriate method of diagnosis."

The acute period of the disease may be associated with critical atrioventricular conduction abnormalities (complete heart block), supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias as well a left ventricular failure. Normally, Lyme carditis is completely reversible. Therefore the prognosis largely depends on the management of the acute complications and early antibiotic therapy. Even if the symptoms are spontaneously reversible, antibiotic therapy should be applied to prevent a chronic cardiomyopathy and other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. We report on a 47-year old patient with acute ECG changes initially suggesting an acute coronary syndrome. However, case history and the erythema migrans indicated an acute Lyme carditis which was confirmed serologically and by myocardial biopsy later."

The genetic identities of these Taiwan isolates (TWKM1-7) were clarified by comparing their restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and sequence similarities of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified intergenic spacer amplicon genes with 3 major genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes. Amplified-spacer DNAs were purified further and subjected to the cleavage by nuclease DraI or MseI. Differential fragment patterns in relation to different genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes were observed among tested Borrelia isolates, and all of these Taiwan isolates were closely related to the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The phylogenetic analysis also revealed that the sequence similarity of polymerase chain reaction-amplified spacer genes of these Taiwan isolates was highly homogeneous (95.7-100%) within the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and can be distinguished clearly from other genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes with a 4.1% sequence divergence. Based on the differential fragment patterns and sequence similarity among these Taiwan isolates, the genetic identity of these Taiwan isolates should be classified into the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto."

The phagocytic activity of peripheral blood neutrophils (percentage of phagocytic cells and fluorescence) was measured using standard cytometric flow assay (Phagotest-kit, Orpegen Pharma). The oxidative metabolism (percentage of bursting cells and fluorescence stimulated by Escherichia coli and PMA) was measured using cytometric flow assay (Burst-test, Orpegen Pharma). The results were statistically analysed using Mann-Whitney test. Evaluation of phagocytosis demonstrated no changes in the percentage of phagocytic cells. But fluorescence increased significantly after treatment. The comparison of oxidative metabolism activity showed no changes despite E. coli and PMA stimulation. Parameters of phagocytosis and oxidative metabolism did not correlate with neutrophil count in analysed groups of patients."

		"abstract": "Nuclear spin relaxation experiments performed at 298K, 308K and 318K are used to characterize the intramolecular dynamics and thermodynamics of outer surface protein A (OspA), a key protein in the life-cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. It has recently been demonstrated that OspA specifically binds to the gut of the intermediate tick host (Ixodes scapularis), and that this interaction is mediated, at least in part, by residues in the C-terminal domain of OspA that are largely inaccessible to solvent in all X-ray structures of this protein. Our analysis of 15N relaxation parameters in OspA shows that the putative-binding region contains and is surrounded by flexible residues, which could facilitate accessibility to solvent and ligands. In addition, residues with similar activation energies are clustered in a manner that suggests locally collective motions. We have used molecular modeling to show that these collective motions are consistent with a hinge-bending mechanism that exposes residues implicated in binding. Characteristic temperatures describing the energy landscape of the OspA backbone are derived from the temperature dependence of the N-H bond vector order parameters, and a comparison is made between the N and C-terminal globular domains and the unusual single-layer beta-sheet connecting them. The average characteristic temperatures in the three regions indicate that, with an increase in temperature, a larger increase in accessible conformational states occurs for N-H bond vectors in the single-layer central beta-sheet than for bond vectors in the globular N and C-terminal domains. These conformational states are accessible without disruption of hydrogen bonds, providing a conformational entropic gain, upon increase in temperature, without a significant enthalpic penalty. This increase in heat capacity may help to explain the unexpected thermal stability of the unusual single-layer beta-sheet."

Often, these studies have been undertaken in patients from different regions or countries, and using methods of varying sensitivity for detecting Borrelia burgdorferi infection. This study aimed to establish whether a relation could be demonstrated in the Highlands of Scotland, an area with endemic Lyme disease, with the use of a sensitive method for detecting the organism. The study was performed on biopsies of lesional skin taken from 16 patients from the Highlands of Scotland with typical clinical features of morphoea. After histological confirmation of the diagnosis, a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to a unique conserved region of the Borrelia burgdorferi flagellin gene was performed on DNA extracts from each biopsy. A literature search was also performed for comparable studies. None of the 16 patients had documented clinical evidence of previous infection with B burgdorferi. DNA was successfully extracted from 14 of the 16 cases but all of these were negative using PCR for B burgdorferi specific DNA, despite successful amplification of appropriate positive controls in every test. The results were compared with those of other documented studies. Examination of the literature suggests that there is a strong geographical relation between B burgdorferi and morphoea. These results, in which no such association was found, indicate that morphoea may not be associated with the subspecies of B burgdorferi found in the Highlands of Scotland."

The \"gold standard\" positive result for each of these samples was determined by Western immunoblot analysis (MarDx Marblot Test System) (n = 99) or clinical signs and symptoms suggestive of Lyme disease with other laboratory results positive for B. burgdorferi (n = 1). Based on these criteria for a gold standard positive result, 29 of the 100 samples tested were considered true positives and 71 were considered true negatives. The following sensitivities and specificities were noted, respectively, for each method: Borrelia DotBlot G, 93 and 90%; MarDx, 100 and 35%; and VIDAS, 100 and 92%. Because of high sensitivity and specificity and ease of use, the VIDAS test is an appealing method, especially for laboratories that perform high volumes of tests. The high sensitivity but low specificity of the MarDx method compared to the VIDAS and Borrelia DotBlot G methods requires that Western blot confirmatory tests be performed frequently. The Borrelia DotBlot G method has acceptable specificity but appears to lack sensitivity when compared to the VIDAS and MarDx methods."

		"abstract": "Human Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most prevalent arthropod-borne infection in temperate climate zones around the world and is caused by Borrelia spirochetes. We have identified 10 variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci present within the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi and subsequently developed a multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) typing system for this disease agent. We report here the successful application of MLVA for strain discrimination among a group of 41 globally diverse Borrelia isolates including B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii. PCR assays displayed diversity at these loci, with total allele numbers ranging from two to nine and Nei's diversity (D) values ranging from 0.10 to 0.87. The average D value was 0.53 across all VNTR loci. A clear correlation exists between the repeat copy number and the D value (r = 0.62) or the number of alleles (r = 0.93) observed across diverse strains. Cluster analysis by the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means resolved the 30 observed unique Borrelia genotypes into five distinct groups. B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii clustered into distinct affiliations, consistent with current 16S rRNA phylogeny studies. Genetic similarity and diversity suggest that B. afzelii and B. garinii are close relatives and were perhaps recently derived from B. burgdorferi. MLVA provides both phylogenetic relationships and additional resolution to discriminate among strains of Borrelia species. This new level of strain identification and discrimination will allow more detailed epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis in future studies."

Our study aimed to analyze technical details related to sample preparation and detection methods. Crucial for a successful urine PCR were (i) avoidance of the first morning urine sample; (ii) centrifugation at 36,000 x g; and (iii) the extraction method, with only DNAzol of the seven different extraction methods used yielding positive results with patient urine specimens. Furthermore, storage of frozen urine samples at -80 degrees C reduced the sensitivity of a positive urine PCR result obtained with samples from 72 untreated erythema migrans (EM) patients from 85% in the first 3 months to <30% after more than 3 months. Bands were detected at 276 bp on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels after amplification by a nested PCR. The specificity of bands for 32 of 33 samples was proven by hybridization with a GEN-ETI-K-DEIA kit and for a 10 further positive amplicons by sequencing. By using all of these steps to optimize the urine PCR technique, B. burgdorferi infection could be diagnosed by using urine samples from EM patients with a sensitivity (85%) substantially better than that of serological methods (50%). This improved method could be of future importance as an additional laboratory technique for the diagnosis of unclear, unrecognized borrelia infections and diseases possibly related to Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Being born in winter and spring is considered one of the most robust epidemiological risk factors for schizophrenia. The aetiology and exact timing of this birth excess, however, has remained elusive so far. Since during phylogeny, Borrelia DNA has led to multiple germ-line mutations within the CB1 candidate gene for schizophrenia, a meta analysis has been performed of all papers on schizophrenic birth excesses with no less than 3000 cases each. All published numerical data were then plotted against the seasonal distributions of Ixodes ticks worldwide. RESULTS: In the United States, Europe and Japan the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop schizophrenia mirror the seasonal distribution of Ixodes ticks nine months earlier at the time of conception. South of the Wallace Line, which limits the spread of Ixodes ticks and Borrelia burgdorferi into Australia, seasonal trends are less significant, and in Singapore, being non-endemic for Ixodes ticks and Lyme disease, schizophrenic birth excesses are absent. CONCLUSION: At present, it cannot be excluded that prenatal infection by B. burgdorferi is harmful to the implanting human blastocyst. The epidemiological clustering of sporadic schizophrenia by season and locality rather emphasises the risk to the unborn of developing a congenital, yet preventable brain disorder later in life."

The utility of a commercially available in-office test kit (SNAP 3Dx, IDEXX Laboratories) for the simultaneous detection of Borrelia burgdorferi and Ehrlichia canis antibodies and Dirofilaria immitis antigen was evaluated for its ability to detect exposure to B. burgdorferi in both vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs from a highly Lyme-endemic area of Connecticut. The test kit is an ELISA that uses a synthetic peptide (C6) that duplicates the sequence of the IR6 region. The in-office C6 ELISA kit was found to be particularly useful in Lyme-endemic areas because it can be used conveniently and reliably in the clinic to determine a dog's infection status regardless of the vaccination history of the animal."

The aim of this study was to investigate the function of the P13 protein. Here, we inactivated the p13 gene by targeted mutagenesis and investigated the porin activities of outer membrane proteins by using lipid bilayer experiments. Channel-forming activity was lost in the p13 mutant compared to wild-type B. burgdorferi, indicating that P13 may function as a porin. We purified native P13 to homogeneity by fast performance liquid chromatography and demonstrated that pure P13 has channel-forming activity with a single-channel conductance in 1 M KCl of 3.5 nS, the same as the porin activity that was lost in the p13 mutant. Further characterization of the channel formed by P13 suggested that it is cation selective and voltage independent. In addition, no major physiological effects of the inactivated p13 gene could be detected under normal growth conditions. The inactivation of p13 is the first reported inactivation of a gene encoding an integral outer membrane protein in B. burgdorferi. Here, we describe both genetic and biophysical experiments indicating that P13 in B. burgdorferi is an outer membrane protein with porin activity."

The bdr genes of B. burgdorferi encode proteins that form three distinct subfamilies, the BdrD, BdrE, and BdrF subfamilies. bdr orthologs have been demonstrated to be carried by all Borrelia species analyzed, and their widespread distribution suggests that they play an important genus-wide functional role. The biological rationale for maintaining 18 bdr alleles has not been defined. It is our hypothesis that specific paralogs function in different environments and are differentially expressed in response to environmental conditions. As a first step in testing this hypothesis, the production patterns of the Bdr proteins in spirochetes grown under a variety of conditions were assessed through immunoblot analyses. The influence of temperature, serum deprivation, tick feeding, and the mammalian environment on Bdr production was evaluated. These analyses revealed that the synthesis of some Bdr paralogs is environmentally regulated. The production of BdrF(2,) BdrF(1), BdrE(4), and BdrE(5) were upregulated in host-adapted bacteria, while the production levels of other Bdr paralogs were influenced by temperature and serum starvation. These observations suggest that different Bdr paralogs function in different biological environments and provide insight into the biological basis for maintaining multiple members of this gene family."

In this context sarcoidosis generally reveals the highest incidence of such bone marrow lesions. Other granulomas may be encountered in drug-induced secondary changes (toxic myelopathy) and in particular also in HIV myelopathy. In these cases the granulomas are small, ill-defined and difficult to recognize. Special staining methods are required to detect microorganisms. Fibrin ring granulomas (doughnut granulomas) are typical for Q-fever, but may also be seen in reactive conditions, after drug therapy and in the course of other infectious disorders, such as Lyme disease. Therefore a broad serological testing should be performed. In conclusion, in most cases the morphological findings in the bone marrow are not specific so that a synoptical approach regarding histological, clinical and serological data is warranted to reach the correct diagnosis."

The disease is multisystemic, and chronic disease, in particular, may be associated with neuropsychological deficits. However, to date, only a few empirical studies exist, which examine the neuropsychological sequelae associated with chronic Lyme disease. A review of the literature shows that the deficits observed in adults with chronic Lyme disease are generally consistent with the deficits that can be seen in processes with primarily frontal systems involvement. These observations are generally consistent with neuroradiologic findings. The clinical presentation in chronic Lyme disease and the nature of the neuropsychological deficits are discussed, as are several central issues in understanding neuropsychological functioning in chronic Lyme disease, such as the impact of chronic illness, response to treatment, and the relationship between neuropsychological performance and depression, fatigue, and neurological indicators of disease."

The inducible isoform of Cox-2 has been implicated in inflammation and its specific inhibition can be used to treat noninfectious inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, can induce joint inflammation. Here we show that B. burgdorferi induced the upregulation of cox-2 gene expression in murine joints at the onset of arthritis in infected mice. The level of mRNA expression correlated with the degree of inflammation. The specific inhibition of Cox-2 diminished the degree of joint inflammation, without affecting B. burgdorferi-specific antibody or cytokine responses. Cox-2 activity is therefore associated with the genesis of infectious arthritis caused by B. burgdorferi."

Data were reviewed for adult patients with erythema migrans diagnosed at our institution from 1994 to July 2001, targeting those who received antibiotics after a tick bite. Seven of 5056 (0.14%) patients, diagnosed with typical erythema migrans, developed the skin lesion despite receiving antibiotics after a tick bite. Antibiotics were prescribed by general physicians: in four cases as prophylaxis of Lyme borreliosis within one day after tick detachment and in three cases because of development of acute respiratory tract infection two, five, and eight days after the bite, respectively. The dosages were as follows: azithromycin in a total dose of 3 g in three patients and 1.5 g in the fourth patient, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid 625 mg t.i.d. for ten days in the fifth patient, amoxycillin 500 mg t.i.d. for seven days followed by azithromycin 250 mg o.d. for eight days in the sixth, and amoxycillin 500 mg t.i.d. for eight days in the seventh. The patients (five females and two males, aged 18-61 years) were referred to our Department on average six (1-19) days after the appearance of skin lesions. They had typical solitary (five patients) or multiple (two patients) erythema migrans with the characteristics usually seen in European patients, except for a rather long incubation period (median value 28 days, range 10-40 days). All laboratory tests, including the examination of cerebrospinal fluid in three patients with the disseminated form of the illness, were within normal range. Borrelial antibodies were demonstrated in only one patient. A skin biopsy specimen obtained from the site of the erythema migrans was culture positive for Borrelia in 2/4 patients. Our study did not enable us to assess the frequency of antimicrobial prophylaxis failure or the efficacy of individual antibiotics for the prevention of Lyme borreliosis. However, the seven patients presented demonstrate that antibiotic prophylaxis for Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite, at least in Europe, is not entirely effective."

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and indirect immunofluorescence assay were used for the detection of tick-borne encephalitis, ixodid tick-borne borreliosis and ehrlichiosis specific antibodies. Tick-borne encephalitis was diagnosed in 22.8% of patients, ixodid tick-borne borreliosis in 50.5%, ehrlichiosis in 4.5% and mixed infections in 2.9%. For the first time in Russia, a new transmitted disease that appeared to be human monocytic ehrlichiosis was identified and its clinical manifestations were described. The common feature of these infections is the acute course and the marked general infectious syndrome at the early period of the disease. Disorders of the nervous system predominate in tick-borne encephalitis. In ixodid tick-borne borreliosis the development of erythema migrans and organic pathology (disorders of the cardio-vascular system and liver) associated with the involvement of the nervous and locomotor system are pathognomonically significant. The specific characteristics of human monocytic ehrlichiosis include nervous impairments, hepatic lesions, the frequent development of a two-wave course and hemogram changes."

Sera, synovial (SF) and cerebro-spinal fluids (CSF) were obtained from 90 patients with clinical symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. Serum samples were tested with recombinant ELISA and Western blot assay. Citrated blood, cerebrospinal and synovial fluids samples were cultured in cell line and tested by PCR to detect spirochetes. No correlation was found between levels of specific B. burgdorferi antibodies detected with a recombinant antigen ELISA and the number of protein fractions developed with these antibodies by immunoblot. Moreover, Lyme borreliosis patients who have live spirochetes in body fluids have low or negative levels of borrelial antibodies in their sera. This indicates that an efficient diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis has to be based on a combination of various techniques such as serology, PCR and culture, not solely on serology."

We report on the results of a Lyme disease proficiency testing program which is regularly organised twice a year by our institutions in close cooperation with the Institute of Standardisation in the Medical Laboratory (INSTAND). From 1999 to 2001, between 226 and 337 microbiological laboratories participated in each of the four surveys that have been held so far. In addition, between 23 and 30 laboratories from 13 other European countries also participated in each trial. In each survey two serum samples which had been unambiguously characterised by six reference laboratories to contain or not to contain antibodies against the Lyme disease spirochete were distributed in order to determine the accuracy of the diagnostic methods used in participating laboratories. The laboratories also reported interpretative statements of whether or not the test constellation suggested a possible borrelial infection and if an early or late phase of the specific antibody response was suspected. Test results were found to be in part highly variable and clearly correlated with the manufacturers and the applied test methodology. It was also clear that IgM tests were more difficult to handle than were IgG tests. ELISA-testing was more reproducible and proved to be more sensitive and specific than IFA and IHA testing. Quantification of test results and reporting of specific immunoblot bands also showed high variability. Moreover, for some assays a high number of false positive and false negative test results were reported by the participants. In view of our results further standardisation of Lyme disease serology is not just desirable but is urgently needed. Moreover, stronger criteria for the validation of available test kits must be applied."

		"abstract": "The use of recombinant proteins for serologic testing represents a modern approach for the improved laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease (LD). The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a new recombinant ELISA (RE) for the detection of specific IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. The RE (Biotest AG, Dreieich, Germany) uses mixtures of recombinant p100, OspC, p18 of Borrelia afzelii and a fusion protein of recombinant internal fragments of the flagellum protein (p41) of Borrelia garinii strain PBi and Borrelia afzelii strain PKo. Serologic testing was performed on a commercially available ELISA processor without pre-absorption of sera. The sensitivity of the RE was determined by testing 226 sera obtained from patients suffering from Lyme disease (stage I: n = 148, stage II: n = 35, stage III: n = 43). Specificity of the RE was evaluated in 1107 sera from healthy blood donors and 275 sera from patients with other infectious diseases or autoimmune illnesses (leptospirosis: n = 53, syphilis: n = 70, toxoplasmosis: n = 60, herpes simplex virus: n = 30, HIV: n = 30; rheumatoid-factor positive: n = 32). In addition, 394 routine samples were prospectively tested in comparison with a well established whole-cell lysate extract ELISA (ENZYGNOST Borreliosis, DadeBehring, Germany) for relative sensitivity and specificity. Overall specificity, determined in 1107 healthy blood donors and 275 sera from patients with other diseases, was 94% for IgG and 91% for IgM. The overall sensitivities in 226 sera obtained from patients suffering from different stages of LD were 67-95%. Moreover, as revealed by prospective testing of 394 routine samples, the relative sensitivity of the RE in comparison with an established whole-cell lysate extract ELISA in the detection of seropositive samples was 81.1% for IgG and 86.5% for IgM with a relative specificity of 98.5% and 93% respectively. The ELISAs showed an overall agreement of 97% for IgG and 92.4% for IgM test results. The RE proved to be a reliable and specific screening test in the routine serodiagnosis of LD. In addition, the RE is easy to perform and requires no pre-absorption."

		"abstract": "It has been demonstrated recently that cells of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, transform from mobile spirochetes into nonmotile cystic forms in the presence of certain unfavourable conditions, and that cystic forms are able to reconvert to vegetative spirochetes in vitro and in vivo. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinetics of conversion of borreliae to cysts in different stress conditions such as starvation media or the presence of different antibiotics. Using the same experimental conditions we also investigated the possible role in cyst formation of RpoS, an alternative sigma factor that controls a regulon in response to starvation and transition to stationary phase. We observed that beta-lactams penicillin G and ceftriaxone, the antibiotics of choice in Lyme borreliosis treatment, favoured the production of cysts when used with serum-depleted BSK medium. In contrast, we observed a low level of cyst formation in the presence of macrolides and tetracyclines. In order to elucidate the role of the rpoS gene in cyst formation we analyzed the reaction of the rpoS mutant strain in comparison with its wild-type in different conditions. Under the same stimuli, both the wild-type borrelia and the rpoS knock-out isogenic strain produced cystic forms with similar kinetics, thus excluding the participation of the gene in this phenomenon. Our findings suggest that cyst formation is mainly due to a physical-chemical rearrangement of the outer membrane of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato leading to membrane fusion and controlled by different regulation mechanisms."

		"abstract": "The innate immune system, particularly the host complement system, plays an important role in the elimination of invading pathogens. Borrelia burgdorferi, like other human pathogens, has developed strategies to prevent complement-mediated bacteriolysis. It is now well established that Borrelia differ in their complement resistance. In general terms, B. afzelii isolates are mainly resistant to complement-mediated bacteriolysis, whereas the majority of B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates display an intermediate complement-resistant phenotype. Most of the B. garinii isolates, in contrast, are efficiently killed by complement and, therefore, are classified as complement-sensitive. Complement resistance of B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates correlates directly with the acquisition of the fluid-phase human complement regulators FHL-1/reconectin and factor H. To date, five distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) have been identified in B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates. The individual CRASPs can be differentiated according to their size and their binding properties to FHL-1/reconectin and factor H. The domains that interact with CRASPs are localized at the C-terminal ends of these complement regulators. Thus, CRASPs represent a family of functional proteins involved in complement resistance of Borrelia. Furthermore, an alterable pattern of gene expression was observed for three CRASPs of B. afzelii: BaCRASP-1, BaCRASP-2, and BaCRASP-5 are up-regulated at 37 degrees C and down-regulated at 20 degrees C. The continued characterization of CRASPs at the molecular level is expected to identify new virulence factors and potential vaccine candidates."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a 2 steps disease: i) Localized erythema migrans ii) occasionally a disseminated disease. Three out of the 10 up to now described Borrelia species are pathogenic for man and each of them exhibits its own organotropism: joints for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (B.b. ss), nervous system for B. garinii, skin for B. afzelii, ospc gene is subject to lateral transfer leading to a huge diversity among corresponding encoded proteins. This allows the spirochete to develop a repertoire of epitopes to escape the host immune response. We noticed that the European endemic ospc repertoire is only a subset of the American one. This bottleneck situation transduces a \"founder's event\" suggesting B.b. ss has been imported from North America to Europe at historical times. Another valuable observation is the fact that isolates from disseminated forms (called \"invasive\") of the disease, all are distributed in only ten out of the 70 ospc genotypes. The conclusion is that in human, some OspC conformations are associated with the invasive potential of a given Borrelia isolate."

Forty-eight Borrelia strains isolated from diverse clinical materials and two tick strains were analyzed. Each of the 50 isolates analyzed by PFGE was found to be a single species: 30 B. afzelii, 14 B. garinii, and 6 B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. PCR amplification of 16S rRNA with species-specific primers revealed a single species in 41/50 samples and in nine samples two species were detected. PCR of the 5S-23S interspace region restricted with MseI restriction endonuclease detected a single species in 48/50 samples and a mixture of two species was found in 2/50 samples. In all cases where a single species was identified using PCR the species was in accordance with the PFGE result, and in all cases where a mixture of two species was identified by PCR one of the species was the same as that detected by PFGE. Using a criterion of complete concordance of the results a significant difference in species identification was found when PFGE and the 16S rRNA PCR were compared (p = 0.0026), but not between 5S-23S interspace PCR and PFGE (p = 0.4949) or between 16S rRNA and 5S-23S interspace PCRs (p = 0.0552). PCR assays were faster and easier to perform than PFGE for Borrelia species identification, however PFGE remains a standard procedure for analyzing isolates and demonstrating heterogeneity within species."

The vast majority of strains (605; 86%) were isolated from skin, 58 (8%) from blood, and 43 (6%) from CSF. When analysed by RFLP, B. afzelii strains were unique, while heterogeneity was found within B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto species. An unusual plasmid content was found in 52/706 (7%) isolated strains, more often in B. garinii than in B. afzelii strains. A plasmid dimer was found in B. afzelii and B. garinii strains, whereas multiple copies of the large plasmid were associated nearly exclusively with B. garinii strains. Analysis of protein profiles revealed that OspA and OspB are expressed more often by B. afzelii strains, and OspC by B. garinii strains. Heterogeneity of Borrelia strains may play a significant role in the virulence and pathogenesis of the infection. Differences in antigenic components have an important impact on serological testing and vaccine development."

We assessed central nervous system involvement by examining cerebrospinal fluid samples in a group of such patients.

None of the 77 patients included in the study (median duration of symptoms 18 months) had pleocytosis and there was no isolation of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato from cerebrospinal fluid. Mildly elevated protein concentration and intrathecal borrelial IgG antibody synthesis were demonstrated in 16 (21%) and 7 (9.1%) patients, respectively. In patients with non-specific long-lasting symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis but with the absence of overt clinical signs suggesting central nervous system involvement, the findings of cerebrospinal fluid examination are usually in the normal range.

On clinical examination, typical livid-red discoloration of the skin distally from the left elbow was evident with atrophy on the dorsum of the hand. Nodules with diameters from 0.5 to 2 cm were present around the olecranon and along the ulnar region. The indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) without absorption in serum revealed negative borrelial IgM and positive IgG (1:512) antibody titres. Histological findings on tissue specimens were compatible with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and fibrous nodule tissue, respectively. Cultures in MKP medium of biopsy specimens from the involved skin and from one of the nodules were positive. Both isolates were identified as B. afzelii with concordant protein and plasmid profiles. The patient received a 3-week course of ceftriaxone (2 g daily, i.v.). Her condition progressively improved: pains and swelling vanished by the end of treatment, fibrous nodules diminished and skin lesions gradually began to fade.

Patients were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of 20 consecutive patients with typical solitary erythema migrans, representing early localised Lyme borreliosis, the second group comprised 20 patients with early disseminated Lyme borreliosis (10 with multiple erythema migrans and 10 with neuroborreliosis), and 10 patients with acrodermatitis chronica athrophicans represented the group with chronic Lyme borreliosis. Blood specimens were taken from all patients included in the study, but CSF samples were restricted to those with disseminated and chronic Lyme borreliosis. The serum and CSF procalcitonin levels were determined utilizing the LUMI PCT (an immunoluminometric assay using two antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies). Serum and CSF procalcitonin levels were in normal range in the large majority of patients. The levels of serum procalcitonin did not differ in the three groups of patients with Lyme borreliosis (p = 0.5006). The corresponding values for patients with solitary erythema migrans (early localised Lyme borreliosis), early disseminated Lyme borreliosis, and chronic Lyme borreliosis were 0.26 (0.11-0.43), 0.22 (0.10-0.67), and 0.28 (0.13-0.66) microgram/ml, respectively. Moreover, procalcitonin levels in CSF were also low and comparable for patients with multiple erythema migrans (median 0.38, range 0.24-0.54 microgram/ml), neuroborreliosis (median 0.16, range 0.10-0.47 microgram/ml), and acrodermatitis chronica athrophicans (median 0.30, range 0.15-0.45 microgram/ml). The differences were not statistically significant (p = 0.7579). In the large majority of patients with Lyme borreliosis procalcitonin values are within normal range. Serum and CSF procalcitonin levels are of no value for differentiation between early localised, early disseminated and chronic Lyme borreliosis."

Compared with the group with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings, patients with pleocytosis more often reported having had Lyme borreliosis in the past (8/55 versus 3/159; p = 0.0011), had longer incubation periods (25.5 versus 14 days; p = 0.0269), larger diameter of the largest erythema migrans at the time of first examination (10 versus 5.5 cm; p = 0.0055), higher frequency of associated systemic symptoms (45.5% versus 21.4%; p = 0.0011), positive meningeal signs (10.9% versus 1.9%; p = 0.0100), borrelial IgG antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (3/49 versus 0/150; p = 0.0142) and B. burgdorferi s.l. isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (7/52 versus 1/147; p = 0.0004), but less often had mild initial disease (67.3% versus 88.7%; p = 0.0006). Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was detected in 25.7% of children with multiple erythema migrans. Although several clinical and laboratory abnormalities were present significantly more often in patients with elevated cell counts than with normal cerebrospinal fluid findings, discriminatory significance for the majority of these abnormalities was low, particularly because of low negative predictive values. In more than 2/3 of patients with pleocytosis the initial disease was mild, fewer than 1/2 reported systemic symptoms, and meningeal signs were expressed in only 11%."

		"abstract": "During the period from 1986 to 2000, 85 adult patients with solitary borrelial lymphocytoma were diagnosed at the Department of Infectious Diseases, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Slovenia. There were 36 (42.4%) females and 49 (57.6%) males with a median age of 49 (15-74) years. Borrelial lymphocytoma was located on the breast (nipple--areola mammae region) in 68 (80%) patients, on the ear lobe in eight (9.4%), and in other locations in nine (10.6%). A concomitant erythema migrans enabling clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was registered or reported in 67 (78.8%) patients. Fifteen (17.6%) patients had no accompanying symptoms, 34 (40%) reported local and constitutional symptoms, 23 (27.1%) recounted only local symptoms, and 13 (15.3%) patients had solely constitutional symptoms. Clinical findings indicating early disseminated borrelial infection were observed at the first visit in 12 (14.1%) patients: six (7.1%) had multiple erythema migrans, one had meningitis, one meningoradiculitis and arthritis, one radiculoneuritis and arthritis, one peripheral facial palsy and concomitant meningitis, and two arthritis. In addition, one of the patients with borrelial lymphocytoma on the breast had acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. A seropositive response to borrelial antigens was found in 30 (35.3%) patients at the initial examination. In 11/46 (23.9%) patients, infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was confirmed by isolation of the agent from lymphocytoma tissue. Eight out of nine (88.9%) typed borrelial strains were found to be B. afzelii, and one (11.1%) B. bissettii. Patients were treated with doxycycline, azithromycin, amoxycillin, cefuroxime-axetil, phenoxymethylpenicillin, or ceftriaxone. Median time to complete disappearance of lymphocytoma was 28 days (range 7-270 days) after the institution of antibiotic treatment; disappearance took longer in patients with prolonged duration of the skin lesion prior to treatment. Treatment failure was registered in 11 (12.9%) patients who were later re-treated. The outcome of borrelial infection assessed at the end of a follow-up period of one year was favourable."

Consecutive patients younger than 15 years, referred to our institution in 1998 and 1999 with previously untreated typical solitary erythema migrans, were included in this prospective study. Basic demographic features and clinical data were collected by means of a questionnaire. The efficiency of treatment of acute disease, development of later major and/or minor manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and side effects of treatment were surveyed by follow-up visits during the first year. Forty-two patients received azithromycin 20 mg/kg/day for the first day followed by 10 mg/kg/day for a further four days and phenoxymethylpenicillin 100,000 IU/kg/day for 14 days. No differences in demographic and clinical pre-treatment characteristics were present in the two groups, with the exception of the duration of erythema migrans before treatment (3 days in the azithromycin group versus 4 days in the phenoxymethylpenicillin group; p = 0.0320). The clinical course during the post-treatment period revealed no significant differences between the two groups in the duration of EM (3 days versus 4 days; p = 0.2471), the appearance of minor manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (17.5% in the azithromycin group versus 24.4% in the phenoxymethyl-penicillin group; p = 0.6252), or in the emergence of major manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (one patient in each treatment group). One year after antibiotic treatment all patients were asymptomatic. Side effects of treatment were observed in 5.3% of patients treated with azithromycin and in 6% treated with phenoxymethylpenicillin. The appearance of \"Herxheimer's reaction\" at the beginning of treatment was recorded in 7 out of 42 patients (6%) in each treatment group. Azithromycin and phenoxymethylpenicillin are equally effective in treatment of children with solitary erythema migrans and have comparable side effects."

Scutal index is the ratio between body length and scutum width and was found to be an objective indicator of the duration of Ixodes scapularis tick attachment, but no data for I. ricinus have been published. In this preliminary report on 30 volunteers with an attached I. ricinus tick (21 had an adult female tick and 9 a nymph), none developed any sign of Lyme borreliosis but we were able to demonstrate two asymptomatic seroconversions in a six-week follow-up period. Twenty-six (87%) volunteers claimed that they were able to determine the approximate duration of tick attachment; participants with attached adult female ticks estimated the duration of attachment to be 30 (2-90) hours, while those with attached nymphs reported 48 (18-90) hours (p = 0.681). Scutal indices were 3.2 (2-5) for nymphs and 3.2 (1-5) for adult ticks, indicating 60- and 48-hour attachment, respectively. According to the volunteers' assessment and scutal index findings, approximately 80% and 45% of adult female ticks were removed within 48 hours after the tick bite (p = 0.032), respectively, while the corresponding values for nymphs were 85% and 17% (p = 0.053). Our findings were limited by low numbers of volunteers and by the lack of experimental data on the value of the scutal index for estimation of the duration of I. ricinus tick attachment."

The occurrence of coinfection with the agents of Lyme borreliosis and tularemia was assessed in different species of rodents. Organs of small mammals, live-trapped mostly in six-week intervals from May 1994 to April 1995, were cultured on appropriate media in order to grow borreliae and F. tularensis. Infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. and also with F. tularensis was found in all the most abundant rodent species. A significant difference was observed in the time period of isolation of these agents. Borrelia was cultured from May to January (PCR detected borrelia up to April), while F. tularensis was isolated from August to December. Coinfection was seen in two species of voles, Clethrionomys glareolus trapped in August and Microtus arvalis in October. The Borrelia strains isolated from these animals were identified as B. garinii. Isolates of F. tularensis belonged to the subspecies holarctica, biovar II. Results obtained indicate that in endemic regions for tularemia the prevalence of infection with borreliae could be modified in different animal species mainly during epizootic outbreaks of tularemia."

		"abstract": "Inflammation in skeletal muscle is a consistent feature of Lyme borreliosis, both in the human disease and experimental models. This study had two goals: to evaluate the expression of selected pro-inflammatory and chemokine genes in skeletal muscle in the Rhesus model of Lyme disease, and to identify unexpected cytokine genes involved in Lyme myositis. Two different techniques for measuring cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were used to achieve these goals: gene expression microarrays and. real-time RT-PCR (Taqman). Muscle from necropsies and biopsies were used, and were obtained from both infected and uninfected non-human primates (NHPs). Although many cytokines were found expressed in muscle tissue, pro-inflammatory cytokines commonly associated with inflammation were not consistently upregulated in infected muscles relative to uninfected muscles. However, B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (BLC), a chemokine implicated in the trafficking of B-cells into tissue, was increased in expression. This study is the first to extensively characterize cytokine gene expression in chronically inflamed tissue in Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The importance of laboratory methods for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis is often overestimated now. The role of several methods including MRI, evoked potentials, examination of the cerebrospinal fluid and some others methods are discussed in this review. Several conditions may in some patients mimick the appearance of MS and it is easy to understand why there is a tendency among many clinicians to embark on extensive- and expensive-laboratory investigations to establish the correct diagnosis at early stages of the disease. Disorders like cerebrovascular diseases, vasculitis, Lyme disease, neurosarcoidosis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HIV-associated encephalitis may cause very close changes of the results of these examinations. A detailed, exhaustive history and the neurological examination, along with a careful scrutiny of the actual MRI films by the neurologist experienced in the diagnosis of MS, will obviate the need for additional tests in the overwhelming majority of cases. So, the MS diagnosis and differential diagnosis is still based mainly of the data of clinical observation."

We studied the immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibody response to N40Br, a sensu stricto strain, in the rhesus macaque(nonhuman primate [NHP]) model of infection to identify the spirochetal protein targets of specific antibody. Antigens used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were whole-cell sonicates of the spirochete and recombinant proteins of B. burgdorferi. Immunoblotting with a commercially available strip and subsequent quantitative densitometry of the bands were also used. Sera from four different groups of NHPs were used: immunocompetent, transiently immunosuppressed, extended immunosuppressed, and uninfected. In immunocompetent and transiently immunosuppressed NHPs, there was a strong IgM and IgG response. Major proteins for the early IgM response were P39 and P41 and recombinant BmpA and OspC. Major proteins for the later IgG response were P39, P41, P18, P60, P66, and recombinant BmpA and DbpA. There was no significant response in the NHPs to recombinant OspA or to Arp, a 37-kDa protein that elicits an antibody response during infection in mice. Most antibody responses, except for that to DbpA, were markedly diminished by prolonged dexamethasone treatment. This study supports the hypothesis that recombinant proteins may provide a useful adjunct to current diagnostic testing for Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Presently, the rhesus macaque is the only nonhuman primate animal model utilized for the study of Lyme disease. While this animal model closely mimics human disease, rhesus macaques can harbor the herpes B virus, which is often lethal to humans; macaques also do not express the full complement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclasses found in humans. Conversely, baboons contain the full complement of IgG subclasses and do not harbor the herpes B virus. For these reasons, baboons have been increasingly utilized as the basis for models of infectious diseases and studies assessing the safety and immunogenicity of new vaccines. Here we analyzed the capability of baboons to become infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. Combined culture and PCR analyses of tick- and syringe-infected animals indicated that baboons are a sufficient host for B. burgdorferi. Analysis of the antibody responses in infected baboons over a 48-week period revealed that antibodies are generated early during infection against many borrelial antigens, including the various OspE, OspF, and Elp paralogs that are encoded on the ubiquitous 32-kb circular plasmids (cp32s). By using the baboon sera generated by experimental infection it was determined that a combination of two cp32-encoded lipoproteins, OspE and ElpB1, resulted in highly specific and sensitive detection of B. burgdorferi infection. An expanded analysis, which included 39 different human Lyme disease patients, revealed that a combination of the OspE and ElpB1 lipoproteins could be the basis for a new serodiagnostic assay for Lyme disease. Importantly, this novel serodiagnostic test would be useful independent of prior OspA vaccination status."

TBE virus is the most frequent virus associated with potentially severe neurological lesions. No treatment is available so far. The most frequent bacterial diseases in which neurological complications may appear are Lyme borreliosis, Q fever and some rickettsial infections. More recently ehrlichiosis have emerged as new infections that may be associated with neuro-meningeal complications. Appropriate antibiotic therapy may be used for the treatment of these bacterial infections, but no vaccine is available so far."

		"abstract": "Xenodiagnosis by ticks was used to determine whether spirochetes persist in mice after 1 month of antibiotic therapy for vectorborne Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Immunofluorescence and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to show that spirochetes could be found in Ixodes scapularis ticks feeding on 4 of 10 antibiotic-treated mice up to 3 months after therapy. These spirochetes could not be transmitted to naive mice, and some lacked genes on plasmids correlating with infectivity. By 6 months, antibiotic-treated mice no longer tested positive by xenodiagnosis, and cortisone immunosuppression did not alter this result. Nine months after treatment, low levels of spirochete DNA could be detected by real-time PCR in a subset of antibiotic-treated mice. In contrast to sham-treated mice, antibiotic-treated mice did not have culture or histopathologic evidence of persistent infection. These results provide evidence that noninfectious spirochetes can persist for a limited duration after antibiotics but are not associated with disease in mice."

		"abstract": "We analyzed expression of a putative oligopeptide permease (Opp) of Borrelia burgdorferi. Unlike the opp operons of other bacteria for which there is a single substrate binding protein, B. burgdorferi codes for three substrate binding proteins (OppA-I to -III) in its opp operon and an additional two homologs on plasmids (OppA-IV and -V). Instead of a single promoter region regulating transcription of the entire operon, as seen in other bacterial opp operons, it appears that among oppA-I, -II, and -III, as well as oppA-IV and -V, each has a potential upstream promoter region. We tested the function of these putative promoter sequences by fusion to a promoterless beta-galactosidase reporter gene in pCB182. Each of the promoter regions was found to be active. The level of activity in the reporter constructs closely paralleled the level of expression of each gene in in vitro-grown B. burgdorferi. Changes in carbon and nitrogen availability differentially affected individual promoters, but no changes in promoter activity were seen when Escherichia coli bacteria (with the promoter constructs) were grown in various concentrations of phosphate and leucine and changes in pH. Expression of specific oppA genes with B. burgdorferi varied significantly between its mouse and fed and unfed tick hosts. Differences in regulation of opp gene expression suggest a potential role in environmental response by the organism."

We found highly significant genetic differentiation between Swiss and Tunisian samples but detected almost no differentiation within Switzerland, even between those samples separated by the Alps. Interestingly, we found that I. ricinus females were more genetically related to one another than were males at a local scale, which would indicate a higher dispersal rate of immature males. Possible explanations for these findings in terms of sex-specific association of ticks with certain hosts (e.g., birds) and their epidemiological consequences are discussed."

IFNgamma responses to hLFA1 peptide were observed in 11 of 19 Lyme disease patients and in 3 of 15 healthy controls. In contrast, only 2 of 19 of the Lyme disease patients and none of the controls responded to the homologous OspAB31 peptide. IFNgamma was produced in response to stimulation with peptide hLFAalphaL (aa326-345) in peripheral blood of 58% of patients with early Lyme disease without signs of arthritis, as well as in peripheral blood of 20% of healthy individuals, but not in response to stimulation with the homologous OspAB31 (aa164-183) peptide (p < 0.05). Our results suggest that reactivity to the hLFA1 peptide in peripheral blood may be the result of T cell degeneracy."

Four different media were tested for their ability to provide sufficient growth conditions for spirochetes and BGM cells. A total of 176 Ixodes ricinus ticks and 268 specimens from 98 dogs were used to compare cell-free culture with the BGM co-culture. A 1:1 mixture of Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium (BSK) and Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM) supported the growth of the two test strains, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31 and B. valaisiana VS116 to the same extent as BSK medium and the growth as well as the viability of BGM cells in this medium were the same as in EMEM. Using the 1:1 mixture of BSK and EMEM, borrelial growth measured in co-culture with BGM cells did not differ significantly from corresponding values obtained in cell-free cultures. In cell-free culture the isolation rate of B. burgdorferi sl. from ticks was significantly higher in BSK/EMEM 1:1 than in BSK medium (P < 0.01). Co-culture with BGM cells had no significant influence on the isolation rate of borreliae from ticks. However, a significant amount of isolates were obtained by one of the procedures only. Analysing canine specimens accordingly, spirochetes were grown from the blood of one dog after four weeks in BGM cell co-culture. The isolate was classified as B. afzelii by PCR-coupled restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis."

The CSF numbers of CD4+, CD8+, HLA-DR+ and total-T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and NK cells were all greater in neuroborreliosis patients than in TBE patients. Neuroborreliosis patients showed positive correlation of CSF protein levels with the numbers of CD4+, HLA-DR+ and total-T lymphocytes. Also, the numbers of CSF B lymphocytes correlated positively with intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi-specific IgG antibodies. Conversely, TBE patients demonstrated intrathecal protein levels that correlated positively with all investigated CSF lymphocyte subsets. These results suggest an intensive recruitment of lymphocyte subsets into the central nervous system (CNS) during acute neuroborreliosis, whereas TBE is characterized by a lower accumulation of lymphocyte subsets in the CSF."

Characteristic skin, musculoskeletal, cardiac, ocular, and neurologic disorders are associated with the local, early dissemination and late stages of infection. Neurologic involvement can be seen at all stages, and involves both central and peripheral nervous system syndromes. The inability to easily culture B. burgdorferi and the lack of a reliable active infection assay have contributed to controversies in diagnosis and management. Because the vast majority of patients are seropositive, however, antibody testing is helpful to support the diagnosis of Lyme disease. With appropriate antibiotics, most patients do well. This infection provides an important model system to understand how interactions between an organism, vector, and host lead to disease. It also provides a model to study how infectious agents lead to neurologic disease."

Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant OspC (rOspC) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and used, after biotinylation, as antigens on streptavidin-coated plates in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In IgM ELISA, 30% (5/17) and 35% (6/17) of patients with erythema migrans (EM) in the acute or convalescent phase, respectively, reacted with one to three rOspCs. Of the patients, 53% (8/15) with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 53% (8/15) with Lyme arthritis (LA) had IgM antibodies to OspC. The immunoreactivity was stronger against rOspC from B. afzelii and B. garinii than against rOspC from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. In early Lyme borreliosis (LB), rOspC and flagella performed equally well in detecting IgM antibodies. Cross-reactive antibodies to rOspC were observed in serum samples from patients with rheumatoid factor positivity and with syphilis or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. In IgM ELISA, thiocyanate in the serum dilution buffer reduced EBV-associated non-specific positive reactions. Of the patient sera examined in IgG ELISA, 30% (5/17) with EM in the acute phase, 35% (6/17) with EM in the convalescent phase, 33% (5/15) with NB and 60% (9/15) with LA were positive. Because of the heterogeneity of OspC, a polyvalent antigen with several OspC variants from at least B. afzelii and B. garinii is needed to improve the sensitivity of OspC ELISA in the serodiagnosis of LB in Europe."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes can circumvent the vertebrate host's immune system for long periods of time. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii, but not B. garinii, bind the complement inhibitor factor H to protect themselves against complement-mediated opsonophagocytosis and killing. We found that factor H binding and complement resistance are due to inducible expression of a wide repertoire of outer surface protein E (OspE) lipoproteins variably called OspE, p21, ErpA, and ErpP. Individual Borrelia strains carry multiple plasmid-encoded OspE paralogs. Together the OspE homologs were found to constitute an array of proteins that bind factor H via multiple C-terminal domains that are exposed outwards from the Borrelial surface. Charged residue substitutions in the key binding regions account for variations between OspE family members in the optimal binding pH, temperature, and ionic strength. This may help the spirochetes to adapt into various host environments. Our finding that multiple plasmid-encoded OspE proteins act as virulence factors of Borrelia can provide new tools for the prevention and treatment of borreliosis."

English-language literature was identified via MEDLINE (1966-January 2002) using the keywords Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and ehrlichiosis. Textbooks and other pertinent resources were also reviewed. All articles identified through the data sources above were evaluated and reviewed if pertinent to the objective. Tick-borne diseases are the most common vector-transmitted diseases in North America. Each disease causes significant morbidity and, in the case of RMSF, mortality if patients go untreated. If the disease syndromes are recognized early and treatment is initiated, complications are greatly reduced. Doxycycline is active against each of the causative organisms, simplifying empiric treatment. Effective pharmacotherapy exists to treat each of these diseases, assuming diagnosis is made quickly. The beta-lactam and tetracycline antibiotics appear to be the most effective therapy for Lyme disease. The tetracyclines, but not the beta-lactams, are effective for RMSF and the human ehrlichioses. Since Borrelia burgdorferi and the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent are becoming more common coinfecting pathogens, tetracycline or doxycycline should be considered the drugs of choice for patients from endemic areas where exposure to both pathogens may have occurred. Doxycycline is the preferred agent because of decreased frequency of administration and adverse effects."

		"abstract": "In western North America, the tick Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae) is the primary vector to humans and domestic animals of the disease agents causing Lyme disease and granulocytic ehrlichiosis. We examined the seasonal activity patterns of I. pacificus nymphs over a 4-year period, including the wet and cold El Niño winter/spring of 1998, in a dry oak/madrone woodland, and for one year in a cooler and moister redwood/tanoak woodland in Mendocino County, California. Linear regressions were used to estimate when nymphal densities first exceeded and then fell below 25, 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peak densities. In oak/madrone woodland, nymphs typically were active by mid-March, reached 50% of their yearly peak densities in early to mid-April, peaked by early May, fell below 50% of their peak densities by early to mid-June, and were absent by late July to mid-August. The lengths of the periods with nymphal densities exceeding 50 and 75% of the recorded yearly peaks in oak/madrone woodland were associated positively with rainfall and negatively with maximum air temperatures during April-May. Moreover, nymphal numbers typically reached 50% of their peak 10-15 days later, remained at levels above 50% of the peak 1.3-1.5 times longer, and started declining 4-6 weeks later under cooler, moister climatic conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 1998 and redwood/tanoak woodland in 2000) relative to warmer, drier conditions (oak/madrone woodland in 2000-2001). In oak/madrone woodland, nymphal densities typically started to decline when mean maximum daily air temperatures exceeded 23 degrees C. Nymphal densities were higher in dry oak/madrone relative to moist redwood/tanoak woodland from mid-March to late May 2000, similar in both habitat types in early June, but higher in redwood/tanoak woodland from late June onwards. We conclude that large-scale studies of the density of I. pacificus nymphs in California need to consider spatial variation in the length of nymphal activity periods and select temporal sampling regimens that yield representative data for all included habitat types."

Lysates of 3 Borrelia genospecies triggered the proliferation of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells not only from patients with skin manifestations of Borrelia infection and from patients with Lyme arthritis but also from healthy donors. However, with the exception of 1 patient with Lyme arthritis, no selective expansion of V delta 1-expressing gamma delta T cells was induced. In contrast, synovial-fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) from 3 of 5 patients with Lyme arthritis responded with a selective outgrowth of V delta 1 gamma delta T cells. V delta 1 gamma delta T cell lines established from SFMC coexpressed various TCR V gamma chains, although V gamma 8 was preferentially used. Thus, the responsiveness to Borrelia antigens is not a general property of V delta 1-expressing gamma delta T cells but is largely restricted to V delta 1 gamma delta T cells recruited into the inflamed tissue."

This project develops a theory describing how physicians learn and formulate decisions in the context of diagnosing Lyme disease in order that educational programs can be designed to improve accuracy in diagnosis of this disease. A qualitative study using grounded theory methodology was performed to explore the learning process of physicians when diagnosing Lyme disease. Nine physicians were interviewed, and the interview transcripts were coded into categories to form a theory about how physicians learn in practice. Patient-physician interactions initiate the learning process by setting a context for which physicians frame a problem according to familiarity. Repetitive, similar, and counter-experiences, combined with cognitive knowledge, contribute to that framework and influence how the problem is framed along a continuum of familiarity. Furthermore, these experiences serve as information that influences diagnostic decisions and physicians' behaviors. For teaching and learning, cases and examples should include sufficient variety, repetition, and counterexperiences that allow a physician to appropriately recognize and categorize a patient's signs and symptoms into a disease category. Resources for information should be readily available and current. Preceptors and physician colleagues should provide timely feedback on diagnostic accuracy, and case studies should be presented with contextual elements that facilitate the diagnosis of Lyme disease."

This effect is associated with induction of NF-kappaB, and increased expression of Toll-like receptor 2 and CD14, receptors known to underlie spirochete activation of other immune cell types. These studies identify microglia as a previously unappreciated source of inflammatory mediator production following challenge with B. burgdorferi. Such production may play an important role during the development of Lyme neuroborreliosis."

Here we report the serum and cerebrospinal fluid levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in samples drawn at different disease intervals during the course of non-chronic neuroborreliosis (n=10), chronic neuroborreliosis (n=15), erythema migrans (n=8, serum only) and controls (n=7). When comparing early neuroborreliosis cerebrospinal fluid samples, significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha were found in non-chronic patients than in chronic patients (P<0.05). Moreover, TGF-beta1 was increased in the early serum samples of non-chronic patients, as compared to chronic patients (P<0.01). Elevated serum levels of TGF-beta1 were also found in erythema migrans as compared to neuroborreliosis and controls (P<0.05). The high TNF-alpha levels noted in early cerebrospinal fluid samples of non-chronic patients only, possibly reflects an ongoing pro-inflammatory immune response in the central nervous system, which could be beneficial in eliminating disease. High serum levels of TGF-beta1 probably mirror an anti-inflammatory response, which might play a role in controlling the systemic immune response."

A questionnaire was sent to patients and controls concerning their health situation. Time from onset of neurological symptoms to the questionnaire send out was 32 months (mean) for the patients with neuroborreliosis and 33 months (mean) for the controls. Fifty per cent of the individuals in the patient group compared with 16% of the individuals in the control group showed persistent complaints after their Borrelia infection (P < 0.0001). The most significant differences between the groups were the presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as headache, attention problems, memory difficulties and depression. Paresthesia, pain and persistent facial palsy was also significantly more common in patients treated because of neuroborreliosis. Our study shows that persisting neurological symptoms are common after a neuroborreliosis infection. The pathological mechanisms that lay behind the development of chronic symptoms, however, are still uncertain."

Among the tick-borne transmitted diseases in Switzerland, Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, ehrlichiosis caused by various species of Ehrlichia and tick-borne encephalitis caused by the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are the most important zoonotic diseases. Early diagnosis and treatment is necessary to prevent fatal infections and chronic damage to various tissues. Due to the variety of uncharacteristic clinical signs, tick-borne diseases are not easily recognized. Diagnosis is based on clinical findings, a record of tick exposure, and direct or indirect detection of the pathogen. Here we discuss briefly the most important tick-borne infections and their diagnosis with emphasis on a new molecular diagnostic tool--the real-time TaqMan PCR--and its importance for the diagnosis of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "A laboratory model of the parasitic system of Lyme borreliosis (LB) with Ixodes persulcatus and Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. underwent 5 epizootic cycles (Cycle I transition of Borreliae by the scheme a tick-->a mouse-->a tick corresponds to the seasonal cycle). A group of 5-6 mice was inoculated with the suspension of infected nymphs by the intracutaneously route and 35-45 days later intact tick larvae or nymphs were fed on them. In the first three cycles, 40-100% of mice in a group (a total of 33 of 59) were susceptible, but 3 of 11 groups of mice were not inoculated. 20-50% of larvae and 75-92% of nymphs were susceptible on the infected mice. The mean geometric abundance of borreliae was 2.8-6.3 cells per 100 fields of vision in the nymphs infected in the larval phase and 16.1-29.5 cells in the image phase. In cycle IV, 2 of 6 groups of mice were unsusceptible to borreliae and 5 of the 17 mice from 4 groups got infected. One mouse died from Lyme borreliosis when larvae were fed on it. The nymphs remolted from underfed larvae were infected in 62.2% of cases, the mean geometric abundance in these nymphs was 5.7% per 100 fields of vision. A total of 3.2-14.7% of the ticks fed on the remaining 4 mice were infected and the abundance of boreliae was 1-2 per 100 fields of vision. In cycle V, one of 12 mice got infected, the infection rate in nymphs was 9.1%, the abundance of borreliae was 1 per 100 fields of vision. Thus, as the number of epizootic cycles increases, the proportion of infected mice, that of ticks infected on these mice on feeding, and the abundance of borreliae in the infected ticks decrease. Moreover, there was a reduction in the length of borreliae reduced from 17-18 mm to 10-11 mm and in the duration of multiplication and preservation of borreliae in the infected ticks and there was concurrently an increase in the duration of development of an infectious process in mice. It is suggested that the population of borreliae consists of 2 morphophysiological groups or more. During cultivation of the laboratory model of the parasitic system of Lyme borreliosis, a group of borrelia that are short and slightly pathogenic for mice had got many points in its favour. A five-fold procedure of artificial election of precisely defining this group set the model on the verge of disappearance. The capacity of the populations of borreliae to alter their properties rapidly and fundamentally suggests that there might be violent annual fluctuations in human morbidity."

According to the frequency of tick suction and the proportion of an immune interlayer among the population within the Perm Region, four districts were identified by varying risks for infection (epidemic hazard) with Ixodes tick-borne relapsing fever. The populations living in the subzones of south taiga, coniferous, broad-leaved forests, and forest steppe run the greatest risk. An area at average infection risk area corresponds to the south part of a mountain taiga subzone and that at lower risk does to the south part of a middle taiga subzone. There is no possibility of relapsing fever contamination outside the area of Ixodes persulcatus ticks at all. Comparison of their own findings and official statistics has made the authors conclude that there is a great hyperdiagnosis of relapsing fever in the region in question."

		"abstract": "Interleukin (IL)-10 is generally regarded as an anti-inflammatory cytokine, since it acts on a variety of cell types to suppress production of proinflammatory mediators. In inflammation, endothelial cells (EC) play a crucial role in recruiting leukocytes to sites of injury or infection. In this study, the actions of IL-10 on human umbilical vein EC were investigated. IL-10 reduced migration of monocytes and T lymphocytes across endothelium stimulated by lipopolysaccharide and decreased endothelial production of chemokines in response to lipopolysaccharide and Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. However, IL-10 did not affect these responses when EC were activated by the host proinflammatory cytokines IL-lbeta or tumor necrosis factor alpha. Moreover, IL-10 did not prevent up-regulation of the adhesion molecules E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by EC exposed to any of these activating agents. IL-10 therefore inhibits proinflammatory activation of EC in a manner that is selective with respect to stimulus and effector response."

The results were assessed by the criteria recommended for the USA and developed for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Certain differences were shown in the reactions of serum IgG with major proteins of three Borrelia genotypes. The sera interacted with p37 of an I-90 isolate and with p39 of both Russian isolates significantly more frequently. The rate of positive results of a serum test using the strain B31 was 18.6% (16 patients); 13 patients were additionally identified when the Russian isolates were applied. It is expedient to use the genotypes circulating in Russia as an antigenic material for immunoblotting. Criteria for positive serum test results may be individual for each genotype of Borreliae."

There was a wide range of variations in the length of specimens (3-74 microns) and in those of this group average sizes (10.7-24.8 microns). The lengths of Borelliae from natural and laboratory ticks after their molt were 17-18 microns. When the ticks were kept in the refrigerator as long as 1-2 years, the length of Borreliae decreased to 10.7-10.9 microns, upon multiple (10) passages on the BSK-II medium, their lengths increased to 24.8 microns (the differences being significant). When the length of Borreliae reduced due to their keeping in the refrigerator, their pathogenicity for albino mice diminished. This disappeared after multiple BSK-II medium passages. It is suggested that the length of Borreliae may serve as a marker of their pathogenicity."

Vaccination against infection with B. burgdorferi could be improved by determining the mechanism(s) that influences the production of protective borreliacidal antibody. Borreliacidal antibody was inhibited in cultures of lymph node cells obtained from C3H/HeJ mice vaccinated with formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi and cultured with macrophages and B. burgdorferi and treated with recombinant gamma interferon (rIFN-gamma). The suppression of production of outer surface protein A (OspA) borreliacidal antibody by rIFN-gamma was not affected by the time of treatment. In addition, treatment with rIFN-gamma inhibited the production of other anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies. By contrast, treatment of cultures of immune lymph node cells with anti-IFN-gamma marginally increased the production of borreliacidal antibody and enhanced the production of other antibodies directed against B. burgdorferi. These results show that IFN-gamma does not play a major role in the production of anti-OspA borreliacidal antibody. Additional studies are needed to determine which cytokine(s) will enhance production of borreliacidal antibody."

Responses of cultured spirochetes to the SGEs were measured by dark-field microscopy at intervals after the initial inoculation. The average numbers of spirochetes that migrated were compared between U-tubes containing either SGEs or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Spirochetes showed increased migration in tubes containing SGE, and migration was approximately 10-20-fold higher than that for spirochetes observed in tubes containing PBS. In addition, the span of migration showed no significant difference relative to the origin of spirochete isolation. These results demonstrate that spirochete migration can be enhanced by SGEs from fed vector ticks. This mechanism may contribute to the novel transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes between cofeeding infected and uninfected ticks in nature."

PCR analysis indicates that all of these Taiwan isolates were genetically related to the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto by their differential reactivities with genospecies-specific PCR primers. After cleavage by DraI, three different RFLP patterns in relation to three different genospecies of Lyme disease spirochetes were observed, and all of these Taiwan isolates were affiliated with the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The phylogenetic analysis also reveals that the sequence similarity of PCR-amplified OspA gene of these Taiwan isolates is highly homogeneous, with a homogeneity of more than 99.8% within the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These results confirm that the genomic identities of these Taiwan isolates belong to the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto."

Regression analysis showed that moral norms, emotional attitude, anticipated regret, role models, and stress self-efficacy were positively associated with inspection behavior. Health education programs not only need to stimulate parental knowledge and discuss the health effects of tick bite prevention, they also need to stress the emotional benefits of tick bite prevention for children and parents and induce positive norms toward inspecting others. Furthermore, they need to stimulate openness about inspection behaviors, since the modeling examples of partners, relatives, and grandparents and the behavior of friends discriminate between inspecting and noninspecting parents. Finally, education programs should clearly indicate how tick inspection works, how the need for it should be communicated to the children, and how to take enough time to do it."

The average ankle diameter and histologic scores for carditis and arthritis were significantly higher after 2 weeks of infection among mice infected with RST1 isolates than among those infected with RST3 isolates (P<.001). These clinical manifestations were associated with larger numbers of spirochetes in target tissues but not with the serum sensitivity of the individual isolates. Thus, the development and severity of disease in genetically identical susceptible hosts is determined mainly by the pathogenic properties of the infecting B. burgdorferi isolate. The RST1 genotype is genetically homogeneous and thus may represent a recently evolved clonal lineage that is highly pathogenic in humans and animals."

		"abstract": "Geographic information systems combined with methods of spatial analysis provide powerful new tools for understanding the epidemiology of diseases and for improving disease prevention and control. In this study, the spatial distribution of a newly recognized tick-borne disease, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), was investigated for nonrandom patterns and clusters in an area known to be endemic for tick-borne diseases. Analysis of confirmed cases of HGE identified in 1997-2000 in a 12-town area around Lyme, Connecticut, showed that HGE infections are not distributed randomly. Smoothed HGE incidence was higher around the mouth of the Connecticut River and lower to the north and west. Cluster analysis identified one area of increased HGE risk (relative risk=1.8, p=0.001). This study demonstrates the utility of geographic information systems and spatial analysis to clarify the epidemiology of HGE."

Injection of Borrelia spirochaetes together with SGE increased the level of bacteraemia and accelerated the appearance of bacteria in the urinary bladder, compared with the injection of spirochaetes alone. More I. ricinus nymphs became infected when feeding on mice inoculated with B. afzelii plus SGE. Analysis of cytokines produced by cells of draining lymph nodes from SGE-treated mice showed a suppression of proinflammatory cytokines IFN-gamma, IL-6 and GM-CSF following a transient upregulation in comparison with the control mice infected without SGE."

We compare the efficacy of Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. detection in whole blood from borreliosis suspected patients and isolates of intestine contents of Ixodes ricinus ticks. A quality of polymerase is also important in sensitivity of PCR method. The best sensitivity of PCR was in blood with primers complementary to 16S rRNA gene, then in ticks isolates with primers complementary to fla gene.

		"abstract": "Morphological changes of B. burgdorferi as well as changes in expression of surface proteins caused by environmental determinants are essential in pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Cysts, spherical form (spheroplasts, L-form) and \"blebs\" (gemmae) can be responsible for long lasting antigenic stimulation, signs of chronic borreliosis, and even probably connected with MS and Alzheimer disease. Mechanisms to avoid elimination and persistence in the host include: expression of low heterogenic Osp A, B replaced by polymorphic in sequence and antigenic reactivity OspC, the hindrance of access to some membrane proteins by other proteins on the spirochete's surface, effects of tick saliva proteins action. Hiding of spirochetes is possible by invagination into fibrocytes membrane as well as, coating by antigens derived from lymphocytes B. Distribution of spirochetes is facilitated by binding to platelets through integrin aIIb b3, and to the endothelial cells through integrins av b3 i a5b1, recognition of decorin by lipoproteins DbpA i DbpB, receptor for NAG (N-acetyl glucosamina). Endothelial cells, toxic products of granulocytes, monocytes, macrophages as well as phagocytosis counterpart in pathogenesis. Induced cytokines are connected with activation subsets of T lymphocytes involved in inflammatory response. Cytokines produced by Th1 as cytotoxic CD8 accompany the disease. Important are also dendritic cells regarded as initiators of Th1 response with participation of IL-12. In pathogenesis of Lyme disease participation of autoimmunity is notified, especially molecular similarities between OspA and human lymphocytic antigen (hLFA-1). Neurotoxin, produced by B. burgdorferi Bbtox1 was identified. Encephalopathy signs in Lyme borreliosis could be result of releasing toxico-metabolic products, ability of spirochetes to pass the blood-brain barrier as well as, effect of lymphocytes migration. Active invasion of brain endothelium as ability to adherence to endothelial wall could be the source of focused or disseminated inflammation of brain vessels. Antiaxonal antibodies could disturb axon conduction without damaging. But damage of white matter could be connected with damage of mielin production cells, probably by antibodies, induced in cross reaction."

Tick Borne Encephalitis (TBE) is neuroinfection caused by Tick Borne Encephalitis Virus (TBEV). We evaluated the occurrence of psychiatric manifestations in the early phase of borreliosis-erythema migrans and neuroboreliosis as well as in its late phase--in arthritis and in the Tick-Born Encephalitis. The aim of the study was to single out the most frequent psychiatric symptoms and psychopathological syndroms and to determine their dynamics. The study was carried out between 1999 and 2000 and comprised 174 patients of the Department of Psychiatry and Department of Infectious and Neuroinfectious Diseases of Medical Academy in Bialystok. Seventy seven patients diagnosed with arthritis, 20 with neuroborreliosis, 26 with skin manifestation-erythrema migrans and 51 with KZM participated. All subjects underwent psychiatric evaluation twice--during hospitalization and six month after discharge. Mental status examinations included general psychiatric examination and battery of scales and tests: Mini Mental State Examination, Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Reitan's Trail Making Test, Choynowsky Memory Scale, Symptoms Inventory and neuropsychological testing. Both in the course of TBE and Lyme borreliosis the majority of patients experienced psychiatric problems in the acute phase of disease as well as in the late phase--3, 6 months after the onset of the disease. The most common psychiatric manifestations were depressive disorders--episodes of depression or organic mood disorders, and cognitive deficits which manifest themselves as mild cognitive disorder or dementia. Psychiatric assessment is important in early stage of kzm and borreliosis but first of all after termination of acute symptomatology."

The verifying investigations were performed on 82 serum samples, which in the commercial ELISA were positive in 36 cases, dubious in 31 cases and negative in 15 cases as well as on 5 serum samples obtained from horses infected with Leptospira spp., which in the ELISA commercial were dubious (total of 87 sera samples). The antigens, against which the immunological response in horses was directed, were also established. The Milenia--Blot--Borrelia IgG test (MIDBO IgG-Kit 30 TESTS: DPC Bierman GmbH) was used in the investigation. In view of species differences, rabbit anti-horse IgG (whole molecule) alkaline phosphatase conjugate, no A6063 SIGMA-ALDRICH was used interchangeably. Also the control sera were substituted with the horse control sera. It was demonstrated that the Western blot test is the most reliable in the serological diagnosis of B. burgdorferi infection in horses. The commercial ELISA and standardized ELISA tests represent a lower diagnostic value than the Western blot test, although similar to each other, while the value of the IFA is minimal. In the Western blot test antigens were established against which the immunological response in horses in mostly directed. In the sera evaluated in this test as positive the presence of antibodies, mainly against antigens with the following molecular weights: 41 kDa, 62/60 kDa, 93 kDa, 72 kDa, 34 kDa (OspB), 66 kDa was noted. At the same time, antibodies contained in the sera accepted as negative, in 55.5% cases also reacted with the antigen of 41 kDa. It points to its minimal specificity. On the basis of the results obtained it is recommended that serological examination of horses should be with the ELISA and that positive or dubious results should be verified with the Western blot test."

The experimental material comprised the chosen horses from which blood samples were collected in order to obtain sera. The test used for indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA No 75941, Bio-Mérieux) is commercially designed for the investigation of human sera and thus needed a prior species adaptation and standardization; ELISA (MRL DIAGNOSTICS, No EL0400G) which was also species adapted and stardandized and ELISA commercially assigned for the examination of dog or horse sera (Die System Diagnostica GmbH Borrelia burgdorferi Veterinary ELISA No. 122.00 Genzyme Virotech GmbH). In the IFA test the highest share of positive results was obtained in respect of the sera from OHK in (K)--60.7% and then in (B)--52.9%, (Ł)--42.9%, (W)--40.5%, (Kr)--38.7%. In the standardized ELISA the highest percent of positive results, amounting to 33.3%, was obtained in respect of the sera from (Ł), and then from (W)--20.7%, (K)--11.5%, (Kr)--10.2% and (B)--5.9%. The percent of positive results obtained in the commercial ELISA also agreement on a high level: the sera originating from (W) were positive in 18.9%, from (K)--9.8%, (Ł)--9.5%. (B)--5.9% and (Kr)--4.1%. Both ELISAs showed high agreement although the standardized test was characterized by a greater tendency for suggesting the presence of B. burgdorferi infection and the agreement of these two ELISAs with the IFA was not so strong. The IFA showed the highest tendency for suggesting the presence of the B. burgdorferi infection, being characterized by the highest percent of false positive results."

E. Stewart, R. Thalken, J. L. Bono, and P. Rosa, Mol. Microbiol. 39:714-721, 2001). B. burgdorferi B31 clones had transformation efficiencies that were either low, intermediate, or high, and this phenotype correlated with the presence or absence of lp25 and lp56. Under the conditions utilized in this study, no transformants were detected in clones that contained both lp25 and lp56; the few kanamycin-resistant colonies isolated did not contain pBSV2, indicating that the resistance was due to mutation. Intermediate electroporation rates (10 to 200 colonies per micro g of DNA) were obtained with B31 clones that were either lp25(-) and lp56(+) or lp25(+) and lp56(-). Clones in this group that initially contained lp25 lacked this plasmid in pBSV2 transformants, a finding consistent with selective transformation of lp25(-) variants. High transformation rates (>1,000 colonies per micro g of DNA) occurred in clones that lacked both lp25 and lp56. Sequence analysis indicated that lp25 and lp56 contain genes that may encode restriction and/or modification systems that could result in the low transformation rates obtained with strains containing these plasmids. The previously reported correlation between lp25 and infectivity in mice, coupled with the barrier lp25 presents to transformation, may explain the difficulty in obtaining virulent transformants of B. burgdorferi."

She did not attend a nursery, and went for walks only within urban area under the careful guidance of her parents. In spite of the negative family history the level of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi was estimated. A very high level of IgG antibodies and a low level of IgM Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, accompanied by physical symptoms allowed to diagnose the second stage of Lyme disease. We considered the described case as worth presentation due to the child's very early age.

Among these protein sequences are several protease inhibitors of distinct classes, metalloproteases, novel proteins with histamine-binding domains, and several peptide families of unknown function displaying different conserved cysteine residues, many of which contain single Kunitz domains. This work provides information into the diversity of messages expressed in the salivary glands of I. scapularis, describes novel sequences that may be responsible for known biological activites, indicates further biological activities that may be present in I. scapularis saliva and identifies novel vaccine targets that may be used in Lyme disease prevention."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a major cause of morbidity in wooded area in western Europe and the eastern seaboard of the U.S.A. Diagnosis of late stage infection and associated disorders may be difficult and often requires an array of different diagnostic procedures. Here we report an 11-year-old girl with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans affecting all four limbs and parts of the trunk. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical appearance, serological and histopathological findings, and the lesional detection of B. burgdorferi-specific gene segments by polymerase chain reaction. This very unusual, severe case illustrates that despite being a late manifestation of tick-borne B.burgdorferi infection, usually occurring in adults, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans may already appear at a young age and may be characterized by extensive skin involvement."

		"abstract": "A comparative study of human sera was conducted to determine which purified preparations of 11 recombinant antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto were diagnostically most important in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). To assess sensitivity, 20 serum samples obtained 1-6 weeks after onset of illness from 20 persons who had physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM) were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies. In tests for IgM antibody, seropositivity of > or = 25% was recorded when ELISAs had separate preparations of protein (p) 37, p41-G, outer-surface protein (Osp) C, OspE, OspF or VlsE antigens. Sera reacted most frequently (80% positive) with VlsE antigen in analyses for IgG antibodies. When results of both class-specific assays were considered for VlsE, OspC or OspF, 90% of the EM cases were serologically confirmed. Results of specificity testing with a further 59 sera from persons who had syphilis, louse-borne relapsing fever, oral infections, rheumatoid arthritis or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and 28 normal sera indicated no false positive reactions when VlsE antigen was used in tests for IgM antibody. One of the 11 louse-borne relapsing fever sera cross-reacted with VlsE antigen in tests for IgG antibodies. Minor cross-reactivity also occurred when p37, OspC, OspE or OspF antigens were used. Overall, VlsE was the most suitable antigen for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis during the early weeks of B. burgdorferi infection because of its high sensitivity and specificity."

		"abstract": "A genome walking technique was applied to borrelial DNA to clone the gene encoding decorin-binding protein B (DbpB) in Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii. Sequence analysis showed 62-67% identity of the predicted amino acid sequences of DbpB between the B. afzelii and B. garinii strains and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Within subspecies, the sequences were 99-100% identical. The respective recombinant DbpBs (rDbpBs) were produced and tested as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Lyme borreliosis (LB). In IgG ELISA, with rDbpBs as antigens, 11 (73%) of 15 adult patients with Lyme arthritis and 9 (64%) of 14 with neuroborreliosis were positive. Of children with Lyme arthritis, 40 (77%) of 52 were positive. All adult and paediatric patients with disseminated LB had high titres of anti-flagellin IgG antibodies. Seropositivity against rDbpB from B. garinii predominated, 39 (65%) of 60 of the positive samples reacting with rDbpB from B. garinii. In patients with erythema migrans, IgM antibodies to rDbpB were detected in 1 (4%) of 23 and IgG antibodies in 6 (26%) of 23. These results indicate that DbpB may be a useful antigen in the IgG serology for disseminated LB. The high inter-species sequence heterogeneity observed indicates that a combination of the variant DbpBs should be included in the antigen set to cover all the relevant borrelial subspecies in the serodiagnosis of LB."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease caused by a spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which manifests as a multisystem disease of the skin, nervous system, heart and joints. Recently it is the most common vector-borne disease in Yugoslavia. New epidemiological studies revealed that ticks can occasionally be infected not only by Borrelia burgdorferi, but also by some other microbes that can cause diseases in humans. Recently discovered the variable major protein-like sequence, antigenic variation of B. burgdorferi B 31 partly explains the ability of this organism to evade an active immune response. A key role in development of clinical symptoms associated with lyme disease belongs to the connection with ability of B. burgdorferi to induce and activate metallopeptidases and fibrinolytic enzymes, leading to extracellular matrix destruction. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is made on the basis of clinical picture, exposure to ticks in endemic areas and serologic confirmation. It seems that polymerase chain reaction has little role in detection of B. burgdorferi in urine, blood, and spinal fluid samples, but it is most useful in evaluating the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy of Lyme arthritis. Infectious Diseases Society of America had prepared new guidelines for selective treatment of Lyme disease. Vaccination is still the best way of prevention for people living in high-risk areas."

Results of laboratory tests. In patients with unilateral Ménière's disease (n = 40), 27% demonstrated elevated antiphospholipid antibody titers (population norm, 6-9%). The majority of these patients manifested negative assays on the other tests listed above. In patients with bilateral Ménière's disease (n = 18), elevations in antinuclear antibody titers (38%) were the most notable finding. As part of a broader study of patients with progressive hearing loss, four patients with positive syphilis titers were identified; however, none of these patients complained of vertigo. In general, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that immune or infectious pathologies are involved in the pathogenesis of unilateral Ménière's disease. In particular, Lyme disease does not seem to cause labyrinthine disease. However, the potential role of the thrombogenic antiphospholipid antibodies must be further investigated. Patients with bilateral Ménière's disease may be more likely to have a systemic autoimmune process."

Two other MAbs were specific for the RevA protein, and have enabled characterization of that previously unknown protein. The data presented here suggest that the production of MAbs from animals infected by tick-bite is a potentially useful tool for the identification of novel proteins synthesized by B. burgdorferi during mammalian infection."

However, the treatment of babesiosis using a clindamycin-quinine combination has been successful.

Previous studies conducted elsewhere on Lyme disease have indicated substantial differences between physician practices and published consensus guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. During 1999, we mailed a 21-item questionnaire to 600 randomly selected family practice physicians, internists, and pediatricians in New Hampshire. Respondents answered a median of 10 (76.9%) of 13 knowledge items correctly. Most physicians (73.6%) underestimated the incidence of erythema migrans among Lyme disease patients, and 41.2% would either test or offer treatment to an asymptomatic patient with deer-tick bite. When surveyed, most respondents (72.4%) planned to recommend Lyme disease vaccine to high-risk persons. Approximately one half (44.8%) reported giving empiric antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease solely because of patient concern. New Hampshire primary care physicians indicated good knowledge about Lyme disease. Lack of awareness about Lyme disease diagnostic criteria, however, could contribute to misdiagnosis through overreliance on laboratory testing. Lyme disease vaccine appeared to be well accepted by physicians, although the vaccine has since been withdrawn from the US market. Both inappropriate management of tick bite and empiric treatment of unsubstantiated Lyme disease diagnoses were common."

		"abstract": "Although Lyme borreliosis is regarded as one of the most important zoonotic diseases, in Europe very few research reports have documented examinations on free-ranging wild animal populations and no study on zoo animals has been published. One of the problems regarding the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in wild animals is often the lack of species specific secondary antibodies for serological tests. For our study on exposure of zoo animals to Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi s. l. and the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis in various German zoos, a non-species dependent ELISA was developed. Specific IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi s. l. were detected by peroxidase labeled protein A or protein G conjugates. For this purpose, both conjugates were tested for their binding affinities to 160 different wild animal species representing 25 families and 7 orders. With 2 exceptions, all tested species reacted with either protein A or protein G, and 47 species reacted with both conjugates. In combination with an easy method for the long-term preservation of antigen-coated microtiter plates, the ELISA developed for this study could essentially facilitate serological examinations regarding Lyme borreliosis in wild animal sera. In summary, the results indicate commercially available protein A and protein G conjugates as useful alternatives to species specific secondary antibodies in various diagnostic assays on sera of a wide range of wild mammals. Therefore, this should be considered more often as versatile diagnostic tools in wildlife studies."

		"abstract": "Grazing animals are continuously exposed to tick bites. Consequently, one may expect that horses will become infected with the various pathogens carried by ticks including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Whether horses may develop clinical disease due to this pathogen is controversially discussed. We were interested to learn about the infection of horses with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato within one season by studying the dynamics of the humoral immune response in paired blood samples. The majority of horses examined were Lipizzaner from the stud farm in Piber/Steiermark, and from the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. Smaller groups of animals of different breeds were from stud farms in Kärnten, Niederösterreich, Salzburg and Steiermark. Clinical status and medical history were obtained and blood was drawn at the beginning of the highest tick activity and nine months later in 1998. Immunoblot technique (Western blot) was used in order to determine the dynamics in the immune response patterns. As antigens served the genospecies Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia lusitaniae, and Borrelia valaisiana. 309 horses (age median 7 years, range 1/12 to 33 years) were seen at the first round. 186 of these animals (60.2%; median age 6 years, range 4/12 to 33 years) were re-examined in the second round. All animals were in normal health condition during both rounds of examination and blood sampling. Analysis of the immunoblot patterns was based on in-house-, Pko-, Pka2-, Pbi-, and European Union Concerted Action on Lyme Borreliosis (EUCALB) 2 & 3-criteria; analyses revealed a variety of positive results with different strains and criteria. Positive immunoblot results with 186 paired samples and B. afzelii as antigen, for example, ranged from 52 to about 91% in the first, and 53 to 93% in the second round. The age dependency analyses showed that the first infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato occurs in the first year. Re-infection is characterised by appearance of additional bands. Continuously tick-exposed horses show a stable pattern of bands whilst in unexposed horses the number of bands decreases with age. In this study horses became repeatedly infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato but, apparently, developed only rarely, if at all, clinical diseases. The infectious agent is predominantly B. afzelii. Antibodies to other borrelia genospecies are predominantly due to cross reactivity."

A total of 987 Ixodes ricinus larvae were collected from 225 birds belonging to 20 host species. The following four passerine species that have not yet been subject to detailed reservoir competence analyses were investigated: Nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos), Dunnock (Prunella modularis), Chiffchaff (Phylloscopus collybita) and Reed warbler (Acrocephalus scirpaceus). Borrelia DNA was analysed in attached ticks and for one species, the Nightingale, blood samples were included. Borrelia DNA was amplified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the ospA gene of B. burgdorferi s. l. and 1-2 larvae per bird were analysed. On the basis of one larva per individual bird, Borrelia DNA could be detected in six out of nine larval ticks from the Nightingale, in one out of ten ticks from the Dunnock, in three of nine ticks from the Chiffchaff, and in two out of 21 larval ticks from Reed warblers. Five out of nine ticks removed from Robins Erithacus rubecula in winter were found to be Borrelia positive. Blood samples of Nightingales caught during the breeding period were ospA-gene-positive in 71 of 138 birds (51%)."

		"abstract": "Presently known tick-borne diseases in Germany include Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE-virus, western subtype), Q-fever, babesiosis and presumably ehrlichiosis. Blood samples of 4,368 forestry workers in the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg (B-W), southwestern Germany, were tested for the presence of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, TBE-virus and Ehrlichia spp. (genogroup E. phagocytophila). Furthermore 12,327 ticks (Ixodes ricinus) collected in various areas of B-W were analysed by PCR and genotyping for the prevalence of pathogen RNA and DNA. The human seroprevalence rates of antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato ranged from 18% to 52%, for TBE-virus from 0% to 43% and for Ehrlichia spp. from 5% to 16% in various counties of the State. The foci of B. burgdorferi and TBE-virus as indicated by antibody prevalence in humans are only partly overlapping with each other. The highest rates of TBE-virus antibodies are in concordance with available clinical data. However antibody prevalence up to 27% in areas with no reports of clinical cases was found, suggesting that TBE occurs throughout the State of B-W. The prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. antibodies suggests that ehrlichiosis plays a role as a tick-borne disease in Germany, but as long as no clinical data are available, this will remain unclear. Investigations of ticks for TBE-virus (n = 9,189) by nested PCR showed prevalence rates from 0% to 2.3% and for Ehrlichia spp. (n = 1,963) from 2.6% to 3.1%. Examination of ticks (n = 3,138) for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was performed by PCR and revealed prevalence rates from 13.9% up to 24%. Furthermore 1,106 samples positive for B. burgdorferi sensu lato were used for genotyping. B. afzelii DNA was found in 407 ticks (36.8%), followed by B. garinii (21.9%), B. valaisiana (13.7%), and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (9.9%). Double infection was found in 6.4% and triple infection in 0.8% of the ticks. 10.5% of the positive samples could not be classified. Prevention of tick-borne diseases has to focus on behavioural intervention to reduce individual tick exposure by proper behaviour in the environment, as a large-scale control of the tick population seems impossible and thus reduction of Lyme borreliosis and TBE through tick control is unlikely. Vaccination against TBE-virus should not only be recommended for high endemic areas but also for persons with a high individual risk."

Analysis of the genospecies in individual ticks showed that B. garinii and B. valaisiana segregate from B. afzelii. Segregation of bird- and rodent-associated Borrelia genotypes can be explained by the operation of complement-mediated selection in the midgut of the feeding tick. Phylogenetic analyses of B. burgdorferi s. l. indicate high rates of migration for bird-associated genotypes. Altogether, it is emerging that the ecology of Lyme borreliosis is largely host-driven and that selection and migration are major forces shaping the population structures of B. burgdorferi s. l."

		"abstract": "The innate immune system and, in particular, the complement system play a key role in the elimination of micro-organisms after entrance in the human host. Like other pathogens, borreliae must develop strategies to inactivate host defence mechanisms. By investigating serum (NHS)-susceptibility of borreliae, we found that mainly B. afzelii isolates are serum-resistant, whereas the majority of B. burgdorferi s. s. isolates display an intermediate serum-sensitive phenotype. In contrast, B. garinii isolates are killed effectively by complement and therefore are classified as serum-sensitive. Up to now, we have identified two distinct proteins of 27.5 kDa and 20.7 kDa expressed on the outer surface of borreliae, which interact directly with FHL-1/reconectin and factor H, the two major regulators of the alternative complement pathway. These borrelial proteins are termed CRASPs (complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins). CRASPs are detectable only on serum-resistant borreliae and, accordingly, binding of FHL-1/reconectin and factor H only occur with serum-resistant borrelial isolates. We conclude from these results that the control of complement activation on the borrelial surface is due to the interaction of borrelial CRASPs with host complement regulatory proteins. Thus, CRASPs represent an important mechanism of immune evasion on the part of borrelial isolates belonging mostly to the genospecies B. afzelii. By analysing the humoral adaptive immune response of patients, we detected sera that killed NHS-resistant borreliae. Borreliacidal activity is observed most frequently with sera of patients at stage III of the disease. The killing of NHS-resistant isolates by these immune sera always requires the combination of antibodies and complement. Bactericidal activity, however, is not detected in all immune sera at the different disease stages, although specific anti-Borrelia antibodies are present according to serological test results. This observation suggests that not all borrelial antigens are able to induce a borreliacidal immune response. In an extensive analysis of 24 immune sera, we identified up to 12 borrelial antigens, including OspC, which possess the greatest potential for the induction of borreliacidal antibody. The borreliacidal potential of anti-OspC antibodies was tested directly on an OspC-expressing borrelial wild-type isolate and a corresponding variant lacking OspC. In these studies, only the wild-type isolate expressing OspC on its surface proved positive for the lytic complement complex, thereby indicating the great importance of this antigen for the control of the infection. Additional studies are required to identify further \"protective\" antigens among these 12 proteins, all of which are candidates for infection control according to our studies involving patient immune sera. These antigens may include the recently detected CRASPs."

Resistance to treatment and a protracted course of the disease, therefore, continue to pose problems for clinicians in the management of patients suffering from chronic Lyme disease. Further characterisation of the antibiotic susceptibility pattern and a better understanding of the interactions of B. burgdorferi with antimicrobial agents are urgently needed and continue to be crucial owing to considerable differences in the experimental conditions and test methods applied. The development of easily performed, new techniques for the sensitivity testing of B. burgdorferi provides the opportunity to study factors affecting the bacteriostatic and bactericidal action of recently introduced chemotherapeutic agents under more standardised conditions. For the first time, these studies provide direct evidence that, in addition to beta-lactams, macrolides, and tetracyclines which are recommended for stage-dependent treatment of Lyme borreliosis, other recently introduced substances, such as fluoroquinolones, everninomycins, and the ketolide family of antimicrobial agents, also show enhanced in vitro activity against borreliae. Some of these compounds, if effective in vivo as well, may prove to be useful agents in the treatment of certain manifestations of Lyme disease. As such, their potential role should be evaluated further by in vivo experiments and clinical trials. Finally, these antimicrobial agents may turn out to be very effective therapeutic alternatives on account of their oral availability, favourable pharmacodynamic profiles, and high tissue levels in cases where beta-lactames or tetracyclines cannot be administered without detrimental side-effects."

		"abstract": "More than 20 years after the first description of the pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based primarily on clinical criteria. Multiple differential diagnoses have to be considered and laboratory confirmation based on various test procedures is required until now. For screening assays the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA), or indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) are frequently in use. During the last ten years a stepwise diagnostic procedure in USA and Europe has been recommended. The use of a serological screening assay as the first diagnostic step, followed by a confirmatory assay only in the case of a positive or borderline result of the screening assay is now \"state of the art\". The most frequently used method is a sensitive enzyme linked immunoassay followed by a sensitive and specific immunoblot technique. However, the quality of these indirect serological tests and, mbst importantly, the interpretation criteria of the commercial tests vary dramatically. The choice of Borrelia strains, antigen preparation, production conditions and test procedures vary widely. The immunoblot, used as a confirmatory assay, must meet the highest quality standards but in practice under routine laboratory conditions, these levels are often not reached. The major reason for this \"shortcoming\" is that Lyme borreliosis is not a sexually transmitted disease and no official approval has been required by the commercial suppliers so far. Another increasingly important aspect is the introduction of molecular biological assays into laboratory routines. Numerous authors published many articles about the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction as a diagnostic tool for the detection of borreliae in human specimens. However, a routine method has not yet been established. Furthermore, no standardized method for DNA isolation from different human specimens has been developed so far. For this reason PCR is not accepted as a routine method and the application should be restricted to a few laboratories with experience in the field of Lyme borreliosis. In summary, it is important to inform clinicians about the limitations of the tests used and it would be very helpful to stage a European or worldwide conference to establish accepted rules for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."

Serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a rational stepwise diagnosis (see English Internet Version (http://www.dghm.org/red/index.html?cname=MIQ) of MiQ Lyme borreliosis). A screening assay (a sensitive ELISA differentiating IgM and IgG) is recommended as the first step. When the ELISA is reactive, it is followed by immunoblot (IgM, IgG) (second step). The reactive diagnostic bands should be clearly identified; this is easy if recombinant antigens are used. Identification of diagnostic bands is difficult in the conventional blot and should be done by monoclonal antibodies. Progress has been made in the sensitivity of the recombinant blot using additional antigens as p58 and homologues of Osp17. In neuroborreliosis the determination of the CSF/serum index is indicated (investigation of paired serum and CSF from the same day). Detection of the etiological agent by culture or PCR should be performed only in specialised laboratories and is confined to specific indications. Recommended specimens are skin, other biopsies, CSF and synovial fluid. The best results are obtained from biopsies (culture and PCR) and synovial fluid (PCR)."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne disease (TBD) transmission foci need to be characterized in space and time, and are often discontinuous on both scales. An active TBD focus is dependent on the fulfillment of three conditions: tick survival, pathogen survival and opportunities for human exposure. The essentials for tick survival include food sources, reproduction, and protection from environmental extremes. The pathogen survival kit includes sufficient densities of ticks and suitable reservoir hosts, and opportunities for transmission between them in order to maintain infection. Opportunities for human exposure depend on sufficient number of encounters between ticks and humans. Because tick foci need to be described on a range of spatial and temporal resolutions, data for such characterization include a variety of surveillance data, field and laboratory experimental data, as well as results of statistical and mathematical analysis and modeling. The application of new tools from molecular biology, geographic information systems (GIS), and satellite imagery, in conjunction with appropriate analytical methods allow for detection of unknown foci and prediction of new ones. A long-term multi-scale study of Ixodes scapularis and Lyme disease in the north-central U. S. is reviewed. Diverse surveillance methods of ticks, rodents, deer, canids and humans were coupled with environmental characterization in situ to create a habitat profile for Lyme disease ticks. Incorporating various digitized databases, a statistical model was used to develop a risk map for tick distribution in the region. The process of introduction and establishment of new tick foci along the Illinois River is described in relation to the known tick distribution and predictions of invasion based on the risk model."

The vast majority of European cases have been caused by Babesia divergens in splenectomised patients, and although rare, this disease is very dangerous, requiring aggressive treatment. The use of atovaquone, a recently developed anti-protozoan agent for human treatment, may be considered in future cases. Most human babesiosis caused by B. microti have occurred in the north-eastern states of the USA and can affect spleen-intact as well as asplenic patients. The majority of infections are subclinical or follow a mild chronic course, but dangerous acute infections can occur in immunocompromised patients. The role of B. microti in apparently unresponsive cases of Lyme borreliosis and treatment of co-infections require further investigation. The zoonotic potential of B. microti in Europe is still unresolved, but the vector competence of Ixodes ricinus for at least some European (and American) strains has been demonstrated."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), the causative agent of Lyme disease in North America is transmitted to the mammalian host by ticks belonging to the genus, Ixodes. Antibodies to several spirochetal proteins, most notably outer surface protein C (OspC), have been observed in early infection in both humans and laboratory animals. Thus, the expression of these proteins have been postulated to play a role in tick transmission and spirochetal infectivity for the mammalian host. B. burgdorferi strain JMNT was induced to produce increased levels of OspC by cultivation in BSK medium at 37 degrees C. To diminish expression of OspC, spirochetes were cultivated at 31 degrees C. Spirochetes shifted down from 37 degrees C to 31 degrees C or up from 31 degrees C to 37 degrees C for 1 week contained equivalent amounts of OspC. To evaluate spirochetal infectivity, hamsters were inoculated subcutaneously with 1 x 10(4) or 1 x 10(6) spirochetes grown at the above-mentioned temperatures. Hamsters inoculated with spirochetes expressing high amounts of OspC all became infected, irrespective of the inoculum size. None of the hamsters inoculated with 1 x 10(4) spirochetes grown at 31 degrees C or in cultures shifted down from 37 degrees C to 31 degrees C were infected. All infected hamsters, confirmed by isolation of spirochetes in ear and/or bladder cultures, had an antibody response to OspC. In contrast, all non-infected hamsters lacked antibodies to OspC. We conclude that cultivation of spirochetes at 37 degrees C enhances their infectivity for hamsters. This study also suggests there is a correlation between enhancement of OspC expression and spirochetal infectivity for hamsters."

C3H.HeJ and BALB/c mice cohorts were coinfected or singly infected and then monitored experimentally for 15 and 30 days after inoculation. Carditis and arthritis was determined by blinded histopathologic evaluation of myocardium and tibiotarsal joints. Cytokine measurements were made on lymph node and spleen supernatants for interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and IL-13. No differences were observed for C3H.HeJ mice cohorts; however, coinfected BALB/c mice had a significant increase in arthritis severity at day 30.

Two main and several minor partially overlapping antigenic determinants have been found on the surface of the OspA protein of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (strain 297) by lanthanide competition fluoroimmunoassay. One of the main antigenic determinants is located in the N- and the other in the C-half of the OspA molecule. The involvement of the OspA protein in intact Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (four bacterial strains have been analyzed: 297, B31, FR90-594, and CA90-742) is associated with retention of the above-mentioned two major antigenic determinants, but unlike the case of the isolated OspA they are partially overlapping with each other and with other antigenic determinants. The protein of the spirochete Borrelia afzelii (two bacterial strains have been analyzed: Ip-21 and Pko) contains only one antigenic determinant, which is the same as the main determinant of the OspA protein of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto located in the N-half of the OspA molecule."

For this purpose, the immunoreactivity of sera collected from patients suffering from tularemia, together with the control sera of patients with Lyme disease and healthy blood donors, were examined by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional immunoblotting. Furthermore, whole cell bacterial lysates, isolated integral membrane proteins and basic proteins were exploited as antigens. By this approach more than 80 different immunorelevant antigens were detected. Most of them came from whole cell bacterial lysate and integral membrane proteins. Conversely, only a negligible reaction was found in the case of basic proteins. Forty-five spots were further selected for mass spectrometric analyses and 22 of them were annotated. Among the spots that provided characteristic reactions with sera from patients with tularemia, 60 kDa and 10 kDa chaperonins that occurred in several charge and mass variants, predominated."

We used [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to determine the metabolic landscape in 23 patients with Lyme disease. Images were evaluated for cortical and subcortical abnormalities by two experienced reviewers blinded to the clinical information. The most striking finding was hypometabolism in the temporal lobes in 17/23 (74%) patients. Of these, 12 had bilateral temporal lobe hypometabolism, two had left temporal lobe, and three had right temporal lobe hypometabolism. Seven of the patients with temporal lobe hypometabolism had diffuse cortical hypometabolism that included the frontal and parietal lobes. Lyme disease appears to have two primary patterns of brain involvement on FDG PET scans, specific temporal lobe hypometabolism or a diffuse cortical hypometabolism. The involvement of the temporal lobes in both patterns is likely associated with the memory disturbances described in many of these patients. Although there was no clear diagnostic pattern, and many of the defects were mild, FDG PET imaging may provide important information regarding the areas of the brain affected in patients with neurological symptoms associated with Lyme disease."

For the first step, regardless whether the initial inocula of B. burgdorferi expressed either all (cultured spirochetes) or less than 40 (host-adapted spirochetes) of the 137 lipoprotein genes, the spirochetes were modulated to transcribe 116 of the genes within 10 d after being introduced to the murine host. This step of adaptation was induced by the microenvironment of the host tissue. During the second step, which was forced by host immune selection pressure and occurred between 17 and 30 d after infection, B. burgdorferi down-regulated most of the lipoprotein genes and expressed less than 40 of the 137 genes. This novel adaptation mechanism could be a critical step for B. burgdorferi to proceed to chronic infection, as the pathogen would be cleared at the early stage of infection if the spirochetes failed to undergo this process."

The human Lymphocyte Function Antigen-1 (hLFA1alpha) contains a peptide with homology to OspA165-173. Treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis patients' T cells, cloned based on their ability to bind OspA165-173-loaded HLA-DRB1*0401 tetramers, respond to OspA and hLFA1alpha with a different cytokine profile, suggesting that hLFA1alpha acts as a partial agonist with a potential role in the perpetuation of joint inflammation."

Lyme arthritis (LA) can usually be prevented by early treatment of acute LD. However, the erythema migrans rash may go undetected in children and in the dark skin of African Americans, leading to delayed treatment and a relatively increased incidence in LA. Virtually all untreated patients with LA have high levels of serum immunoglobulin G antibodies, and sometimes low levels of immunoglobulin M antibodies, to Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) by ELISA and Western blot. These responses may persist for many years after antibiotic treatment, and therefore, serologic results do not accurately distinguish between active or past infection. Most patients with LA respond well to standard courses of antibiotic treatment, but a small percentage have persistent knee synovitis, in some cases possibly related to the triggering of intrasynovial autoimmunity. Other patients develop a syndrome of diffuse arthralgia, myalgia, fatigue, and subjective cognitive difficulty during or soon after LD, which persists despite antibiotic treatment. Patients with this post-treatment, post-LD syndrome were recently studied in a placebo-controlled double-blind antibiotic trial. There was no evidence of Borrelial infection in these patients by culture or detection of Bb DNA in blood or spinal fluid. Furthermore, there was no difference in responsiveness of these patients to a 3-month course of antibiotic compared with placebo treatment. Thus, LA caused by active Bb infection, post-treatment LA with persistent knee synovitis and post-LD syndrome are distinct and distinguishable clinical entities."

While it is clear that vlsE undergoes sequence change within its variable regions at a high frequency during the early stages of infection, a definitive role in immune evasion has not been demonstrated. In this report we assessed the murine and human humoral immune response to recombinant (r)-VlsE variants that originally arose during infection in mice. Immunoblot analyses of r-VlsE variants were conducted by using serum samples collected from mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi clones that carried different vlsE variants. All of the r-VlsE variants were recognized by infection sera regardless of the identity of the infecting clone or isolate. In addition, all variants were immunoreactive with a panel of human Lyme disease patient serum samples. It is evident from these analyses that the infection-induced VlsE variants share common epitopes that reside within conserved segments of these proteins. However, preabsorption experiments revealed that the variable regions of the central domain of VlsE, which undergo rapid mutation during infection, also influence the antigenic properties of the protein. A subset of the antibodies elicited against vlsE variants that differ in the sequences of their variable regions were found to be variant specific. Hence, in spite of a robust antibody response to conserved segments of VlsE, infection-induced sequence changes within the variable regions alter the antigenicity of VlsE. These results provide the first direct evidence of antigenic variation in the VlsE protein."

The luxS gene of B. burgdorferi was identified and demonstrated to encode a functional enzyme by complementation of an Escherichia coli luxS mutant. Cultured B. burgdorferi responded to AI-2 by altering the expression levels of a large number of proteins, including the complement regulator factor H-binding Erp proteins. Through this mechanism, a population of Lyme disease spirochetes may synchronize production of specific proteins needed for infection processes."

In Europe, Lyme borreliosis can be caused by three species of Borrelia: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii. The microbiological diagnosis is established primarily on the basis of antibody detection, and secondarily by detection of the pathogen itself. Suitable material for the detection of the latter are various body fluids (CSF, joint fluid and biopsy material, in particular in the skin). In the case of antibodies, the substrate is usually serum. If neuroborreliosis is suspected, CSF should always be investigated (CSF/serum, pairwise, same day!). The microbiological findings must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical presentation. A negative serological result does not exclude an early manifestation, a positive finding is no proof of a clinically manifest infection--it might be a titer from an earlier infection."

In particular the early stages of the disease, with their paucity of symptoms or wide variability of the clinical symptomatology, often present a diagnostic challenge. This means that in the event of unclear unspecific cutaneous lesions indicating, for example, erysipelas or urticaria, Lyme borreliosis should also receive differential diagnostic consideration. Culture of the organism, DNA-based confirmation of B. burgdorferi or, where indicated, a serological investigation can confirm the diagnosis at an early stage. The treatment of choice compromises an antibiotic administered for an adequate duration and at an adequate dose, e.g. doxycycline 2 x 100 mg over three weeks). If treatment is initiated in a local or disseminated early stage, healing rates of more than 85% can be achieved."

Given the high cost of the vaccine, the low risk of Lyme disease in many areas, and the largely curable nature of the disease, the cost-effectiveness of the vaccine in various risk groups is uncertain. This study was undertaken to examine the cost-effectiveness of the Lyme disease vaccine and the factors that influence its cost-effectiveness. We constructed a Markov decision-analysis model to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the Lyme disease vaccine in populations at various levels of risk for the disease. The probabilities of clinical events and costs were estimated from reports in the literature. Sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of potential variations of parameters on model results. At the average national incidence of Lyme disease (0.0067%), the incremental cost-effectiveness of vaccination was approximately $1,600,000 per case averted when a yearly booster was given for 10 years after the standard initial vaccination regimen of 3 inoculations at 0, 1, and 12 months. For populations with an annual Lyme disease incidence of 1% (the incidence in several well-defined geographical areas of the US), the incremental cost-effectiveness was approximately $9,900 per case averted. Disease incidence had to exceed 10% before vaccination with yearly boosters became both more effective and more cost saving than no vaccination. The Lyme disease vaccine is cost-effective only for individuals who live in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and who are frequently exposed to ticks."

		"abstract": "Few well-documented cases of central nervous system involvement in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia and/or HCV infection have been reported. We can distinguish between acute or subacute diffuse and focal lesions (transient ischemic attack-like syndromes and cerebrovascular accidents). A search of two electronic databases (Medline and EMBASE) was conducted from the year of their inception (1966 for Medline and 1988 for EMBASE) to September 2000. The search strategy employed entailed combining these terms: Cryoglobulinemia, Central Nervous System, Hepatitis C, Chronic Hepatitis. Cryoglobulinemia and Central Nervous System were also used as free test words. We analysed articles with case reports and the most frequent articles on the references list. The main pathophysiologic mechanism of cerebral involvement is ischemia (or rarely hemorrhage) due to diffuse or segmental vasculitis of the small cerebral vessels. In these cases a brain MRI usually shows single or multiple increased T2 signals. Furthermore an occasional occlusive vasculopathy without vasculitis was documented histologically. In these patients ischemia could be started or enhanced by the engorgement of the microvasculature by clumps of red cells and by aggregates of cryoglobulins. In the same patients vasculitis and hemorheological abnormalities can affect the clinical picture of the cerebral involvement in mixed cryoglobulinemia. Finally, the detection of HCV in the lesions induces a hypothesis that, in some cases, CNS involvement could be directly related to chronic HCV infection, even in the absence of cryoglobulin production. We describe a 63 year-old woman with acute severe encephalopathy. Laboratory evaluation revealed a high positive test result for rheumatoid factor (3390 U/ml) and hypocomplementemia (C4 less than 1.67 mg/dl). Protein immunofixation electrophoresis demonstrated 5% monoclonal proteins (IgM/k and IgG/k), 3% cryoglobulins were present, HCV antibody and HCV-RNA (type 2a-2c) were positive. Cryoglobulins were never typed, because they disappeared after plasma exchanges. Liver enzymes, renal function and findings on cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cerebral CT and MRI were also normal. Antinuclear antibodies, anti nDNA antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, ANCA, Lyme disease serology, complete tests for thrombophilia were negative. Bone aspiration was normal. The patient, in coma, was treated with two plasma exchanges. During the first treatment she recovered consciousness. Prednisone (1 mg/Kg/day) and cyclophosphamide (400 mg iv for three days) were added. After a week two plasma exchanges were performed again. Liver enzymes and rheumatoid factor were analysed monthly for six months and than every two months for another six month period up to the present. Liver enzymes were always normal, rheumatoid factor was always at a lower level than the first evaluation (now it's 311 U/ml). At present she is taking Prednisone 5 mg once a day, neurologic symptoms are absent and neurologic examination is normal. We can conclude that: central neurologic involvement may be the clinical presentation of HCV infection and mixed cryoglobulinemia. HCV serologic tests and cryoglobulins should be considered in patient with encephalopathy of non-obvious cause; plasma exchange is the treatment of choice in acute severe forms; in some patients HCV could involve directly CNS, even in the absence of cryoglobulin production."

Osteomalacia and thyroid disease are also in the differential diagnosis of diffuse pain and are imminently treatable.

To investigate this, 34 Lyme disease sera and 34 sera from patients with other illnesses who had presented to a primary-care facility located in an area of borreliosis endemicity were tested by the BAT and Western blotting (WB). The BAT was more sensitive (79% versus 65%; P = 0.090), especially in cases in which patients had a single erythema migrans lesion (P = 0.021). In addition, the potentially cross-reactive sera were negative by the BAT but WB yielded three (9%) false-positive results.

The BAT was positive for 40 (38%) sera from patients with Lyme disease-related symptoms and appropriate clinical and epidemiological findings. WB confirmed Lyme disease in 30 (75%) of the 40 BAT-positive patients but failed to detect B. burgdorferi infection in 10 BAT-positive patients. WB was also positive for 11 BAT-negative sera, but six (55%) patients had case histories which suggested that the results were false positives. Collectively, the results confirm that the BAT is a sensitive and highly specific test and suggest that widespread use would increase the accuracy of serodiagnostic confirmation of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "This review aims to illustrate the extent to which wildlife act as reservoirs of infectious agents that cause disease in domestic stock, pet and captive animals and humans. More than 40 agents are described. In the case of some of these, e.g. Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli O157 and malignant catarrhal fever, the current evidence is that wildlife either does not act as a reservoir or is of limited importance. However, in the case of many important diseases, including bovine tuberculosis, Weil's disease, Lyme disease, avian influenza, duck virus enteritis and louping ill, wild animals are considered to be the principal source of infection. Wildlife may be involved in the epidemiology of other major diseases, such as neosporosis, Johne's disease, mucosal disease and foot and mouth disease, but further studies are needed. The UK would benefit from a more positive approach to the study of wildlife and the infections they harbour."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease vaccine is based on the outer-surface lipoprotein (OspA) of the pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, and 95% of vaccine recipients develop substantial titers of antibodies against OspA. Here, we identified seven individuals with very low antibody titers after vaccination (low responders). The macrophages of low responders produced less tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 after OspA stimulation and had lower cell-surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 as compared to normal cells, but normal expression of TLR2. TLRs activate innate responses to pathogens, and TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins and peptidoglycan (PGN). After OspA immunization, mice genetically deficient in either TLR2 (TLR2(-/-)) or TLR1 (TLR1(-/-)) produced low titers of antibodies against OspA. Notably, macrophages from TLR2(-/-) mice were unresponsive to OspA and PGN, whereas those from TLR1(-/-) mice responded normally to PGN but not to OspA. These data indicate that TLR1 and TLR2 are required for lipoprotein recognition and that defects in the TLR1/2 signaling pathway may account for human hyporesponsiveness to OspA vaccination."

Eighteen (11.3%) of the blood donors and 11 (5.1%) of the B. burgdorferi-seronegative children were found to have A. phagocytophila antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent-antibody assay (IFA). Nine of 42 (21.4%) patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans tested at the baseline visit, 42 of 118 (35.6%) adults, and 3 of 57 (5.3%) children whose sera were reactive for B. burgdorferi antibodies also tested positive for A. phagocytophila antibodies. The geometric mean titer ranged from 219 to 315 for all groups, and the differences in titers among the groups were not statistically significant. Only one-third of the healthy blood donors reactive by IFA were confirmed to be positive by immunoblotting. We conclude that a significant proportion of adults and children without clinical evidence of HGE will test positive for A. phagocytophila antibodies when the conventional cutoff titer of 80 is used in the IFA. This information must be considered in interpretation of test results."

The strains consisted of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. andersonii, B. bissettii, one undescribed genospecies, MI-8, and one probably new Borrelia species, TXW-1. A high degree of similarity exists between B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. bissettii and between B. bissettii and B. andersonii. Lateral transfers of the ospC gene probably occurred between B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. bissettii and between B. bissettii and B. andersonii. Internal gene recombination appears to occur among them. The highest degree of genetic diversity among them was observed in the two variable domains (V1 and V2), semivariable domain (SV), and the species-specific epitopes (between amino acids 28 and 31). Differences in ospC sequences among southern strains reflect diversity at the strain and genospecies levels. MI-8, which was recognized as an undescribed genospecies in our previous reports, remains distinguishable in our current analysis of ospC genes and is distinct from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Interestingly, another undescribed southern isolate, TXW-1, was not amplified under various PCR conditions. Compared to European B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, American B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains show greater genetic heterogeneity. Southern B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. andersonii, and B. bissettii isolates were intermixed with each other in the phylogenetic trees. In the derived trees in our work, at least one southeastern strain of B. burgdorferi, MI-2, most closely aligns with a so-called invasive cluster that possesses many proven human-invasive strains. Transmission experiments show that MI-2 and the strains in this group of southern spirochetes are able to infect mice and hamsters and that the typical vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, can acquire the spirochetes from infected mammals. Currently, strain MI-2 appears to be the only southern isolate among the 20 we analyzed that clusters with an OspC invasive group and thus might be invasive for humans."

		"abstract": "Babesiosis is considered to be an emerging tick-borne disease in humans worldwide. However, most studies on the epidemiology of human babesiosis to date have been carried out in North America, and there is little knowledge on the prevalence of infection and frequency of disease in other areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Babesia infections in a human population in Germany. A total of 467 sera collected between May and October 1999 from individuals living in the Rhein-Main area were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies to antigens of Babesia microti and Babesia divergens by indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) tests. These sera were derived from 84 Lyme borreliosis patients suffering from erythema migrans, 60 asymptomatic individuals with positive borreliosis serology, and 81 individuals with a history of tick bite. Cutoff values for discrimination between seronegative and seropositive results in the IFA tests were determined using sera from 120 healthy blood donors and 122 patients suffering from conditions other than tick-borne diseases (malaria, n = 40; toxoplasmosis, n = 22; syphilis, n = 20; Epstein-Barr virus infection, n = 20; and presence of antinuclear antibodies, n = 20). The overall specificities of the IFA tests for B. microti and B. divergens were estimated to be >or=97.5%. Positive IgG reactivity against B. microti antigen (titer, >or=1:64) or B. divergens antigen (titer, >or=1:128) was detected significantly more often (P < 0.05) in the group of patients exposed to ticks (26 of 225 individuals; 11.5%) than in the group of healthy blood donors (2 of 120 individuals; 1.7%). IgG antibody titers of >or=1:256 against at least one of the babesial antigens were found significantly more often (P < 0.05) in patients exposed to ticks (9 of 225) than in the control groups (1 of 242). In the human population investigated here, the overall seroprevalences for B. microti and B. divergens were 5.4% (25 of 467) and 3.6% (17 of 467), respectively. The results obtained here provide evidence for concurrent infections with Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia species in humans exposed to ticks in midwestern Germany. They also suggest that infections with Babesia species in the German human population are more frequent than believed previously and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile illness occurring after exposure to ticks or blood transfusions, in particular in immunocompromised patients."

Both microbe species may co-occur in the same and other species of the genus tick and produce a mixed infection in humans and animals. The major objective of the study was to identify DNA of B. burgdorferi and B. microti in the I. ricinus ticks collected in spring and autumn 1999 from 6 sites in north-western Poland. The microbial DNA was identified with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The marker used to detect the B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA was a fragment of the fla gene encoding the protein flagellin, while the B. microti DNA was detected with a fragment of the gene encoding 16S rRNA. A total of 550, 1,160, and 385 tick adults, nymphs, and larvae, respectively, were examined. Among the 155 (7.4%) B. burgdorferi- infected ticks and the 130 (6.2%) infected with B. microti, mixed infection was detected in 0.6% of individuals. The prevalence of coinfection differed between the tick developmental stages. Coinfection was most prevalent (3.1%) in females, males and nymphs being less affected (0.4 and 0.2%, respectively). No coinfection was revealed in the tick larvae. The study described was the first of its kind to be conducted in the former District of Szczecin. For the phenomenon of microbial co-occurrence and related mixed infections to be properly evaluated, the research will be continued."

This study examined the degree of spirochete clearance likely to occur with PMNL or mononuclear cells before the development of the secondary immune response. Without specific antibody in vitro, there was very limited uptake of spirochetes by PMNL or monocytes and no intracellular colocalization of PMNL granule products with spirochetes. Most of the killing of spirochetes by PMNL was extracellular. In contrast, mature macrophages ingest and kill spirochetes avidly with or without specific antibody. Once the spirochetes are opsonized, PMNL clear them rapidly. These findings may be relevant to the initial survival of spirochetes introduced into the host."

		"abstract": "Failures in the antibiotic therapy of Lyme disease have repeatedly been demonstrated by post-treatment isolations of the infecting borreliae. Analyses of the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of borreliae may help to understand the causes of such treatment failures and to develop new therapeutic regimens. The three subspecies of Borrelia burgdorferi known to be pathogenic for humans and to differ in their virulence and organ affinity possibly may also show divergent susceptibilities to some common antibacterial agents. In order to get real clues for such probable differences we compared the efficacy of six antimicrobial agents against 24 borrelial tick and skin isolates belonging to the three subspecies of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. In five comparative evaluations, some significantly different antibiotic sensitivity of the three borrelial species was found. The Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto isolates showed lower sensitivity to cephalosporin, tetracycline and ciprofloxacin as well as a higher sensitivity to erythromycin compared to the B. afzelii and B. garinii isolates. The B. garinii isolates proved to be more sensitive to penicillin in comparison to the B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. afzelii isolates. In the light of these data, treatment failures may be interpreted by serum and tissue levels of the antibiotic too low for an effective killing of the infecting Spirochetes. However, prolonged treatment regimens applying higher dosages of antibiotics, in order to get complete clearing of the infection, may be linked to aggravated side effects. Therefore, the combination of different antiborrelial agents with synergistic effect seems to be a meaningful alternative and should be included in future studies in vitro as well as in vivo."

		"abstract": "In order to determine the prevalence of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) in Belgium, the sera of 216 patients previously diagnosed with Borrelia burgdorferi infection were analysed for possible coinfection with the agent of HGE. For this purpose, an indirect immunofluorescence assay was applied, and positive results were confirmed by Western blot using a 44-kilodalton recombinant protein (rP44) specific for the agent of HGE. Sixteen of the 216 (7.4%) sera tested were positive for the HGE agent using indirect immunofluorescence assay, and seven (3%) of them were confirmed positive by Western blot. These data suggest the agent for HGE is present in Belgium and may cause coinfection in patients infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, as has been reported in the USA and elsewhere in Europe. This is the first report documenting the identification of this agent in Belgium."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi differentially expresses many of the OspE/F/Elp paralogs during tick feeding. These findings, combined with the recent report that stable B. burgdorferi infection of mammals occurs only after 53 h of tick attachment, prompted us to further analyze the expression of the OspE/F/Elp paralogs during this critical period of transmission. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis revealed that OspE, p21, ElpB1, ElpB2, and OspF/BbK2.11 are expressed in the salivary glands of ticks allowed to feed on mice for 53 to 58 h. Interestingly, many of the spirochetes in the salivary glands that expressed abundant amounts of these antigens were negative for OspA and OspC. Although prior reports have indicated that OspE/F/Elp orthologs are surface exposed, none of the individual lipoproteins or combinations of the lipoproteins protected mice from challenge infections. To examine why these apparently surface-exposed lipoproteins were not protective, we analyzed their genetic stability during infection and their cellular locations after cultivation in vitro and within dialysis membrane chambers, mimicking a mammalian host-adapted state. Combined restriction fragment length polymorphism and nucleotide sequence analyses revealed that the genes encoding these lipoproteins are stable for at least 8 months postinfection. Interestingly, cellular localization experiments revealed that while all of these proteins can be surface localized, there were significant populations of spirochetes that expressed these lipoproteins only in the periplasm. Furthermore, host-specific signals were found to alter the expression patterns and final cellular location of these lipoproteins. The combined data revealed a remarkable heterogeneity in populations of B. burgdorferi during tick transmission and mammalian infection. The diversity is generated not only by temporal changes in antigen expression but also by modulation of the surface lipoproteins during infection. The ability to regulate the temporal and spatial expression patterns of lipoproteins throughout infection likely contributes to persistent infection of mammals by B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "By using real-time quantitative PCR, the population dynamics and gene transcription of Borrelia burgdorferi were examined in ticks and skin of mice during acquisition of the infection from mice by ticks and during transmission of the infection from ticks to mice. Population dynamics were determined by using a flaB DNA target. A quantitative analysis of flaB, ospA, ospC, dbpA, and arp transcription was also performed. The results revealed that both uninfected larval and nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks acquired B. burgdorferi as early as 1 day after attachment and that the sizes of spirochete populations within ticks increased during feeding. In addition, all gene targets revealed that there was RNA transcription during feeding. Similar events occurred within infected nymphal ticks feeding on uninfected hosts. Transmission from infected nymphal ticks to mice could be detected within 1 day after attachment. Analysis of skin during the first 3 days after attachment of infected ticks revealed rising numbers of spirochetes but minimal gene transcription. In contrast, the skin of mice with established infections revealed static populations of spirochetes and active but stable transcription of flaB, ospC, dbpA, and arp. There were consistent reductions in the number of spirochetes in the skin at the tick attachment sites compared to the number of spirochetes in the skin at nontick sites, but there were no differences in gene expression between tick and nontick skin sites. Evidence of ospA transcription in skin could be found 1 day after tick attachment but not thereafter."

In the current study, we determined whether crushing nymphal ticks during removal with forceps increased the risk of B. burgdorferi transmission, what degree of protection from transmission of B. burgdorferi was provided by removal of nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say at specific intervals, and whether commercial devices marketed for tick removal worked when tested against nymphal I. scapularis. Both removal via gentle pressure (26% transmission) or crushing the tick (30% transmission) caused a significant decrease in transmission as compared with the sham control (70% transmission). The degree of protection provided via tick removal decreased steadily up to 60 h of attachment; between 60 and 66 h, a dramatic falloff in protection occurred to the point where no protection was observed at 66 h. Finally, commercial tick removal devices varied widely in their efficacy for the removal of attached nymphal I. scapudaris."

Data on L ricinus density assessed by dragging the vegetation in 438 sites during 1996 were cross-correlated with the digital cartography of a GIS, which included the variables altitude, exposure and slope, substratum, vegetation type and roe deer density. Ticks were more abundant at altitudes below 1,300 m a.s.l., in the presence of limestone and vegetation cover with thermophile deciduous forests and high densities of roe deer. A bootstrap aggregation procedure (bagging) was used to produce a model for the prediction of tick occurrence, the accuracy of which was tested on actual tick counts assessed by a further dragging campaign carried out during 1997 to determine infection prevalence and resulted in average 77%. Other tests of the model were made on additional and independent data sets. The prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l, determined by polymerase chain reaction on 2,208 nymphs collected by random dragging in 245 transects selected within eight areas where the model predicted the occurrence of I. ricinus during 1997, was 17.5% and was positively correlated to tick abundance and roe deer density. These findings were used to relate the output of the bagged model (probability of tick occurrence) to the density of infected nymphs through a stepwise model selection procedure and thus to produce a GIS digital map of the probability distribution of infected nymphs in the Province of Trento at high resolution scale (50 by 50-m cell resolution). The application of the bagging procedure increased the accuracy of the prediction made by a single classification tree, a well-known classification method for the analysis of epidemiological data."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, causes joint inflammation in an experimental murine model. Inflammation occurs, in part, due to the ability of B. burgdorferi to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and a strong CD4(+) T helper type 1 response. The mechanisms by which spirochetes induce these responses are not completely known, although transcription factors, such as NF-kappa B in phagocytic cells, initiate the proinflammatory cytokine burst. We show here that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase of 38 kDa (p38 MAP kinase) is involved in the proinflammatory cytokine production elicited by B. burgdorferi Ags in phagocytic cells and the development of murine Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi Ags activated p38 MAP kinase in vitro, and the use of a specific inhibitor repressed the spirochete-induced production of TNF-alpha. The infection of mice that are deficient for a specific upstream activator of the kinase, MAP kinase kinase 3, resulted in diminished proinflammatory cytokine production and the development of arthritis, without compromising the ability of CD4(+) T cells to respond to borrelial Ags or the production of specific Abs. Overall, these data indicated that the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays an important role in B. burgdorferi-elicited inflammation and point to potential new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of inflammation induced by the spirochete."

Lyme disease cases were identified through review of medical records for residents of the Marshfield Epidemiologic Study Area (MESA), a population-based cohort of nearly 80,000 in north-central Wisconsin for which comprehensive medical care data are available through the Marshfield Clinic. These cases were compared with cases reported to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health to estimate the completeness of reporting. Annual incidence rates were calculated for MESA using the cases identified from chart review. Division of Public Health data were used to calculate statewide reported incidence rates, as well as rates for an eight-county region that surrounds and includes the MESA region. Of Lyme disease cases meeting the national case definition identified in MESA, 34% were reported to the state. The average incidence of Lyme disease (1992-1998) was 19.1 per 100,000 per year in MESA, 17.0 in the surrounding eight-county region, and 9.0 statewide. Trends in reported incidence across time, gender, and age in the surrounding eight-county region were generally comparable with those observed in MESA. These findings suggest that the passive surveillance system monitored trends in Lyme disease incidence reasonably well despite underreporting of cases."

For children who are unable to tolerate amoxicillin, there is currently no proven alternative oral therapy for LD. This randomized, unblinded study compared 2 dosage regimens of cefuroxime axetil (20 mg/kg/d and 30 mg/kg/d) with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d), each given for 20 days. Children were enrolled if they were 6 months to 12 years of age, had erythema migrans, and met other eligibility requirements. Serologic testing occurred at entry and after 6 months. Follow-up evaluations for safety, tolerability, and efficacy occurred at 10 and 20 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Forty-three children were randomized (13 in the amoxicillin group, 15 in each cefuroxime axetil group); 39 completed 12 months of follow-up. At the completion of treatment, there was total resolution of erythema migrans in 67% of the amoxicillin group, 92% of the low-dose cefuroxime group, and 87% of the high-dose cefuroxime group, and resolution of constitutional symptoms occurred in 100%, 69%, and 87%, respectively. All patients had a good outcome, with no long-term problems associated with LD. One patient, who was well at the first 2 follow-up visits, was treated with doxycycline because of new constitutional symptoms. Mild diarrhea occurred in a small number of participants in each group (1 patient was diagnosed and treated for Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, which occurred after completing the full course of study medication). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred. The number of patients in this trial was not sufficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups; however, both amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil seem to be safe, efficacious treatments for children with early LD."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that has protean neurologic manifestations involving both the central and peripheral nervous system. The peripheral nervous system manifestations of Lyme borreliosis can be divided chronologically into acute and chronic forms. Within weeks after disease onset, approximately 15% of untreated patients develop an acute Lyme meningoradiculoneuritis with headache, fever, radicular pain, weakness, and sensory loss, often associated with cranial neuropathy, usually facial palsy. Cerebrospinal fluid typically shows lymphocytic pleocytosis, high protein, and normal glucose. Diagnosis is made by recognition of characteristic clinical features with a history of preceding exposure and confirmed by serologic evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi or by antibody or PCR evidence of cerebrospinal fluid infection. Months to years after onset, rare patients may develop chronic polyradiculoneuropathy presenting with sensory symptoms or radicular pain. Diagnosis is confirmed by a history of exposure, previous systemic or acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, and serologic evidence of infection. Pathology of acute or chronic Lyme radiculoneuropathy reveals axonal degeneration with perivascular mononuclear infiltration. Eradication of the organism can be achieved with 2 to 4 weeks of ceftriaxone for both acute and chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis. Isolated facial palsy without evidence of cerebrospinal fluid infection can be treated with oral antibiotics such as doxycycline. Prognosis after therapy is good, but neurologic recovery is slower for chronic than acute Lyme radiculoneuropathy."

		"abstract": "Previous studies from the late 1980s defined the risk of human Lyme disease by determining the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in Ixodes scapularis ticks and Peromyscus sp. mice captured from areas around La Crosse, Wis. High percentages of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis ticks and P. leucopus mice were common in areas located north of Interstate 90 but were not detected in areas south of this major east-west thoroughfare. In this study, we reevaluated the extent of B. burgdorferi infection. High percentages of mice captured from sites north of the interstate were still infected with B. burgdorferi. In addition, B. burgdorferi was recovered from 12 (67%) of 18 mice captured from a site well south of the highway. However, none of 104 mice or 713 I. scapularis ticks captured from the study sites were infected with Ehrlichia spp. The results confirmed the continued high risk for humans to contract infection with B. burgdorferi and the significant southward expansion of the area in which Lyme disease is endemic. In contrast, the risk of acquiring human granulocytic ehrlichiosis remains minimal despite the abundance of appropriate vector ticks and reservoir rodents."

		"abstract": "Between May and December 1998, tick-associated febrile illness was prospectively studied in Southeast Sweden in order to assess the occurrence of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE). Inclusion criteria were fever (> or = 38.0 degrees C), with or without headache, myalgia or arthralgia in patients with an observed tick bite or tick exposure within 1 month prior to onset of symptoms. Patients with clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis were included. Of the 27 patients included, we identified 4 cases of HGE. Three of the patients had coinfection with Lyme borreliosis, which presented as erythema migrans. All 27 patients presented with a 2-5 d history of fever. None of the clinical signs or laboratory parameters monitored was helpful in predicting ehrlichiosis in this group with tick-associated fever conditions. Within the HGE-negative group (n = 23), 12 patients had clinical or laboratory signs of Lyme borreliosis. For 11 patients, the aetiology of the fever remained unclear. Our results suggest that HGE is common in tick-infested areas of Southeast Sweden, and may occur as a coinfection of Lyme borreliosis. Granulocytic ehrlichiosis should be suspected in patients who present with tick-associated fever, with or without erythema migrans. Ehrlichia serology and PCR should be employed to confirm the diagnosis."

Women manifested to a greater extent than men although both genders were bitten equally by ticks, thus indicating that women may be more susceptible to reinfection. All reinfected women were > 44 y old. The county of Kalmar including Oland was found to be highly endemic for reinfection with Lyme borreliosis. Thus the number of tick bites, gender, age and study area influenced the risk of reinfection."

During a 2-year period, we prospectively studied 503 consecutive patients with acute idiopathic facial paralysis for the presence of Lyme borreliosis. We screened the patients for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi and for symptoms or signs related to Lyme borreliosis. Chi-square and logistic regression tests were used for the statistical analysis. Special attention was paid to strict criteria for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Eleven (2.2%) of the 503 patients with facial paralysis had Lyme borreliosis. Fever, headache, pharyngalgia, enlarged cervical lymph nodes, bilateral paralysis, and arthralgia were more common in patients with Lyme borreliosis than in those without it. In the logistic regression modeling the best combination of explanatory variables for predicting the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis included summer season at the onset of facial paralysis, presence of enlarged cervical lymph nodes, and arthralgia. The best combination of explanatory variables to predict the poor outcome of facial paralysis was total paralysis of facial nerves, recurrent facial paralysis, and hyperacusis. Lyme borreliosis is an important infectious cause of facial paralysis. In our study, 11 of 503 patients with acute idiopathic facial paralysis had Lyme borreliosis. The screening for serum antibodies in addition to the thorough evaluation of the history of the patient and of the patient's clinical signs or symptoms possibly linked with Lyme borreliosis, are essential when diagnosing Lyme borreliosis."

Asp177, conserved in all PP(i) PFKs, negates the binding of the alpha-phosphate group of ATP and likely contacts the essential Mg(2+) cation via a water molecule.

Antimyelin antibodies (ELISA-Doxa Kit-Myelin Basic Protein Antibodies) were assessed in 31% (n 11) of examined serum samples of patients with the working diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Statistical analysis (p 0.07) confirmed a more frequent incidence of antimyelin antibodies in younger female subjects (age 31 years) as compared with a group of sera (n 25) where the authors did not record the formation of immunoglobulins against the basic myelin protein (age 51 years). Neither the value of titres nor the frequency of detected anti-borrelia IgG and IgM and immune complexes did not differ significantly in the two groups. From the assembled results ensues that in the course of Lyme borreliosis, in chronic affection of organs an autoimmune reaction may develop where the basic myelin protein is damaged (demyelinizatio) and subsequently antimyelin antibodies are formed."

		"abstract": "Saliva of the hard tick and Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, has a repertoire of compounds that counteract host defenses. Following sequencing of an I scapularis salivary gland complementary DNA (cDNA) library, a clone with sequence homology to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was identified. This cDNA codes for a mature protein, herein called Ixolaris, with 140 amino acids containing 10 cysteines and 2 Kunitz-like domains. Recombinant Ixolaris was expressed in insect cells and shown to inhibit factor VIIa (FVIIa)/tissue factor (TF)-induced factor X (FX) activation with an inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC(50)) in the picomolar range. In nondenaturing gel, Ixolaris interacted stoichiometrically with FX and FXa but not FVIIa. Ixolaris behaves as a fast-and-tight ligand of the exosites of FXa and gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domainless FXa (des-Gla-FXa), increasing its amidolytic activity. At high concentration, Ixolaris attenuates the amidolytic activity of FVIIa/TF; however, in the presence of DEGR-FX or DEGR-FXa (but not des-Gla-DEGR-FXa), Ixolaris becomes a tight inhibitor of FVIIa/TF as assessed by recombinant factor IX (BeneFIX) activation assays. This indicates that FX and FXa are scaffolds for Ixolaris in the inhibition of FVIIa/TF and implies that the Gla domain is necessary for FVIIa/TF/Ixolaris/FX(a) complex formation. Additionally, we show that Ixolaris blocks FXa generation by endothelial cells expressing TF. Ixolaris may be a useful tool to study the structural features of FVIIa, FX, and FXa, and an alternative anticoagulant in cardiovascular diseases."

As many as nine different cp32s appear to be capable of stable replication within a single spirochaete. Here, we show that a construct (pCE310) containing a 4 kb fragment from the putative maintenance region of a B. burgdorferi CA-11.2A cp32 was capable of autonomous replication in both high-passage B. burgdorferi B31 and virulent B. burgdorferi 297. Deletion analysis revealed that only the member of paralogous family 57 and the adjacent non-coding segment were essential for replication. The PF32 ParA orthologue encoded by the pCE310 insert was almost identical to the PF32 orthologues encoded on the B31 and 297 cp32-3 plasmids. The finding that cp32-3 was selectively deleted in both B31 and 297 transformants carrying pCE310 demonstrated the importance of the PF32 protein for cp32 compatibility and confirmed the prediction that cp32 plasmids expressing identical PF32 paralogues are incompatible. A shuttle vector containing the CA-11.2A cp32 plasmid maintenance region was used to introduce green, yellow and cyan fluorescent protein reporters into B. burgdorferi. Flow cytometry revealed that the green fluorescent protein was well expressed by almost 90% of both avirulent and infectious transformants. In addition to enhancing our understanding of B. burgdorferi plasmid biology, our results further the development of genetic systems for dissecting pathogenic mechanisms in Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is now the most common vectorborne disease in North America, Europe and Asia. It is a multisystemic infection which may cause skin, neurological, cardiac or rheumatologic disorders. The aims of the present thesis were: (i) to develop a PCR assay for direct detection of B. burgdorferi DNA and to evaluate the diagnostic utility of PCR in clinical specimens from patients with Lyme borreliosis and (ii) to study the taxonomic classification of B. burgdorferi isolates and its implications for epidemiology and clinical presentation. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis by direct demonstration of B. burgdorferi in clinical specimens would compared to current serology allow (i) optimal specificity, (ii) increased sensitivity during the first weeks of infection, when the antibody response is not yet detectable and (iii) discrimination between ongoing and past infection. Due to the extreme paucity of spirochetes in clinical specimens neither in vitro culture nor antigen detection had yielded a sufficient diagnostic sensitivity. Thus the recently introduced highly sensitive PCR methodology could be a solution and was thus studied. Assays for PCR amplification and subsequent identification of B. burgdorferi specific sequences were established and used. For all assays the analytical sensitivity was a few genome copies using purified DNA as template. The efficacy of PCR was initially evaluated using tissue samples from experimentally infected gerbils in order to start with biological samples a priori known to contain B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi DNA was detectable in 88% of the specimens. Thus the diagnostic sensitivity of PCR was comparable to and even higher than in vitro culture. PCR was significantly more sensitive than a histological B. burgdorferi specific immunophosphatase-staining method. The utility of the PCR was then tested for identification of B. burgdorferi DNA in skin biopsies from 31 patients with erythema migrans. The sensitivity of PCR was 71%, which was superior to culture and serology. Based on own and otherwise published results there is clear evidence for PCR being the most sensitive and specific test for detection of B. burgdorferi in skin biopsies from patients with both early and late dermatoborreliosis. However, since the clinical diagnosis of dermatoborreliosis in most instances is easy, an invasive procedure as a skin biopsy, will only be justified in patients with an atypical clinical presentation. The most frequent and serious manifestation of disseminated Lyme borreliosis is neuroborreliosis. PCR was applied to 190 patients with untreated and confirmed neuroborreliosis. B. burgdorferi DNA was detectable in 17-21% of CSF samples from patients with neuroborreliosis. In patients with very early neuroborreliosis (< 2 weeks), still being negative for specific intrathecal antibody synthesis, a positive PCR was more frequent than in patients with longer disease duration. PCR can be used as a diagnostic aid in these patients. However, in general the measurement of specific intrathecal antibody production in patients with neuroborreliosis was superior to PCR. In urine samples from patients with Lyme borreliosis the diagnostic sensitivity varied, generally showing a low reproducibility. Urine is thus not regarded as a suitable sample source for B. burgdorferi PCR. The reason may be the variable presence of Taq polymerase inhibitors. Based on a semi-quantitative detection system for amplicons, reflecting the input amount of specific DNA and thus the density of spirochetes in the clinical samples high amounts of DNA were found in skin biopsies whereas especially in urine the amount of DNA was low. When the present study was initiated there was no accepted classification of B. burgdorferi. A heterogeneity among B. burgdorferi strains might have important implications for understanding the epidemiology and different clinical presentations (dermatoborreliosis versus neuroborreliosis) and courses (self-limiting versus chronic disease). Furthermore, strain differences were of importance for selection of suitable antigens for diagnostic assays and for vaccine development. Since then, B. burgdorferi isolates have been studied by phenotypic and genotypic traits and have been shown to be highly heterogeneous. Our first approach was to genotype a panel of human B. burgdorferi isolates by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of three genes. Thereafter, sequencing and dideoxy fingerprinting of ospA was applied. By RFLP the strains could be differentiated into two to five groups. The RFLP classification was compared with four different phenotypic and genotypic methods including the rRNA typing. Results obtained with the different methods correlated highly and confirmed the meanwhile accepted taxonomic classification by Baranton et al., According to this the term B. burgdorferi sensu lato comprises three different human pathogenic genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii. All three genospecies have been isolated among Danish patients with Lyme borreliosis and are thus prevalent in Denmark. Since isolation of B. burgdorferi from patients with Lyme borreliosis is laborious and often unsuccessful molecular typing methods based on PCR are recommended obviating the need for isolation by prior culture. Of special interest was to study a possible association of neuroborreliosis to certain B. burgdorferi genospecies, indicating species depended organotropism. By RFLP all six CSF isolates tested belonged to B. garinii and that 6 out of 7 isolates from patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans belonged to B. afzelii. Due to the low culture yield of B. burgdorferi from CSF, the association of B. garinii and neuroborreliosis was further studied by sequence analysis and dideoxyfingerprinting analysis of ospA PCR amplicons obtained from CSF samples from patients with neuroborreliosis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in 11 out of 13 patients B. garinii DNA was found in CSF. These data strongly supports the hypothesis that B. garinii is the principal agent of Lyme neuroborreliosis in Europe. Similarly it was shown that B. afzelii is associated with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and thus dermatoborreliosis. Due to a strain dependent different selection pressure in culture only PCR based methods can be used to answer whether mixed infection in patients specimens occur. Our data indicate that mixed infections in humans if ever are rare."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has bundles of periplasmic flagella subpolarly located at each cell end. These bundles rotate in opposite directions during translational motility. When not translating, they rotate in the same direction, and the cells flex. Here, we present evidence that asymmetrical rotation of the bundles during translation does not depend upon the chemotaxis signal transduction system. The histidine kinase CheA is known to be an essential component in the signaling pathway for bacterial chemotaxis. Mutants of cheA in flagellated bacteria continually rotate their flagella in one direction. B. burgdorferi has two copies of cheA designated cheA1 and cheA2. Both genes were found to be expressed in growing cells. We reasoned that if chemotaxis were essential for asymmetrical rotation of the flagellar bundles, and if the flagellar motors at both cell ends were identical, inactivation of the two cheA genes should result in cells that constantly flex. To test this hypothesis, the signaling pathway was completely blocked by constructing the double mutant cheA1kan cheA2ermC. This double mutant was deficient in chemotaxis. Rather than flexing, it failed to reverse, and it continually translated only in one direction. Video microscopy of mutant cells indicated that both bundles actively rotated. The results indicate that asymmetrical rotation of the flagellar bundles of spirochetes does not depend upon the chemotaxis system but rather upon differences between the two flagellar bundles. We propose that certain factors within the spirochete localize at the flagellar motors at one end of the cell to effect this asymmetry."

The concentrations were determined on the second day of the acute phase and then on the 7th, 12th, 18th, and 23rd days. Apparent rate constants for the elimination of the BSP from blood (k(e)) were calculated with the non-linear regression. In patients with TBE, the highest serum concentrations of alpha(1)BG and NSE, observed on the second day, were followed by their monotonic decrease to the normal levels reached by the 23rd day. The mean k(e) values for alpha(1)BG and NSE were found to be significantly different (0.086+/-0.003 vs. 0.057+/-0.006 day(-1), respectively; p<0.05). Higher serum levels of both BSP were observed in the more severe clinical cases and in the cases with unfavorable outcomes. Similar profiles were also observed for the serum alpha(1)BG and NSE in LD. These results suggest that, in the patients examined, the blood-brain barrier was partially impaired; the quantitative parameters of the serum BSP time courses can be indicative of the extents of the neuronal and/or glial lesions."

		"abstract": "Laboratory testing for B. burgdorferi infection is intended to substantiate a physician's clinical judgment of whether a patient has Lyme disease or not. Cultivation of B. burgdorferi from a patient's skin or blood is the gold standard for demonstration of active infection, but it is expensive and lacks clinical sensitivity. Detection of spirochetal DNA in clinical samples by PCR has better sensitivity, but PCR for B. burgdorferi has not yet been standardized for more routine diagnostic testing. Detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi is the most practical and common approach for laboratory work-up of a case of suspected Lyme disease. Serologic assays fall short of 100% sensitivity and specificity, however, and examination of a single specimen in time does not discriminate between previous and ongoing infection. Because of a background false positivity even among healthy populations of nonendemic regions, serologic testing is recommended only when there is at least a one in five chance, in the physician's estimation, that the patient has active Lyme disease. The pretest likelihood of the disease is determined by the physician in the context of epidemiologic and clinical facts of the case. This estimate can serve to reassure patients who are at low risk of B. burgdorferi infection but are seeking a Lyme test for complaints of a more nonspecific nature. Although new subunit serologic assays based on recombinant proteins are becoming available commercially, the longstanding two-test approach, in which a positive or indeterminate result with a standardized, sensitive ELISA test is followed by verification with a more specific Western blot assay, still provides the physician with a reasonably accurate and reliable assessment of the presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. More recent challenges for serologic testing are seropositivity in the population as the result of immunization with the Lyme disease vaccine and the emergence of new Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease-like illnesses."

		"abstract": "Infection with B. burgdorferi can cause a large joint inflammatory arthritis in patients who have not been treated for early Lyme disease; the knee is the most common joint affected. The diagnosis depends on a history of known exposure to the spirochete, characteristic clinical features, and serologic studies (ELISA and Western blot) confirming exposure to the spirochete. In most patients, antibiotic therapy is curative, but in a smaller percentage of patients, the presence of the HLA-DR beta 1*0401 haplotype can trigger treatment-resistant arthritis, in which antibiotic therapy is ineffective; in these instances, remittive agents, such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, are indicated. Arthroscopic synovectomy may be considered when antibiotic therapy is not curative. Fibromyalgia can follow infection with B. burgdorferi but is unresponsive to antibiotic therapy; it is treated with tricyclic antidepressants and an exercise program. Lyme arthritis is the only chronic inflammatory arthritis in which the specific cause is known and can be cured. As such, it serves as an excellent model with which to study the pathogenesis of more common inflammatory arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a vector-borne illness that can affect numerous organ systems during the early disseminated phase, including the heart. The clinical course of Lyme carditis is usually benign with most patients recovering completely. In rare instances, death from Lyme carditis has been reported. The cardinal manifestation of Lyme carditis is conduction system disease, which generally is self-limited. Heart block occurs usually at the level of the atrioventricular node but often is unresponsive to atropine sulfate. Temporary pacing may be necessary in more than 30% of patients, but permanent heart block rarely develops. Myocardial and pericardial involvement can occur but generally is mild and self-limited. Diagnosis is made by associating the clinical and historical features of borreliosis, such as previous tick bite, EM, or neurologic involvement, with electrocardiographic abnormalities and symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, syncope, and dyspnea. Serologic studies and endomyocardial biopsy can support the diagnosis in the correct clinical setting, and MR imaging, echocardiography, and gallium scanning have utility in selected circumstances. No treatment has been shown clearly to attenuate or prevent the development of Lyme carditis, but mild carditis generally is treated with oral antibiotics and severe carditis with intravenous antibiotics in an effort to eradicate the infection and prevent late complications of Lyme disease. There is conflicting evidence regarding the role that B. burgdorferi plays in the development and progression of chronic congestive heart failure. Because of the significant false-positive ELISA rate in this population and the unclear benefit of antibiotic therapy, confirmatory Western blot analysis is recommended. Routine therapy and screening of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy is of limited utility and should be reserved for patients with clear history of antecedent Lyme disease or tick bite."

With early diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, patients do well. Because culture is not reliable, diagnosis has relied on positive serology to document exposure. Serology should improve as second-generation assays become available. Although there is a preventive vaccine based on the lipoprotein OspA, newer vaccines in development may prove more desirable. Lyme disease provides a valuable model to study how infectious pathogens cause neurologic disease."

Because this phase of infection with B. burgdorferi offers an excellent opportunity to treat this potentially systemic infection, front-line physicians must be familiar with its diagnosis. Although much attention has been paid to the classic form--the target lesion or bull's eye--there are variations that are more common. These include uniform coloration, lesions with necrotic or vesicular centers, and lesions with shapes that are not circular or oval. These findings must be interpreted in epidemiologic context. Serologic testing at this phase of the illness should not be done. It is unnecessary and potentially misleading; false-positive and false-negative tests can occur. Diagnosis is clinical. Prompt initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy for 3 weeks cures most patients at this early stage of the disease. Clinicians should be aware that 15% of patients may be coinfected with a second tick-borne pathogen, which could alter the usual clinical manifestations and the response to treatment."

		"abstract": "Ticks are a part of the landscape where humans live, work, and play. Because ticks carry a wide range of organisms that potentially can cause disease in humans, many studies have focused on ways to reduce risk of these diseases. Ticks have biologically complex interactions with microorganisms and with their vertebrate hosts, on whom they depend for blood meals and survival. To consider ways to reduce the burden of tick-borne diseases in humans, it is necessary to understand the biology and ecology of ticks and their interface with humans. In many areas, changes in land use, reforestation, and patterns of human settlements have led to more abundant tick populations, increasing rates of infections in ticks, and increasing contact with human populations. Warmer winter temperatures in temperate regions may extend the transmission season for some ticks and pathogens. Although much of the discussion in this article has focused on I. scapularis and the Lyme disease spirochete (because they have been studied extensively), other tick-pathogen pairs may differ in risk factors for infection and transmission dynamics. Interventions studied to reduce the burden of tick-borne diseases include changing the environment, controlling vertebrate hosts, killing ticks, altering the behavior of humans, treating tick bites, and trying to protect humans through immunologic means (vaccine). All of these approaches have limitations and drawbacks. From a public health perspective, a plan that employs multiple strategies may be most effective. This article has reviewed what is known about preventive interventions, including the vaccine."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic infection caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi. In European endemic areas like northeast France, articular manifestations are, after neuroborreliosis, the most frequent extra-cutaneous features observed. Among the pathogenic species of Borrelia, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most frequently identified during Lyme arthritis, but others species also seem to be involved. The diagnosis of Lyme arthritis is usually based on combined clinical data and serological laboratory tests. In atypical forms, detection of bacterial DNA could be useful. While mechanisms involved in acute Lyme arthritis are beginning to be better understood, the pathogenesis of chronic arthritis, which concerns about 10% of the patients, remains unknown. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the prolonged evolution of the articular disease: a chronic persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi, which evades the host immune system within the joint and/or an autoimmune mechanism by molecular mimicry. The antibiotic therapy is codified in acute arthritis, but is not really adapted in chronic Lyme arthritis or post-Lyme syndrome. To prevent the disease, the vaccine available in the United States does not offer complete protection and is not useful in Europe since the species heterogeneity is important for the outer surface protein A. A better understanding of Lyme disease pathogenesis can subsequently lead to new therapeutic or preventive approaches."

In some cases, onset of skin lesions is triggered by antigenic stimulation, and specific skin infiltrates at sites of previous herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection have been well documented. Specific skin manifestations of B-CLL can also be observed at sites typical for lymphadenosis benigna cutis (nipple, scrotum, earlobe), a Borrelia burgdorferi-associated cutaneous B-cell pseudolymphoma. We studied specific skin manifestations of B-CLL arising at sites typical for B. burgdorferi-induced lymphadenosis benigna cutis, analyzing tissues for presence of B. burgdorferi DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Six patients with B-CLL (M : F = 4 : 2; mean age: 67.8) presented with specific skin lesions located on the nipple (four cases) and scrotum (two cases). Clinically there were solitary erythematous plaques or nodules. Histology revealed in all cases a dense, monomorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes showing an aberrant CD20+/CD43+ phenotype. In all cases monoclonality was demonstrated by PCR analysis of the JH gene rearrangement. PCR analysis showed in four of the six cases the presence of DNA sequences specific for B.burgdorferi. Our study demonstrates that infection with B. burgdorferi can trigger the development of specific cutaneous infiltrates in patients with B-CLL."

The clinical basis and variable presentation of EM leave room for diagnostic error and, as a consequence, potential long-term repercussions such as rheumatic, cardiac, ophthalmic, or neurologic complications. Most cases are reported in the Northcentral and Northeastern states. In areas where LD is not endemic, the differential diagnosis of annular erythema may not list EM highly, although all the features of a lesion may fit the typical description of EM. Therefore, a complete understanding of LD and its clinical presentation are key in making a diagnosis, especially in areas with low incidence. We present a hypothetical case report of EM from Oklahoma, a state with low incidence of LD, for the purposes of review of this entity and the differential diagnosis of annular erythema."

Characterization of the highly hydrophobic Borrelia outer membrane component P13 from a mutant (OspA- OspB- OspC- and OspD-) strain was undertaken by use of a combination of mass spectrometric methods. In a previous investigation, an electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrum of the intact protein provided an average molecular weight that was 20 Da lower than the predicted molecular weight. The mass deviation could be explained by a modification of the N-terminus of the protein such as pyroglutamylation (-17 Da) in combination with the experimental error of measurement, however more information was required. New structural information for this membrane protein was provided by peptide mapping with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) and sequencing with ESI-quadrupole-TOF tandem MS."

The aim of this study was to describe the findings of routine clinical, auditory and vestibular tests in patients with Ménière's and Lyme disease and to use electrocochleography (ECoG) to assess the presence of endolymphatic hydrops (EH) in both diseases. Transtympanic ECoG was performed in 91 patients with Ménière's disease and in 11 patients with confirmed Lyme disease. In both diseases the majority of patients had more than one complaint. There was one case with isolated hearing loss in the Lyme disease group. Typical clinical manifestations of Ménière's disease (vertigo, sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus) were found in 6/11 patients (54.5%) in the Lyme disease group. The ECoG results indicated that there were 65/91 patients (71.4%) with Ménière's disease and 5 patients (45.5%) with Lyme disease who presented with EH. No statistically significant difference was found between the incidence of different symptoms of Ménière's and Lyme disease. On the basis of these results, patients with Lyme disease should undergo careful examination and investigation, especially in endemic regions. The presence of EH does not exclude the presence of infection with borreliosis as a cause of Ménière's disease-like symptoms."

In this study, we address the question of whether nymphs show a greater tendency than adults to accept humans as their host. To evaluate this, we have compared the host acceptance behavior of nymphs and adults (males and females) with respect to a human in Rambouillet forest, a focus of Lyme disease. Individual ticks (nymph, male or female) located on a herbaceous stem were exposed to different stimuli (e.g., approach, stem movement, breathing), and the response of each individual to these stimuli was noted. Tick responses were categorised into classes (from 0 to 3) according to their intensity. Statistical analysis carried out on 22 ticks allowed us to compare the behavior of the nymph stage with respect to males and females. Despite the small sample sizes, it appears that nymphs are more responsive to a human than are the adults."

An exploratory, tree-based statistical analysis was used to identify ecological variables that were associated with spirochete infection among rodents and ticks. Spirochetes were isolated from tissues of 71 rodents: 22 (69%) of 32 eastern woodrats, 39 (53%) of 74 cotton mice, and 11(25%) of 44 hispid cotton rats. Rodent infection prevalences were significantly higher in the Coastal Zone than in other regions. Spirochetes were also cultured from 31 (2.6%) of 1,193 questing ticks. Prevalence of spirochetes in Ixodes affinis Neumann (19/74, 26%) was significantly higher than in I. scapularis Say (12/864, 1.3%) and other species (0/255) of ticks tested. In addition, two (9%) of 23 adult I. minor Neumann removed from woodrats contained spirochetes. Isolates from rodents and ticks were analyzed immunologically by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blots, and further characterized by polymerase chain reaction assays and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. All were determined to be B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Results of this study confirmed that B. burgdorferi is endemic in South Carolina, and that enzootic transmission cycles exist at foci in the Coastal Zone. These findings add additional evidence that I. affinis and I. minor are potentially significant maintenance vectors of the spirochete."

The second part of the study was undertaken 2 yr later to characterize B. burgdorferi distribution by focusing on the areas where L. ricinus was the predominant species. Ten areas were selected from which 1,535 nymphs and adults of I. ricinus were collected and processed by PCR and culture techniques. Infected ticks were found in all zones. B. burgdorferi DNA was detected in a mean of 9.3 and 1.5% of adults and nymphs, respectively. Nine isolates of B. burgdorferi were obtained, belonging to four different genospecies (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. valaisiana, and B. lusitaniae). The results indicate that some areas of Spain have a potential risk for Lyme disease agent exposure and that B. borgdorferi appears to have an increasing occurrence in ticks in the Basque Country."

Capillary infection was stable and persisted in the nymphs for at least 10 d after feeding. Capillary feeding also maintained natural vector competence patterns because I. scapularis ticks acquired infection unlike Dermacentor variablis (Say), which did not become infected. Capillary infected I. scapularis nymphs were capable of transmitting the infection to naive mice although not as efficiently as naturally infected nymphs. The capillary infection method is convenient and is a better alternative to syringe inoculation as a means of infecting animals with B. burgdorferi."

The diagnosis of LNB was based on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies, laboratory findings and the clinical course whereas the patient's history and the lack of characteristic skin lesions obscured the diagnosis in the beginning. After four weeks of antibiotic and physiotherapeutic treatment, the hemiparetic symptoms had completely resolved. Although evidence of vasculitic and perivascular inflammation in LNB has been described in the literature, large cerebral vessel occlusive disease represents a rare finding. Appropriate treatment strategies can lead to good clinical rehabilitation, as shown in this case, making the timely diagnosis a crucial issue. We conclude that LNB should be considered in every stroke-like episode of unknown origin in children, even in the absence of a history of a tick bite or typical skin lesions."

		"abstract": "The distribution and abundance of Ixodes scapularis were studied in Wisconsin, northern Illinois, and portions of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan by inspecting small mammals for ticks and by collecting questing ticks at 138 locations in state parks and natural areas. Environmental data were gathered at a local level (i.e., micro and meso levels), and a geographic information system (GIS) was used with several digitized coverages of environmental data to create a habitat profile for each site and a grid map for Wisconsin and Illinois. Results showed that the presence and abundance of I. scapularis varied, even when the host population was adequate. Tick presence was positively associated with deciduous, dry to mesic forests and alfisol-type soils of sandy or loam-sand textures overlying sedimentary rock. Tick absence was associated with grasslands, conifer forests, wet to wet/mesic forests, acidic soils of low fertility and a clay soil texture, and Precambrian bedrock. We performed a discriminant analysis to determine environmental differences between positive and negative tick sites and derived a regression equation to examine the probability of I. scapularis presence per grid. Both analyses indicated that soil order and land cover were the dominant contributors to tick presence. We then constructed a risk map indicating suitable habitats within areas where I. scapularis is already established. The risk map also shows areas of high probability the tick will become established if introduced. Thus, this risk analysis has both explanatory power and predictive capability."

The genetic identities of these Taiwan isolates (TWKM1-7) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and sequence similarities of the PCR-amplified ospC gene amplicons. After cleavage by nuclease Dral, differential fragment patterns of PCR-amplified ospC DNA in relation to different genospecies of Lyme disease spirochaetes were observed and all of these Taiwan isolates were genetically affiliated to the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The phylogenetic analysis on the sequence similarity of these Taiwan isolates revealed a highly homogeneous genotype, ranging from 99.3% to 100%, within the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and was distinguished from other genospecies of Borrelia isolates. The sequence similarity analysis also revealed the high sequence variability of the ospC gene among Borrelia strains that belong to the same genospecies but were isolated from different biological and geographical sources. Thus, these results provide the first investigation on the genetic identity of the ospC gene of these Taiwan isolates and show that these Taiwan isolates were closely related genetically to the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto."

B. burgdorferi was detected in 80% (40 of 50) of the specimens tested; the mean number of spirochetes in these specimens ranged over 3 orders of magnitude (10 to 11,000 spirochetes per 2-mm biopsy specimen). Larger numbers of spirochetes were significantly associated with a shorter duration of the erythema migrans skin lesion (P = 0.020), smaller skin lesions (P = 0.020), and infection with a specific genotype of B. burgdorferi (P = 0.008) but not with the number or severity of symptoms. Skin culture positivity was significantly associated with skin lesions containing larger numbers of spirochetes (P = 0.019)."

By immunoglobulin G (IgG) Western blotting (WB) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), up to 74 and 100% of acute- and convalescent-phase samples, respectively, from 23 patients with erythema migrans (EM) were positive for recombinant BBK32 protein from B. afzelii. In the serology of disseminated LB, the three variant BBK32 antigens cross-reacted. In total, 14 of 14 samples from patients with neuroborreliosis and 15 of 15 samples from patients with Lyme arthritis were positive. The specificities of the IgG ELISA with the variant BBK32 antigens for EM and disseminated borreliosis were 81 to 92% and 89 to 95%, respectively. Our findings indicate that the BBK32 proteins are promising serodiagnostic antigens for the detection of early and disseminated LB but that variant BBK32 proteins may be needed either in parallel or in combination with an immunoassay for LB to cover all the relevant borrelial species that cause the disease."

The crystal structure of recombinant variant protein VlsE1 at 2.3-A resolution reveals that the six variable regions form loop structures that constitute most of the membrane distal surface of VlsE, covering the predominantly alpha-helical, invariant regions of the protein. The surface localization of the variable amino acid segments appears to protect the conserved regions from interaction with antibodies and hence may contribute to immune evasion."

Seven hundred twenty-one serum samples were collected between 1992 and 1999 from febrile patients with unresolved aetiology (n=108), patients suspected of having Lyme disease (n=174), forestry workers (n=154) and healthy controls (n=54) as well as from wild deer (n=96), hares (n=60), wild boar (n=15) and red foxes (n=60). Reactive antibodies against granulocytic Ehrlichia were detected in 4% of febrile patients with unresolved aetiology and in 4% of patients suspected of having Lyme disease. Among the forestry workers, 1% tested positive for antibodies against granulocytic Ehrlichia, whereas all the healthy controls were negative. Antibody reaction against monocytic Ehrlichia was detected in only 2% of the febrile patients. Granulocytic Ehrlichia and monocytic Ehrlichia-reactive serum antibodies were detected in 22% and 3% of the deer samples, respectively, and in 2% of the hares. In wild boars and in red foxes, only serum antibodies reactive against monocytic Ehrlichia were detected in 13% and 7%, respectively. The demonstration of the presence of both granulocytic and monocytic Ehrlichia-reactive serum antibodies among humans and wild animals in The Netherlands indicates that patients suspected of having Lyme disease and febrile patients with unresolved aetiology should be tested for the presence of granulocytic and monocytic Ehrlichia antibodies or by polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, granulocytic Ehrlichia are most prevalent in humans and animals in The Netherlands."

		"abstract": "Over 80% of reported cases of Lyme disease in the United States occur in coastal regions of northeastern and mid-Atlantic states. The genetic structure of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi) and its main tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) was studied concurrently and comparatively by sampling natural populations of I. scapularis ticks along the East Coast from 1996 to 1998. Borrelia is genetically highly diverse at the outer surface protein ospC. Since Borrelia is highly clonal, the ospC alleles can be used to define clones. A newly designed reverse line blotting (RLB) assay shows that up to 10 Borrelia clones can infect a single tick. The clone frequencies in Borrelia populations are the same across the Northeast. On the other hand, I. scapularis populations show strong regional divergence (among northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and southern states) as well as local differentiation. The high genetic diversity within Borrelia populations and the disparity in the genetic structure between Borrelia and its tick vector are likely consequences of strong balancing selection on local Borrelia clones. Demographically, both Borrelia and I. scapularis populations in the Northeast show the characteristics of a species that has recently expanded from a population bottleneck. Major geological and ecological events, such as the last glacial maximum (18,000 years ago) and the modern-day expansion of tick habitats, are likely causes of the observed \"founder effects\" for the two organisms in the Northeast. We therefore conclude that the genetic structure of B. burgdorferi has been intimately shaped by the natural history of its main vector, the northern lineage of I. scapularis ticks."

Observational cohort study. 31 university-based or clinician-practice sites in 10 endemic states. 10 936 participants enrolled in a phase III trial of Lyme disease vaccine; 118 participants had erythema migrans in which Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by culture or polymerase chain reaction. Clinical characteristics and treatment outcome were noted. Skin biopsies of erythema migrans were performed for culture and detection of B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction; serologic responses were determined by Western blot. The 118 patients with microbiologically confirmed erythema migrans presented a median of 3 days after symptom onset. Early erythema migrans commonly had homogeneous or central redness rather than a peripheral erythema with partial central clearing. The most common associated symptoms were low-grade fever, headache, neck stiffness, arthralgia, myalgia, or fatigue. By convalescence, 65% of patients had positive IgM or IgG antibody responses to B. burgdorferi. Most patients responded promptly to antibiotic treatment. In major endemic areas in the United States, Lyme disease commonly presents as erythema migrans with homogeneous or central redness and nonspecific flu-like symptoms. Clinical outcome is excellent if antibiotic therapy is administered soon after symptom onset."

The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by the slow-feeding ixodid tick Ixodes scapularis, whereas the relapsing fever spirochete, B. hermsii, is transmitted by Ornithodoros hermsi, a fast-feeding argasid tick. Lyme disease spirochetes are generally restricted to the midgut in unfed I. scapularis. When nymphal ticks feed, the bacteria pass through the hemocoel to the salivary glands and are transmitted to a new host in the saliva after 2 days. Relapsing fever spirochetes infect the midgut in unfed O. hermsi but persist in other sites including the salivary glands. Thus, relapsing fever spirochetes are efficiently transmitted in saliva by these fast-feeding ticks within minutes of their attachment to a mammalian host. We describe how B. burgdorferi and B. hermsii change their outer surface during their alternating infections in ticks and mammals, which in turn suggests biological functions for a few surface-exposed lipoproteins."

To understand the mechanism(s) implicated in the regulation of the synthesis and release of IL-10 during early infection, we investigated the autocrine effects of IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-10 itself, as well as the exocrine effect of IFN-gamma on the production of macrophage-derived IL-10 with lipoprotein as a stimulant. In addition, in view of the differences in the receptor and signal transduction pathways of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and bacterial lipoproteins, we also investigated the effects described above with LPS as a stimulant. The THP-1 human monocytic cell line and purified recombinant lipidated OspA (L-OspA) were used as the model target cell and stimulant, respectively. TNF-alpha increased the production of IL-10, as elicited by lipoproteins. The production of IL-10 by THP-1 cells stimulated with L-OspA was autoregulated by a negative feedback mechanism involving the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R). Exogenous IFN-gamma significantly inhibited the production of IL-10. Both autocrine (IL-10) and exocrine (IFN-gamma) inhibition of IL-10 production resulted in an increase in the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-12. The same results were obtained when the stimulant was LPS. The results further illustrate that IL-10 may play a pivotal role in Lyme disease pathogenesis. Moreover, the regulation of its production with lipoprotein as a stimulant is indistinguishable from that observed when LPS acts as a stimulant."

The Scl70 antigen was obtained by recombinant DNA procedures using a prokaryotic expression system; CENP-B was a Baculovirus-expressed recombinant protein. Anti-centromere and anti-Scl70 antibodies were assayed in serum samples from 288 patients, of whom 123 had systemic sclerosis/scleroderma and 165 constituted the control groups (including patients with other connective tissue diseases, viral infections, Lyme disease, and healthy subjects). The sensitivity was 98.8% (confidence interval, 96-101%) for anti-Scl70 and 100% (99.6-100%) for anti-CENP-B; the specificity was 99.0% (98-100%) and 100% (99.9-100%) for anti-Scl70 and anti-CENP-B, respectively. The intra-assay coefficient variations (CV) ranged from 3.8 to 9.2% for anti-Scl70, and from 2.8 to 8.0% for anti-CENP-B. Inter-assay CVs were 8.1 to 12.0% for anti-Scl70, and 4.7 to 10.5% for anti-CENP-B. In 3 patients, coexpression of both antibodies was observed. The results of this study demonstrate that the light scattering technology is also applicable to the detection of autoantibodies to intracellular antigens for the diagnosis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases."

A group of 200 blood donors from Prague (100 men, mean age 33.5 years and 100 women mean age 24.4 years) and 71 subjects with a higher risk of contact with ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi--forestry workers from the Sumava mountains (39 men, mean age 40.6 years and 32 women, mean age 44.5 years). In all participants antiborrelia antibodies class IgM and IgG were assessed and using the Western blot method the presence of specific antigens was examined. The blood samples of all probands were analyzed in the national reference laboratory for Lyme borreliosis CEM in the National Institute of Public Health in Prague. To test the hypothesis on the difference of groups as regards the frequency of positive antibody levels the chi square test was used. For testing the hypothesis on the difference of the groups as regards antibodies irrespective of normal laboratory values the non-parametric method--the Mann-Whitney test was used. The group of Prague blood donors and forestry workers from the Sumava mountains do not differ as to the individual frequency of positive antibody values assessed by the ELISA method in class IgM and IgG but they differ in class IgM assessed by the Western blot method. Both groups differ moreover markedly in the general distribution of antibodies unrelated to normal laboratory values assessed by the ELISA method in class IgM, in class IgG the distribution does not differ. We provided evidence that when using a different formulation of the hypothesis while using correct statistical methods identical data can be differently interpreted. Thus in the interpretation of the prevalence of antiborrelia antibody levels in healthy populations with a different risk--even if the two groups do not differs as to the frequency of positive findings, there is a significant statistical difference in their distribution."

Retrospective study of 182 patients with idiopathic SHL. One hundred six patients presented with sudden SHL, and 76 presented with progressive SHL. Serologies for herpes simplex and varicella-zoster viruses (immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G titers), Lyme disease (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), syphilis (fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption or microhemagglutination-Treponema pallidum test) and human immunodeficiency virus were performed. The serologies were negative in 179 patients. Two patients had positive serologies for Lyme disease and another tested positive for syphilis. Both cases of suspected Lyme disease were later excluded by Western blot analysis and lumbar puncture (two false-positives). The patient with serologic syphilis was diagnosed as having latent syphilis after neurosyphilis was excluded. The infection screening was positive in only 1 (0.6%) of 182 patients: the patient who was diagnosed with latent syphilis. On the basis of these results and taking into account the cost of systematic screening, we propose that serologic tests be limited to patients with suspect histories or symptomatologies, except for patients with a diagnosis of syphilis."

Nonimmune Long-Evans rats were given a short-course treatment orally with excessive amounts of ethanol. Their spleens were removed at the time of sacrifice, and separate spleen cell suspensions were prepared and tested in vitro for their ability to kill two bacterial pathogens, Listeria monocytogenes and Borrelia burgdorferi. After the bacteria were mixed separately with various concentrations of spleen cells, it was found that spleen cells from the ethanol-treated rats killed fewer bacteria than matching pair-fed controls, based on counts of the number of cultured CFU (for Listeria) or based on microscopic examination (for Borrelia). For the in vivo studies, ethanol-treated and control rats were infected intraperitoneally with Listeria, and then, 1 to 3 days later, they were assessed for systemic infection based on the numbers of organisms present in their livers and spleens. Numbers of bacterial CFU for both organs were significantly higher in the group fed ethanol for the first 2 days after listerial challenge. These results support the concept that acute exposure to high levels of ethanol can impair host defense mechanisms, especially those expressed at the cellular level, which could lead to increased susceptibility to certain types of infections."

Careful delineation of these protective epitopes on target antigens is essential for the development of vaccine candidates as well as for understanding the limitations of such vaccines. Structural models of these targets will provide critical information about conformation and specific residue surface accessibility for defining protective epitopes. Co-crystal structures with Fab fragments of protective antibodies will further delineate critical antigen surfaces. Population genetics will provide vital information on the heterogeneity of these proteins. Detailed epitope mapping will provide the information needed for the bioengineering of antigens needed to expand the specificity of a candidate vaccine."

To evaluate adverse events following Lyme disease vaccination reported to VAERS during the first 19 months of the vaccine's licensure. Analysis of all VAERS reports of adverse events following vaccination for Lyme disease in the US from 28 December 1998 to 31 July 2000. We evaluated reported adverse events for unexpected patterns in age, gender, time to onset, dose number, and clinical characteristics and compared them to adverse events observed in clinical trials of this vaccine. Over 1,400,000 doses were distributed and 905 adverse events were reported to VAERS, 440 in men and 404 in women, with ages ranging from 10 to 82 years. The majority (56%) of adverse events occurred after administration of the first dose. The most frequently reported adverse events were arthralgia (250), myalgia (195), and pain (157). There were 59 reports coded as arthritis, 34 as arthrosis, 9 as rheumatoid arthritis, and 12 as facial paralysis. Sixty-six (7.4%) events were classified as serious, involving life-threatening illness, hospitalization, prolongation of hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or death. Twenty-two hypersensitivity reactions were reported. Based on reporting to VAERS, we did not detect unexpected or unusual patterns of reported adverse events following Lyme disease vaccine administration, other than hypersensitivity reactions, compared with adverse events observed in clinical trials."

Here we describe a novel mechanism of immune evasion by B. burgdorferi. In immunocompetent mice, spirochetes that did not express ospC (the outer-surface protein C gene) were selected within 17 d after inoculation, concomitantly with the emergence of anti-OspC antibody. Spirochetes with no detectable OspC transcript that were isolated from immunocompetent mice reexpressed ospC after they were either cultured in vitro or transplanted to naive immunocompetent mice, but not in OspC-immunized mice. B. burgdorferi persistently expressed ospC in severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice. Passive immunization of B. burgdorferi-infected SCID mice with an anti-OspC monoclonal antibody selectively eliminated ospC-expressing spirochetes but did not clear the infection. OspC-expressing spirochetes reappeared in SCID mice after the anti-OspC antibody was eliminated. We submit that selection of surface-antigen nonexpressers is an immune evasion mechanism that contributes to spirochetal persistence."

The region of chromosome 5 including the osteopontin (OPN) gene (Opn) has been identified in intercross populations of C3H/HeN x C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ x BALB/cAnN mice. OPN is of particular interest as it is involved in the maintenance and remodeling of tissue during inflammation, it regulates production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-12 (cytokines implicated in Lyme arthritis), it is necessary for host control of certain bacterial infections, and mice displaying different severities of Lyme arthritis possess different alleles of the OPN gene. Macrophages and splenocytes from OPN-deficient mice on mixed C57BL/6J-129S or inbred 129S backgrounds were stimulated with the Pam(3)Cys modified lipoprotein from Borrelia burgdorferi, OspA. OPN was not required for OspA-induced cytokine production; however, macrophages from 129S-Opn(-/-) mice displayed a reduced level of IL-10 production. OPN was also not required for resistance to severe arthritis, as B. burgdorferi-infected 129S-Opn(-/-) mice developed mild arthritis, as did their wild-type littermates. Arthritis was more severe in OPN-deficient mice on the mixed C57BL/6J-129S backgrounds than in inbred mice of either strain. This increase was most likely due to a gene(s) closely linked to Opn on chromosome 5 in conjunction with other randomly assorting genes. Deficiency in OPN did not influence the numbers of spirochetes in tissues from B. burgdorferi-infected mice, indicating OPN is not part of the host defense to this pathogen. Interestingly, there was no alteration in the B. burgdorferi-specific antibody isotypes in OPN-deficient mice, indicating that its effect on helper T-cell responses is not relevant to the host response to B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Vector borne diseases are infections transmitted by arthropods. The vector can mechanically spread the infectious disease or give hospitality to microrganisms for their biological cycle. The etiologic agents of these infections are viruses as yellow fever and Dengue, protozoans as plasmodium of malaria, Leishmania spp., bacteria as Borrelia burgdorferi, Rickettsia spp. or worms as lymphatic filariasis. They are emerging infectious diseases for the epidemiological changes of our national territory (ex. Lyme disease) but especially for the significant increase of the imported forms. Malaria is the more important infection for its clinical management but also for its remote possibility of a further transmission in Italy. In this review are illustrated the recent progresses in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the main vector borne infections that the clinical physicians may frequently observe. It is very important to know these diseases because an adequate preparation and continuous updating are necessarily required."

Twenty-one isolates were found to detectably infect mice. A variation among isolates in degree of infectivity was observed. Higher infection rate and higher average ELISA readings were recorded for intradermal than intraperitoneal inoculations. The results suggest differences between Borrelia genospecies in organotropism. The ear was frequently infected by representatives of all genospecies; among high infectivity experiments, this rate was highest, 100%, in infections by Borrelia afzelii. Further differences between genospecies specific organ distributions: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia garinii isolates seemed to infect the bladder relatively more frequently than B. afzelii did; B. afzelii isolates infected heart relatively more frequently than others did. Genospecies specific differences were demonstrated between antigens in reactivity, i.e. in their 'sensitivity' as reagents of ELISA and IFA methods to measure isolate specific immune responses. Antigens from two B. afzelii isolates differed clearly in sensitivity."

Microarrays contained 95.4% of the predicted B31 genes, 150 (8.6%) of which were differentially regulated (changes of > or = 1.8-fold) among the three growth conditions. A substantial proportion (46%) of the differentially regulated genes encoded proteins with predicted export signals (29% from predicted lipoproteins), emphasizing the importance to Bb of modulating its extracellular proteome. For B31 cultivated at the more restrictive UT condition, microarray data provided evidence of a bacterial stringent response and factors that restrict cell division. A large proportion of genes were responsive to the FT growth condition, wherein increased temperature and reduced pH were prominent environmental parameters. A surprising theme, supported by cluster analysis, was that many of the gene expression changes induced during the FT growth condition were transient and largely tempered as B31 adapted to the mammalian host, suggesting that once Bb gains entry and adapts to mammalian tissues, fewer differentially regulated genes are exploited. It therefore would seem that although widely dissimilar, the UT and dialysis membrane chamber growth conditions promote more static patterns of gene expression in Bb. The microarray data thus provide a basis for formulating new testable hypotheses regarding the life cycle of Bb and attaining a more complete understanding of many aspects of Bb's complex parasitic strategies."

The dbpA was cloned and sequenced from the three pathogenic Borrelia species common in Europe. Sequence analysis revealed high interspecies heterogeneity. The identity of the predicted amino acid sequences was 43 to 62% among Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii. The respective recombinant DbpAs (rDbpAs) were produced and tested as antigens by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). One hundred percent of patients with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 93% of patients with Lyme arthritis (LA) reacted positively. Sera from the majority of patients reacted with one rDbpA only and had no or low cross-reactivity to other two variant proteins. In patients with culture-positive erythema migrans (EM), the sensitivity of rDbpA immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgM ELISA was low. The DbpA seems to be a sensitive and specific antigen for the serodiagnosis of LA or NB, but not of EM, provided that variants from all three pathogenic borrelial species are included in the combined set of antigens."

The authors compared the prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in groups of psychiatric patients and healthy subjects to find out whether there is an association between this infection and psychiatric morbidity. Between 1995 and 1999 the authors screened for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in 926 psychiatric patients consecutively admitted to Prague Psychiatric Center. They compared the results of this screening with findings from 884 consecutive healthy subjects who took part in an epidemiological survey of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in the general population of the Czech Republic. Sera were tested by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Circulating immune complexes were isolated by polyethylene glycol precipitation. To control for potential confounders, the two groups of patients and healthy subjects were matched according to gender and age. Results were obtained in a sample of 499 matched pairs. Among the matched pairs, 166 (33%) of the psychiatric patients and 94 (19%) of the healthy comparison subjects were seropositive in at least one of the four assays. These findings support the hypothesis that there is an association between Borrelia burgdorferi infection and psychiatric morbidity. In countries where this infection is endemic, a proportion of psychiatric inpatients may be suffering from neuropathogenic effects of Borrelia burgdorferi."

An unusual feature of these bacteria is a segmented genome consisting mostly of a number of linear DNA molecules with covalently closed hairpin ends or telomeres. In this study we show that the BBB03 locus encodes the B. burgdorferi telomere resolvase, ResT. The purified protein catalyzes telomere resolution in vitro through a unique reaction: breakage of two phosphodiester bonds in a single DNA duplex (one on each strand) and joining of each end with the opposite DNA strand to form covalently closed hairpin telomeres. Telomere resolution by ResT occurs through a two-step transesterification reaction involving the formation of a covalent protein-DNA intermediate at a position three nucleotides from the axis of symmetry in each strand of the substrate."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is capable of infecting a wide variety of vertebrates. This broad host range implies that B. burgdorferi possesses the ability to contravene the immune defenses of many potential hosts. B. burgdorferi produces multiple different Erp proteins on its outer membrane during mammalian infection. It was reported previously that one Erp protein can bind human factor H (J. Hellwage, T. Meri, T. Heikkilä, A. Alitalo, J. Panelius, P. Lahdenne, I. J. T. Seppälä, and S. Meri, J. Biol. Chem. 276:8427-8435, 2001). In this paper we report that the ability to bind the complement inhibitor factor H is a general characteristic of Erp proteins. Furthermore, each Erp protein exhibits different relative affinities for the complement inhibitors of various potential animal hosts. The data suggest that the presence of multiple Erp proteins on the surface can allow a single B. burgdorferi bacterium to resist complement-mediated killing in any of the wide range of potential hosts that it might infect. Thus, Erp proteins likely contribute to the persistence of B. burgdorferi in nature and to the ability of this bacterium to cause Lyme disease in humans and other animals."

Results of Lyme enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot studies were available for all patients evaluated. Of these, 68 (31%) fulfilled the criteria for active Lyme disease, most commonly having arthritis, facial nerve palsy, aseptic meningitis or erythema migrans; 39 (18%) had a prior history of Lyme disease and were referred with an acute intercurrent illness or lower school grades attributed to the previous Lyme disease; 77% of these were receiving therapy at the time of referral; 109 (50%) of 216 had no past or current evidence of Lyme disease, yet 79% were receiving therapy at the time of referral. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of Lyme disease is a major concern in areas endemic for Lyme disease, even after 1995 when standard criteria for diagnosis were published.

Study was based on self reporting questionnaires, physical examination, and laboratory results. Group I (n=27) consisted of citizens from New York State presenting with EM, referred to the study by their physicians. Group II (n=25) consisted of patients treated as outpatients in 1998-1999 at the Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland. The diagnosis of EM was based on patient history and clinical picture. Depending on the immune reaction of the host, the clinical picture is variable. The initial symptoms range from discrete to strongly expressed. The inflammatory reaction at the site of tick-bite seems to be milder in Europe than in North America, which is reflected in the prevalence of the annular form of rash and milder expression of general symptoms. Mild or absent general symptoms and the prevalence of the annular over homogenous form are observed in those areas of Europe where Ixodes ricinus is the main vector. In the endemic area of New York State, where Ixodes scapularis mainly occurs, uniform EM with flu-like symptoms is more common. There are distinct differences in the typical clinical pictures between the two separated endemic areas of New York State and Northeastern Poland, due to different vectors (saliva components?), bacterial genospecies, likely intermediate hosts and climatic differences. Familiarity with the presenting form of the disease can be very important, especially for primary care physicians."

OspA is the major outer surface protein expressed in cultured B. burgdorferi, and any seroassay that uses whole organisms as its antigen source cannot differentiate between subjects who received the vaccine and those who were naturally infected. We developed a new sensitive and specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing recombinant chimeric borrelia proteins devoid of OspA (rNon-OspA) that can be used to detect antibodies to diagnostically important B. burgdorferi antigens in both OspA-vaccinated and nonvaccinated individuals. We tested sera from patients with Lyme disease and with conditions associated with false-positive serologies, OspA-vaccinated individuals, and healthy high-risk workers from an area of endemicity and normal sera from individuals from areas of nonendemicity. The rNon-OspA test was compared with two commercially available whole-cell immunoassays. The rNon-OspA assay is as sensitive and specific as the whole-cell assay (P > 0.05) for detection of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies. However, the rNon-OspA assay can differentiate between populations comprised of naturally infected and OspA-vaccinated individuals (P < 0.05). Our data demonstrate that this new sensitive rNon-OspA ELISA can be used for the laboratory detection of B. burgdorferi antibodies regardless of vaccination status and could replace existing serologic assays for Lyme disease."

The detection limit of the PCR was 1 to 10 spirochetes. A melting temperature determined from the melting curve of the amplified product immediately after thermal cycling allowed the differentiation of the three different B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia afzelii) that are clinically relevant in Europe in a single PCR run. This method represents a simplified approach to study the association of different Borrelia species in ticks, the risk of Lyme borreliosis, and the putatively species-specific clinical sequelae. To determine the reliability of the real-time PCR protocol, we studied the prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection in Ixodes ricinus ticks. A total of 1,055 ticks were collected by flagging vegetation in five different sites in the region of Konstanz (south Germany) and were examined for the distribution of B. burgdorferi species by real-time PCR. The mean infection rate was 35%. Of 548 adult ticks, 40% were positive, and of 507 nymphs, 30% were positive. The predominant genospecies (with 18% mixed infections) in the examined areas was B. afzelii (53%), followed by B. garinii (18%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (11%); 0.8% of the infecting Borrelia could not be identified."

		"abstract": "To report on the clinical findings in a patient with posterior scleritis associated with infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Interventional case report. A 39-year-old male ranger who experienced posterior scleritis after several tick bites with erythema migrans. Extensive ophthalmic and systemic workup, including serologic testing and imaging techniques. Sonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a large scleral mass (16 x 12 x 13 mm) in a patient with painful proptosis in the left eye with episcleral vascular dilation, reduction in bulbar motility, and chorioretinal folds in the upper temporal quadrant. Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids resulted in rapid regression of clinical symptoms and of the scleral mass. Intensive workup revealed immunoglobulin M antibodies (enzyme-linked immunoassay, Western immunoblot) and a positive lymphocyte transformation assay against B. burgdorferi. No other cause for posterior scleritis could be identified. Posterior scleritis should be added to the list of ocular manifestations associated with Lyme disease. Because corticosteroids alone resulted in rapid improvement of clinical symptoms, the scleritis might be mediated by autoimmunologic mechanisms."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteins activate inflammatory cells through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), suggesting that TLR2 could play a pivotal role in the host response to B. burgdorferi. TLR2 does play a critical role in host defense, as infected TLR2(-/-) mice harbored up to 100-fold more spirochetes in tissues than did TLR2(+/+) littermates. Spirochetes persisted at extremely elevated levels in TLR2-deficient mice for at least 8 wk following infection. Infected TLR2(-/-) mice developed normal Borrelia-specific Ab responses, as measured by quantity of Borrelia-specific Ig isotypes, the kinetics of class switching to IgG, and the complexity of the Ags recognized. These findings indicate that the failure to control spirochete levels in tissues is not due to an impaired acquired immune response. While macrophages from TLR2(-/-) mice were not responsive to lipoproteins, they did respond to nonlipoprotein components of sonicated spirochetes. These TLR2-independent responses could play a role during the inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi, as infected TLR2(-/-) mice developed greater ankle swelling than wild-type littermates. Thus, while TLR2-dependent signaling pathways play a major role in the innate host defense to B. burgdorferi, both inflammatory responses and the development of the acquired humoral response can occur in the absence of TLR2."

		"abstract": "Ceftriaxone is highly effective clinically in patients with Lyme disease. We studied a representative invasive human isolate of Borrelia burgdorferi for which the MBC of ceftriaxone was 0.050 microg/ml. A once-per-day dosage regimen of ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/dose) administered intramuscularly for 5 days was 100% effective in sterilizing tissue samples of C3H mice infected with this strain of B. burgdorferi, regardless of whether the mice were being treated concomitantly with a corticosteroid. Administration of the same five doses of ceftriaxone at 6-h intervals over just 24 h was also 100% effective. These experiments suggest that shorter courses of antibiotics than those currently recommended should be considered for study in patients with early uncomplicated Lyme disease."
