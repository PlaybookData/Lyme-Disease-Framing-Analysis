		"abstract": "Complement inhibiting surface proteins of pathogenic bacteria provide candidates for vaccines because of two reasons. First, an immune response against them would recognize the microbes and secondly, it would neutralize the key bacterial virulence mechanism. Prerequisites for a vaccine protein include the following: (i) it should show limited variability, (ii) it should be immunogenic and the immune response against it should cover a sufficiently broad range of microbial strains, (iii) it should not be hidden beneath a capsule, long LPS O-polysaccharide side chains or a protein coat and (iv) it should not raise unwanted immune responses against host structures. Bacterial complement inhibitors often act by binding the soluble inhibitors factor H or C4 bp, by blocking C3 or C5 activation or by enzymatically cleaving key complement components. Inhibitors have been found from all major types of pathogens and may offer promise as rational vaccine candidates for preventing diseases such as meningococcal meningitis, systemic pneumococcal or group B streptococcal disease and Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Plasma cell panniculitis is a rare histopathological variant of morphea profunda. Its occurrence in two siblings has been reported once. We report a new case in which a brother and a sister with a family history of consanguinity presented plasma cell panniculitis of long duration. A man and his sister, 38 and 28 years old respectively, presented thick hyperpigmented indurations of the trunk and thighs since puberty. Previous investigations did not lead to any definitive diagnosis. Deep cutaneous specimens taken from both patients exhibited indistinct histological features of plasma cell panniculitis. Morphea profunda is a deep-localized variant of scleroderma. The presence of predominant plasma cell infiltrate suggests a rare type of morphea profunda named plasma cell panniculitis. Subcutaneous plasma cell infiltrate has been described in many diseases such as lupus profundus and lymphoplasmocytic panniculitis of Lyme disease. The family history of consanguinity, similar age of onset and identical clinicopathological presentation suggest a genetic role in this disorder. This is the second report of plasma cell panniculitis in two siblings with a history of consanguinity."

		"abstract": "Borreliosis is a multisystem infection, which in the absence of adequate diagnosis and clinical management, may develop towards various clinical forms of chronic pathology. Due to the heterogeneity of clinical manifestations it is known under more names: erythema migrans, Lyme disease, neuroborreliosis etc. Taking into account the present interest and the weight in pathology of syndromes consistent with the suspicion of a Borrelia spp. infection, since 2002 we applied in current practice the investigation of this etiology. There have been investigated 481 subjects, clinically suspected of Borrelia spp. infection that had historical risk of tick bite and cases of serous meningitis, after exclusion of usual etiology. Tests were performed on ELISA kits with standardised immunoreagents and recently, for result validation, on Western immunoblot kits (WB). Our results revealed the Borrelia etiology in 32% of cases (27.96-36.29% CI = 95%) at the screening, value expressed by the persistent positivity of the specific immunoglobulins (Ig) IgM (80.5%) and IgM+IgG (19.5%). Historic infection, represented exclusively by IgG positivity, was present in 8.6% (5.87-11.98% CI = 95%) from the cases that were negative for IgM (68%, 63.71-72.04%, CI = 95%). This weight is superposable with the results obtained in investigating a comparable sample of healthy individuals (193 subjects with 6.74% historical IgG, 3.79-10.96%, CI = 95%). Based on these results, it can be considered that ELISA procedure is useful and of reliable prognosis value for screening the Borrelia spp. etiology, the next step, taking into account the higher sensitivity of WB, being WB procedure which is useful for confirmation of ELISA positive cases and for treatment efficiency surveillance. The results prove that Borrelia spp. infections are a public health issue, which due to the diversity of clinical manifestations and diagnosis difficulties need repeated and complex laboratory investigations."

		"abstract": "Boreliosis is an arthropod transmitted, bacterial infection, known for its complicated pathogenesis and prolonged course. Boreliosis can be divided into early, localized type, early generalized type as well as late type. Cytokines control homeostasis of the organism by transmitting signals between cells. TGF (transforming growth factor) beta is one of the cytokines that modulates cell differentiation, proliferation and angiogenesis. In larger concentrations it blocks the expression of IL-1 and TNF-alfa. TGF-beta stimulates production of selectin, collagen, fibrinoectin and integrin. It inhibits metalloproteinase that causes degradation of the above mentioned proteins. We assessed a concentration of TGF-beta in the blood of patients presented with an early form of boreliosis Erythema Migrans (EM) as well as in patients with an advanced form of this disease Lyme arthritis (LA) In addition, levels of metalloproteinase (MMP-2), its tissue inhibitor (TIMP) was assessed. We attempted to analyze the effects of treatment by measuring specific markers of inflammation. We tested a group of 40 patients with Lyme disease. The first group included 20 patients with an early form--(EM), while the second group of 20 patients, had a chronic form of the disease--(LA). The control group consisted of 8 healthy blood donors. The serum levels of TGF beta, metalloproteinase (MMP-2) and its tissue inhibitor (TIMP-2) were obtained using ELISA. Levels were obtained prior to treatment and after 4 weeks of treatment with Doxycyclin or Rocephin (Ceftriaxon). The results indicated that levels of TGF-beta were lower in the Lyme patients than in the healthy control. In the patients group, the early form of disease had higher levels of TGF-beta than in the chronic. Acute, early phase group had also higher serum levels of MMP-2 and TIMP-2 in comparison to the chronic stage group. LA group showed correlation between TGF-beta concentration and levels of MMP-2. It has not been the case in the acute stage of the disease. Both groups of patients had higher levels of IL-1-aRII and selectin E in comparison with control. As suggested by the results, decreased levels of TGF-beta in patients with boreliosis can be due to increased levels of MMP-2 and TIMP. The above markers and their concentration can be useful in the monitoring of the effectiveness of provided therapy and suggest that inflammation can persist in spite of the normalization of the clinical picture. The results suggest extremely complicated pathophysiology of Lyme disease where pro and antiinflammatory cytokines are as important as the pathogen itself."

Two borrelia genospicies, B. afzelii (6.3%) and B. garinii (20%) proved the most prevalent. The genospecies could form a mixtinfection (11%). Borrelia miyamotoi, B. valaisiana, and B. burgdorferi s. s. were also found in the studied territory, with the total ratio lesser than 6%. Acarotropism of Borrelia proved 2.4 times higher with respect to I. persulcatus, than to I. ricinus. Average long-term infection rates of these tick species were 27.3 and 11.3% respectively. Spatial variability of the infection rate in ticks significantly exceeds interannual fluctuations with the variation coefficients 66 and 26% respectively."

Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify specific DNA sequences of Lyme spirochetes, Spotted fever group rickettsiae, Ehrlichia(anaplasma) from samples of mice and ticks. 14 positive samples were identified from 121 mice and 105 groups of ticks. Among mice samples, one positive 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer of Borrelia burgdorferi and two 5' fragments of Ehrlichia (anaplasma) 16S rDNA were obtained. 11 positive results were detected from tick samples including three 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer regions of Borrelia burgdorferi and eight 5' fragments of Spotted fever group rickettsiae outer member protein A gene. One group of adult ticks, Haemaphysalis longicornis, which had been collected from eastern mountain area were detected to have co-infected with Lyme spirochetes and Spotted fever group rickettsiae. The positive sequences of 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer and ompA gene were tested and analyzed as Lyme spirochetes while rickettsia which was closely related to Borrelia valaisiana and R. massiliae. This was the first report about co-infection of Lyme spirochetes and Spotted fever group rickettsiae found in the same group of adult Haemaphysalis longicornis. It is very important to strengthen the surveillance program on tick-borne infectious disease and their pathogenic in vectors, wild animals and targeted high risk groups and to differentiate the clinical manifestation and diagnosis to extend the knowledge of tick-borne infectious diseases in Zhejiang."

While the percent positive test results varied by agent in different regions of the United States, with D. immitis antigen and antibodies to E. canis more commonly identified in dogs from the South (3.9% and 1.3%, respectively), and antibody to B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum found more frequently in dogs from the upper Midwest and Northeast (4.0-6.7% and 5.5-11.6%, respectively), evidence of at least one agent was found in dogs from every state considered. Furthermore, each organism also appeared to occur in endemic foci within larger areas of relatively low prevalence. Relocation of infected or previously exposed dogs from endemic regions likely accounts for some of the unexpected geographic distribution seen, although local transmission in previously under-recognized areas of endemicity could also be occurring. Although data were only available from the 48 contiguous states (Alaska and Hawaii were not included), taken together, our results suggest that these disease agents may be present over a wider geographic area, and thus pose greater animal and public health risks, than is currently recognized. Dogs can serve as sentinels to identify the presence of vector-borne disease agents of both veterinary and public health significance."

Ophthalmoscopic analysis of the left eye showed elevated and blurred optic disk margins, retinal hemorrhages, venous congestion. The diagnosis of borreliosis was based on clinical and ocular findings and determinations of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot analysis, the detection of DNA of B.burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction and exclusion of other infectious and inflammatory causes (tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, syphilis and sarcoidosis were excluded). The commonly used blood, urine and spinal fluid tests, cerebral MRI and angiofluorography were also done. The patient received oral ceftriaxone 2gr/daily for 4 weeks, 2 cures and Doxycycline 2 gr/daily, 21 days. Under the treatment, the clinical signs had significantly improved (VA left eye = 20/20), but the central scotoma remained. The case is unusual because only one eye was affected (typically decreased visual acuity occurs on both eyes), other signs of the disease were absent, and the recovery under the antibiotic treatment was excellent."

Both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that Bb-induced inflammation is primarily host-mediated, via cytokine or chemokine production that promotes leukocyte adhesion/migration. Whether Bb produces mediators that can directly alter the vascular permeability in vivo has not been investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate if Bb produces a mediator(s) that can directly activate endothelial cells resulting in increases in permeability in intact microvessels in the absence of blood cells. The effects of cell-free, spent culture medium from virulent (B31-A3) and avirulent (B31-A) B. burgdorferi on microvessel permeability and endothelial calcium concentration, [Ca(2+)](i), were examined in individually perfused rat mesenteric venules. Microvessel permeability was determined by measuring hydraulic conductivity (Lp). Endothelial [Ca(2+)](i), a necessary signal initiating hyperpermeability, was measured in Fura-2 loaded microvessels. B31-A3 spent medium caused a rapid and transient increase in Lp and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i). Within 2-5 min, the mean peak Lp increased to 5.6+/-0.9 times the control, and endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) increased from 113+/-11 nM to a mean peak value of 324+/-35 nM. In contrast, neither endothelial [Ca(2+)](i) nor Lp was altered by B31-A spent medium. A mediator(s) produced by virulent Bb under culture conditions directly activates endothelial cells, resulting in increases in microvessel permeability. Most importantly, the production of this mediator is associated with Bb virulence and is likely produced by one or more of the 8 plasmid(s) missing from strain B31-A."

In case of reinfection, antibiotic treatment should be administered."

Symptoms of Lyme arthritis, preceded by typical skin lesion (erythema migrans) appeared in 46 years old women 5 years after successful treatment of borrelial meningitis. Re-appearance of symptoms of Lyme borreliosis following localized skin lesion, after a long asymptomatic period, as well as accompanying increase in specific antibodies, point to reinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Different localization of systemic symptoms during two episodes of Lyme disease suggests infection with distinct genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. This case confirms risk of recurrent infections with different B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies in inhabitants of highly endemic areas in the north-east of Poland, which may pose necessity of repeated antibiotic treatment."

		"abstract": "Antibiotic treatment has been proven to be effective in about 90% of patients with Lyme arthritis in controlled studies. Overt arthritis persisting in spite of antibiotic therapy is rare and most likely has an autoimmune background. More frequently, patients with history of Lyme borreliosis present with non-specific articular and musculosceletal symptoms, which seem to be permanent sequelae of arthritis or constitute part of so called post-Lyme disease syndrome, of unclear pathogenesis. As persistence of active infection after proper antibiotic therapy is unlikely, repeated treatment seems of no benefit in most of the patients. No more than 2-3 attempts of antibiotic therapy should be undertaken; if symptoms persist, symptomatic and anti-inflammatory treatment should be introduced. Lack of response to antibiotics should also point to co-existing musculoskeletal morbidity or to improper diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, which is frequent due to common occurrence of false-positive serologic tests results."

Nevertheless, such a pattern has been described in the literature in other non-infectious conditions. On the other hand, granuloma annulare (GA) has been recently closely associated with infection by Borrelia. We investigated how frequently pseudorosettes can be detected in common GA cases confirmed for Borrelia by PCR. We studied 13 biopsies of non-interstitial GA and 2 biopsies of interstitial GA from patients without clinical suspicion of borrelial infection. We also performed immunohistochemical studies in all the biopsies, using the CD-68 antibody. Molecular studies with PCR were performed with beta-globin PCR (human DNA). Borrelial DNA was confirmed by amplifying the OspA gene and intergenic rrf-rrl region. We found histiocytic pseudorosettes in 13 biopsies (86.66%). Human DNA was successfully amplified from 8 of 13 paraffin-embedded skin samples. From these we amplified borrelial DNA in 5 of 8 samples. Out of the 8 cases in which human DNA was amplified, a correlation between pseudorosettes and the molecular tests (Borrelia DNA) was confirmed in 5 instances. a) Pseudorosettes are not an unusual finding in common granuloma annulare; b) Borrelia is present in (most) cases of granuloma annulare; and c) Pseudorosettes seem to be a good morphological sign predictive of infection with Borrelia in granuloma annulare."

		"abstract": "Borrelia lusitaniae is an Old World species of the Lyme borreliosis (LB) group of tick-borne spirochetes and prevails mainly in countries around the Mediterranean Basin. Lizards of the family Lacertidae have been identified as reservoir hosts of B. lusitaniae. These reptiles are highly structured geographically, indicating limited migration. In order to examine whether host geographic structure shapes the evolution and epidemiology of B. lusitaniae, we analyzed the phylogeographic population structure of this tick-borne bacterium using a recently developed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme based on chromosomal housekeeping genes. A total of 2,099 questing nymphal and adult Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected in two climatically different regions of Portugal, being approximately 130 km apart. All ticks were screened for spirochetes by direct PCR. Attempts to isolate strains yielded 16 cultures of B. lusitaniae in total. Uncontaminated cultures as well as infected ticks were included in this study. The results using MLST show that the regional B. lusitaniae populations constitute genetically distinct populations. In contrast, no clear phylogeographic signals were detected in sequences of the commonly used molecular markers ospA and ospC. The pronounced population structure of B. lusitaniae over a short geographic distance as captured by MLST of the housekeeping genes suggests that the migration rates of B. lusitaniae are rather low, most likely because the distribution of mediterranean lizard populations is highly parapatric. The study underlines the importance of vertebrate hosts in the geographic spread of tick-borne microparasites."

He had also complained of a single headache, which occurred approximately 10 days before admission. The headache did not occur in the early morning hours or wake him up from his sleep. His appetite for the weeks before admission had progressively decreased, and he had also become more irritable, especially when stimulated. He had increased fatigue for the week before presentation. His parents denied any fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, rash, bruising, bleeding, or hematuria. The patient denied any abdominal pain or headache while in the ED."

The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a complete (third degree) heart block with a bradycardic ventricular escape rhythm. The patient reported having had an rash on his right lower leg six weeks previously. After spreading centrifugally it had turned pale in its centre, then regressed and finally disappeared. After having been supplied with a temporary pacemaker in a county hospital the patient was transferred to our hospital. The ECG showed pacemaker stimulation of the ventricle at about 60 beats/min. Without this stimulation the complete atrioventricular block persisted. Coronary heart disease was excluded by angiography and levocardiography revealed normal systolic left ventricular function. Serological findings were a positive titre of IgG-antibodies against Borrelia while the IgM titre was negative. The heart block disappeared under antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxon within eight days, after first changing to transitory second and first-degree atrioventricular block, and the pacemaker was removed. The patient did not develop any neurological symptoms. Cardiac involvement in Lyme disease can be the only manifestation of borreliosis. Possible reversibility under antibiotic therapy is an important aspect of diagnosis. In spite of atypical serology the combination of history, symptoms and serological findings will lead to the diagnosis Lyme disease."

We examine the 'Axis of Evil' components in the context of diagnostic and therapeutic challenges for Lyme disease patients and their physicians, and we present an evidence-based refutation to this misguided view. Despite its virulent nature, the 'Axis of Evil' perspective is a useful starting point to resolve the controversy over Lyme disease."

Between 2002 and 2006, the incidence increased constantly; in 2002, the incidence per 100,000 inhabitants was 17.8 and rose by 110% to 37.3 in 2006. The incidence among the states varies greatly with Brandenburg accounting for the highest incidence (77.6 per 100,000 inhabitants) and Berlin for the lowest incidence (5.7 per 100,00 inhabitants). The age distribution is bimodal with incidence peaks in childhood between the ages 5 to 9 and in adulthood in the age group 65 to 69 years. In general, females are more frequently affected than males (55% versus 45%). Erythema migrans and early neuroborreliosis affected 20,787 patients (90%) and 799 patients (3%), respectively. Around 70% of all cases occurred between June and September. Further studies are needed to answer the question to which extent the annual increase can be related to a changing epidemiological situation or to other factors such as growing awareness, better diagnostic tools and changing recreational habits."

The epidemiology of these pathogens was investigated on ticks as well as on rodents, the main hosts. Therefore adults of Dermacentor spp. (n = 862) and rodents (n = 119) were collected and examined for the existence of C. burnetii and Rickettsia spp. by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In none of the ticks and rodents C. burnetii could be detected, in contrast to Rickettsia spp. where the infection rate in ticks was about 20%. Over and above that, nymphs and adults of Ixodes ricinus were also collected and investigated by PCR for A. phagocytophilum (n = 5,424), Rickettsia helvetica (n = 1,187) and Babesia spp. (n = 3,113). Thereby infection rates of 1%, 8.9% and 1%, respectively, could be determined. The prevalence in rodents was 5.3% for A. phagocytophilum and 0.8% for Babesia microti.

The ribotype patterns obtained with HindII and EcoRV ribotype patterns showed good correlations with the recently proposed genotypes and grouped each genospecies in a well-separated cluster. The whole-cell protein profiles of genospecies were more heterogeneous than the ribotype patterns.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, a multisystem inflammatory disorder that principally targets the skin, joints, heart, and nervous system. The role of T lymphocytes in the development of chronic inflammation resulting from B. burgdorferi infection has been controversial. We previously showed that natural killer T (NKT) cells with an invariant (i) TCR alpha chain (iNKT cells) recognize glycolipids from B. burgdorferi, but did not establish an in vivo role for iNKT cells in Lyme disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate the importance of iNKT cells for host defense against these pathogenic spirochetes by using Valpha14i NKT cell-deficient (Jalpha18(-/-)) BALB/c mice. On tick inoculation with B. burgdorferi, Jalpha18(-/-) mice exhibited more severe and prolonged arthritis as well as a reduced ability to clear spirochetes from infected tissues. Valpha14i NKT cell deficiency also resulted in increased production of antibodies directed against both B. burgdorferi protein antigens and borrelial diacylglycerols; the latter finding demonstrates that anti-glycolipid antibody production does not require cognate help from Valpha14i NKT cells. Valpha14i NKT cells in infected wild-type mice expressed surface activation markers and produced IFNgamma in vivo after infection, suggesting a participatory role for this unique population in cellular immunity. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that the antigen-specific activation of Valpha14i NKT cells is important for the prevention of persistent joint inflammation and spirochete clearance, and they counter the long-standing notion that humoral rather than cellular immunity is sufficient to facilitate Lyme disease resolution."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spirochetes in bird-feeding ticks were studied in the Czech Republic. During the postbreeding period (July to September 2005), 1,080 passerine birds infested by 2,240 Ixodes ricinus subadult ticks were examined. Borrelia garinii was detected in 22.2% of the ticks, Borrelia valaisiana was detected in 12.8% of the ticks, Borrelia afzelii was detected in 1.6% of the ticks, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in 0.3% of the ticks. After analysis of infections in which the blood meal volume and the stage of the ticks were considered, we concluded that Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula), song thrushes (Turdus philomelos), and great tits (Parus major) are capable of transmitting B. garinii; that juvenile blackbirds and song thrushes are prominent reservoirs for B. garinii spirochetes; that some other passerine birds investigated play minor roles in transmitting B. garinii; and that the presence B. afzelii in ticks results from infection in a former stage. Thus, while B. garinii transmission is associated with only a few passerine bird species, these birds have the potential to distribute millions of Lyme disease spirochetes between urban areas."

The vaccinated dogs produced high titers of anti-OspA and anti-OspC borreliacidal antibodies, including borreliacidal antibodies specific for an epitope within the last seven amino acids at the OspC carboxy terminus (termed OspC7) that was conserved among pathogenic Borrelia genospecies. In addition, spirochetes were eliminated from the infected ticks that fed on the bacterin recipients, B. burgdorferi was not isolated from the skin or joints, and antibody responses associated specifically with canine infection with B. burgdorferi were not produced. In contrast, B. burgdorferi was recovered from engorged ticks that fed on 13 (87%) placebo-vaccinated dogs (P<0.0001), skin biopsy specimens from 14 (93%) dogs (P<0.0001), and joint tissue specimens from 8 (53%) dogs (P=0.0022). In addition, 14 (93%) dogs developed specific antibody responses against B. burgdorferi proteins, including 11 (73%) with C6 peptide antibodies (P<0.0001). Moreover, 10 (67%) dogs developed Lyme disease-associated joint abnormalities (P<0.0001), including 4 (27%) dogs that developed joint stiffness or lameness and 6 (40%) that developed chronic joint inflammation (synovitis). The results therefore confirmed that the bacterin provided a high level of protection against Lyme disease shortly after immunization."

		"abstract": "Gene expression analysis previously revealed a robust IFN-responsive gene induction profile that was selectively up-regulated in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected C3H mice at 1 wk postinfection. This profile was correlated with arthritis development, as it was absent from infected, mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice. In this report we now demonstrate that profile induction in infected C3H scid mice occurs independently of B or T lymphocyte infiltration in the joint tissue. Additionally, type I IFN receptor-blocking Abs, but not anti-IFN-gamma Abs, dramatically reduced arthritis, revealing a critical but previously unappreciated role for type I IFN in Lyme arthritis development. Certain examined IFN-inducible transcripts were also significantly diminished within joint tissue of mice treated with anti-IFNAR1, whereas expression of other IFN-responsive genes was more markedly altered by anti-IFN-gamma treatment. These data indicate that induction of the entire IFN profile is not necessary for arthritis development. These findings further tie early type I IFN induction to Lyme arthritis development, a connection not previously made. Bone marrow-derived macrophages readily induced IFN-responsive genes following B. burgdorferi stimulation, and this expression required a functional type I IFN receptor. Strikingly, induction of these genes was independent of TLRs 2,4, and 9 and of the adapter molecule MyD88. These data demonstrate that the extracellular pathogen B. burgdorferi uses a previously unidentified receptor and a pathway traditionally associated with viruses and intracellular bacteria to initiate transcription of type I IFN and IFN-responsive genes and to initiate arthritis development."

We inactivated the gene encoding for superoxide dismutase A (sodA, bb0153), an enzyme mediating the dismutation of superoxide anions and examined the in vitro and in vivo phenotype of the mutant. There were no significant differences in the in vitro growth characteristics of the sodA mutant compared with the control strains. Microscopic analysis of viability of spirochaetes revealed greater percentage of cell death upon treatment of sodA mutant with superoxide generators compared with its controls. Infectivity analysis in C3H/HeN mice following intradermal needle inoculation of 10(3) or 10(5) spirochaetes per mouse revealed complete attenuation of infectivity for the sodA mutant compared with control strains at 21 days post infection. The sodA mutant was more susceptible to the effects of activated macrophages and neutrophils, suggesting that its in vivo phenotype is partly due to the killing effects of activated immune cells. These studies indicate that SodA plays an important role in combating oxidative stress and is essential for the colonization and dissemination of B. burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The immunologic events that lead to persistent joint inflammation in certain patients with Lyme arthritis post-antibiotic treatment have been elusive so far. The prevalence of this condition is highest in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis-associated HLA-DR alleles. This study was undertaken to generate a murine model with persistent arthritis post-antibiotic treatment. We have previously shown that CD28(-/-) mice develop intermittent monarticular Lyme arthritis that is responsive to antibiotics. Since there seems to be a link in humans between persistent arthritic manifestations post-antibiotic treatment and the HLA-DR4 allele, we generated DR4+/+CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, infected them with Borrelia burgdorferi, and subsequently treated them with antibiotics. Thirty-eight percent of the B burgdorferi-infected DR4+/+CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, but none of the B burgdorferi-infected CD28(-/-)MHCII(-/-) mice, remained arthritic post-antibiotic treatment. A significant fraction (36%) of these mice, but none of the mice in which arthritis resolved, had serum antibodies to outer surface protein A of B burgdorferi. After abrogation of active B burgdorferi infection, the inflammatory reaction in mice with persistent joint inflammation was restricted to the joints, since their draining lymph nodes were no longer enlarged. Increased CD20 and interferon-gamma messenger RNA expression in the inflamed joints of these mice suggested a possible role of B cells and inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of persistent arthritis post-antibiotic treatment. The establishment of this murine model allows, for the first time, the elucidation of the immunologic events that lead to persistent Lyme arthritis post-antibiotic therapy in genetically susceptible individuals."

We assessed 159 patients drawn from a cohort of 240 patients evaluated at an academic Lyme disease referral center. Patients were screened for common axis I psychiatric disorders (e.g., depressive and anxiety disorders); structured clinical interviews confirmed diagnoses. Axis II personality disorders, functional status, and traits like negative and positive affect and pain catastrophizing were also evaluated. A physician blind to psychiatric assessment results performed a medical evaluation. Two groups of CLD patients (those with post-Lyme disease syndrome and those with medically unexplained symptoms attributed to Lyme disease but without Borrelia burgdorferi infection) were compared with 2 groups of patients without CLD (patients recovered from Lyme disease and those with an identifiable medical condition explaining symptoms attributed to Lyme disease). After adjusting for age and sex, axis I psychiatric disorders were more common in CLD patients than in comparison patients (P = 0.02, odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.30-5.35), but personality disorders were not. Patients with CLD had higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (P < 0.001) than comparison patients. All psychological factors except personality disorders were related to level of functioning. A predictive model based on these psychological variables was confirmed. Fibromyalgia was diagnosed in 46.8% of CLD patients. Psychiatric comorbidity and other psychological factors distinguished CLD patients from other patients commonly seen in Lyme disease referral centers, and were related to poor functional outcomes."

This protein shares c. 30% identity with its counterparts from other bacteria. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that bb0666 along with two other genes (bb0665 and bb0667) are cotranscribed with the motility and chemotaxis genes. This newly identified operon is termed as pami. Sequence and primer extension analyses showed that pami was regulated by a sigma(70)-like promoter, which is designated as P(ami). Transcriptional analysis using a gene encoding green fluorescence protein as a reporter demonstrated that P(ami) functions in both Escherichia coli and B. burgdorferi. Genetic studies showed that the Deltabb0666 mutant grows in long chains of unseparated cells, whose phenotype is similar to its counterparts in E. coli. Taken together, these results demonstrate that bb0666 is a homolog of MurNac-LAAs that contributes to the cell division of B. burgdorferi."

A causative role of Borrelia burgdorferi infection has been controversially discussed, but no conclusive solution has yet been achieved. Intrigued by 3 young patients with severe Borrelia-associated morphea and high-titer antinuclear antibodies, we retrospectively examined the relationship between Borrelia exposure, serologic autoimmune phenomena and age at disease onset in morphea patients. In 90 morphea patients the presence of Borrelia-specific serum antibodies was correlated to the age at disease onset and the presence and titers of antinuclear antibodies. Patients with active Borrelia infection or high-titer antinuclear antibodies due to systemic sclerosis or lupus erythematosus served as controls. We observed a statistically highly significant association between morphea, serologic evidence of Borrelia infection, and high-titer antinuclear antibodies when disease onset was in childhood or adolescence. Because pathogenic Borrelia species may vary in different geographic regions the relevance of Borrelia infection in morphea induction may show regional variations. B burgdorferi infection may be relevant for the induction of a distinct autoimmune type of scleroderma; it may be called \"Borrelia-associated early onset morphea\" and is characterized by the combination of disease onset at younger age, infection with B burgdorferi, and evident autoimmune phenomena as reflected by high-titer antinuclear antibodies. As exemplified by the case reports, it may take a particularly severe course and require treatment of both infection and skin inflammation."

Evidence-based guidelines committees disagree over the severity of PLDS. The 2004 International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) concluded that PLDS are severe. The 2006 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines committee concluded that PLDS are nothing more than the \"aches and pains of daily living\" and an ad hoc International Lyme group concluded that PLDS are \"symptoms common in persons who have never had Lyme disease.\" Clinical trials validate the severity of persistent Lyme disease symptoms. There are 22 standardized instruments used to measure the severity of PLDS among the four published National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). VALIDATING THE HYPOTHESIS: All four NIH sponsored RCTs validate the severity of PLDS. PLDS are as severe as symptoms seen in other serious chronic illnesses, and result in a quality of life lower than for the general population as determined by 22 standardized measures of QOL, including fatigue, pain, role function, psychopathology, and cognition. None of the four RCTs support the IDSA hypothesis that PLDS are nothing more than \"the aches and pains of daily living\" nor the ad hoc International Lyme group conclusion that PLDS are \"symptoms common in persons who have never had Lyme disease.\" If the QOL of life for these patients is as poor as for patients with other serious chronic diseases, their symptoms need to be addressed by their doctors. Studies differ as to the precise cause of PLDS, the most effective treatments, and whether a cure is possible. But the fact that there is disagreement is not a license for physicians to ignore or turn away patients complaining of PLDS, or to dismiss their symptoms as purely psychosomatic. For physicians, the goal or purpose of treating PLDS should be the same as their purpose in treating other chronic illnesses that result in a poor QOL: vigorous pursuit of a cure, and where a cure proves impossible, amelioration of patients' symptoms and suffering. Even if this hypothesis fails to be apply to more than a fraction of the total Lyme disease population, this still represents a significant number of patients, and these findings could address a neglected aspect of caring for patients with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Electron cryotomography was used to analyze the structure of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. This methodology offers a new means for studying the native architecture of bacteria by eliminating the chemical fixing, dehydration, and staining steps of conventional electron microscopy. Using electron cryotomography, we noted that membrane blebs formed at the ends of the cells. These blebs may be precursors to vesicles that are released from cells grown in vivo and in vitro. We found that the periplasmic space of B. burgdorferi was quite narrow (16.0 nm) compared to those of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, in the vicinity of the periplasmic flagella, this space was considerably wider (42.3 nm). In contrast to previous results, the periplasmic flagella did not form a bundle but rather formed a tight-fitting ribbon that wraps around the protoplasmic cell cylinder in a right-handed sense. We show how the ribbon configuration of the assembled periplasmic flagella is more advantageous than a bundle for both swimming and forming the flat-wave morphology. Previous results indicate that B. burgdorferi motility is dependent on the rotation of the periplasmic flagella in generating backward-moving waves along the length of the cell. This swimming requires that the rotation of the flagella exerts force on the cell cylinder. Accordingly, a ribbon is more beneficial than a bundle, as this configuration allows each periplasmic flagellum to have direct contact with the cell cylinder in order to exert that force, and it minimizes interference between the rotating filaments."

Almost 2 weeks after the initial serologic test results were obtained, blood was collected from the puppies for comprehensive testing. Assessment of the findings indicate the possibility that passive transfer of maternally derived antibody to the in vivo expressed C6 peptide of Borrelia burgdorferi can temporarily render pups serologically positive for antibodies on the in-hospital C6 Lyme borreliosis antibody test kit when the test is run on very young animals."

Bound plasminogen is converted to the serine protease plasmin and thereby may facilitate the bacterium's dissemination throughout the host by degrading extracellular matrix. In this work, we demonstrate plasminogen binding by three highly similar borrelial outer surface proteins, ErpP, ErpA, and ErpC, all of which are expressed during mammalian infection. Extensive characterization of ErpP demonstrated that this protein bound in a dose-dependent manner to lysine binding site I of plasminogen. Removal of three lysine residues from the carboxy terminus of ErpP significantly reduced binding of plasminogen, and the presence of a lysine analog, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, inhibited the ErpP-plasminogen interaction, thus strongly pointing to a primary role for lysine residues in plasminogen binding. Ionic interactions are not required in ErpP binding of plasminogen, as addition of excess NaCl or the polyanion heparin did not have any significant effect on binding. Plasminogen bound to ErpP could be converted to the active enzyme, plasmin. The three plasminogen-binding Erp proteins can also bind the host complement regulator factor H. Plasminogen and factor H bound simultaneously and did not compete for binding to ErpP, indicating separate binding sites for both host ligands and the ability of the borrelial surface proteins to bind both host proteins."

Tick-borne infections are uncommon causes of FUOs. Any infectious disease accompanied by prolonged fevers can present as an FUO if the diagnosis is not suspected or if specific laboratory testing is not done to confirm the diagnosis. Babesiosis is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis ticks endemic to areas in the northeastern United States. We present the case of a 73-year-old, non-human immunodeficiency virus, male from Long Island who presented with FUO for 6 weeks. As with malaria, there are usually few or no localizing signs in babesiosis. During the patient's hospitalization, babesiosis was suspected on the basis of nonspecific laboratory findings, that is, relative lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, and an elevated lactate dehydrogenase. When babesiosis was considered in the differential diagnosis, stained blood smears demonstrated the red blood cell inclusions of babesiosis. In the hospital, the patient developed noncardiac pulmonary edema, which rapidly resolved which has been described as a rare complication of babesiosis. He also had an elevated immunoglobulin-M Lyme titer indicating coinfection with Lyme disease. Although his hemolytic anemia persisted for weeks, he only had 3% parasitemia and intact splenic function. We believe this to be the first case of babesiosis presenting as an FUO in a normal host."

The study was organized prospectively, the presence of DNA was tested for plasma, CSF, joint fluid and urine before treatment, and plasma, joint fluid and urine were examined after treatment. Before therapy, 36 patients (58.1%) were DNA positive on the whole; 21 positive patients (65.6%) were found in the group of neuroborreliosis, 8 (42.1%) showed signs of skin involvement, and 7 (63.6%) were positive in arthritis. After treatment, 11 patients (36.7%) were positive in neuroborreliosis, 3 (17.6%) in skin form, and 6 (54.5%) in joint form of LB. Among 97 positive amplifications the most frequent target was found in primer corresponding with 16S rDNA (50 samples, 51.5%). Lower but very similar results were obtained with primers for OspA (18 positive amplifications; 18.6%), OspC (13 positive amplifications; 13.4%), and flagellin (13 positive amplifications; 13.4%). There were 11 patients in whom only DNA and no specific antibodies were found. Specific DNA was found in all clinical groups of LB with similar sensitivity. Examination of the borrelial DNA in urine displayed the same sensitivity as in CSF and had a two times higher sensitivity than in plasma."

		"abstract": "To determine the cell envelope proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi recognized by immune sera of patients with late Lyme disease, we developed a Borrelia microarray containing proteins encoded by 90 cell envelope genes and their homologs described in the annotated genomic sequence of B. burgdorferi, strain B31. The protein microarray was used to profile the humoral immune response using sera from 13 patients with late Lyme disease and four normal controls. Although there was considerable heterogeneity in the individual sera responses, 25 of the cell envelope proteins were recognized by seven or more samples. Sera from non-infected individuals lacked reactivity against any of the proteins on the array. Among the most antigenic envelope proteins, BLAST search revealed little sequence homology to known microbial proteins from other species. The proteins that were highly seropositive included several members of the Erp gene families, BBA24 (decorin binding protein A (DbpA)) and members of the Borrelia gene family Pfam113 that code for the Mlp lipoprotein gene family. Several novel, uncharacterized B. burgdorferi antigens identified in this study were BBA14, BBG23, BB0108, BB0442 and BBQ03. The accurate diagnosis of Lyme disease depends on correlating objective clinical abnormalities with serological evidence of exposure to B. burgdorferi. A protein array of the envelope proteins of Borrelia burgdorferi may be very useful in specifically identifying patients with Lyme disease. This approach could contribute to a more rapid discovery of antigens not expressed in vitro that may be useful for the development of vaccine and diagnostics."

This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of the innate and acquired immune responses elicited by the neutrophil-activating protein A (NapA) of B burgdorferi in patients with Lyme arthritis. Serum anti-NapA antibodies were measured in 27 patients with Lyme arthritis and 30 healthy control subjects. The cytokine profile of synovial fluid T cells specific for NapA was investigated in 5 patients with Lyme arthritis. The cytokine profile induced by NapA in neutrophils and monocytes was also investigated. Serum anti-NapA antibodies were found in 48% of the patients with Lyme arthritis but were undetectable in the healthy controls. T cells from the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis produced interleukin-17 (IL-17) in response to NapA. Moreover, NapA was able to induce the expression of IL-23 in neutrophils and monocytes, as well as the expression of IL-6, IL-1beta, and transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) in monocytes, via Toll-like receptor 2. These findings indicate that NapA of B burgdorferi is able to drive the expression of IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-23, and TGFbeta by cells of the innate immune system and to elicit a synovial fluid Th17 cell response that might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis."

The three characteristic cutaneous manifestations are erythema migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Erythema migrans occurs in acute Lyme borreliosis, lymphocytoma is a subacute lesion, and acrodermatitis is the typical manifestation of late Lyme borreliosis. Clinical appearances of erythema migrans and lymphocytoma (when located on the ear or breast) are characteristic, whereas acrodermatitis is often confused with vascular conditions. The diagnosis of erythema migrans is made clinically. Serologic analyses often yield false-negative results and are not required for the diagnosis. However, serologic proof of the diagnosis in lymphocytoma (approximately 90% positive) and acrodermatitis (100% positive) is mandatory. Histopathologic examination often adds substantial information in patients with skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and is recommended in clinically (and serologically) undecided cases of erythema migrans or lymphocytoma and is obligatory in acrodermatitis. Polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia-specific DNA (rather than culture of the spirochete) and immunohistochemical investigations (lymphocytoma) are sometimes necessary adjuncts for the diagnosis. Antibacterial treatment is necessary in all patients to eliminate the spirochete, cure current disease, and prevent late sequelae. Oral doxycycline, also effective against coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, is the mainstay of therapy of cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Other first-line antibacterials are amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil. Erythema migrans is treated for 2 weeks, lymphocytoma for 3-4 weeks, and acrodermatitis for at least 4 weeks."

The symptoms of Lyme disease have been characterized as either severe or ''related to the aches and pains of daily living.'' A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (RCT) was conducted in a primary internal medicine practice in Westchester County, New York, USA. A total of 84 adults with Lyme disease with persistent symptoms (LDPS) were studied; 52 received amoxicillin and 34 received placebo. The subjects received either placebo or amoxicillin 3 g per day orally for 3 months. The SF-36 was used as the outcome measure of the patient's perceived Quality of Life (QOL). For subjects enrolling in this RCT, the average SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) of QOL (40+/-9, range 29-44) and mental component summary (MCS) of QOL (39+/-14, range 23-46) were worse than the general USA population and worse than individuals with diabetes, heart disease, depression, osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. The improvements in the SF-36 measure of QOL for subjects randomized to amoxicillin vs. placebo was significant (46% vs 18%, P=0.007). It is important for clinicians to be aware that LDPS can be severe. A significant gain in the QOL for subjects randomized to amoxicillin in this RCT without serious adverse events is consistent with the goal of improving patient's QOL and consequently worthy of further study."

Here we test a model that explains the entomological risk of Lyme disease (LD) in terms of host community composition. The model was parameterized in a continuous forest tract at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies (formerly the Institute of Ecosystem Studies) in New York State, U.S.A. We report the results of continuing longitudinal observations (10 years) at the Cary Institute, and of a shorter-term study conducted in forest fragments in LD endemic areas of Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, USA. Model predictions were significantly correlated with the observed nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) in both studies, although the relationship was stronger in the longer-term Cary Institute study. Species richness was negatively, albeit weakly, correlated with NIP (logistic regression), and there was no relationship between the Shannon diversity index (H') and NIP. Although these results suggest that LD risk is in fact dependent on host diversity, the relationship relies explicitly on the identities and frequencies of host species such that conventional uses of the term biodiversity (i.e., richness, evenness, H') are less appropriate than are metrics that include species identity. This underscores the importance of constructing interaction webs for vertebrates and exploring the direct and indirect effects of anthropogenic stressors on host community composition."

		"abstract": "The surface lipoproteins of the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi directly interact with tissue microenvironments during mammalian infection, and thus potentially affect various aspects of infection. To investigate the influence of surface antigen synthesis on infectious behaviour, B. burgdorferi was modified to constitutively produce the well-characterized surface lipoproteins OspA and invariant VlsE. Although increasing OspA or VlsE production did not significantly affect synthesis of other surface lipoproteins or spirochaetal growth in vitro, overexpressing vlsE resulted in increased ospA but decreased ospC expression, and overexpressing ospA led to decreased ospC and vlsE expression in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Increasing the expression of either ospA or vlsE did not alter the ID(50), but affected spirochaetal dissemination and significantly reduced tissue spirochaete loads in SCID mice. In immunocompetent mice, increased vlsE expression resulted in quick clearance of infection, while constitutive ospA expression led to a substantial ID(50) increase and severely impaired dissemination. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi with constitutive ospA expression persisted in the skin tissue but was cleared from both heart and joints of chronically infected immunocompetent mice. Taken together, the study indicates that increasing production of OspA or invariant VlsE influences lipoprotein gene expression in the murine host and alters the infectious behaviour of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "To find out the relationship of ecological environment protection and the transmission of Lyme disease under economic development of western regions in China. Both scene molecular and traditional epidemiological methods were used to assess the effects of environmental protection on the transmission of Lyme disease. Among areas as protected natural forests, semi-protected nursery forests and farmland, the vector tick species and reservoir rodents from protected natural forests area had the highest quantity of population and diversity index and followed by semi-protected nursery forests. Vector competence of reservoir hosts and value of natural foci from protected natural forests area were also remarkably higher than those areas of semi-protected nursery forests and farmland. Staff working in the areas who were bitten by ticks from protected natural forests areas had higher serological positive rate (66.7%) than those from semi-protected nursery forests areas (2.5%), and both showed remarkable difference (P = 6.45, E-11 < 0.01, df = 1). The difference of genetic divergence among these subpopulations from different habitats being surveyed showed that the biggest genetic divergence index (F(st)) of 0.557 42 was between protected natural forests area and farmland area. The index between semi-protected nursery forests area and farmland area was also bigger than zero with statistical significance. The genetic divergence index of 0.108 02 between semi-protected nursery forests area and protected natural forests area was the lowest which showed that genetic divergence between the subpopulations of the two sampling areas was not obvious. The genetic distance among these subpopulations had similar change along with their habitats. Under economic development of western regions in China, when programs as natural forests protections, recovery prairie and grassland from farmland were actively performed, vectors insects and reservoir hosts of Lyme disease might also be protected to some degree but the risk and value of natural foci on Lyme disease might increase. Data suggested that people entering these areas should be told to strengthen their awareness on individual protection against the disease."

		"abstract": "The universal protease inhibitors of the alpha(2)-macroglobulin (alpha(2)M) family are evolutionarily conserved constituents of innate immunity, presumably because they guard organisms against undesired proteolytic attacks of a different origin. Here, we determined the primary structure of alpha(2)-macroglobulin from the hard tick Ixodes ricinus (IrAM) by sequencing of overlapping PCR products. Predicted disulfide and glycosylation patterns, post-translational cleavage and alternative splicing within its 'bait region' demonstrate that IrAM is closely related to the alpha(2)-macroglobulin from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata. The IrAM message is expressed in all tick developmental stages and tissues, except for the gut, and the protein was detected to be mainly present in the hemolymph. Silencing of IrAM by dsRNA interference markedly reduced the phagocytosis of a potential pathogen, Chryseobacterium indologenes, by tick hemocytes both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, phagocytosis of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi or a commensal bacteria Staphylococcus xylosus was not affected by the IrAM knock-down. Similar results were obtained upon deactivation of all thioester proteins in tick hemolymph by methylamine. We have further demonstrated that phagocytosis of C. indologenes is dependent on an active metalloprotease secreted by the bacteria. These data indicate that interaction of tick alpha(2)-macroglobulin with a protease of an invading pathogen is linked with cellular immune response."

These diseases can manifest with clinical signs including fever, anorexia, malaise, lameness, rash, and bleeding episodes; however, these signs are nonpathognomonic, and infections can occur in the absence of clinical signs. Hematologic abnormalities can include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, hyperproteinemia and hypergammaglobulinemia. In biomedical research, diseases such as canine monocytic ehrlichiosis, Lyme disease, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever may cause morbidity among exposed dogs and confound research results. Random-source dogs are susceptible to these diseases because of their increased risk of arthropod exposure. Nonpurpose bred, randomly selected conditioned dogs (n = 21) were examined; blood samples were taken for hematology, biochemistry analysis, tickborne pathogen serology, and PCR. Of these, 2 dogs (10% of the population) presented with illness characterized by fever, malaise, lameness, or hemostatic abnormalities, and 15 (71%) had antibodies to one or more tickborne pathogens. No specific hematologic or biochemical differences were apparent between seronegative dogs and seropositive dogs reactive to all 3 pathogens. E. canis and B. burgdorferi PCR of tissues and blood were negative for all dogs. PCR amplification of several Ehrlichia and Anaplasma genes yielded no positive samples. From this cohort of dogs, serologic and molecular results indicate prior exposure without active infection or clinical disease. Exposure to and potential for infection with these bacteria and other pathogens may contribute to blood and tissue alterations that could confound experiments and lead to misinterpretation of data in canine models."

For panel II, we observed sensitivities of 61.5% and 100% for subjects with early (n=26) or late-stage (n=11) disease, respectively. We observed a specificity of 99.5% for healthy donors (n=600) living either in regions of the United States where the disease is endemic or in regions where it is not endemic. Overall, specificity among 207 potentially cross-reactive sera from subjects who had other spirochetal infections, nonspirochetal infections including bacterial and viral infections, or autoimmune or neurologic disease; who were positive for rheumatoid factor or anti-mouse antibodies; or who had been previously vaccinated for Lyme disease was 93.7%. In a direct comparison of 1,038 prospectively collected samples for Lyme disease testing we observed a relative sensitivity of 70%, a relative specificity of 99.1%, and an overall agreement of 97.1% between the DiaSorin recombinant VlsE chemiluminescence immunoassay and the Immunetics peptide-based C6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay."

		"abstract": "Most individuals seeking consultation at sports medicine clinics are young, healthy athletes with injuries related to a specific activity. However, these athletes may have other systemic pathologies, such as rheumatic diseases, that may initially mimic sports-related injuries. As rheumatic diseases often affect the musculoskeletal system, they may masquerade as traumatic or mechanical conditions. A systematic review of the literature found numerous case reports of athletes who presented with apparent mechanical low back pain, sciatica pain, hip pain, meniscal tear, ankle sprain, rotator cuff syndrome and stress fractures and who, on further investigation, were found to have manifestations of rheumatic diseases. Common systemic, inflammatory causes of these musculoskeletal complaints include ankylosing spondylitis (AS), gout, chondrocalcinosis, psoriatic enthesopathy and early rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Low back pain is often mechanical among athletes, but cases have been described where spondyloarthritis, especially AS, has been diagnosed. Neck pain, another common mechanical symptom in athletes, can be an atypical presentation of AS or early RA. Hip or groin pain is frequently related to injuries in the hip joint and its surrounding structures. However, differential diagnosis should be made with AS, RA, gout, psudeogout, and less often with haemochromatosis and synovial chondochromatosis. In athletes presenting with peripheral arthropathy, it is mandatory to investigate autoimmune arthritis (AS, RA, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus), crystal-induced arthritis, Lyme disease and pigmented villonodular synovitis. Musculoskeletal soft tissue disorders (bursitis, tendinopathies, enthesitis and carpal tunnel syndrome) are a frequent cause of pain and disability in both competitive and recreational athletes, and are related to acute injuries or overuse. However, these disorders may occasionally be a manifestation of RA, spondyloarthritis, gout and pseudogout. Effective management of athletes presenting with musculoskeletal complaints requires a structured history, physical examination, and definitive diagnosis to distinguish soft tissue problems from joint problems and an inflammatory syndrome from a non-inflammatory syndrome. Clues to a systemic inflammatory aetiology may include constitutional symptoms, morning stiffness, elevated acute-phase reactants and progressive symptoms despite modification of physical activity. The mechanism of injury or lack thereof is also a clue to any underlying disease. In these circumstances, more complete workup is reasonable, including radiographs, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory testing for autoantibodies."

Our goal was to determine clinical predictors of Lyme disease as the etiology of peripheral facial palsy in children presenting to an emergency department in a Lyme disease-endemic area. We reviewed all available electronic medical charts of children <or=20 years old with peripheral facial palsy who were evaluated in the emergency department of a tertiary care pediatric center from 1995 to 2007. We used the Centers for Disease Control Lyme disease definition: presence of erythema migrans lesion or serologic evidence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. We performed binary logistic regression with bootstrapping validation to determine independent clinical predictors of Lyme disease. We identified 313 patients with peripheral facial palsy evaluated for Lyme disease. The mean age was 10.7 years, and 52% were male. Of these, 106 (34%) had Lyme disease facial palsy. After adjusting for year of study, the following were independently associated with Lyme disease facial palsy: onset of symptoms during peak Lyme disease season (June to October), absence of previous herpetic lesions, presence of fever, and history of headache. In the subset of patients without meningitis, both onset of symptoms during Lyme disease season and presence of headache remained significant independent predictors. Lyme disease is a frequent cause of facial palsy in children living in an endemic region. Serologic testing and empiric antibiotics should be strongly considered, especially when children present during peak Lyme disease season or with a headache."

In Lyme disease diagnostic problems are still discussed extensively as the laboratory workup is not standardized and a positive antibody result is not proof of active infection. It is therefore important to appreciate all clinical signs that can prompt us to the diagnostic investigation of Lyme borreliosis. We present a case of a woman with Lyme borreliosis and recurrent unilateral anterior uveitis in her right eye for 2 years, who developed cotton wool spots (CWS) in her left eye, followed by acute and recurrent anterior uveitis in this second eye. An extensive general examination, including blood coagulopathies and ultrasound of the carotid arteries, did not reveal any pathology. The CWS resolved within a few months. The recurrent anterior uveitis could be controlled by topical steroids. After treatment with 2 g of i.v. ceftriaxone for 3 weeks, she remained free of recurrences for 1 year of observation time. CWS can be the first clinical sign of ocular vascular pathology and/or uveitis. Further investigation will be necessary to confirm the relationship between CWS and ocular borreliosis. In patients with otherwise unexplained CWS, the possibility of an infection with borreliosis should be ruled out carefully."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern hemisphere. Low-passage-number infectious strains of B. burgdorferi exhibit extremely low transformation efficiencies-so low, in fact, as to hinder the genetic study of putative virulence factors. Two putative restriction-modification (R-M) systems, BBE02 contained on linear plasmid 25 (lp25) and BBQ67 contained on lp56, have been postulated to contribute to this poor transformability. Restriction barriers posed by other bacteria have been overcome by the in vitro methylation of DNA prior to transformation. To test whether a methylation-sensitive restriction system contributes to poor B. burgdorferi transformability, shuttle plasmids were treated with the CpG methylase M.SssI prior to the electroporation of a variety of strains harboring different putative R-M systems. We found that for B. burgdorferi strains that harbor lp56, in vitro methylation increased transformation by at least 1 order of magnitude. These results suggest that in vitro CpG methylation protects exogenous DNA from degradation by an lp56-contained R-M system, presumably BBQ67. The utility of in vitro methylation for the genetic manipulation of B. burgdorferi was exemplified by the ease of plasmid complementation of a B. burgdorferi B31 A3 BBK32 kanamycin-resistant (B31 A3 BBK32::Kan(r)) mutant, deficient in the expression of the fibronectin- and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding adhesin BBK32. Consistent with the observation that several surface proteins may promote GAG binding, the B. burgdorferi B31 A3 BBK32::Kan(r) mutant demonstrated no defect in the ability to bind purified GAGs or GAGs expressed on the surfaces of cultured cells."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease in humans, is vectored between mammalian hosts in nature by Ixodes ticks. The organism adapts to diverse environments encountered throughout the enzootic cycle by differentially expressing essential gene products to survive the specialized conditions, whether in ticks or warm-blooded hosts. However, little is known regarding the identity and/or function of B. burgdorferi genes expressed during colonization of tissues during mammalian infection. Experimental evidence has shown that a group of genes (formerly classified as paralogous gene family 54) contiguously localized on the 54-kilobase linear plasmid of B. burgdorferi, are among the most highly regulated by in vitro conditions resembling mammalian infection. In this study, we employed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to measure temporal gene expression of a subset of this B. burgdorferi gene family (bba64, bba65, bba66, and bba73) in tissues during chronic murine infection. The goal was to gain insight into the role of these genes in infectivity and pathogenesis by identifying when the genes are induced and whether they are expressed in specific target tissues. B. burgdorferi bba64, bba65, bba66, and bba73 expression was measured from infected mouse tissues relative to expression in in vitro culture conditions at specific times post-infection. bba64 expression was highly upregulated in bladder, heart, and spleen tissues throughout the infection period, contrasting with the sharp downregulation previously observed in ear tissues. bba65, bba66, and bba73 demonstrated upregulated differential expression in various tissues over 1 year post-infection. These results suggest an essential role for these genes in borrelial survival, persistence, and/or pathogenesis."

The possible cross-reaction between Yersinia antigens and anti-Borrelia antibodies in blood sera of patients with Lyme disease was studied. The occurrence of specific IgA, IgG and IgM antibodies was analyzed in serum samples from 30 patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis, 30 patients with Lyme disease and five samples from healthy blood donors. For anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies, cross-reaction was detected with YopH, YopB, V-ag, YopD, YopN, YopP and YopE, and for IgA with YopD. For IgM, no cross-reaction was detected. Owing to cross-reactivity with Borrelia, the diagnosis of Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis should be based on a combination of serological and clinical findings."

A survey of 222 western gray squirrels in California showed an overall prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection of 30%, although at a county level, prevalence of infection ranged from 0% to 50% by polymerase chain reaction. Laboratory trials with wild-caught western gray squirrels indicated that squirrels were competent reservoir hosts of the Lyme disease bacterium and infected up to 86% of feeding Ixodes pacificus larvae. Infections were long-lasting (up to 14 months), which demonstrated that western gray squirrels can maintain B. burgdorferi trans-seasonally. Non-native eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) and fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) were infrequently infected with B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The effect of introduced large herbivores on the abundance of Ixodes ricinus ticks and their Borrelia infections was studied in a natural woodland in The Netherlands. Oak and pine plots, either ungrazed or grazed by cattle, were selected. Ticks were collected weekly by blanket dragging. Borrelia infections were determined by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Rodent densities were estimated using mark-release-recapture methods. On occasion, the cattle were inspected for tick infestations. Meteorological data were recorded for each habitat. Significantly more ticks were collected in the ungrazed woodland than in the grazed woodland. The ungrazed oak habitat had higher tick densities than the pine habitat, while in the grazed habitats, tick densities were similar. Borrelia infection rates ranged from zero in larvae to 26% in nymphs to 33% in adult ticks, and B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. valaisiana were the species involved. Coinfections were found in five ticks. There was no effect of the presence of cattle on Borrelia infections in the ticks. In the ungrazed area, Borrelia infections in nymphs were significantly higher in the oak habitat than in the pine habitat. More mice were captured in the ungrazed area, and these had a significantly higher tick burden than mice from the grazed area. Tick burden on cattle was low. The results suggest that grazing has a negative effect on small rodents as well as on ticks but not on Borrelia infections. Implications of these results for management of woodland reserves and risk of Lyme disease are discussed."

Decorin-binding proteins (Dbps) A and B, encoded by a 2-gene operon, are outer surface lipoproteins with similar molecular weights and share approximately 40% identity, and both bind decorin and glycosaminoglycans. To investigate how DbpA and DbpB contribute differently to the overall virulence of B. burgdorferi, a dbpAB mutant was modified to overproduce the adhesins. Overproduction of either DbpA or DbpB resulted in restoration of the infectivity of the mutant to the control level, measured by 50% infectious dose (ID(50)), indicating that the two virulence factors are interchangeable in this regard. Overproduction of DbpA also allowed the mutant to disseminate to some but not all distal tissues slightly slower than the control, but the mutant with DbpB overproduction showed severely impaired dissemination to all tissues that were analyzed. The mutant with DbpA overproduction colonized all tissues, albeit generating bacterial loads significantly lower than the control in heart and joint, while the mutant overproducing DbpB remained severely defective in heart colonization and registered bacterial loads substantially lower than the control in joint. Taken together, the study indicated that DbpA and DbpB play a similar role in contribution to infectivity as measured by ID(50) value but contribute differently to dissemination and tissue colonization."

		"abstract": "Hematogenous dissemination is important for infection by many bacterial pathogens, but is poorly understood because of the inability to directly observe this process in living hosts at the single cell level. All disseminating pathogens must tether to the host endothelium despite significant shear forces caused by blood flow. However, the molecules that mediate tethering interactions have not been identified for any bacterial pathogen except E. coli, which tethers to host cells via a specialized pillus structure that is not found in many pathogens. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying tethering have never been examined in living hosts. We recently engineered a fluorescent strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, and visualized its dissemination from the microvasculature of living mice using intravital microscopy. We found that dissemination was a multistage process that included tethering, dragging, stationary adhesion and extravasation. In the study described here, we used quantitative real-time intravital microscopy to investigate the mechanistic features of the vascular interaction stage of B. burgdorferi dissemination. We found that tethering and dragging interactions were mechanistically distinct from stationary adhesion, and constituted the rate-limiting initiation step of microvascular interactions. Surprisingly, initiation was mediated by host Fn and GAGs, and the Fn- and GAG-interacting B. burgdorferi protein BBK32. Initiation was also strongly inhibited by the low molecular weight clinical heparin dalteparin. These findings indicate that the initiation of spirochete microvascular interactions is dependent on host ligands known to interact in vitro with numerous other bacterial pathogens. This conclusion raises the intriguing possibility that fibronectin and GAG interactions might be a general feature of hematogenous dissemination by other pathogens."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis ticks transmit the Lyme disease agent in the United States. Although strong antitick immunity mediates tick rejection by certain vertebrates, only a few Ags have been molecularly characterized. We show that guinea pig vaccination against a secreted tick salivary immunomodulator, sialostatin L2, can lead to decreased feeding ability of I. scapularis nymphs. Increased rejection rate, prolonged feeding time, and apparent signs of inflammation were observed for nymphs attached to vaccinated animals, indicating a protective host immune response. Interestingly, sialostatin L2 humoral recognition does not take place upon repeated tick exposure in control animals, but only in the vaccinated animals that neutralize sialostatin L2 action. Therefore, we demonstrate an essential sialostatin L2 role upon nymphal infestation that can be blocked by vertebrate immunity and propose the discovery of similarly \"silent\" Ags toward the development of a multicomponent vaccine that will protect against tick bites and the pathogens they transmit."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, often manifests by causing neurocognitive deficits. As a possible mechanism for Lyme neuroborreliosis, we hypothesized that B. burgdorferi induces the production of inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system with concomitant neuronal and/or glial apoptosis. To test our hypothesis, we constructed an ex vivo model that consisted of freshly collected slices from brain cortex of a rhesus macaque and allowed live B. burgdorferi to penetrate the tissue. Numerous transcripts of genes that regulate inflammation as well as oligodendrocyte and neuronal apoptosis were significantly altered as assessed by DNA microarray analysis. Transcription level increases of 7.43-fold (P = 0.005) for the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha and 2.31-fold (P = 0.016) for the chemokine interleukin (IL)-8 were also detected by real-time-polymerase chain reaction array analysis. The immune mediators IL-6, IL-8, IL-1beta, COX-2, and CXCL13 were visualized in glial cells in situ by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. Concomitantly, significant proportions of both oligodendrocytes and neurons undergoing apoptosis were present in spirochete-stimulated tissues. IL-6 production by astrocytes in addition to oligodendrocyte apoptosis were also detected, albeit at lower levels, in rhesus macaques that had received in vivo intraparenchymal stereotaxic inoculations of live B. burgdorferi. These results provide proof of concept for our hypothesis that B. burgdorferi produces inflammatory mediators in the central nervous system, accompanied by glial and neuronal apoptosis."

This antibody assay was applied to a panel of antigens for the detection of different neuroautoimmune diseases that included multiple sclerosis, motor peripheral neuropathies, multifocal motor neuropathy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection. We studied women with pregnancies complicated by neural tube defect, neuroborreliosis, autism and patients with possible somatic hypermutation. Antibodies were also measured against antigens and etiologic agents associated with primary biliary cirrhosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And, finally, antibodies were measured against several tumor antigens or peptides which are expressed in prostatic, breast and colon tissues. This panel of different autoantibodies was applied to 290 patients with neuroautoimmune disorders, cancer, and possible somatic hypermutation. The levels of these antibodies against different tissue-specific antigens and etiologic agents associated with them were significantly elevated in patients versus controls. We hope that this novel 96 antigen-specific ELISA will be used in additional studies that will prove its clinical efficacy, not only for the early diagnosis of many neuroautoimmune, liver and lung autoimmune disorders, but also for prognosis and the implementation of preventive steps for many complex diseases."

In the United States, the etiologic agent is Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, a spirochete transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus ticks. The majority of patients with Lyme disease develop a characteristic rash, erythema migrans (EM), accompanied by symptoms of fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgia, or arthralgia. Other manifestations of infection can include arthritis, carditis, and neurologic deficits. Lyme disease can be treated successfully with standard antibiotic regimens. 1992--2006. U.S. health departments report cases of Lyme disease voluntarily to CDC as part of the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System. Variables collected include patient age, sex, race, county and state of residence, date of illness onset, and reported signs and symptoms. During 1992--2006, a total of 248,074 cases of Lyme disease were reported to CDC by health departments in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories; the annual count increased 101%, from 9,908 cases in 1992 to 19,931 cases in 2006. During this 15-year period, 93% of cases were reported from 10 states (Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). Incidence was highest among children aged 5--14 years, and 53% of all reported cases occurred among males. More than 65% of patients with EM had illness onset in June and July, compared with 37% of patients with arthritis. Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vectorborne illness in the United States. The geographic distribution of cases is highly focused, with the majority of reported cases occurring in the northeastern and north-central states. During 1992--2006, the number of reported cases more than doubled. A disproportionate increasing trend was observed in children and in young males compared with other demographic groups. The results presented in this report underscore the continued emergence of Lyme disease and the need for tick avoidance and early treatment interventions. Public health practitioners can use the data presented in this report to target prevention campaigns to populations with increasing incidence (i.e., children and young males)."

		"abstract": "Virus capsids find increasing use as nanoparticulate platforms for the surface display of heterologous ligands, including as multivalent vaccine carriers. Presentation on the icosahedral hepatitis B virus capsid (HBcAg) is known to strongly enhance immunogenicity of foreign sequences, most efficiently if they are inserted into the dominant c/e1 B cell epitope, a surface-exposed loop in the center of the constituent core protein primary sequence. Even some complete proteins were successfully inserted but others, e.g. the outer surface protein A (OspA) of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, impaired formation of capsid-like particles (CLPs). This difference can be rationalized by the requirement for the termini of the insert to fit into the predetermined geometry of the two acceptor sites in the carrier. We reasoned that cleavage of one of the two bonds connecting insert and carrier should relieve these constraints, provided the cleaved protein fragments remain competent to support the particle structure. Indeed, HBcAg CLPs containing a recognition site for tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease in the c/e1 loop remained intact after cleavage, as did CLPs carrying a 65-residue peptide insertion. Most importantly, in situ cleavage of a core-OspA fusion protein by coexpressed TEV protease strongly enhanced CLP formation compared with the uncleaved protein. These data attest to the high structural stability of the HBcAg CLP and they significantly widen its applicability as a carrier for heterologous proteins. This approach should be adaptable to any protein-based particle with surface-exposed yet sequence-internal loops."

After 6 months the patients were interviewed by phone using a standardised questionnaire. From 2004-2006, 216 ticks were collected from 167 persons. Most ticks were removed within 24 hours. In 44 ticks (20.4%) B. burgdorferi DNA was detected. Follow up information was available on 146 persons, 41 (28.1%) of whom had been bitten by a Borrelia-positive tick. None of the persons developed a typical erythema migrans. From the 13 persons (9%) reporting a non-specific redness of the skin (diameter less than 5 cm) at the site of the tick bite, 5 had been bitten by a positive tick and 8 by a negative tick. One patient bitten by a positive tick reported systemic symptoms related to Lyme borreliosis, namely fatigue, perspiration and joint ache, without local redness. The probability of developing Lyme borreliosis was low even though a relatively large percentage of the ticks collected were positive for B. burgdorferi. This is probably connected to the fact that in the majority of cases the tick had been removed within 24 hours."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, employs sophisticated means to evade killing by its mammalian hosts. One important immune escape mechanism is the inhibition of complement activation mediated by interactions of the host-derived immune regulators factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (CFHL1) with borrelial complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (BbCRASPs). BbCRASP-2 is a distinctive CFH- and CFHL1-binding protein that is produced by serum-resistant B. burgdorferi strains. Here we show that binding of CFH by BbCRASP-2 is due to electrostatic as well as hydrophobic forces. In addition, 14 individual amino acid residues of BbCRASP-2 were identified as being involved in CFH and CFHL1 binding. Alanine substitutions of most of those residues significantly inhibited binding of CFH and/or CFHL1 by recombinant BbCRASP-2 proteins. To conclusively define the effects of BbCRASP-2 residue substitutions on serum sensitivity in the bacterial context, a serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii strain was transformed with plasmids that directed production of either wild-type or mutated BbCRASP-2 proteins. Critical amino acid residues within BbCRASP-2 were identified, with bacteria producing distinct mutant proteins being unable to bind either CFH or CFHL1, showing high levels of complement components C3, C6, and C5b-9 deposited on their surfaces and being highly sensitive to killing by normal serum. Collectively, we mapped a structurally sensitive CFH/CFHL1 binding site within borrelial BbCRASP-2 and identified single amino acid residues potentially involved in the interaction with both complement regulators."

		"abstract": "Production of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by C57BL/6 mice following infection with Borrelia burgdorferi has been proposed as a mechanism whereby resistance to the development of experimental Lyme arthritis is maintained. In the current study, we sought to determine the role of IL-10 during infection of arthritis- and carditis-susceptible C3H mice. Infection of C3H IL-10(-/-) mice led to increased joint swelling and arthritis severity scores over those of wild-type C3H mice. Measurement of B. burgdorferi numbers in joints or disseminated tissues indicated a more efficient clearance of spirochetes in the absence of IL-10, similar to that reported in C57BL/6 IL-10(-/-) mice. However, in contrast to previous in vitro work, infection of C3H IL-10(-/-) mice led to decreased in vivo expression of the cytokines KC, IL-1beta, IL-4, and IL-12p70 in the infected joints. Finally, adenoviral expression of IL-10 in the infected joints of C3H mice was unable to modulate the development of severe Lyme arthritis and had no effect on spirochete clearance or Borrelia-specific antibody production. Development of Lyme carditis appeared to be independent of modulation by IL-10. These results suggest that IL-10 limits the development of joint inflammation in both arthritis-resistant and -susceptible mouse strains infected with B. burgdorferi and that increased IL-10 production cannot rescue genetic susceptibility to development of pathology in this model."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) the agent of Lyme borreliosis circulates in endemic areas between Ixodes ricinus ticks and a large number of vertebrate hosts upon which ticks feed. Currently, at least 12 different Borrelia species belonging to the complex B. burgdorferi sl have been identified among which seven have been detected in I. ricinus: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. spielmanii and B. bissettii. A few dozens of vertebrate hosts have been identified as reservoirs for these Borrelia species. Specific associations were rather early observed between hosts, ticks and borrelia species, like for example between rodents and B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi ss, and between birds and B. garinii and B. valaisiana. The complement present in the blood of the hosts is the active component in the Borrelia host specificity. Recent studies confirmed trends toward specific association between Borrelia species and particular host, but also suggested that loose associations may be more frequent in transmission cycles in nature than previously thought."

		"abstract": "Several Borrelia burgdorferi genes induced under mammalian host conditions have been purported to be important in Lyme disease pathogenesis based on their binding to host structures. These genes include the dbpBA locus, whose products bind host decorin and glycosoaminoglycans. Recently, the dbpBA genes were reported to be involved in borrelial infectivity. Here we extended the previous observations by using culture and quantitative PCR to evaluate low- and high-dose murine infection by a Delta dbpBA::Gent(r) derivative of B. burgdorferi strain B31. The results indicate that the Delta dbpBA::Gent(r) mutant is attenuated in the ability to initially colonize and then persist in multiple tissues. The mutant exhibited a colonization defect as early as 3 days postinfection, before the development of an adaptive immune response, and after low-dose infection of SCID mice, which are deficient in adaptive immunity. These findings suggest that the inability to adhere to host decorin may promote clearance of B. burgdorferi, presumably via innate immune mechanisms. In a high-dose infection, the mutant disseminated to several tissues, particularly joint tissue, but it was generally cleared from these tissues by 3 weeks postinfection. Finally, following high-dose infection of SCID mice, the dbpBA mutant exhibited only a mild colonization defect, suggesting that the adaptive response is involved in the clearance of the mutant in immunocompetent mice. Taken together, these results suggest that the DbpBA proteins facilitate the colonization of multiple tissues by B. burgdorferi and are required for optimal resistance to both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms following needle inoculation."

These results should alert clinicians to the fact that B. lusitaniae may be pathogenic in humans, highlighting that patients may be seronegative or present with minimal positive antibody titres and clinical signs that are not specific for Lyme borreliosis. In order to prevent the occurrence of more serious disease manifestations via timely treatment, the analysis by molecular methods may be a useful approach when antibody titres are uninformative."

Both proteins are highly expressed during transmission from infected mammals to feeding ticks and during colonization of tick midguts, but are repressed when bacteria are transmitted from ticks to mammals. Humans and other infected mammals generally do not produce antibodies against either protein, although some Lyme disease patients do seroconvert and produce antibodies against OspA for unknown reasons. We hypothesized that, if such patients had been fed upon by additional ticks, bacteria moving from the patients' bodies to the feeding ticks would have produced OspA and OspB proteins, which then led to immune system recognition and antibody production. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing immune responses of infected mice following feedings by additional Ixodes scapularis ticks. However, results of the present studies demonstrate that expression of OspA and OspB by B. burgdorferi during transmission from infected mammals to feeding ticks does not trigger seroconversion."

We surveyed 103 Brazilians on MV about their health beliefs and perceptions of LD risk and assessed their level of precautionary behaviors and the cultural factors influencing them. The population had only a moderate perception of risk and little understanding of LD. Forty-one percent did not think LD posed a risk, while 79% were not sure they could recognize symptoms. Accordingly, the population as a whole reported taking few precautions."

Coinfection of humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and ticks with both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum appears to be common, yet the pathologic mechanisms and ecology remain poorly understood compared with single-agent infection. We compiled available literature describing experimental and naturally occurring coinfection with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. ricinus-complex ticks and host species, including wildlife, humans, livestock, and pets; calculated odds ratios for coinfection risks; evaluated the hypotheses that odds ratios for coinfection differ significantly between different tick life stages, ticks and vertebrate hosts, and reservoir and nonreservoir hosts; and finally, calculated the predicted coinfection prevalence based on the probability of each pathogen alone and compared this to the reported coinfection prevalence. Sixty-one manuscripts referenced coinfection or coexposure between these pathogens, with prevalence estimates for coinfection up to 67% in vertebrates and 28% in ticks. Of 61 different reports of coinfection or coexposure, 18 had odds ratios for coinfection significantly higher than 1. The combined odds ratios for coinfection in vertebrates and ticks were 1.9 and 1.28, respectively, with statistically significant variability among host and tick species in odds ratios. The overall predicted coexposure prevalence for vertebrates was 3.1% compared with an observed 8.9% prevalence. Odds ratios were not significantly different among classes of vertebrate hosts, species of ticks, stages of ticks, or ticks compared with hosts. We confirm a considerable level of coinfection and coexposure with these pathogens, although not predictably across host or tick species or geographical region."

Understanding the spatial dynamics of LD requires an understanding of the spatial determinants of each of these organisms. We review the literature on spatial patterns and environmental correlates of human cases of LD and the vector ticks, Ixodes scapularis in the northeastern and midwestern United States and Ixodes pacificus in the western United States. The results of this review highlight a need for a more standardized and comprehensive approach to studying the spatial dynamics of the LD system. Specifically, we found that the only environmental variable consistently associated with increased LD risk and incidence was the presence of forests. However, the reasons why some forests are associated with higher risk and incidence than others are still poorly understood. We suspect that the discordance among studies is due, in part, to the rapid developments in both conceptual and technological aspects of spatial ecology hastening the obsolescence of earlier approaches. Significant progress in identifying the determinants of spatial variation in LD risk and incidence requires that: (1) existing knowledge of the biology of the individual components of each LD system is utilized in the development of spatial models; (2) spatial data are collected over longer periods of time; (3) data collection and analysis among regions are more standardized; and (4) the effect of the same environmental variables is tested at multiple spatial scales."

This linear plasmid exhibits a large polyT track within the promoter region of an intact variable large protein gene and a telomere resolvase that is unique to Borrelia. The genome content is characterized by several repeat families, including antigenic lipoproteins. B. recurrentis exhibited a 20.4% genome size reduction and appeared to be a strain of B. duttonii, with a decaying genome, possibly due to the accumulation of genomic errors induced by the loss of recA and mutS. Accompanying this were increases in the number of impaired genes and a reduction in coding capacity, including surface-exposed lipoproteins and putative virulence factors. Analysis of the reconstructed ancestral sequence compared to B. duttonii and B. recurrentis was consistent with the accelerated evolution observed in B. recurrentis. Vector specialization of louse-borne pathogens responsible for major epidemics was associated with rapid genome reduction. The correlation between gene loss and increased virulence of B. recurrentis parallels that of Rickettsia prowazekii, with both species being genomic subsets of less-virulent strains."

The present study evaluated the genotypes of >400 clinical isolates of B. burgdorferi recovered from patients from suburban New York City with early Lyme disease associated with erythema migrans; it is the largest number of borrelial strains from North America ever to be investigated. Genotyping was performed by restriction fragment-length polymorphism polymerase chain reaction analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA spacer and reverse line blot analysis of the outer surface protein C gene (ospC). For some isolates, DNA sequence analysis was also performed. The findings showed that the 16S-23S ribosomal spacer and ospC are in strong linkage disequilibrium. Most B. burgdorferi genotypes characterized by either typing method were capable of infecting and disseminating in patients. However, a distinct subset of just 4 of the 16 ospC genotypes identified were responsible for >80% of cases of early disseminated Lyme disease. This study identified the B. burgdorferi genotypes that pose the greatest risk of causing hematogenous dissemination in humans. This information should be considered in the future development of diagnostic assays and vaccine preparations."

To elucidate the role of OspA in the vector, we created an insertional deletion of ospA in strain B31-A3. The ospA mutant infects mice when it is injected intradermally and is acquired by larval ticks fed on these mice, where it persists through the molt to the nymph stage. Bacterial survival rates in artificially infected tick larvae fed on naïve mice were compared with those in the vector fed on immune mice. The ospA mutant proliferates in larvae if it is exposed to blood from naïve mice, but it declines in density after larval feeding if the blood is from immune mice. When uninfected larvae are fed on B-cell-deficient mice infected with the ospA mutant, larvae show borrelial densities and persistence that are significantly greater than those fed on infected, immunocompetent mice. We conclude that OspA serves a critical antibody-shielding role during vector blood meal uptake from immune hosts and is not required for persistence in the tick vector."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, alters its gene expression in response to highly disparate environmental signals encountered in its tick vector versus vertebrate hosts. Whole-genome transcriptional profile analysis of B. burgdorferi, propagated in vitro under mammalian-host-specific conditions, revealed significant upregulation of several linear plasmid 54 (lp54)-encoded open reading frames (ORFs). Among these ORFs, BBA64, BBA65, and BBA66 have been shown to be upregulated in response to multiple mammalian-host-specific signals. Recently, we determined that there was no significant difference in the ability of BBA64(-) mutant to infect C3H/HeN mice compared to its isogenic control strains, suggesting that B. burgdorferi might utilize multiple, functionally related determinants to establish infection. We further generated BBA65(-) and BBA66(-) single mutants in a noninfectious, lp25(-) clonal isolate of B. burgdorferi strain B31 (ML23) and complemented them with the minimal region of lp25 (BBE22) required for restoring the infectivity. In addition, we generated a BBA64(-) BBA65(-) BBA66(-) triple mutant using an infectious, clonal isolate of B. burgdorferi strain B31 (5A11) that has all of the infection-associated plasmids. There were no significant differences in the ability to isolate viable spirochetes from different tissues of C3H/HeN mice infected via intradermal needle inoculation with either the individual single mutants or the triple mutant compared to their respective isogenic parental strains at days 21 and 62 postinfection. These observations suggest that B. burgdorferi can establish infection in the absence of expression of BBA64, BBA65, and BBA66 in the murine model of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The RpoN-RpoS alternative sigma factor pathway is essential for key adaptive responses by Borrelia burgdorferi, particularly those involved in the infection of a mammalian host. A putative response regulator, Rrp2, is ostensibly required for activation of the RpoN-dependent transcription of rpoS. However, questions remain regarding the extent to which the three major constituents of this pathway (Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS) act interdependently. To assess the functional interplay between Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, we employed microarray analyses to compare gene expression levels in rrp2, rpoN and rpoS mutants of parental strain 297. We identified 98 genes that were similarly regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, and an additional 47 genes were determined to be likely regulated by this pathway. The substantial overlap between genes regulated by RpoS and RpoN provides compelling evidence that these two alternative sigma factors form a congruous pathway and that RpoN regulates B. burgdorferi gene expression through RpoS. Although several known B. burgdorferi virulence determinants were regulated by the RpoN-RpoS pathway, a defined function has yet to be ascribed to most of the genes substantially regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever is a worldwide, endemic disease caused by several spirochetal species belonging to the genus Borrelia. During the recurring fever peaks, borreliae proliferate remarkably quickly compared to the slow dissemination of Lyme disease Borrelia and therefore require efficient nutrient uptake from the blood of their hosts. This study describes the identification and characterization of the first relapsing fever porin, which is present in the outer membranes of B. duttonii, B. hermsii, B. recurrentis, and B. turicatae. The pore-forming protein was purified by hydroxyapatite chromatography and designated Oms38, for outer membrane-spanning protein of 38 kDa. Biophysical characterization of Oms38 was done by using the black lipid bilayer method, demonstrating that Oms38 forms small, water-filled channels of 80 pS in 1 M KCl that did not exhibit voltage-dependent closure. The Oms38 channel is slightly selective for anions and shows a ratio of permeability for cations over anions of 0.41 in KCl. Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences demonstrated that Oms38 contains an N-terminal signal sequence which is processed under in vivo conditions. Oms38 is highly conserved within the four studied relapsing fever species, sharing an overall amino acid identity of 58% and with a strong indication for the presence of amphipathic beta-sheets."

The aims of the study were to assess the association of mental and physical complaints with seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG in a general population sample. Seropositivity indicated an infection with Borrelia in the past. The Study of Health in Pomerania was conducted in a community living in a region with endemic Lyme disease. Mental and physical complaints were assessed on 38 items with the von Zerssen's complaint scale. IgG antibodies to Borrelia were determined by ELISA in 4264 individuals. Seropositivity was analyzed applying two cut-off scores (>5 and >10 IU/ml). IgG antibodies to Borrelia were found positive in 388 subjects (9.1%) applying the >5 IU/ml cut-off and in 130 subjects (3.0%) applying the >10 IU/ml cut-off. In multivariate analyses (MANCOVA), both definitions of seropositivity were not associated with increased mental or physical complaints while adjusting for gender, age, employment status, rural residency, physical activity, diabetes mellitus and number of chronic diseases. In the general population, seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies was not associated with an increase of self-rated mental or physical complaints or impairments. Therefore, clinicians should not overvalue seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG as a medical cause for unexplained mental or physical complaints."

Twenty-five adolescents with late stage posttreatment Lyme disease (symptoms > 6 months) and 25 participants without Lyme disease (matched on gender, IQ, age, socioeconomic status) were assessed for neuropsychological functioning, depression, school functioning, and predisease academic achievement. The Lyme group had significant deficits in cognition (short-term visual memory, short-term and delayed verbal memory, all forms of recognition memory), as well as worse attendance, grades, and subjective reports of memory problems, without differing in predisease achievement or depression. Deficits in visual memory exceeded deficits in verbal memory-a striking difference from what is reported in adults. These results reveal that adolescents with a history of treated Lyme disease are at risk for long-term problems in cognition and school functioning."

The circulation of Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks and wild animals has been observed in natural foci in this area for several years. Samples of human sera from patients with Lyme borreliosis and persons with a history of recent tick bite and clinical symptoms indicating Lyme borreliosis were collected in central Slovakia. A total of 76 human sera were analyzed using an indirect HGE IgG immunofluorescent assay kit. IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were found in 19 (25%) sera (15 female, 4 male patients). A. phagocytophilum infection was serologically confirmed in one (3.8%) child, 12 (38.7%) persons aged 22-56 and six (31.6%) persons older than 56. A statistically significant difference in seroprevalence (P < 0.01) was observed between children (3.8%, 1/26) and adults (36%, 18/50). Antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were detected in seven patients with clinically diagnosed Lyme borreliosis and in another seven individuals with assessed antiborrelia antibodies. IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum were detected in five persons seronegative for borrelia. The most frequent clinical symptoms in patients with positive A. phagocytophilum serology were cephalalgia, arthralgia, myalgia, fever, exanthema, neurological symptoms and lymphadenopathy. Positive sera were obtained from patients living in villages and towns in the orographic entities Vtácnik (5/19), Stiavnické vrchy (1/19), Kremnické vrchy (10/19) and Ziarska kotlina (3/19). Our results demonstrate the risk of acquiring A. phagocytophilum infection in natural foci in central Slovakia. Human anaplasmosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in cases of acute febrile illness with tick-bite history."

It is the most important vector-borne disease of humans in Europe, for which excellent long-term data allow robust quantitative analyses. Despite the increasing tendency to attribute all increases in vector-borne diseases to climate change, there is no convincing evidence that the appearance of new foci in Sweden, Switzerland, France and Germany during this century, or the upsurge in cases within well recognized endemic regions, is due to the recorded minor extensions of infectious ticks into higher altitudes and latitudes and into winter periods, in response to warmer conditions. Rather, there is now good evidence of greater human exposure to infected ticks through altered socioeconomic circumstances (in addition to higher densities of tick-feeding deer--not reviewed here), so far best quantified for Central and Eastern Europe. Increased awareness of tick-borne encephalitis and understanding of the changing risk factors, including the role of human behaviour, will ensure better personal protection against infection, including vaccination and avoidance of high-risk activities."

Other than spirochete lipids, existence of protein antigens, which are abundant in joints and participate in B. burgdorferi-induced host inflammatory response, is unknown. Here, we report that major products of the B. burgdorferi basic membrane protein (bmp) A/B operon that are induced in murine and human joints, possess inflammatory properties. Compared to the wild type B. burgdorferi, an isogenic bmpA/B mutant induced significantly lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in cultured human synovial cells, which could be restored using bmpA/B-complemented mutants, and more directly, upon addition of recombinant BmpA, but not BmpB or control spirochete proteins. Non-lipidated and lipidated versions of BmpA induced similar levels of cytokines, and remained unaffected by treatment with lipopolysaccharide inhibitor, polymyxin B. The bmpA/B mutant was also impaired in the induction of NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase signaling pathways in synovial cells, which were activated by non-lipidated BmpA. These results show that a protein moiety of BmpA can induce cytokine responses in synovial cells via activation of the NF-kappaB and p38 MAP kinase pathways and thus, could potentially contribute to the genesis of Lyme arthritis."

This is a particular concern for the C6 test, which is based on reactivity to a single peptide. C6 testing and 2-tier testing were performed on acute-phase serum samples obtained from >158 patients with erythema migrans for whom the genotype of the borrelial isolate was defined on the basis of an analysis of the 16S-23S ribosomal DNA spacer region and/or on the genetic variation of the outer surface protein C gene (ospC). The sonicated whole cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the immunoblots used in the 2-tier testing, and the C6 assay all used antigens from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31. The sensitivity of C6 testing (69.5%) was greater than that of 2-tier testing (38.9%) (P<.001); the difference in sensitivity, however, was statistically significant only for patients infected with 2 of the 3 ribosomal spacer type-defined genotypes. The lower sensitivity of 2-tier testing was attributable to the low sensitivity of the immunoblot tests, rather than the first-tier enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. There was also a trend for the sensitivity of 2-tier testing to vary according to the ospC genotype for the 14 genotypes represented in the study (P=.07); this relationship was not observed with C6 testing. Lack of sensitivity of the C6 test because of strain diversity seems less likely to be a limitation of this serologic test, compared with 2-tier testing in North American patients with early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Blood meals by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) on vertebrate hosts serve to transmit the agents of several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, between host and tick. If ticks are aggregated on hosts, a small proportion of hosts may be responsible for most transmission events. Therefore, a key element in understanding and controlling the transmission of these pathogens is identifying the group(s) or individuals feeding a disproportionate number of ticks. Previous studies of tick burdens, however, have focused on differences in mean annual burdens between one or a few groups of hosts, ignoring both the strong seasonal dynamics of I. scapularis and their aggregation on hosts. We present a statistical modeling framework that predicts burdens on individual hosts throughout the year as a function of temporal-, site-, and individual-specific attributes, as well as the degree of aggregation in a negative binomial distribution. We then fit alternate versions of this model to an 11-year data set of I. scapularis burdens on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) and eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) to explore which factors are important to predicting tick burdens. We found that tick burdens are a complex function of many extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including seasonality. Specifically: (1) burdens on mice and chipmunks increased with densities of host-seeking ticks in a manner that suggests hosts become saturated. (2) Chipmunks draw larval ticks away from mice, which are efficient reservoirs of the Lyme disease bacterium, and mice draw nymphs away from chipmunks, which are key nymphal hosts. (3) While individual correlates were statistically important, the relationships were complex, and no group or correlate (sex, age, mass) could explain which hosts fed a disproportionate number of ticks. (4) Ticks were strongly aggregated on hosts within and across groups suggesting that some undiscovered quality of individual hosts was responsible for the aggregation. (5) Those individuals that fed more nymphs than expected, and are thus more likely to be infected with the Lyme disease agent, also tend to feed and infect more larvae than expected. Predicting which individuals those are is not yet possible."

		"abstract": "The duration of tick feeding is an important indicator to evaluate the risk of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato transmission, which increases considerably with the blood meal duration. This blood meal duration may be estimated from scutal index, the ratio between body length (idiosoma) and scutum width. For the estimation of blood meal duration in Ixodes ricinus, nymphal and adult female ticks were detached at predetermined intervals (24, 48, 72, and 96h) from laboratory mice and rabbits and their scutal index calculated. From this, non-linear regression equations were developed to determine the duration of attachment for nymphal and adult female I. ricinus ticks. As part of an epidemiological study addressing the risk of subclinical (seroconversion) and clinical infections after a tick bite in the Neuchâtel area (Switzerland) over 3 years (2003-2005), duration of tick attachment and anatomical site of bites collected on participants as well as seasonal distribution of tick bites were studied. Tick attachment duration was estimated in all ticks collected during this study (n=261). Nymphs were attached for a mean (+/- standard error, SE) of 31.6h (+/-2.6) and females for a mean (+/-SE) of 29.6h (+/-3.2). Most nymphs were removed after 24h of blood meal whereas most females were removed before 24h. Legs were the major anatomical sites of bites for women (40.7%), men (44.4%), and almost all age classes. Only children <10 years old were bitten more frequently on the head (41.2%) and on the neck (38.5%) than participants >10 years. The majority of tick bites were recorded from May to July during the 3 years. Attachment sites can influence the discovery of ticks, hence the duration of the tick bite. A detailed body examination after each outing in forest and an early withdrawal of an attached tick is an effective way to prevent Lyme borreliosis."

Workers exposed to tick bites in Eastern France were interviewed by occupational health physicians of the mutualité sociale agricole (MSA) on their sociodemographic features, their occupational activity, their last tick bite, their clinical history, and their means of prevention. Blood sampling was carried out for antibody detection. Among the 2975 subjects included in the study, the observed seroprevalence was 14.1% for Lyme borreliosis and 3.4% for TBE. Age, occupational activity, and place of residence significantly influenced the serological status of Lyme borreliosis. The seroprevalence was significantly higher among woodcutters (17.5%) than among other occupational categories (p<.001). Seroprevalence in Alsace (26.9%) and Lorraine (16.5%) were significantly higher than in other regions (p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively). The seroprevalence of TBE was significantly higher in Alsace (5.5%; p<0.001). The rates of seroprevalence for both infections varied according to forest areas. The multifactorial analysis of prevention practices revealed three types of behaviors as far as protection was concerned: \"rigorous\", \"partial\", or \"insufficient\". These results do not change the present French indications for use of TBE vaccine. They highlight the importance of information on these diseases and the need for further studies on microbial ecology and risk-factors identification."

In most textbooks it is assigned to the incoherent conglomeration of figurate or gyrate erythemas. To re-evaluate a large cohort of patients with EAC and to assess the evidence for infection with Borrelia. We retrospectively investigated 90 cases with the diagnosis of EAC. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and diagnoses were specified; these were then confirmed by clinicopathological correlation. Infection with Borrelia was assessed by focus-floating microscopy and by a Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Besides a miscellaneous group of annular disorders at times confused with EAC such as urticaria, leucocytoclastic vasculitis and psoriasis (20 of 90; 22%), EAC appeared to serve as a collective term for three main clinicopathological reaction patterns: (i) (tumid) lupus erythematosus (29 of 90; 32%), (ii) spongiotic dermatitides (25 of 90; 28%) and (iii) pseudolymphoma (16 of 90; 18%). In 13 of 16 (81%) cases with a pseudolymphomatous reaction pattern spirochaetes stained positive but were negative in other reaction patterns of EAC as well as in negative controls. These findings were confirmed by a Borrelia-specific PCR which was positive in two of three (67%) of these pseudolymphomatous EAC cases but was negative in all other variants of EAC (none of five) as well as 20 controls. We conclude that 'EAC' is a clinical reaction pattern that does not represent a specific clinicopathological entity and should lead to consideration of mainly lupus erythematosus, dermatitis and, in some cases, cutaneous Lyme disease."

Differences in the sensitivities of serologic assays for the detection of these antibodies, however, may not be the only or even the primary explanation for this observation. We investigated the impacts of four clinical variables on seropositivity--the duration of erythema migrans, the presence of single versus multiple skin lesions, and the gender and age of the patient. In this analysis, three different serologic tests were performed on acute-phase sera from 175 untreated patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans: the C6 single-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a commercially available ELISA in which a whole-cell sonicate of B. burgdorferi was the antigen, and a two-tier procedure. Irrespective of the serologic test performed, the results showed that seropositivity rates increased with the duration of the erythema migrans for patients with single lesions (P < 0.001) but not for those with multiple skin lesions. The variability in seropositivity rates was greatest for the two-tier testing strategy, with a >6-fold-higher rate of seropositivity among patients with a single lesion of 22- to 30-day duration than among those whose skin lesion was of 1- to 7-day duration (85.7 versus 14.1%; P < 0.001). Rates of seropositivity by each of the testing methods were also significantly higher for patients with multiple skin lesions than for those with single lesions (P < 0.001). In contrast, seropositivity rates were not affected by either the gender or the age of the patient. Thus, in patients with erythema migrans, certain clinical variables such as the duration and number of skin lesions had a profound impact on seropositivity rates, irrespective of the serologic assay performed."

As the incidence of Lyme disease continues to increase, it is important for physicians in Minnesota to become familiar with its clinical aspects, including the concept of \"chronic Lyme disease.\" Chronic Lyme disease is a misnomer that is often applied to patients with nonspecific presentations who may or may not have a history of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent that causes Lyme disease. When a patient does present with persistent nonspecific symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease, clinicians should ascertain the presence of objective manifestations, obtain laboratory results, and get a history of tick exposure. If active infection with B. burgdorferi is unlikely, they should avoid prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy and instead thoroughly evaluate the patient for other possible causes of the complaints and recommend appropriate care."

We evaluated the transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi s.s. during the key third day of nymphal I. scapularis feeding, when the risk of transmission rapidly increases.

At least five Complement Regulator-Acquiring Surface Proteins (BbCRASPs) are produced by B. burgdorferi, which are thought to assist spirochetes in host immune evasion. Recent studies established that BbCRASP-2 is preferentially expressed in mammals, and elicits robust antibody response in infected hosts, including humans. We show that BbCRASP-2 is ubiquitously expressed in diverse murine tissues, but not in ticks, reinforcing a role of BbCRASP-2 in conferring B. burgdorferi defense against persistent host immune threats, such as complement. BbCRASP-2 immunization, however, fails to protect mice from B. burgdorferi infection and does not modify disease, as reflected by the development of arthritis. An infectious BbCRASP-2 mutant was generated, therefore, to examine the precise role of the gene product in spirochete infectivity. Similar to wild type B. burgdorferi, BbCRASP-2 mutants remain insensitive to complement-mediated killing in vitro, retain full murine infectivity and induce arthritis. Quantitative RT-PCR assessment indicates that survivability of BbCRASP-2-deficient B. burgdorferi is not due to altered expression of other BbCRASPs. Together, these results suggest that the function of a selectively expressed B. burgdorferi gene, BbCRASP-2, is not essential for complement resistance or infectivity in the murine host."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spielmanii, one of the etiological agents of Lyme disease found in Europe, evades host complement-mediated killing by recruitment of the immune regulators factor H and FHL-1 from human serum. Serum-resistant and intermediate serum-resistant isolates express up to 3 distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) that bind factor H and/or FHL-1. The present study describes identification and functional characterization of BsCRASP-1 as the dominant factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of B. spielmanii. BsCRASP-1 is a 27.7kDa outer surface lipoprotein, which after processing has a predicted mass of 24.9kDa. BsCRASP-1 is encoded by a single copy gene, cspA, that maps to a linear plasmid of approximately 55kb. Ligand affinity blot techniques revealed that both native and recombinant BsCRASP-1 from different isolates can strongly bind FHL-1, but only weakly factor H. Deletion mutants of recombinant BsCRASP-1 were generated and a high-affinity binding site for factor H and FHL-1 was mapped to its carboxy-terminal 10-amino-acid residue domain. Similarly, the dominant binding site of factor H and FHL-1 was localized to short consensus repeats (SCRs) 5-7. Factor H and FHL-1 maintained cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation when bound to full-length BsCRASP-1 but not to a deletion mutant lacking the carboxy-terminal 10-amino-acid residue domain. In conclusion, BsCRASP-1 binds the host immune regulators factor H and FHL-1, and is suggested to represent a key molecule of B. spielmanii for complement resistance. Thus, BsCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. spielmanii and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Musculoskeletal symptoms in Lyme disease are very common at all stages of the disease. Lyme arthritis, whether intermittent or chronic, is a hallmark of late Lyme disease. This may cause severe joint pain and swelling especially confined to one or a few joints, most notably the knee. Antibiotic therapy is very effective in treating Lyme arthritis in the majority of cases. However, a small proportion of individuals will develop persistent chronic arthritis which is likely mediated through immunologic mechanisms. In these patients treatment strategies should include anti-inflammatory medications and possibly immunosuppressive treatments. Arthroscopic synovectomy ma ybe very helpful in some of these patients. Post Lyme disease syndrome and Lyme myositis are two other sequelae that are associated with Lyme disease."

It may manifest itself at any stage of the disease and has a wide clinical spectrum, from transient musculoskeletal symptoms to chronic, persistent inflammation of the large joints. Typically, however, the natural course of the disease is favorable, leading to elimination of the spirochete and regression of symptoms even if untreated. Antibiotic therapy is highly effective in eliminating Borrelia burgdorferi at any stage of the disease, but in minority of antibiotically treated patients autoimmunological phenomena may account for prolonged inflammation. Diagnosis is based on detection of specific antiborrelial antibodies in patients with history and symptoms consistent with Lyme arthritis. Results of the serologic examinations must be interpreted with caution, as their specificity in recognizing active infection is limited."

The Institute of Medicine and the Department of Health and Human Services have identified the need for strategies to improve access to healthcare services and to support the improvement of health outcomes. The literature documents health disparities associated with healthcare access and health outcomes from a geographic perspective. Place of residence, location of healthcare services, and geography in general are important factors in the analysis of health. Geographical information systems (GISs) are an emerging technology in the analysis of health from a geographical or location context. As a type of information technology, GISs are potentially powerful assessment tools for the investigation of healthcare access, health outcomes, and the possible resulting health disparities. Their ability to integrate health data with mapping functions allows for visualization, exploration, and modeling of health patterns. Application of GIS technology using health data can help in describing and explaining disparities in healthcare access and health outcomes. The studies reviewed demonstrated the use of GISs to investigate various aspects of healthcare access and health outcomes, including environmental variables of Lyme disease, sociodemographic variables and teen pregnancy, geographical disparities in breast cancer mortality by racial groups, PCP and AIDS prevalence, and factors of a leptospirosis disease outbreak. The literature reviewed shows effective integration and analysis of health data using GIS technology."

This significant infection rate indicates an accelerated development of B. burgdorferi s.s. in TPPP, because this pathogen was not detected five years previously during sampling of the three motile life stages of I. scapularis. Our study provides the initial report of the presence of B. burgdorferi s.s. in TPPP, which is now endemic for Lyme disease. Ultimately, people and domestic animals are at risk of contracting Lyme disease when they frequent this park."

Cells at the interface between these two arms of the immune response are thus critical to provide full engagement of host defense. Among the innate T cells at this interface are gammadelta T cells. gammadelta T cells contribute to the defense from a variety of infectious organisms, yet little is understood regarding how they are activated. We have previously observed that human gammadelta T cells of the Vdelta1 subset accumulate in inflamed joints in Lyme arthritis and proliferate in response to stimulation with the causative spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. We now observe that murine gammadelta T cells are also activated by B. burgdorferi and that in both cases the activation is indirect via TLR stimulation on dendritic cells or monocytes. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi stimulation of monocytes via TLR, and secondary activation of gammadelta T cells, are both caspase-dependent."

Lyme borreliosis is caused by Borelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which has four different species. Objective of this research was to investigate frequency of borreliosis on our material, to determine seasonal yearly distribution of disease and to investigate variability of clinical forms of disease. Retrospective analysis of medical records and discharge notes of treated patients with borreliosis in period 01 January 1996-31 December 2006 was conducted at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Sarajevo. Diagnosis of disease was confirmed serologically using Indirect Immunofluorescency method (IF), ELISA and Western-blot methods. During the investigated period at Clinic for Infectious Diseases, 51 patient with borreliosis was treated. Most affected was work-capable population. Since year 2000 number of treated patients is increasing. Disease is registered from May to September with peak in June. Most frequent symptoms were fever, fatigue, myalgias, and arthralgias. Disease was mainly diagnosed as Erythema migrans (39), than neuroborreliosis (7), borelial arthritis (4) and rarely eye infections-endophtalmitis and episcleritis. based on conducted 11-year period research of borreliosis we can conclude following: disease is mainly diagnosed as Erythema migrans, followed by neuroborreliosis. Women were more affected than men. Work-capable population is exposed to higher risk of getting disease. Highest peak of disease was in June. Due to various clinical forms and severity of late complications (II and III stage) it would be useful to conduct borreliosis testing with every etiologically unexplained neurological, cardiac and bone-joint manifestation."

The procedure was compared with \"classical\" infection of nymphs by feeding on infected mice. Both methods yielded comparable results (infection rate 44-65%) with the exception of B. afzelii, which produced better results using the immersion method (44%) compared with feeding on infected mice (16%). Nymphs infected by the immersion method at the larval stage were able to transmit the infection to naïve mice as shown by serology and PCR detection of spirochetal DNA in organs. The immersion method is faster than feeding on infected mice and provides more reproducible conditions for infection. It can be exploited for studies on both pathogen transmission and Borrelia-vector interactions."

		"abstract": "The availability of microbial genome information has provided a fruitful opportunity for studying regulatory networks in a variety of pathogenic bacteria. In an initial effort to elucidate regulatory networks potentially involved in differential gene expression by the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, we have been investigating the functions and regulation of putative transcriptional regulatory factors predicted to be encoded within the B. burgdorferi genome. Herein we report the regulation of one of the predicted transcriptional regulators, LtpA (BB0355), which is homologous to the transcriptional regulator CarD from Myxococcus xanthus. LtpA expression was assessed in response to various environmental stimuli. Immunoblot and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that unlike many well-characterized differentially regulated Borrelia genes whose expression is induced by elevated temperature, the expression of LtpA was significantly downregulated when spirochetes were grown at an elevated temperature (37 degrees C), as well as when the bacteria were cultivated in a mammalian host-adapted environment. In contrast, LtpA was induced at a lower culture temperature (23 degrees C). Further analyses indicated that the downregulation of LtpA was not dependent on the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS regulatory pathway, which is involved in the downregulation of OspA when B. burgdorferi is grown in a mammalian host-adapted environment. LtpA protein levels in B. burgdorferi were unaltered in response to changes in the pH in the borrelial cultures. Multiple attempts to generate an LtpA-deficient mutant were unsuccessful, which has hampered the elucidation of its role in pathogenesis. Given that LtpA is exclusively expressed during borrelial cultivation at a lower temperature, a parameter that has been widely used as a surrogate condition to mimic B. burgdorferi in unfed (flat) ticks, and because LtpA is homologous to a known transcriptional regulator, we postulate that LtpA functions as a regulator modulating the expression of genes important to B. burgdorferi's survival within its arthropod vector."

Diagnosis is problematic for many reasons, including unsatisfactory laboratory tests and confusion about test interpretation. When Lyme disease is diagnosed early, treatment is usually successful with oral antibiotics. Unfortunately, the diagnosis is often missed, allowing the infection to disseminate and affect every body system. When Lyme disease affects the central nervous system, it is often treated with intravenous antibiotics in the home setting. Infusion nurses who are experienced with the myriad symptoms and treatment challenges of these complex patients will be a reassuring asset to patients and physicians alike."

We surveyed residents of three Connecticut health districts to evaluate the impact of intensive community-wide education programs on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors to prevent Lyme disease. Overall, 84% of respondents reported that they knew a lot or some about Lyme disease, and 56% felt that they were very or somewhat likely to get Lyme disease in the coming year. During 2002-2004, the percentage of respondents who reported always performing tick checks increased by 7% and the percentage of respondents who reported always using repellents increased by 5%, whereas the percentage of respondents who reported avoiding wooded areas and tucking pants into socks decreased. Overall, 99% of respondents used personal protective behaviors to prevent Lyme disease. In comparison, 65% of respondents reported using environmental tick controls, and increased use of environmental tick controls was observed in only one health district. The majority of respondents were unwilling to spend more than $100 on tick control. These results provide guidance for the development of effective Lyme disease prevention programs by identifying measures most likely to be adopted by residents of Lyme disease endemic communities."

Previous studies have shown the loss of infectivity of B. burgdorferi is associated with in vitro cultivation. This diminished infectivity of B. burgdorferi has occurred as early as three in vitro passages, and the loss of plasmids have been observed with these less virulent to noninfective cultures. The effects of long-term in vitro cultivation on B. hermsii have not been investigated. However, understanding the degree of genomic degradation during in vitro cultivation is important for investigating pathogenic mechanisms of spirochetes. In this study, we analyzed the effects of continuous in vitro cultivation on the genomic composition and infectivity of B. hermsii and B. turicatae.We report that all seven isolates of B. hermsii and the one isolate of B. turicatae examined retained infectivity in mice after 1 year of continuous in vitro cultivation. Furthermore, there were few apparent differences in the plasmid profiles after long-term cultivation. Two isolates of B. hermsii remained infective after high passage despite losing a portion of the 200-kb linear plasmid containing the fhbA gene encoding the factor H binding protein. Also, sequence analysis of multiple B. hermsii isolates demonstrated two types of fhbA with complete congruence with the two genomic groups of B. hermsii spirochetes. Therefore, these results suggest that relapsing fever spirochetes are genetically stable during in vitro cultivation, and the fhbA-containing segment of DNA that is lost during cultivation is not required for infection."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the principal tick vector of the Lyme borreliosis agent Borrelia burgdorferi and other tick-borne zoonoses in northeastern North America. The degree of seasonal synchrony of nymphal and larval ticks may be important in influencing the basic reproductive number of the pathogens transmitted by I. scapularis. Because the seasonal phenology of tick vectors is partly controlled by ambient temperature, climate and climate change could shape the population biology of tick-borne pathogens. We used projected monthly normal temperatures, obtained from the second version of the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2) under emissions scenario A2 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for a site in southern Ontario, Canada, to simulate the phenology of I. scapularis in a mathematical model. The simulated seasonal abundance of ticks then determined transmission of three candidate pathogens amongst a population of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. Fitness of the different pathogens, in terms of resilience to changes in tick and rodent mortality, minima for infection duration, transmission efficiency and particularly any additional mortality of rodents specifically associated with infection, varied according to the seasonal pattern of immature tick activity, which was different under the temperature conditions projected for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. In each case, pathogens that were long-lived, highly transmissible and had little impact on rodent mortality rates were the fittest. However, under the seasonal tick activity patterns projected for the 2020s and 2050s, the fitness of pathogens that are shorter-lived, less efficiently transmitted, and more pathogenic to their natural hosts, increased. Therefore, climate change may affect the frequency and distribution of I. scapularis-borne pathogens and alter their evolutionary trajectories."

We demonstrate that an oral vaccine based on live recombinant Lactobacillus plantarum protects mice from tick-transmitted Borrelia burgdorferi infection.

Among these is the downregulation of lipoprotein antigen expression, exemplified by outer surface protein C (OspC), at the advent of specific immunity in the mammalian host. B. burgdorferi spirochetes that lack the linear plasmid 28-1 (lp28-1) succumb to the host's immune response. We thus explored the notion that these two phenomena were related--that lp28-1(-) organisms fail to downregulate ospC and thus are cleared following the appearance of anti-OspC antibody in the murine host. The lp-28-1(-) isolate and a wild-type (wt) isolate bearing the complete set of plasmids were grown in dialysis membrane chambers that were implanted into rat peritoneal cavities. Analysis of mRNA and protein from these cultures showed that OspC expression levels by lp28-1(-) organisms are abnormally high in vivo. A time course analysis of ospC expression in tissues following infection indicates also that temporal diminution of the dominant antigen OspC is impaired in lp28-1(-) spirochetes. Finally, passive transfer of monoclonal OspC-specific antibody into SCID mice 8 days postinfection cleared lp28-1(-) spirochetes, yet the wt organisms persisted in a majority of animals. These findings indicate that incomplete repression of OspC by lp28-1(-) organisms renders them susceptible to immune-mediated clearance. The lp28-1 plasmid must harbor one or more genes involved in OspC downregulation."

Our aim was to assess the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi infection among forestry workers and farmers in Duzce, in the north-west region of Turkey. Blood samples from 349 forestry workers and farmers and 193 healthy blood donors were obtained to determine the presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. A two-step testing strategy was used; the sera were initially tested by ELISA and then by Western blot (WB) IgG. Demographic data regarding residence, age, gender, profession, tick bite history, contact with animals, and symptoms involving the skin, nervous system, and osteoarticular system were collected by questionnaire. All results were evaluated statistically using the chi2 test. The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi was 10.9% (n=38) in forestry workers and farmers and 2.6% (n=5) in blood donors by ELISA, with a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Seropositivity rates were related to age, gender, and common risk factors for the disease. IgG seropositivity was confirmed in four (1.1%) sera by WB. In this first seroepidemiological report from the northwest region of Turkey, tick bite exposure was found to be high, whereas B. burgdorferi infection was not common. Preventive measures against tick exposure and further studies to determine the distribution of Lyme disease in Turkey are proposed."

		"abstract": "The disease of Lyme is a tick-borne infection. It involves skin, the nervous system, joints and the heart. Spirochaeta Borrelia burgdorferi is the etiologic agent of the disease. In the majority of cases, clinical symptoms, like migrating erythema, occur from 3 to 30 days, sometimes to 3 months after a bite from a tick. The early disseminated infection involves multiple migrating erythema, neuroborreliosis, arthritis, myocarditis and other organ-related symptoms. The late stage of chronic infection involves chronic atrophic leg dermatitis, neurological and rheumatological symptoms, and other organ-related symptoms which persist for above 12 months. The diagnosis of the disease of Lyme is based upon specific clinical symptoms confirmed by serologic tests. The two-step diagnostic protocol including the ELISA method, confirmed by the Western-blot test, is optimal. The present article describes a case of a 59-year-old man, a computer specialist, who often spends his free time walking in woods for recreation, and who was bitten by a tick 3 years before hospitalization. The bite resulted in migrating erythema that subsided without antimicrobial treatment. In spite of this, the man had not changed his hobby exposing himself to bites from ticks. One year later, multiple migrating erythema and extrapyramidalis symptoms appeared without any other organ malfunctions. In the current year, the patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital, and received antibiotics (ceftriaxon) with following neurological improvement. Several months later, extrapyramidal symptoms increased. On the day of admission to the hospital, the neurologic examination showed abnormalities of upper and lower limbs movements (propulsive walking and the right lower leg traction), the right hand tremor, pouts of the face, and sleepiness."

		"abstract": "Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) represents the persistent late stage of borreliosis in which Borrelia species may survive for decades. Occasionally, B-cell lymphoma may develop in these patients, and additional neoplastic complications such as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) have been reported once each over the past 60 years. Here we describe, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of metastatic SCC in a European patient with long-standing ACA caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Our case highlights a potential pathophysiological connection of untreated Borrelia infection with the initiation or progression of SCC and should alert dermatologists to this rare complication."

		"abstract": "RecA is a key protein linking genetic recombination to DNA replication and repair in bacteria. Previous functional characterization of Borrelia burgdorferi RecA indicated that the protein is mainly involved in genetic recombination rather than DNA repair. Genetic recombination may play a role in B. burgdorferi persistence by generation of antigenic variation. We report here the isolation of a recA null mutant in an infectious B. burgdorferi strain. Comparison of the in vitro growth characteristics of the mutant with those of the wild-type strain under various conditions showed no significant differences. While the RecA mutant was moderately more sensitive to UV irradiation and mitomycin C than the wild-type strain, the lack of RecA abolished allelic exchange in the mutant. Absence of RecA did not affect the ability of the mutant to infect mice. However, the RecA mutant was attenuated for joint infection in competitive-infection assays with the wild-type strain. vlsE sequence variation in mice was observed in both wild-type and RecA mutant spirochetes, indicating that the mechanism of antigenic variation is not homologous genetic recombination."

		"abstract": "Since 1999, the expansion of the West Nile virus (WNV) epizooty has led public health authorities to build and operate surveillance systems in North America. These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20,000 or smaller. After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease."

Molecules have been identified in tick saliva that effect T cell proliferation by binding to specific cytokines, thereby promoting a Th2 cytokine response that does not afford protection against tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi in mice. Moreover, reconstitution of a Th1-biased T cell response prior to spirochete challenge effectively neutralizes tick modulation of host immunity and affords protection against tick transmission of spirochetes. The current studies were undertaken to determine the effect of neutralizing specific Th2 cytokines prior to tick feeding and subsequent transmission of B. burgdorferi. The results indicate that suppression of both IL-4 and IL-5 prior to the feeding of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks significantly decreased spirochete load in target organs such as joint, bladder, heart, and skin of the Lyme disease-susceptible host."

To resolve phylogenetic relationships among isolates, we sequenced 68 isolates from Europe and North America at 1 chromosomal locus (16S-23S ribosomal RNA spacer) and 3 plasmid loci (ospC,dbpA, and BBD14). The ospC-A clone appeared to be highly prevalent on both continents, and isolates of this clone were uniform in DNA sequences, which suggests a recent trans-oceanic migration. The genetic homogeneity of ospC-A isolates was confirmed by sequences at 6 additional chromosomal housekeeping loci (gap, alr, glpA, xylB, ackA, and tgt). In contrast, the ospC-B group consists of genotypes distinct to each continent, indicating geographic isolation. We conclude that the ospC-A clone has dispersed rapidly and widely in the recent past. The spread of the ospC-A clone may have contributed, and likely continues to contribute, to the rise of Lyme disease incidence."

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis after MluI restriction of the genomic DNA (MluI large restriction fragment patterns, LRFPs) represents one of several approaches that have been used to assess Borrelia genotypic characteristics. The aim of the present report was to analyze the value of MluI-LRFP for identification of B. burgdorferi sensu lato at a species level and for further species subtype delineation. Results of the present study are based on 1487 B. afzelii strains, 285 B. garinii strains, 29 B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, 23 B. valaisiana strains, 8 B. spielmanii strains and 3 B. lusitaniae strains. Using MluI-LRFP, we were able to delineate all Borrelia species included in the study. Each of the six examined Borrelia species displayed unique MluI-LRFPs that enabled straightforward separation of strains into particular species, and also of strains within species. The subtypes of B. afzelii (Mla2 and Mla3), B. spielmanii (Mls1 and Mls2) and B. lusitaniae (Mll1 and Mll2) uncovered in the present analysis have not been reported previously. MluI-LRFP represents a highly specific and reproducible method for Borrelia identification."

		"abstract": "Autoimmune rheumatic diseases are generally considered as a multifactorial aetiology, mainly genetic susceptibility combined with environmental triggers of which bacteria are considered one of the most prominent. Among the rheumatic diseases where bacterial agents are more clearly involved as triggers are: reactive arthritis (ReA), rheumatic fever (RF) and Lyme disease. The role of bacterial infections in inducing other seronegative spondyloarthritis and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome has been hypothesized but is still not proven. The classic form of ReA is associated with the presence of HLA-B27 and is triggered by the urethritis or enteritis causing pathogens Chlamydia trachomatis and the enterobacteria Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia, respectively. But several other pathogens such as Brucella, Leptospira, Mycobacteria, Neisseria, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus have also been reported to cause ReA. RF is due to an autoimmune reaction triggered by an untreated throat infection by Streptococcus pyogenes in susceptible individuals. Carditis is the most serious manifestation of RF and HLA-DR7 is predominantly observed in the development of valvular lesions. Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Knowledge is limited about how this spirochete interacts with human tissues and cells. Some data report that Borrelia burgdorferi can manipulate resident cells towards a pro- but also anti-inflammatory reaction and persist over a long period of time inside the human body or even inside human cells."

The aim of the research was to determine species of B. burgdorferi s.l. in 32 patients from the Western Pomerania region in whom EM has been recognized. Blood samples of patients were investigated by PCR-RFLP method, with the use of enzyme differentiating species. The DNA of spirochetes was detected in 25 patients (25/32, 78.1%), compared with 23/32 (71.8%) of ELISA positive patients. Among 25 positive samples, 10 contained the DNA of B. garinii (10/25, 40%), 5 the DNA of B. afzelii (5/25, 20%), 4 the DNA of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) (4/25, 16%) and in 6 samples (6/25, 24%) the DNA of both B. garinii and B. afzelii was found. The DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes may be detected in patients with EM after antibiotic treatment. The most frequent species in patients with EM from the Western Pomerania region is B. garinii. Infections with more than one species of B. burgdorferi s.l. may occur in patients with EM."

We also discussed some diagnostic problems of Lyme borreliosis resulting from, in addition to other factors, genetic and geographical heterogeneity isolates B. burgdorferi s.l. used as antigens. Using ELISA from 395 sera of horses the total mean seroprevalence for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies 25.6% was observed. In the respective years, significant differences in the mean seroprevalence were not recorded. In the voivodships, the total mean seroprevalence and mean seroprevalence for the respective years varied from 16.6-66.6%. An analysis of seroprevalence depending on the age showed a significant difference between 0-2 year-old horses compared to older horses. The total seroprevalence in the set of 98 serum samples was lower with the strain of B. garinii (25.5%) compared to a mixture of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with B. afzelii (36.7%) and B. afzelii (42.8%). The highest correlation of findings was reached comparing the strains of B. afzelii (South Poland) and a mixture of B. burgdorferi s. s.+B. afzelii (East Slovakia). Lower correlation was between B. garinii and mixture of B. burgdorferi s. s.+B. afzelii. On the contrary, the lowest correlation of findings was observed between the Slovak strain of B. garinii and Polish B. afzelii. In a group of 26 cow sera, the mean seroprevalence for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies was 26.9%. In the remaining clinical signs the seroprevalence was 28.5-66.6%. In Western blot, out of 25 examined sera of horses 15 (60.0%) were positive, out of 6 cows 5 (83.3%) were positive (2 lameness, 2 phlebitis, 1 clinically healthy). The horses and cows sera recognised the proteins: 93 (MEP)-, 83-, 75-, 66-, 55-, 43-, 45-, 41 (flagellin)-, 39-, 34-, 35 (OspB) and 25-, 28 (OspC)-kDa.

		"abstract": "We recently hypothesized that T helper 17 (Th17) cells and their associated cytokines are involved in the development of arthritis following infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Here, we show that interleukin-23 (IL-23), a survival factor for Th17 cells, is required for the induction of arthritis in mice vaccinated with B. burgdorferi strain 297 and challenged with \"Borrelia bissettii.\" When Borrelia-vaccinated and -challenged mice were given antibodies to the p19 subunit of IL-23, they failed to develop the histopathological changes observed in untreated vaccinated and challenged mice. In addition, viable B. bissettii organisms stimulated the secretion of IL-17 from Borrelia-immune lymph node cells during in vitro culture. When anti-IL-23 p19 antibody was included in cultures of B. bissettii organisms and Borrelia-immune lymph node cells, the production of IL-17 was reduced to levels observed in cultures containing immune cells alone. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that Th17 cell-associated cytokines are involved in the development of Borrelia-mediated arthritis. These findings provide insight into previously overlooked immune mechanisms responsible for the development of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Colonial seabirds often breed in large aggregations. These individuals can be exposed to parasitism by the tick Ixodes uriae, but little is known about the circulation of pathogens carried by this ectoparasite, including Lyme disease Borrelia. Here we investigated the prevalence of antibodies (Ab) against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in seabird species sampled at eight locations across the North Atlantic. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests, we found that the prevalence of anti-Borrelia Ab in adult seabirds was 39.6% on average (over 444 individuals), but that it varied among colonies and species. Common guillemots showed higher seroprevalence (77.1%+/-5.9) than black-legged kittiwakes (18.6%+/-6.7) and Atlantic puffins (22.6%+/-6.3). Immunoblot-banding patterns of positive individuals, reflecting the variability of Borrelia antigens against which Ab were produced, also differed among locations and species, and did not tightly match the prevalence of Borrelia phylogroups previously identified in ticks collected from the same host individuals. These results represent the first report of the widespread prevalence of Ab against Borrelia within an assemblage of seabird species and demonstrate that Borrelia is an integrated aspect in the interaction between seabirds and ticks. More detailed studies on the dynamics of Borrelia within and among seabird species at different spatial scales will now be required to better understand the implications of this interaction for seabird ecology and the epidemiology of Lyme disease."

They were characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer amplicons. PCR-RFLP analysis indicated that the strains represented at least 3 genospecies (including a possible novel genospecies) and 4 different restriction patterns. Thirty strains belonged to the genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B. burgdorferi s. s.), 4 southern strains were identified as B. bissettii, and strain SCCH-5 from South Carolina exhibited MseI and DraI restriction patterns different from those of previously reported genospecies. Complete sequences of rrf-rrl intergenic spacers from 14 southeastern and northeastern strains were determined and the phylogenetic relationships of these strains were compared. The 14 strains clustered into 3 separate lineages on the basis of sequence analysis. These results were confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis."

		"abstract": "Recent infectious disease models illustrate a suite of mechanisms that can result in lower incidence of disease in areas of higher disease host diversity--the 'dilution effect'. These models are particularly applicable to human zoonoses, which are infectious diseases of wildlife that spill over into human populations. As many recent emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, the mechanisms that underlie the 'dilution effect' are potentially widely applicable and could contribute greatly to our understanding of a suite of diseases. The dilution effect has largely been observed in the context of Lyme disease and the predictions of the underlying models have rarely been examined for other infectious diseases on a broad geographic scale. Here, we explored whether the dilution effect can be observed in the relationship between the incidence of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection and bird (host) diversity in the eastern US. We constructed a novel geospatial contrasts analysis that compares the small differences in avian diversity of neighboring US counties (where one county reported human cases of WNV and the other reported no cases) with associated between-county differences in human disease. We also controlled for confounding factors of climate, regional variation in mosquito vector type, urbanization, and human socioeconomic factors that are all likely to affect human disease incidence. We found there is lower incidence of human WNV in eastern US counties that have greater avian (viral host) diversity. This pattern exists when examining diversity-disease relationships both before WNV reached the US (in 1998) and once the epidemic was underway (in 2002). The robust disease-diversity relationships confirm that the dilution effect can be observed in another emerging infectious disease and illustrate an important ecosystem service provided by biodiversity, further supporting the growing view that protecting biodiversity should be considered in public health and safety plans."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, has become the most common vector-borne disease in North America over the last three decades. To understand the dynamics of the epizootic spread and to predict the evolutionary trajectories of B. burgdorferi, accurate information on the population structure and the evolutionary relationships of the pathogen is crucial. We, therefore, developed a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme for B. burgdorferi based on eight chromosomal housekeeping genes. We validated the MLST scheme on B. burgdorferi specimens from North America and Europe, comprising both cultured isolates and infected ticks. These data were compared with sequences for the commonly used genetic markers rrs-rrlA intergenic spacer (IGS) and the gene encoding the outer surface protein C (ospC). The study demonstrates that the concatenated sequences of the housekeeping genes of B. burgdorferi provide highly resolved phylogenetic signals and that the housekeeping genes evolve differently compared with the IGS locus and ospC. Using sequence data, the study reveals that North American and European populations of B. burgdorferi correspond to genetically distinct populations. Importantly, the MLST data suggest that B. burgdorferi originated in Europe rather than in North America as proposed previously."

		"abstract": "Alteration of surface lipoprotein profiles is a key strategy that the Lyme disease pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, has evolved to be maintained within its enzootic cycle between arthropods and mammals. Accumulated evidence indicates that the central regulatory pathway controlling differential gene expression by B. burgdorferi is the RpoN-RpoS pathway (the sigma(54)-sigma(S) sigma factor cascade). It was previously shown that activation of the RpoN-RpoS pathway is controlled by Rrp2, a two-component response regulator and sigma(54)-dependent transcriptional activator. The role of Rrp2 in the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi has not been determined heretofore. In this report, we demonstrate that an rrp2 mutant defective in activating sigma(54)-dependent transcription was unable to establish infection in mice, but the rrp2 mutant was capable of surviving within ticks during and after tick feeding. Because the rrp2 mutant was defective in the production of OspC, an outer surface lipoprotein essential for mammalian host infection, we further examined whether the loss of infectivity of the rrp2 mutant was solely due to the inability to produce OspC. While transformation with a shuttle vector carrying ospC under the control of a constitutive flaB promoter restored infection to an ospC mutant in immunodeficient SCID mice, it could not rescue the avirulent phenotype of the rrp2 mutant. These data indicate that, in addition to controlling OspC, Rrp2 controls another factor(s) essential for B. burgdorferi to establish infection in mammals. Furthermore, microarray analyses revealed that 125 and 19 genes were positively and negatively regulated, respectively, by Rrp2, which provides a foundation for future identification of additional Rrp2-dependent virulence determinants in B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a spirochetal infection caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex that can proceed towards an inflammatory joint manifestation known as Lyme arthritis. Production of chemokines orchestrating neutrophil infiltration is supposed to be key to early arthritic pathogenesis. Using PMA-differentiated macrophage-like THP-1 (mTHP-1) cells we identified by antibody array methodology or mRNA analysis IL-8, GRO-alpha, NAP-2, and SDF-1alpha as being among those chemokines that are upregulated by bacterial lysates obtained from B. burgdorferi. Based on these observations, we set out to characterize in detail mechanisms mediating IL-8 release in this cellular model. TLR2 blocking antibodies, analysis of p65 translocation, and electromobility-shift analysis revealed activation of the TLR2/NF-kappaB axis by B. burgdorferi. The functional importance of this pathway was substantiated by suppression of IL-8 after inhibition of IkappaB kinase. Notably, MAP kinases, specifically the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, were essential for IL-8 secretion. Those data were confirmed by using freshly isolated adherent peripheral blood mononuclear cells. On the contrary, B. burgdorferi-induced IL-8 in mTHP-1 was unlikely related to flagellin, alpha3beta1-integrin signaling, lipopolysaccharide, bacterial DNA, NOD1/NOD2 agonists, or to intermediate production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Induction of IL-8 by B. burgdorferi was not due to amplification of constitutive AP-1 DNA-binding activity detectable in mTHP-1 cells. Data presented herein validate that TLR2, particularly on mTHP-1 cells, holds a central position in mediating IL-8 secretion associated with extracellular B. burgdorferi and beyond that suggest inhibition of IkappaB kinase and MEK1/2 kinases as promising pharmacological strategies aiming at IL-8 in early Lyme arthritis."

With the advent of the World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Consensus Classification for Cutaneous Lymphomas in 2005, uniform terminology and classification for this rare group of neoplasms were introduced. However, staging procedures and treatment strategies still vary between different cutaneous lymphoma centers, which may be because consensus recommendations for the management of CBCL have never been published. Based on an extensive literature search and discussions within the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Group and the International Society for Cutaneous Lymphomas, the present report aims to provide uniform recommendations for the management of the 3 main groups of CBCL. Because no systematic reviews or (randomized) controlled trials were available, these recommendations are mainly based on retrospective studies and small cohort studies. Despite these limitations, there was consensus among the members of the multidisciplinary expert panel that these recommendations reflect the state-of-the-art management as currently practiced in major cutaneous lymphoma centers. They may therefore contribute to uniform staging and treatment and form the basis for future clinical trials in patients with a CBCL."

They navigate efficiently through dense extracellular matrix and cross the blood-brain barrier by unknown mechanisms. Due to their slender morphology, spirochetes are difficult to visualize by standard light microscopy, impeding studies of their behavior in situ. We engineered a fluorescent infectious strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, which expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP). Real-time 3D and 4D quantitative analysis of fluorescent spirochete dissemination from the microvasculature of living mice at high resolution revealed that dissemination was a multi-stage process that included transient tethering-type associations, short-term dragging interactions, and stationary adhesion. Stationary adhesions and extravasating spirochetes were most commonly observed at endothelial junctions, and translational motility of spirochetes appeared to play an integral role in transendothelial migration. To our knowledge, this is the first report of high resolution 3D and 4D visualization of dissemination of a bacterial pathogen in a living mammalian host, and provides the first direct insight into spirochete dissemination in vivo."

Twenty-six affected and 10 control dogs were identified over an 8-year period (1996-2004) in databases at Cornell University's College of Veterinary Medicine. Case inclusion required serologic evidence of natural exposure to B. burgdorferi and availability of renal tissue (frozen or paraffin embedded) exhibiting pathology consistent with Lyme nephritis. Renal tissue samples were assessed using modified Steiner (silver) (MS) staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using 4 primer sets (eubacterial, B. burgdorferi, Bartonella, and canine genomic DNA), and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a 5'-cy3-eubacterial probe for 16S rRNA. MS stain was positive in 1 case; IHC was negative in all cases. None of the B. burgdorferi or Bartonella PCR reactions was positive. Two of the B. burgdorferi FISH analyses were positive. Minimal evidence of the presence of intact B. burgdorferi or any other bacterial organism was found in the renal tissue of dogs with suspected Lyme nephritis.

		"abstract": "The journey of the Chagas' disease parasite Trypanosoma cruzi in the human body usually starts in the skin after an insect bite, when trypomastigotes get through the extracellular matrix to bind specific surface receptors in the epidermis and dermis to enter cells, where they differentiate and replicate. As the infection spreads to the heart, nervous system, and other parts of the body via the circulatory system, the parasite must also cope with additional receptors in the immune system and vascular endothelium. The molecular underpinnings that govern host cell receptor recognition by T. cruzi counterreceptors remain largely unknown. Here, we describe an immunoprecipitation strategy designed to concurrently identify host receptors and complementing parasite counterreceptors. Extracellular domains of growth factor receptors fused to human immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc were incubated with parasite lysates, immunoprecipitated on protein G-Sepharose, and eluted with Laemmli sample buffer. Possible T. cruzi counterreceptors pulled down by the receptor-Fc bait were visualized on immunoblots probed with multispecific high-affinity IgG from chronic chagasic sera and on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels stained with silver or Coomassie blue. In screening receptors important for nervous system repair, this parasite counterreceptor immunoprecipitation (PcIP) assay identified 7 to 11 polypeptides (molecular masses, 14 kDa to 55 kDa) that bound to the coreceptors of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) GFRalpha-1, -2, and -3. Binding was specific because the T. cruzi mimic of host GFLs, named TGFL, did not react with GFL coreceptor tyrosine kinase RET and with other neurotrophic receptors. The polypeptides were located on the parasite outer membrane and bound noncovalently to each other. TGFL eluted from the GFL receptor/protein G affinity column with 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and potently promoted neurite outgrowth and cell survival in a GFL-sensitive mouse pheochromocytoma cell line. Given that GFLs are neuron survival factors crucial for development and maintenance of central and peripheral nervous systems, it may be that T. cruzi mimicry of host GFLs helps in mutually beneficial host repair of infected and damaged nervous tissue. As there are >30 growth factor receptor-Fc chimeras commercially available, this PcIP assay can be readily adapted to identify receptors/counterreceptors in other T. cruzi invasion sites and in other infections such as Lyme disease, amebiasis, and schistosomiasis."

Given the extensive genetic polymorphism of B. burgdorferi, elucidation of the population genetic structure of the bacterium in clinical samples may be relevant for understanding disease pathogenesis and may have applicability for the development of diagnostic tests and vaccine preparations. In this investigation, the genetic polymorphism of the 16S-23S rRNA (rrs-rrlA) intergenic spacer and ospC was investigated at the sequence level in 127 clinical isolates obtained from patients with early Lyme borreliosis evaluated in suburban New York City. Sixteen distinct rrs-rrlA and 16 distinct ospC alleles were identified, representing virtually all of the genotypes previously found in questing Ixodes scapularis nymphs in this region. In addition, a new ospC group was identified in a single patient. The strong linkage observed between the chromosome-located rrs-rrlA and plasmid-borne ospC genes suggests a clonal structure of B. burgdorferi in these isolates, despite evidence of recombination at ospC."

		"abstract": "To investigate whether the decreased rate of apoptosis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells occurs in patients with chronic Lyme arthritis (LA), which could contribute to persistent inflammation in those patients. PBMC from 7 patients with LA and 6 healthy persons (control--C) were incubated for 48 hours without stimulation (negative control) or under antigenic stimulation with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes: Borrelia afzelii VS46110 (B.a.), B. garinii 20047 (B.g.) or B. burgdorferi sensu stricte B-31 (B.ss.). Concentration of the apoptosis mediator active caspase-3, was measured by ELISA in the culture homogenate. Mean active caspase-3 concentration was higher in LA than in C in unstimulated culture. Increase of active caspase-3 concentration under antigenic stimulation occurred in C (significant for B.g.), but not in LA. 1) apoptosis rate of PBMC increases in presence of B. burgdorferi s.l., which may be a defense mechanism of this pathogen; 2) in late LA there is increased baseline susceptibility of PBMC to apoptosis, but exposition to B. burgdorferi s.l. seem not to exert further pro-apoptotic effect. This altered response to pro-apoptotic stimuli may be related to persistent inflammatory pathology in this group of patients."

However, these tests have not been assessed prospectively. We used these tests prospectively to determine serologic responses in 134 patients with various manifestations of Lyme disease, 89 patients with other illnesses (with or without a history of Lyme disease), and 136 healthy subjects from areas of endemicity and areas in which the infection was not endemic. With 2-tier tests and the C6 peptide ELISA, only approximately one-third of 76 patients with erythema migrans had results that were positive for IgM or IgG seroreactivity with Borrelia burgdorferi in acute-phase samples. During convalescence, 3-4 weeks later, almost two-thirds of patients had seroreactivity with the spirochete B. burgdorferi. The frequencies of seroreactivity were significantly greater among patients with spirochetal dissemination than they were among those who lacked evidence of disseminated disease. Of the 44 patients with Lyme disease who had neurologic, heart, or joint involvement, all had positive C6 peptide ELISA results, 42 had IgG responses with 2-tier tests, and 2 patients with facial palsy had only IgM responses. However, among the control groups, the IgG Western blot was slightly more specific than the C6 peptide ELISA. The differences between the 2 test systems (2-tier testing and C6 peptide ELISA) with respect to sensitivity and specificity were not statistically significant. Except in patients with erythema migrans, both test systems were sensitive for support of the diagnosis of Lyme disease. However, with current methods, 2-tier testing was associated with slightly better specificity."

The intensity and nature of the inflammatory response of host immune cells to B. burgdorferi may be a determining factor in disease progression. Gene array analysis was used to examine the expression of genes encoding cytokines, chemokines, and related factors in the joint tissue of infected C3H/HeJ mice and in a murine macrophage-like cell line in response to a disseminating or attenuated clinical isolate of B. burgdorferi. Both isolates elicited a robust proinflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells characterized by an increase in transcript levels of genes encoding CC and CXC chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and TNF superfamily members. Transcription of genes encoding IL-1beta, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1alpha, CXCR4, and TLR2 induced in RAW264.7 cells by either live or heat-killed spirochetes did not differ significantly at any time point over a 24-h period, nor was there a difference in the protein levels of IL-10, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p70 in culture supernatants. Thus, induction of host macrophage expression of proinflammatory mediators by host macrophages does not contribute to the differential pathogenicity of different B. burgdorferi strains."

Here, we show in Borrelia-vaccinated and -challenged mice that two cytokines known to induce the production of IL-17, IL-6 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, are also involved in the development of arthritis. Vaccinated and challenged mice administered either anti-TGF-beta or anti-IL-6 antibodies developed histopathologic changes of the hind paws similar to or greater than untreated control mice. By contrast, simultaneous blockage of these cytokines reduced the severity of arthritis in Borrelia-vaccinated and -challenged mice. Moreover, administration of anti-IL-17 antibodies to these dual-antibody-treated mice completely prevented the development of histopathologic changes of the ankle joints, significantly reduced edema of the hind paws, and prevented the production of anti-outer surface protein A borreliacidal antibodies. These findings demonstrate a role for the combined effects of IL-17, IL-6, and TGF-beta in the adaptive immune events leading to the development of Borrelia-induced arthritis."

The study was carried out at the \"Corporació Parc Taulí\" hospital in the city of Sabadell, Barcelona, Spain. The inclusion period was from April 2000 to April 2006. Serology tests were performed for Rickettsia conorii, R. slovaca, and Borrelia burgdorferi. The presence of Rickettsia was assessed by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and linear-after-the exponential-PCR in blood, skin biopsy, and ticks from the patients. Thirty-six patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Twenty-eight patients were children. In most cases, infection occurred between the months of October and April. In 34 patients the tick bite was on the scalp. A necrotic eschar surrounded by a perilesional erythematous halo was observed in 29 cases. All patients had painful regional lymphadenopathies. Serology for R. conorii was positive in 8 cases and for R. slovaca in 2. PCR was negative. The tick, identified as Dermacentor marginatus, was studied in 7 patients. Four of the 7 D. marginatus were positive for sequences compatible with R. slovoca as determined by RFLP or DNA sequencing. Thirty-three patients received antibiotic treatment. Progress was satisfactory in all cases. TIBOLA is present in Catalonia (Northeastern Spain) mainly in children. Although clinical and epidemiologic manifestations are very specific microbiologic confirmation is difficult."

The tick was removed en bloc with surrounding conjunctiva by an ophthalmologist. The arthropod was identified as the larval stage of the Lone Star tick (Amblyomma americanum). The patient did not experience any systemic illnesses or adverse sequelae. Attachment of ticks to the conjunctiva is unlikely to result in disease transmission when the larval stage is involved.

While information on the molecular interactions between ticks and pathogens that facilitate pathogen infection, development and transmission is limited, a comprehensive understanding of the tick-pathogen interface would be fundamental toward development of new and novel measures for control of both tick infestations and tick-borne pathogens. Recently, vaccine studies using key tick antigens and characterization of tick gene function by RNA interference (RNAi) have provided new information on genes that impact the tick-pathogen interface. In this review we summarize current research and prospects of tick vaccines and genetic manipulation of ticks targeted to the tick-pathogen interface. The knowledge gained from these collective studies will be fundamental toward understanding of tick-pathogen interactions and for formulation of control methods targeted at both ticks and tick-borne pathogens. Use of these molecular approaches will likely contribute to control measures that will notably reduce tick populations and tick-borne diseases in the future."

Carditis is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. The commonest abnormality is atrioventricular block of various degrees, though other rhythm abnormalities have been reported. Pericarditis, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy and degenerative valvular disease have been associated with B. burgdorferi. Temporary pacing might be required in unstable patients. The majority of the conduction disturbances have a benign prognosis, if the infectious agent is identified and treated appropriately."

		"abstract": "Decorin-binding proteins (Dbps) A and B of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, are surface-exposed lipoproteins that presumably bind to the extracellular matrix proteoglycan, decorin. B. burgdorferi infects various tissues including the bladder, heart, joints, skin and the central nervous system, and the ability of B. burgdorferi to bind decorin has been hypothesized to be important for this disseminatory pathogenic strategy. To determine the role of DbpBA in the infectious lifecycle of B. burgdorferi, we created a DbpBA-deficient mutant of B. burgdorferi strain 297 and compared the infectious phenotype of the mutant to the wild-type strain in the experimental murine model of Lyme borreliosis. The mutant strain exhibited a 4-log decrease in infectivity, relative to the wild-type strain, when needle inoculated into mice. Upon complementation of the DbpBA-mutant strain with DbpA, the wild-type level of infectivity was restored. In addition, we demonstrated that the DbpBA-deficient mutant was able to colonize Ixodes scapularis larval ticks after feeding on infected mice and persist within the ticks during the molt to the nymphal state. Moreover, surprisingly, the DbpBA-mutant strain was capable of being transmitted to naïve mice via tick bite, giving rise to infected mice. These results suggest that DbpBA is not required for the natural tick-transmission process to mammals, despite inferences from needle-inoculation experiments implying a requirement for DbpBA during mammalian infection. The combined findings also send a cautionary note regarding how results from needle-inoculation experiments with mice should be interpreted."

He had papillitis and an exudative subretinal macular lesion OD. Treatment was started with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone; a week later, IV methylprednisolone was administered with a tapering dose of oral steroids thereafter. Three months later, VA had improved to 3/60 OD. Patient 2: 38-year-old healthy female presenting with reduced left-eye vision (6/24) 6 weeks after a tick bite. She also suffered from erythema migrans and arthralgias. She had left-eye papillitis, macular haemorrhages and vascular sheathing. Treatment was started with IV ceftriaxone. One month later, there was profound loss of vision with development of CNVM. Treatment was declined by the patient and eventually retinal fibrosis developed. Inflammatory CNVM has not been described previously in the setting of ocular Lyme borreliosis. We herein describe the occurrence of inflammatory CNVM in two patients whose diagnosis with Lyme disease was clinically based--both were sero-negative. Visual outcome in the two patients was profoundly impaired because of the ensuing macular scar."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the commonest vector-borne zoonosis in the temperate world, and an emerging infectious disease in Canada due to expansion of the geographic range of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis. Studies suggest that climate change will accelerate Lyme disease emergence by enhancing climatic suitability for I. scapularis. Risk maps will help to meet the public health challenge of Lyme disease by allowing targeting of surveillance and intervention activities. A risk map for possible Lyme endemicity was created using a simple risk algorithm for occurrence of I. scapularis populations. The algorithm was calculated for each census sub-division in central and eastern Canada from interpolated output of a temperature-driven simulation model of I. scapularis populations and an index of tick immigration. The latter was calculated from estimates of tick dispersion distances by migratory birds and recent knowledge of the current geographic range of endemic I. scapularis populations. The index of tick immigration closely predicted passive surveillance data on I. scapularis occurrence, and the risk algorithm was a significant predictor of the occurrence of I. scapularis populations in a prospective field study. Risk maps for I. scapularis occurrence in Canada under future projected climate (in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s) were produced using temperature output from the Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model 2 with greenhouse gas emission scenario enforcing 'A2' of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We have prepared risk maps for the occurrence of I. scapularis in eastern and central Canada under current and future projected climate. Validation of the risk maps provides some confidence that they provide a useful first step in predicting the occurrence of I. scapularis populations, and directing public health objectives in minimizing risk from Lyme disease. Further field studies are needed, however, to continue validation and refinement of the risk maps."

		"abstract": "The Ixodoidea (ticks) are important vectors in the transmission of many human diseases; for example, the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis is the major vector in the transmission of Lyme disease, the most frequently reported vector-borne illness in the United States. The development of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) for ixodoidean cDNA libraries, and their public deposition, has generated a rich resource for protein discovery in members of this taxon, thereby providing an opportunity for better understanding the physiology and behavior of these disease vectors. Here, in silico searches of publicly accessible ESTs were conducted to identify transcripts encoding putative ixodoidean neuropeptide precursors, with the mature peptides contained within them predicted using online peptide processing programs and homology to known arthropod sequences. In total, 37 putative neuropeptide-encoding ESTs were identified from three ixodoidean species: I. scapularis (29 ESTs), Rhipicephalus microplus (seven ESTs) and Amblyomma americanum (one EST). Among those identified from I. scapularis were ones predicted to encode isoforms of corazonin, crustacean hyperglycemic hormone/ion transport peptide, diuretic hormone (both calcitonin- and corticotropin-releasing factor-like), FMRFamide-related peptide (both short neuropeptide F and sulfakinin subfamilies) orcokinin, proctolin, pyrokinin/periviscerokinin/pheromone biosynthesis activating neuropeptide, SIFamide, and tachykinin-related peptide. Collectively, 80 distinct ixodoidean neuropeptides were characterized from the identified precursors. These results not only expand greatly the number of known/predicted ixodoidean neuropeptides, but also provide a strong foundation for future molecular and physiological investigations of peptidergic control in this important group of disease-transmitting arthropods."

Together with GH13 and GH70, it forms the clan GH-H, known as the alpha-amylase family. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that the putative GH77 amylomaltase (MalQ) from the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi genome (BB0166) contains several amino acid substitutions in the positions that are important and conserved in all GH77 amylomaltases. The most important mutation concerned the functionally important arginine positioned two residues before the catalytic nucleophile that is replaced by lysine in B. burgdorferi MalQ. Similar remarkable substitutions were found in two other putative GH77 amylomaltases from related borreliae. In order to confirm the exclusive sequence features and to verify the eventual enzymatic activity, the malQ gene from B. burgdorferi was amplified using PCR. A c. 1.5-kb amplified DNA fragment was sequenced, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli, and the resulting recombinant protein was preliminarily characterized for its activity towards glucose (G1) and a series of malto-oligosaccharides (G2-G7). This study confirmed that the remarkable substitution of the arginine really exists and the GH77 MalQ protein from B. burgdorferi is a functional amylomaltase because it is able to hydrolyse the malto-oligosaccharides as well as to form their longer transglycosylation products."

Part of the material was also investigated by Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction. The study population comprised 61 cases of lichen sclerosus and 118 controls (60 negative controls and 68 positive controls). The presence of B burgdorferi sensu lato within tissue specimens. Using focus-floating microscopy, we detected Borrelia species in 38 of 60 cases (63%) of lichen sclerosus and in 61 of 68 (90%) of positive controls of classic borreliosis, but Borrelia species were absent in all negative controls. Borrelia species were detected significantly more often in early inflammatory-rich (31 of 39 [80%]) than in late inflammatory-poor (7 of 21 [33.3%]) cases (P = .001). Polymerase chain reaction findings were positive in 25 of 68 positive controls (37%) and negative in all 11 cases of lichen sclerosus and all 15 negative controls. Focus-floating microscopy is a reliable method to detect Borrelia species in tissue sections. The frequent detection of this microorganism, especially in early lichen sclerosus, points to a specific involvement of B burgdorferi or other similar strains in the development or as a trigger of this disease."

Here, we focused on the sialome of the European vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes ricinus. In the attempt to describe expressed genes and their dynamics throughout the feeding period, we constructed cDNA libraries from four different feeding stages of Ixodes ricinus females: unfed, 24 hours after attachment, four (partially fed) and seven days (fully engorged) after attachment. Approximately 600 randomly selected clones from each cDNA library were sequenced and analyzed. From a total 2304 sequenced clones, 1881 sequences forming 1274 clusters underwent subsequent functional analysis using customized bioinformatics software. Clusters were sorted according to their predicted function and quantitative comparison among the four libraries was made. We found several groups of over-expressed genes associated with feeding that posses a secretion signal and may be involved in tick attachment, feeding or evading the host immune system. Many transcripts clustered into families of related genes with stage-specific expression. Comparison to Ixodes scapularis and I. pacificus transcripts was made. In addition to a large number of homologues of the known transcripts, we obtained several novel predicted protein sequences. Our work contributes to the growing list of proteins associated with tick feeding and sheds more light on the dynamics of the gene expression during tick feeding. Additionally, our results corroborate previous evidence of gene duplication in the evolution of ticks."

		"abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with dementia, brain atrophy and the aggregation and accumulation of a cortical amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). Chronic bacterial infections are frequently associated with amyloid deposition. It had been known from a century that the spirochete Treponema pallidum can cause dementia in the atrophic form of general paresis. It is noteworthy that the pathological hallmarks of this atrophic form are similar to those of AD. Recent observations showed that bacteria, including spirochetes contain amyloidogenic proteins and also that Abeta deposition and tau phosphorylation can be induced in or in vivo following exposure to bacteria or LPS. Bacteria or their poorly degradable debris are powerful inflammatory cytokine inducers, activate complement, affect vascular permeability, generate nitric oxide and free radicals, induce apoptosis and are amyloidogenic. All these processes are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Old and new observations, reviewed here, indicate that to consider the possibility that bacteria, including several types of spirochetes highly prevalent in the population at large or their persisting debris may initiate cascade of events leading to chronic inflammation and amyloid deposition in AD is important, as appropriate antibacterial and antiinflammatory therapy would be available to prevent dementia."

We present a survey of clinical stages, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of Lyme borreliosis in adults. The article is based on literature retrieved through database searches and own experience. In Norway, Lyme borreliosis is most prevalent in coastal areas from the south and up to Trøndelag. Lyme disease can be classified into three stages; localised stage, and early and late disseminated stages. A laboratory gold standard does not exist, so the diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical manifestations and indirect detection of the bacteria, most often specific antibodies. Antibody results must be interpreted with caution. No medication is needed after a tick bite, but all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis should be treated with antibiotics according to guidelines. The prognosis is generally good. Post Lyme disease with persistent symptoms after borreliosis is a controversial condition. No studies have demonstrated persistent infection with borrelia bacteria in patients with chronic complaints after adequate antibiotic treatment, and additional antibiotic treatment does not improve quality of life in these patients."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi must repress expression of outer surface protein C (OspC) to effectively evade specific humoral immunity and to establish persistent infection. This ability largely relies upon a regulatory element, the only operator that has been reported in spirochetal bacteria. Immediately upstream of the ospC promoter, two sets of inverted repeats (IRs) constitute small and large palindromes, in which the right IR of the large palindrome contains the left IR of the small one, and may collectively function as the ospC operator. In the study, the large palindrome with or without the small IR was fused with an flaB promoter, which was used to drive expression of a promoterless ospC copy as a reporter gene, and introduced into OspC-deficient B. burgdorferi. The presence of the large palindrome alone significantly reduced ospC expression driven by the fused flaB promoter in the joint tissue of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, and rescued spirochetes from elimination by passively transferred OspC antibody in infected SCID mice and specific immune responses elicited in immunocompetent mice, confirming a function of the IRs as an operator. Inclusion of the small IR further enhanced the ability of the large palindrome to reduce the activity of the fused flaB promoter, indicating that the small IR is a part of the operator. Taken together, the study led to successful verification and dissection of the ospC operator."

		"abstract": "Humans and other animals with Lyme borreliosis produce antibodies to a number of components of the agent Borrelia burgdorferi, but a full accounting of the immunogens during natural infections has not been achieved. Employing a protein array produced in vitro from 1,292 DNA fragments representing approximately 80% of the genome, we compared the antibody reactivities of sera from patients with early or later Lyme borreliosis to the antibody reactivities of sera from controls. Overall, approximately 15% of the open reading frame (ORF) products (Orfs) of B. burgdorferi in the array detectably elicited an antibody response in humans with natural infections. Among the immunogens, 103 stood out on the basis of statistical criteria. The majority of these Orfs were also immunogenic with sera obtained from naturally infected Peromyscus leucopus mice, a major reservoir. The high-ranking set included several B. burgdorferi proteins hitherto unrecognized as immunogens, as well as several proteins that have been established as antigens. The high-ranking immunogens were more likely than nonreactive Orfs to have the following characteristics: (i) plasmid-encoded rather than chromosome-encoded proteins, (ii) a predicted lipoprotein, and (iii) a member of a paralogous family of proteins, notably the Bdr and Erp proteins. The newly discovered antigens included Orfs encoded by several ORFs of the lp36 linear plasmid, such as BBK07 and BBK19, and proteins of the flagellar apparatus, such as FliL. These results indicate that the majority of deduced proteins of B. burgdorferi do not elicit antibody responses during infection and that the limited sets of immunogens are similar for two different host species."

The disease covers a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations affecting the skin, nervous and musculoskeletal systems, the heart, and the eyes. The diagnosis must be based on clinical suspicion and on symptoms and signs observed during a thorough interview and examination of the patient. Laboratory results either support or oppose the conclusions that are drawn from history and clinical examination. Antibiotic therapy is curative in most patients with LB. Unfortunately, some patients develop chronic symptoms, such as arthritis, that do not respond to antibiotics. In these patients, treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids is recommended, while the role of immunomodulatory drugs, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, remains open. In this review we focus, after presenting the history and basics of LB, on the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of LB, as well as on recent advances in selected aspects of the field."

Although specific, the interpretation of WBs for diagnosis of LB (i.e., Lyme WBs) is subjective, with considerable variability in results. In addition, the processing, reading, and interpretation of Lyme WBs are laborious and time-consuming procedures. With the need for rapid processing and more objective interpretation of Lyme WBs, we evaluated the performances of two automated interpretive systems, TrinBlot/BLOTrix (Trinity Biotech, Carlsbad, CA) and BeeBlot/ViraScan (Viramed Biotech AG, Munich, Germany), using 518 serum specimens submitted to our laboratory for Lyme WB analysis. The results of routine testing with visual interpretation were compared to those obtained by BLOTrix analysis of MarBlot immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG and by ViraScan analysis of ViraBlot and ViraStripe IgM and IgG assays. BLOTrix analysis demonstrated an agreement of 84.7% for IgM and 87.3% for IgG compared to visual reading and interpretation. ViraScan analysis of the ViraBlot assays demonstrated agreements of 85.7% for IgM and 94.2% for IgG, while ViraScan analysis of the ViraStripe IgM and IgG assays showed agreements of 87.1 and 93.1%, respectively. Testing by the automated systems yielded an average time savings of 64 min/run compared to processing, reading, and interpretation by our current procedure. Our findings demonstrated that automated processing and interpretive systems yield results comparable to those of visual interpretation, while reducing the subjectivity and time required for Lyme WB analysis."

The degree of Lyme arthritis severity is controlled in part by host genetics and several quantitative trait loci have been identified which contribute to this regulation. In addition, the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 assumes an important role in the control of arthritis in C57BL/6 mice. However, the identification of genes and signaling pathways that dictate arthritis severity has remained elusive. In an attempt to elucidate such genes and pathways, the power of microarray analysis was combined with information gleaned from gene manipulation models. As a result of this approach, two novel gene profiles were identified: an IFN-inducible profile in arthritis-susceptible C3H and IL-10(-/-) mice, and an epidermal/differentiation profile in C57BL/6 mice. Application of this information to TLR2(-/-) mice, which also develop severe arthritis, indicated that they also upregulated IFN-responsive genes. These results provided new insight into the regulation of Lyme arthritis development and illustrated the utility of combining gene expression analyses with genetically manipulated mouse models in unraveling mechanisms underlying specific disease processes."

		"abstract": "Characterizing the basic reproduction number, R(0), for many wildlife disease systems can seem a complex problem because several species are involved, because there are different epidemiological reactions to the infectious agent at different life-history stages, or because there are multiple transmission routes. Tick-borne diseases are an important example where all these complexities are brought together as a result of the peculiarities of the tick life cycle and the multiple transmission routes that occur. We show here that one can overcome these complexities by separating the host population into epidemiologically different types of individuals and constructing a matrix of reproduction numbers, the so-called next-generation matrix. Each matrix element is an expected number of infectious individuals of one type produced by a single infectious individual of a second type. The largest eigenvalue of the matrix characterizes the initial exponential growth or decline in numbers of infected individuals. Values below 1 therefore imply that the infection cannot establish. The biological interpretation closely matches that of R(0) for disease systems with only one type of individual and where infection is directly transmitted. The parameters defining each matrix element have a clear biological meaning. We illustrate the usefulness and power of the approach with a detailed examination of tick-borne diseases, and we use field and experimental data to parameterize the next-generation matrix for Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Sensitivity and elasticity analyses of the matrices, at the element and individual parameter levels, allow direct comparison of the two etiological agents. This provides further support that transmission between cofeeding ticks is critically important for the establishment of tick-borne encephalitis."

An in-clinic C6 ELISA SNAP kit has been marketed for dogs. This canine kit was evaluated for horses using serum from experimentally infected ponies. Serum samples originated from 2 previous studies. In the first study, 7 ponies were exposed to B. burgdorferi-infected ticks; 4 ponies served as uninfected controls. Serum samples were obtained bimonthly for 9 months. In the second study, 16 ponies were exposed to B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. After confirmation of infection by skin culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology, the ponies were allocated to 4 groups that received tetracycline, doxycycline, ceftiofur, or no treatment. Serum samples were obtained monthly, both before and after antibiotic treatments, for 11 months. For the current study, selected samples (n = 220) from both studies were tested with IDEXX SNAP Heartworm Ab/Borrelia burgdorferi Ab/Ehrlichia canis Ab Test Kits. Tested samples included samples taken before infection, from various times postinfection, and after antibiotic treatments. Results from confirmed positive or negative samples were used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Results indicate that the test kits have fair sensitivity (63%) and very high specificity (100%) for horses recently infected with B. burgdorferi. Validation of this test provides equine practitioners with an inexpensive, in-clinic method to confirm infection, although its moderate sensitivity may result in a moderate chance of a false negative test."

The major problem is the unspecific adsorption of blood serum components to the sensor surface. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor has been used for the direct detection of Lyme borreliosis specific antibodies in blood serum. The combination of an optimal dilution factor with the addition of suitable detergents minimizes the unspecific adsorption. Serum samples from healthy donors and infected patients have been analyzed and the results were compared with a certified immunoassay and a western blot. A serum dilution of 1:20 in HBS-buffer with 0.05% Tween20 and 1 mg/mL carboxymethyl dextran reduces unspecific adsorption significantly and enables the identification of antibodies against the OspC/pepC10 antigen pair with a sensitivity of 92% and that against the VlsE/C6 pair with 81% sensitivity; the specificities are 82% and 86% respectively. Positive hits in the western blot could also be determined in the SPR-assay with a correlation of 96.5%. The presented optical label-free technique has the potential for a precise and fast identification of pathogen-specific antibodies without the need for a secondary labeling antibody."

Although B. burgdorferi sensu lato is a diverse group of bacteria, only three genospecies, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii, are known to be pathogenic and commonly recognized to cause human disease. To assess the potential of another common genospecies, Borrelia bissettii, to induce disease, a mouse model was employed. Two Colorado isolates of B. bissettii (CO-Bb) induced lesions of the bladder, heart, and femorotibial joint 8 weeks after inoculation into mice. In contrast, two British Columbia (BC-Bb) isolates, could not be cultured or amplified by PCR from target organs, and did not induce lesions. Consistent with pathology and culture results, the antibody response in mice to BC-Bb was minimal compared to CO-Bb, indicating either transient localized infection or rapid immune clearance of BC-Bb. Although sequence analysis of the rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer region indicated 99% homology between CO-Bb and BC-Bb, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) analysis indicated five distinct protein differences between these low-passage isolates. These studies support the prospect that B. bissettii may indeed be the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis cases in Eastern Europe, associated with the atypical Borrelia strain 25015, and in other regions. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that B. bissettii can induce pathology in a vertebrate host."

Despite extensive study, there is currently no clear evidence that post-Lyme disease syndrome is caused by persistent infection with B burgdorferi. Four randomized placebo-controlled studies have shown that antibiotic therapy offers no sustained benefit to patients who have post-Lyme disease syndrome. These studies also showed a substantial placebo effect and a significant risk of treatment-related adverse events. Further research to elucidate the mechanisms underlying persistent symptoms after Lyme disease and controlled trials of new approaches to the treatment and management of these patients are needed."

Information was obtained from a search of the PubMed and MEDLINE databases (keyword: Lyme disease) for articles published from August 31, 1997, through September 1, 2007. Approximately 20,000 cases of Lyme disease are reported annually. Residents of the coastal Northeast, northwest California, and the Great Lakes region are at highest risk. Children and those spending extended time outdoors in wooded areas are also at increased risk. The disease is transmitted to humans through the bite of the Ixodes tick (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus). Typically, the tick must feed for at least 36 hours for transmission of the causative bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, to occur. Each of the 3 stages of the disease is associated with specific clinical features: early localized infection, with erythema migrans, fever, malaise, fatigue, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias; early disseminated infection (occurring days to weeks later), with neurologic, musculoskeletal, or cardiovascular symptoms and multiple erythema migrans lesions; and late disseminated infection, with intermittent swelling and pain of 1 or more joints (especially knees). Neurologic manifestations (neuropathy or encephalopathy) may occur. Diagnosis is usually made clinically. Treatment is accomplished with doxycycline or amoxicillin; cefuroxime axetil or erythromycin can be used as an alternative. Late or severe disease requires intravenous ceftriaxone or penicillin G. Single-dose doxycycline (200 mg orally) can be used as prophylaxis in selected patients. Preventive measures should be emphasized to patients to help reduce risk."

		"abstract": "To initiate infection, a microbial pathogen must be able to evade innate immunity. Here we show that the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi depends on its surface lipoproteins for protection against innate defences. The deficiency for OspC, an abundantly expressed surface lipoprotein during early infection, led to quick clearance of B. burgdorferi after inoculation into the skin of SCID mice. Increasing expression of any of the four randomly chosen surface lipoproteins, OspA, OspE, VlsE or DbpA, fully protected the ospC mutant from elimination from the skin tissue of SCID mice; moreover, increased OspA, OspE or VlsE expression allowed the mutant to cause disseminated infection and restored the ability to effectively colonize both joint and skin tissues, albeit the dissemination process was much slower than that of the mutant restored with OspC expression. When the ospC mutant was modified to express OspA under control of the ospC regulatory elements, it registered only a slight increase in the 50% infectious dose than the control in SCID mice but a dramatic increase in immunocompetent mice. Taken together, the study demonstrated that the surface lipoproteins provide B. burgdorferi with an essential protective function against host innate elimination."

The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of COX-2 to temporal regulation of the inflammatory response to infection in a murine model of Lyme arthritis. Experimental Lyme disease was induced in both arthritis-resistant DBA/2J and arthritis-susceptible C3H/HeJ mice by inoculation in the hind footpads with Borrelia burgdorferi. COX-2 inhibitors were administered daily, and their effect on arthritis pathology was assessed at various time points postinfection. The COX-2 deficiency was also backcrossed onto both DBA and C3H backgrounds to confirm the findings from COX-2 inhibitor-treated mice. In COX-2 inhibitor-treated or COX-2-/- C3H mice, arthritis developed normally but did not resolve. Cessation of COX-2 inhibitor treatment on day 14 postinfection did not induce resolution of arthritis, indicating an early onset for the molecular mechanisms governing resolution. The lack of resolution of arthritis correlated with altered COX-2 and cytosolic phospholipase A2 messenger RNA levels in the joints of C3H mice. In addition, the proresolution lipid molecule 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 was produced in response to B burgdorferi infection, and its production was attenuated by the inhibition of COX-2. Our results demonstrate that early production of COX-2 products is necessary for resolution of the inflammatory arthritis induced by Borrelia infection, and that COX-2 inhibition may result in prolonged inflammatory states, possibly by inhibition of proresolution eicosanoids."

Report of a 67-year-old patient with medical history of recurrent iridocyclitis and arthritis presented with a bilateral, progressive, asymmetric crystalline keratopathy, which was particularly pronounced in the peripheral temporal superior cornea. After penetrating keratoplasty, crystalline keratopathy with stromal haziness recurred. Corneal regrafting was performed. The corneal specimen from the penetrating keratoplasty was examined by light and EM as well as by PCR. In the explanted corneal graft, as well as retrospectively in the corneal specimen from the first keratoplasty, spirochetelike bodies and fragments were detected by light and EM. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was demonstrated by broad-range (16S rDNA) PCR. A more precise identification as Borrelia garinii serotype 5 was possible by analyses of the flaB and ospA gene sequences. Borrelia-specific serological tests showed borderline titers in immunofluorescence and weak reaction in immunoblot, respectively. This case illustrates that borreliae must be considered as a cause of crystalline keratopathy; Borrelia-specific serological tests can be false negative; explanted cornea specimens of etiologically unclear crystalline keratopathy should be analyzed by EM or PCR for detection of pathogens; and prolonged antibiotic treatment might be effective to prevent progression or recurrence of the disease."

The tick records reported herein represent a culmination of data from specimens in the U.S. National Tick Collection, new records of ticks from endemic tarsiers and associated vertebrates, and literature reviews. Collectively, the tick fauna of Sulawesi shows most affinities with the fauna of southeast Asia but there are distinct faunal elements that show relationships with other Indonesian islands, the Philippines or Australasia, as well as a few tick species with widespread geographical distributions. Some ticks known from Sulawesi have known or potential medical-veterinary significance. These include R. (B.) microplus which is a significant pest of cattle and a vector of the agents of bovine anaplasmosis, I. granulatus which is a vector of Langat virus and Lyme disease spirochetes and has been shown to harbor pathogenic rickettsiae in other parts of its range, and R. sanguineus which is a globally widespread ectoparasite of canines and a vector of canine pathogens and parasites."

Deposition of terminal C5b to C9 (one molecule each of C5b, C6, C7, and C8 and one or more molecules of C9) complement complexes, part of the membrane attack complex, on the surface of B. burgdorferi was inhibited in the presence of Salp15. In the presence of normal human serum, serum-sensitive Borrelia burgdorferi requires protection against complement-mediated killing, which is provided, at least in part, by the binding to the tick salivary protein Salp15."

		"abstract": "Reports of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in malignant lymphomas have raised the hypothesis that infection with B. burgdorferi may be causally related to non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) development. We conducted a Danish-Swedish case-control study including 3055 NHL patients and 3187 population controls. History of tick bite or Borrelia infection was ascertained through structured telephone interviews and through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serum analyses for antibodies against B. burgdorferi in a subset of 1579 patients and 1358 controls. Statistical associations with risk of NHL, including histologic subtypes, were assessed by logistic regression. Overall risk of NHL was not associated with self-reported history of tick bite (odds ratio [OR] = 1.0; 95% confidence interval: 0.9-1.1), Borrelia infection (OR = 1.3 [0.96-1.8]) or the presence of anti-Borrelia antibodies (OR = 1.3 [0.9-2.0]). However, in analyses of NHL subtypes, self-reported history of B. burgdorferi infection (OR = 2.5 [1.2-5.1]) and seropositivity for anti-Borrelia antibodies (OR = 3.6 [1.8-7.4]) were both associated with risk of mantle cell lymphoma. Notably, this specific association was also observed in persons who did not recall Borrelia infection yet tested positive for anti-Borrelia antibodies (OR = 4.2 [2.0-8.9]). Our observations suggest a previously unreported association between B. burgdorferi infection and risk of mantle cell lymphoma."

We evaluated the ability of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on a synthetic peptide (OspC7) that matched the region to detect the response and compared the sensitivity during early Lyme disease to that for an FDA-approved Western blot. When the optical density value was adjusted to 98% specificity based on the results from testing normal or uncharacterized sera (n = 236) or sera from patients with blood factors or illnesses that commonly produce antibodies that cross-react with B. burgdorferi antigens (n = 77), 115 (73%) of 157 sera from patients likely to have early Lyme disease were positive for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and 17 (11%) also had IgG antibodies. In addition, the IgM ELISA reactivities and the titers of antibodies detected by a flow cytometric borreliacidal antibody test correlated closely (r = 0.646). Moreover, the IgM ELISA was significantly more sensitive (P < 0.001) than the Western blot procedure. The findings therefore confirmed that the peptide IgM ELISA detected OspC borreliacidal antibodies and provided strong evidence that the test can eliminate the necessity for confirming early Lyme disease by a supplementary test such as Western blotting."

		"abstract": "The class of Spirochetes comprises a wide array of clinically important pathogens, including Treponema pallidum causing syphilis as well as Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease (LD). Diseases caused by spirochetes are characterized by specific sequelae of host reactions, and also by characteristic antibody response patterns. Over the last decades, research on the interaction of spirochetes with the host's immune system had a strong emphasis on outer membrane lipoproteins. In fact, these structures have been convincingly shown to activate immune cells via CD14 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and recent data also indicate an interaction with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein (LBP). In particular, the interaction of B. burgdorferi with TLR-2 could not only be demonstrated in mice, but was also supported by data showing that genetic variants of TLR-2 in humans influenced the clinical course of LD. However, there is increasing evidence that next to lipoproteins, glycolipids may also play an important role in responses of the immune system towards spirochetes. Diacylglycerol-containing glycolipids exhibiting similarities with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) of Gram-positive bacteria have been demonstrated in various Treponema species, whereas LPS-like glycolipids have been shown to be present in Leptospira. Treponema glycolipids, comparably to lipoproteins and LTA, interact with LBP, CD14 and TLRs. In contrast, complex glycolipids of high molecular weight could not be demonstrated in Borrelia, whereas these bacteria exhibit a number of unique low molecular weight glycolipids. Some of these glycolipids cause strong immediate immune responses, while others appear to be potent antigens for induction of an adaptive immune response. This review summarizes data obtained so far on amphiphilic and hydrophobic molecules from spirochetes regarding structure and influence on innate as well as adaptive immune responses."

Vector-borne disease risk can, in many cases, be modeled with high predictive accuracy by using geographic information system approaches because abundances of vectors and pathogen reservoirs often are associated with environmental factors. Spatial risk models for human exposure to vector-borne pathogens, which ideally should have high accuracy for predicting areas of elevated risk without overestimating risk coverage, can be constructed based on epidemiological data or abundance of vectors or infected vectors. We use five bacterial or viral vector-borne diseases occurring in the United States and with pathogen transmission by fleas (plague), ticks (Lyme disease and tularemia), or mosquitoes (dengue and West Nile virus disease) to 1) examine how spatial risk of human exposure to vector-borne pathogens typically is presented to the public health community and public and 2) evaluate the utility of basing spatial risk models on epidemiological data relative to data for arthropod vectors or infected vectors. Recommended future directions for vector-borne disease risk modeling include development of subcounty level spatial risk models combining epidemiological and vector data and the use of simulation or analytical models to assess critical vector abundance thresholds required for enzootic pathogen maintenance."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi must adapt physiologically to two markedly different host milieus and efficiently transit between its mammalian host and arthropod vector during tick feeding. Differential production of lipoproteins is essential for spirochaetes to survive, multiply and migrate within both hosts. Outer-surface protein C (OspC), which is induced during the blood meal, is critical for transmission of Lyme disease spirochaetes by nymphal ticks. Its biological function is poorly understood, however, despite the fact that its crystal structure has been solved. Evidence has accumulated that OspC blocks clearance of spirochaetes following inoculation in skin, and it is thought to do so by facilitating evasion of innate immunity. The study by Liang and co-workers in this edition of Molecular Microbiology extends this work by showing that OspC prevents early elimination and promotes dissemination. Surprisingly, they also show that unrelated borrelial outer-surface lipoproteins can replace these functions in an ospC mutant. They propose that an abundance of lipoprotein(s) is needed to stabilize the borrelial outer membrane against innate defences. This provocative work clearly runs counter to prevailing orthodoxies of bacterial pathogenesis. It also points the way towards future studies that will clarify the 'partially specific' roles of this enigmatic molecule in Lyme disease pathogenesis."

Complex infections with multiple genetic variants of B. burgdorferi occur in mice through multiple exposures to infected ticks or through exposure to ticks infected with multiple variants of B. burgdorferi. Using a combination of cloning and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), B. burgdorferi ospC variation was assessed in serial samples collected from individual P. leucopus during a single transmission season. In individuals with ospC variation, at least seven ospC variants were recognized at each time point. One to four of these variants predominated at each time point; however, the predominant variants seldom remained consistent in an individual mouse throughout the entire sampling period. These results confirmed that mice in southern Maryland were persistently infected with multiple variants of B. burgdorferi throughout the transmission season. However, the presence of multiple ospC variants and the fluctuations in the frequency of these variants indicates that either new ospC variants are regularly introduced to this mouse population and predominate while the existing infections are cleared, or that the variation detected in the genetic profile at different time points reflects a complex mixture of B. burgdorferi populations whose relative frequencies may continually change."

Since then, there have been few studies examining the diversity of Borrelia spp. circulating in seabirds, or the potential interaction between terrestrial and marine disease cycles. To explore these aspects, we tested 402 Ixodes uriae ticks collected from five colonial seabird species by amplification of the flaB gene. Both the average prevalence (26.0%+/-3.9) and diversity of LB spirochetes was high. Phylogenetic analyses grouped marine isolates in two main clades: one associated with B. garinii and another with B. lusitaniae, a genospecies typically associated with lizards. One sequence also clustered most closely with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Prevalence in ticks varied both among seabird species within colonies and among colonies. However, there was no clear association between different Borrelia isolates and a given seabird host species. Our findings indicate that LB spirochetes circulating in the marine system are more diverse than previously described and support the hypothesis that seabirds may be an important component in the global epidemiology and evolution of Lyme disease. Future work should help determine the extent to which isolates are shared between marine and terrestrial systems."

The causative agent is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi species complex, and the hard-shell ticks of the genus Ixodes is responsible for pathogen transmission from animals to humans. The incidence of the disease is increasing year by year and although lyme disease is not fatal, it can affect the skin, heart, nervous, and musculoskeletal system with an impairment of quality of life. The appropriate diagnosis of lyme disease should be promptly treated by antibiotics to prevent late stage of the disease. The choice of antibiotics depends on many factors such as the stage of the disease, the drug efficacy, adverse effects, type of delivery, duration of treatment, and cost. Treatment failure occurs as a result of many reasons, re-infection is possible. The recommended treatment schedule in the Czech Republic is presented."

We analyzed a subset of these genes/proteins that were historically categorized as paralogous gene family 54 (BBA64, BBA65, BBA66, BBA68, BBA69, BBA70, BBA71, and BBA73) and found that the expression of several genes was influenced by the sigma(N)-sigma(S) regulatory cascade at the level of transcription and protein synthesis. Moreover, we established in this and a previous study that BBA65, BBA66, BBA69, BBA71, and BBA73 are temporally expressed during persistent infection of immunocompetent mice, as determined by quantitative real time-PCR of ear tissue, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and by immunoblotting. Correspondingly, BBA65, BBA66, BBA71, and BBA73 proteins were detectable in infectious B. burgdorferi B31 isolates but undetectable in noninfectious isolates. BBA65, BBA66, BBA71, and BBA73 proteins were also found to partition into the Triton X-114 detergent phase and were sensitive to protease treatment of intact cells, indicating that they are membrane associated and surface localized. Lastly, Southern blotting and PCR with specific gene primer/probes for BBA64, BBA65, BBA66, BBA71, and BBA73 suggest that many of these genes are conserved among the B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates and the relapsing-fever Borrelia species. Together, the data presented suggest that these genes may play a part in Borrelia infection and/or pathogenicity that could extend beyond the sensu lato group."

At present, serology remains the main diagnostic tool for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Recently, the PCR technique has been applied for diagnosis of B. burgdorferi s.l., but, until now, a reliable, easy-to-perform and sensitive method has not been described. Here we present a new PCR-based method for the detection of both B. burgdorferi s.l. and Borrelia genospecies DNAs in serum samples collected from patients showing Lyme disease symptoms. Of 265 serum samples of patients included in this study, 7.5% were positive, 1.9% was borderline and 90.6% were negative for antibodies against B. burgdorferi by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. The B. burgdorferi s.l. 16S rRNA gene was detected by PCR in all serum-positive and in two borderline samples. None of the serum-negative samples nor serum samples collected from healthy subjects gave positive PCR reactions. Of PCR-positive serum samples, 50% gave a positive reaction for Borrelia afzelii, 18% for Borrelia garinii and 23% for two Borrelia species. Two samples (9%) were not identified to species level. The new protocol could be considered to be reliable as neither false-positive nor false-negative reactions were recorded, and to be sensitive as it detects DNA from one bacterial cell."

An understanding of disease transmission, clinical manifestations and prevention strategies has been established. With the number of new cases increasing each year, it is important that clinicians are aware of the available treatment options. Most patients respond well to a course of treatment with a recommended antibiotic; however, for those patients who develop post-Lyme disease syndrome, the management is unclear. This review provides an overview of Lyme disease and the recommended treatment options available to physicians."

		"abstract": "Viliuisk encephalomyelitis (VE) is an endemic neurological disease in Northeastern Siberia and generally believed to be a chronic encephalomyelitis of unknown origin. We investigated 17 patients with a clinical diagnosis of VE within the Viliuiski region of Sakha (Yakutian) Republic to explore the core clinical syndrome of chronic VE and subsequently whether VE is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection. We found a chronic myelopathy as the core of the syndrome, often following an acute phase with a meningo-radiculo-neuropathy, suggestive of chronic neuroborreliosis. A search for inflammatory parameters in a larger cohort in blood (39 VE patients and 41 controls) and CSF samples (10 VE patients and 7 controls) excluded an ongoing chronic infection, but revealed evidence for an immunological scar or a chronic inflammatory (\"autoimmune\") response in the CSF. In addition, we detected signs of a previous exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi antigens in a subset of chronic VE patients with positive serological results using ELISA/immunoblot in 54/10% and 22/0% of VE patients and controls, respectively (p values of 0.003/0.034; Fisher's exact test). However, CSF analyses did not show a link between exposure or at least immunological reaction against Borrelia and the risk of suffering from VE. Our data provide the first evidence of the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi or similar pathogens in Northeastern Siberia, but do not support a causative role of these pathogens in the aetiopathogenesis of VE."

These plasmids have also been referred to as mini-chromosomes and essential genetic elements and are integral components of its segmented genome. We have investigated two plasmid maintenance proteins, BBD14 (the replication initiator) and BBD21 (a presumptive ParA orthologue), encoded by the linear plasmid lp17; these proteins are representatives of paralogous families 62 and 32, respectively. We have purified recombinant 6-his-BBD21 and shown it possesses an ATPase activity. 6-his-BBD14 initially could not be overexpressed in Escherichia coli by itself. It was only effectively overproduced in recombinant form through coexpression with other B. burgdorferi proteins and codon optimization. Although the mechanism for increased production through coexpression is not clear, this method holds promise for expression and purification of other B. burgdorferi proteins, a number of which have remained recalcitrant to purification from E. coli. Finally, we present evidence for the physical interaction of BBD14 and BBD21, a feature suggesting that BBD21 and the paralogous family 32 proteins are more likely involved in DNA replication than functioning as simple ParA orthologues as previously surmised based upon sequence homology. Such a role would not preclude a function in plasmid partitioning through interaction with the replication initiator."

The goal of this work was to obtain the recombinant OspC and a fragment of the FlaA protein (f-FlaA) from the Western Siberian Borrelia garinii NT29 isolates and to assess the possibility of their use for the LD diagnosis. Encoding regions of the OspC and f-FlaB genes were amplified using PCR inserted in the pREB expressive vectors and cloned in the E. coli str. BL21 and C-600, respectively. The recombinant OspC and f-FlaA proteins were purified using affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA-sepharose 6A, and their ability to bind serum antibody of patients with Lyme disease was tested using western-blot and ELISA methods. The results of the analyses suggest that these proteins can be considered as promising components for elaboration of diagnostic tests for LD. The prototype of the ELISA diagnostic test was designed on the basis of the OspC and f-FlaA recombinant antigens. This test provides satisfactory parameters of diagnostic specificity (70.0%) and sensitivity (85.0%)."

		"abstract": "Outer surface proteins (Osp) A and C of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi) are selectively produced and of functional significance in the tick vector and mammalian host, respectively. Some studies indicate a simple, reciprocal relationship where the signals and pathways that turn on ospC also turn off ospA. Other studies indicate a more complex regulation where many spirochetes produce both proteins and others produce one of the proteins or neither protein. Here, we have used flow cytometry to characterize ospA and ospC transcript and protein levels in individual bacterial cells grown in culture. The results support a simple, reciprocal model where, at the level of single cells, the transcription of ospC is linked to the repression of ospA. We also demonstrate that under conditions conducive for OspC production, spirochetes display an \"all or none\" response, with some cells displaying high levels of ospC transcription and others demonstrating little or no transcription. Despite the reciprocal regulation of ospA and ospC at the single-cell level, we propose that spirochetes display an array of phenotypes due to stochasticity in the pathways that regulate osp expression and the slow turnover of outer surface proteins."

		"abstract": "Current prophylaxis for infected tick bites consists of personal protective measures directed towards ticks. This study compared the efficacy of a single oral dose of doxycycline with that of a single injection of sustained-release doxycycline in a model of Lyme borreliosis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum infection. Dosages of doxycycline were equilibrated based on previously determined peak plasma levels in mice [oral, 2.4 microg (ml plasma)(-1); sustained release, 1.9 microg (ml plasma)(-1)] determined 8 h after inoculation. In challenge experiments where five Borrelia burgdorferi-infected and five A. phagocytophilum-infected nymphs were used per mouse, only 20 and 30 % of mice were protected from B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum infection, respectively, using oral doxycycline. In contrast, 100 % of mice receiving sustained-release doxycycline were protected from A. phagocytophilum infection, as indicated by real-time PCR of blood samples, quantitative PCR and culture isolation of spleen samples, and protected against B. burgdorferi infection as demonstrated by culture of ear, heart and bladder. Although 15-40 copies of A. phagocytophilum could be amplified from the spleens of mice treated with sustained-release doxycycline, no viable A. phagocytophilum from these spleens could be cultured in HL-60 cells. In contrast, 7/10 mice receiving oral doxycycline were PCR- and culture-positive for A. phagocytophilum, with copy numbers ranging from 800 to 10 000 within the spleen, as determined by quantitative PCR. Other correlates with A. phagocytophilum infection included a significant difference in spleen mass (mean of 110 mg for sustained-release treatment versus a mean of 230 mg for oral treatment) and the number of splenic lymphoid nodules (mean of 8 for sustained-release treatment versus mean of 12.5 for oral doxycycline) as determined by histopathology. These studies indicate that a single injection of a sustained-release formulation antibiotic may offer a viable prophylactic treatment option for multiple infectious agents in patients presenting with tick bites."

Our aim was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of CSF CXCL13 in a cohort of 59 consecutive patients referred to hospital for suspected LNB. Thirty-seven patients were classified as definite LNB and used as the reference standard. Seven were classified as probable, and seven as possible LNB. Eight patients did not fulfil case definitions and were used as controls. At presentation, CSF CXCL13 was elevated in all patients with definite LNB, as compared to a positive CSF B. burgdorferi (Bb) antibody index (AI) in 33 of 37. Pre-treatment sensitivity of elevated CSF [corrected] Bb Al [corrected] was 100 % (95 % CI = 91-100) and 89 % [corrected] (95 % CI = 75-96) respectively (p = 0.053). Among the eight control patients, CSF CXCL13 was normal in five and only slightly elevated in three, and Bb AI was negative in five. Specificity of CSF CXCL13 and Bb AI was similar 63 % (95 % CI = 31-86) (p = 1.0).CSF CXCL13 was elevated in 6/7 patients with probable LNB and 3/7 patients with possible LNB. Bb AI was negative in all these 14 patients. An additional control group consisted of 31 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 11 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, and ten with verified non-Lyme meningitis and high CSF cell count. CSF CXCL13 was slightly elevated in 15 MS patients, and in nine meningitis patients. Mean CSF CXCL13 was higher in definite LNB (3524 ng/g CSF protein) than in MS (27 ng/g) and non-Lyme meningitis (23 ng/g) (p < 0.001). Four months post-treatment CSF CXCL13 was normalized in 82 % of patients with definite LNB, as compared to a negative Bb AI in 10 % (p < 0.001).CSF CXCL13 may be a useful supplement in early diagnosis of acute LNB."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi synthesizes a variety of differentially regulated outer surface lipoproteins in the tick vector and in vertebrate hosts. Among these is OspD, a protein that is highly induced in vitro by conditions that mimic the tick environment. Using genetically engineered strains in which ospD is deleted, we demonstrate that this protein is not required for B. burgdorferi survival and infectivity in either the mouse or the tick. However, examination of both transcript levels and protein expression indicates that OspD expression is limited to a discrete window of time during B. burgdorferi replication within the tick. This time frame corresponds to tick detachment from the host following feeding, and expression of OspD continues during tick digestion of the blood meal but is low or undetectable after the tick has molted. The high level of OspD production correlates to the highest cell densities that B. burgdorferi is known to reach in vivo. Although OspD is nonessential to the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi, the tight regulation of expression suggests a beneficial contribution of OspD to the spirochete during bacterial replication within the tick midgut."

The only clinical cardiac abnormality found was that of second-degree atrioventricular block. At autopsy, a diffuse carditis, characterized by infiltrates of macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils and primarily in an interstitial, endocardial, and perivascular distribution, was found. Serologic testing from blood drawn on the day before his death demonstrated IgG and IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi, confirmed by Western blot.

Tick rearing was performed in incubator at 20 degrees C with 95% relative humidity and 12-hour light/dark photo-period regimen. We found out that adult females fed for 8 +/- 2 days and had a pre-oviposition period lasting for 7 +/- 2 days. The minimum egg incubation period was 1 month with the hatched larvae feeding for 3 +/- 1 days and molting to nymphs 3-4 months thereafter. Meanwhile, the nymphs fed for 4 +/- 1 days and molted to adult 2-3 months thereafter. For future analysis of gene expression profiles in I. persulcatus, we cloned and sequenced the actin gene (a housekeeping gene), and found that it is 92.7% to 98.6% homologous to the published sequences of related ixodid ticks. This laboratory colony of I. persulcatus will facilitate investigations on the role of tick-derived molecules on the transmission of I. persulcatus-borne pathogens and will be important for identification of potential anti-tick vaccine and acaricide target molecules."

		"abstract": "The effectiveness of antibiotic treatment was examined in a mouse model of Lyme borreliosis. Mice were treated with ceftriaxone or saline solution for 1 month, commencing during the early (3 weeks) or chronic (4 months) stages of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Tissues from mice were tested for infection by culture, PCR, xenodiagnosis, and transplantation of allografts at 1 and 3 months after completion of treatment. In addition, tissues were examined for the presence of spirochetes by immunohistochemistry. In contrast to saline solution-treated mice, mice treated with antibiotic were consistently culture negative, but tissues from some of the mice remained PCR positive, and spirochetes could be visualized in collagen-rich tissues. Furthermore, when some of the antibiotic-treated mice were fed on by Ixodes scapularis ticks (xenodiagnosis), spirochetes were acquired by the ticks, as determined based upon PCR results, and ticks from those cohorts transmitted spirochetes to naïve SCID mice, which became PCR positive but culture negative. Results indicated that following antibiotic treatment, mice remained infected with nondividing but infectious spirochetes, particularly when antibiotic treatment was commenced during the chronic stage of infection."

We reviewed our institutional arrhythmia database from January 1988 to January 2007 to identify all patients less than 18 years of age with normal cardiac anatomy and episodes of syncope associated with paroxysmal AV block. Demographic and clinical information was collected. Six patients were identified (Table I). Five of the six patients were female, with an average age of 9.3 +/- 4.4 years. Patients had episodes of syncope for an average of 5.6 +/- 3.3 years prior to diagnosis. All patients had normal physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms. None were on medications known to interfere with AV nodal function, and laboratory evaluation including Lyme titers were negative. Five of the six patients' episodes were atypical for vasovagal syncope (except patient 6). All patients had documented paroxysmal AV block on either inpatient cardiac monitor, Holter monitor, or event recorder at the time of syncope. There was maintenance or acceleration of the sinus rate during episodes of syncope in all patients (mean atrial rate 107 +/- 37 bpm). All six patients had permanent transvenous pacemakers implanted with resolution of symptoms over a mean follow-up of 5.2 +/- 6.3 years. Paroxysmal AV nodal block is a rare finding in pediatric patients, but should be considered as a possible etiology in patients presenting with episodes atypical for vasovagal syncope. Pacemaker therapy prevented future episodes in all six of our patients."

Serum samples were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis antibodies and for Dirofilaria immitis antigen. Blood samples from 273 dogs were also analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species DNA. Based on the owner history and the attending veterinarian's physical examination findings, dogs exhibiting illness compatible with anaplasmosis or borreliosis were considered clinical cases, and their results were compared to the healthy dog population. Antibodies to only A. phagocytophilum were detected in 217 (29%) dogs; to only B. burgdorferi, in 80 (11%) dogs; and seroreactivity to both organisms, in 188 (25%) dogs. Of 89 suspected cases of canine anaplasmosis or borreliosis, A. phagocytophilum or B. burgdorferi antibodies were detected in 22 dogs (25%) and 8 dogs (9%) respectively, whereas antibodies to both organisms were found in 38 dogs (43%). Ehrlichia canis antibodies and D. immitis antigen were each detected in 11 (1.5%) dogs. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was amplified from 7 of 222 (3%) healthy dogs and 19 of 51 (37%) clinical cases. Seroreactivity to both A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi was detected more frequently in suspected cases of anaplasmosis and/or borreliosis than seroreactivity to either organism alone. Based on PCR testing, A. phagocytophilum DNA was more prevalent in suspected cases of anaplasmosis or borreliosis than in healthy dogs from the same region."

In other bacteria, the major target for oxidative damage is DNA as a consequence of the reaction of \"free\" intracellular with ROS through the Fenton reaction. Therefore, cellular defenses in these bacteria are focused on protecting this essential cellular component. This does not seem to be the case for B. burgdorferi. In this chapter, we describe methods that were used to analyze the potential targets for ROS in B. burgdorferi. Surprisingly, membrane lipids (e.g., linoleic and linolenic acids) derived from host are the major target of ROS in the Lyme disease spirochete."

Attempts to understand the genetic factors that allow B. burgdorferi to sense, adapt to, and survive in different environments have been limited by a relatively low transformation rate. Here, we describe a mariner-based transposon system that achieves saturating levels of random mutagenesis in B. burgdorferi. In comparison with allelic exchange, which targets a single locus, transposon mutagenesis can create libraries of mutants encompassing disruptions of all genes. Suitably designed screens or selections of such a library permit the recovery of mutants exhibiting a desired phenotype. The system described here allows rapid identification of the genetic locus responsible for the mutant phenotype. With appropriate modifications, this mariner-based transposon can be adapted to other spirochetes and bacteria with inefficient genetic transformation methods."

In real-time phase-contrast videomicroscopy we were able to measure the speed of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme spirochete, moving back and forth across a platelet to which it was tethered. Its mean crossing speed was 1,636 microm/min (N = 28), maximum, 2800 microm/min (N = 3). This is the fastest speed recorded for a spirochete, and upward of two orders of magnitude above the speed of a human neutrophil, the fastest cell in the body. This alacrity and its interpretation, in an organism with bidirectional motor capacity, may well contribute to difficulties in spirochete clearance by the host."

Reticulo-histiocytoma of the back was later classified as a primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL). A definitive diagnosis of the condition is frequently delayed because of a relative lack of clinical symptoms and difficulties in interpretation of the histologic findings. Indeed, a number of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas have been mislabeled as pseudolymphomas in the past. We present a case of PCFCL that initially demonstrated predominantly small T lymphocytes on histology. These findings were interpreted as an inflammatory pseudolymphomatous reaction. However, small lymphocytes, whether B or T cells, in early lesions of cutaneous B-cell lymphomas should not automatically be considered 'reactive.' Persistent antigenic stimulation of lymphocytes in a neoplastic process or by an antigen, for example, Borrelia burgdorferi, can lead to transformation and cell division with development of large blast cells. In our patient, the initial scarcity of B lymphocytes also led to further diagnostic difficulties. Although the association of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma with Borrelia infection is known, there are still difficulties in differentiating the condition from pseudolymphoma. Such difficulties can in part be ascribed to the morphologic changes such lymphomas can undergo over time. The initially small number of B cells that may be seen at first in PCFCL infiltrates may increase in number in longer-standing lesions. It is also important to recognize that inability to verify monoclonality should not exclude the diagnosis of lymphoma."

		"abstract": "Most vector-borne zoonotic pathogens are transmitted among several host species, but different species vary considerably in their importance to pathogen transmission, at least partially because they vary in their propensity to infect feeding vectors. This propensity is often called realized reservoir competence. Realized reservoir competence is the product of 1) the probability the individual host is infected, i.e., infection prevalence, and 2) the probability that if the host is infected, it will transmit the infection to a feeding vector, or infectivity. Prevalence varies in space and time, whereas infectivity may be a property of the host species. Both prevalence and infectivity are ecologically and epidemiologically important, but measuring them simultaneously is difficult. We present a probabilistic model that separately estimates host infection prevalence and infectivity from data on the infection status of vectors collected from individual hosts, data generally used to measure realized reservoir competence. We then consider how imperfect diagnostic tests (i.e., false negatives and positives) influence these probabilities-estimates of prevalence and infectivity are fairly robust to false negatives, but not to false positives. We thus extend the model to estimate the rate of false positives in order to improve estimates of prevalence and infectivity. We illustrate these methods by reanalyzing data from LoGiudice et al. (2003; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 100: 567-571) on the reservoir competence of ten vertebrate hosts of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. We find that these vertebrate hosts vary both in prevalence and infectivity and that both values are highly, positively correlated among species."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ticks are major vectors for human pathogens, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Tick saliva contains immunosuppressive molecules that facilitate tick feeding and B. burgdorferi infection. We here demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that the Ixodes scapularis salivary protein Salp15 inhibits adaptive immune responses by suppressing human dendritic cell (DC) functions. Salp15 inhibits both Toll-like receptor- and B. burgdorferi-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by DCs and DC-induced T cell activation. Salp15 interacts with DC-SIGN on DCs, which results in activation of the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1. Strikingly, Raf-1 activation by Salp15 leads to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-dependent decrease of IL-6 and TNF-alpha mRNA stability and impaired nucleosome remodeling at the IL-12p35 promoter. These data demonstrate that Salp15 binding to DC-SIGN triggers a novel Raf-1/MEK-dependent signaling pathway acting at both cytokine transcriptional and post-transcriptional level to modulate Toll-like receptor-induced DC activation, which might be instrumental to tick feeding and B. burgdorferi infection, and an important factor in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Insight into the molecular mechanism of immunosuppression by tick salivary proteins might provide innovative strategies to combat Lyme disease and could lead to the development of novel anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agents."

Correlation between results of the ELISA, IFA, and immunoblot for IgM or IgG, when two tests were always compared, one to the other, ranged from r(s) = 0.673 to r(s) = 0.905. In the immunoblot, the highest sensitivity was observed in DbpA and VlsE proteins (76.9% and 84.6%, respectively) in IgG testing of the sera from the patient group of Lyme arthritis. VlsE proteins, together with OspC proteins, were also shown to be useful for IgM antibody detection in erythema migrans patients (up to 44.4% and 53.7% sensitivity, respectively). Our results indicate that both the ELISA and the recombinant immunoblot test were more satisfactory for seroconfirmation of Lyme disease than IFA. Moreover, the reseach confirmed diagnostic value of the in-vivo expressed proteins (VlsE and DbpA), which might have the potential to play an important role in improving whole-cell antigen-based testing."

		"abstract": "An investigation of the risk of human tick infestation, together with the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. infection, was conducted in a sylvatic habitat in western Germany to provide data needed for future risk-benefit evaluations of acaricides used for clothing impregnation. Additionally, data were collected on behavioural changes in Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.-infected adult female I. ricinus ticks and the possible impact of such changes on host-finding efficacy. The risk of I. ricinus-infestation was determined by collecting from the protective clothing of volunteers and by dragging in known tick-infested sites in the Kühkopf Mountain area, Koblenz, Germany, from June through October 2006. The overall tick infestation rate per person per hour was 7.4+/-5.5, with the following sex- and stage-specific differences: males 0.32+/-0.37, females 1.1+/-1.2, nymphs 3.6+/-4.4, larvae 2.4+/-3.5. Concurrent dragging revealed an average 19.4+/-16.2 times higher infestation rate as well as a markedly lower infection rate with borreliae in adult I. ricinus ticks when compared to ticks collected from exposed human volunteers. Although the difference in infection rates was statistically significant (P<0.023) only in adult female ticks, our data indicate that B. burgdorferi s.l. infection may increase host-finding efficacy in adult I. ricinus. The overall exposure risk was 1.0 B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected ticks per person per hour of exposure, or 0.25 ticks per 100 m walking distance in the study area."

		"abstract": "Arthropod bites remain a major cause of patient morbidity. These bites can cause local or systemic effects that may be infectious or inflammatory in nature. Arthropods, notably insects and arachnids, are vectors of potentially serious ailments including malaria, West Nile virus, dengue, and Lyme disease. Measures to curtail the impact of insect bites are important in the worldwide public health effort to safely protect patients and prevent the spread of disease. The history of insect repellent (IR) lends insight into some of the current scientific strategies behind newer products. Active ingredients of currently available IRs include N,N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide (DEET), botanicals, citronella, and, the newest agent, picaridin. Currently, the Environmental Protection Agency's registered IR ingredients approved for application to the skin include DEET, picaridin, MGK-326, MGK-264, IR3535, oil of citronella, and oil of lemon eucalyptus. DEET has reigned as the most efficacious and broadly used IR for the last 6 decades, with a strong safety record and excellent protection against ticks, mosquitoes, and other arthropods. Newer agents, like picaridin and natural products such as oil of lemon eucalyptus are becoming increasingly popular because of their low toxicity, comparable efficacy, and customer approval. Various characteristics and individual product advantages may lead physicians to recommend one agent over another."

We assessed the utility of complement and its split products as markers of Lyme disease in patients shortly after a tick bite. Thirty-one consecutive acute Lyme disease patients, 14 with and 17 without erythema migrans (EM) skin rash, seen by a physician within 96 h of a tick bite were matched with 24 consecutive tick bite patients without Lyme disease symptoms and 46 healthy control subjects. Complement and split products measured included factor B, Bb, C4, C3c, C3a(des Arg), C4a(des Arg), C1q- and C3d-containing immune complexes, and C2. C2, C4, C3 and factor B levels were within normal ranges in all groups. C3a and C4a levels were significantly higher in acute Lyme disease patients than in tick bite and healthy control groups (both p < 0.001). All acute Lyme disease patients, regardless of EM, had elevated levels of C3a or C4a. Few tick bite controls had elevated levels of C3a (2/20) or C4a (5/24) and only 1 of the healthy control subjects had elevated C3a (0/46) or C4a (1/32). These findings suggest that C3a and C4a may be useful markers of Lyme disease in patients seen shortly after tick bite, even in those without EM."

A total of 2832 host-seeking Ixodes ricinus (2660 nymphs and 172 adults) were collected, with maximal abundance in June and a minor second increase in abundance in August. The spatial and temporal variation in tick abundance was closely related to the air temperature, relative humidity, soil water content and specific vegetation type. Increases in tick abundances in individual habitats were most likely caused by climate change and/or anthropogenic interventions such as increased numbers of wild boar, a host of I. ricinus. When combined with data from previous investigations a correlation of plant communities with six semi-qualitative tick abundance categories (ranging from 'no ticks' to 'very high tick abundance') was revealed, and GIS analysis indicated that 56.5% of the 'Siebengebirge' is made up of plant communities belonging to the three highest tick abundance categories. Therefore, the risk of visitors in the 'Siebengebirge' of being exposed to tick bites and being infected by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato had increased."

Both, clinical symptoms and radiological findings disappeared within 2 months after treatment. Borrelia burgdorferi specific IgM and IgG in CSF and IgG in serum became negative between 6 and 12 months after diagnosis. We show that neuroborreliosis at an early stage may present only with moderate neurological deficits and that at this stage MRI reveals distinct cerebral lesions which might even precede clinical manifestation. Thus, early diagnosis and treatment of neuroborreliosis may prevent persistent neurologic lesions."

The first mosquito to be sequenced was Anopheles gambiae, the vector for Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Further mosquitoes have followed: Aedes aegypti (yellow fever and dengue fever vector) and Culex pipiens (lymphatic filariasis and West Nile fever). Species that are currently in sequencing include the body louse Pediculus humanus (Typhus vector), the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus (Chagas disease vector) and the tick Ixodes scapularis (Lyme disease vector). The motivations for sequencing vector genomes are to further understand vector biology, with an eye on developing new control strategies (for example novel chemical attractants or repellents) or understanding the limitations of current strategies (for example the mechanism of insecticide resistance); to analyse the mechanisms driving their evolution; and to perform an exhaustive analysis of the gene repertory. The proliferation of genomic data creates the need for efficient and accessible storage. We present VectorBase, a genomic resource centre that is both involved in the annotation of vector genomes and act as a portal for access to the genomic information (http://www.vectorbase.org)."

Effectiveness of these measures has not been conclusively demonstrated. The aim of our case-control study was to assess the effectiveness of personal preventive measures in a highly disease-endemic area. Case-patients were persons with LD reported to Connecticut's Department of Public Health and classified as having definite, possible, or unlikely LD. Age-matched controls without LD were identified. Study participants were interviewed to assess the practice of preventive measures and to obtain information on occupational and recreational risk factors. Use of protective clothing was 40% effective; routine use of tick repellents on skin or clothing was 20% effective. Checking one's body for ticks and spraying property with acaricides were not effective. We concluded that use of protective clothing and of tick repellents (on skin or clothing) are effective in preventing LD."

Recent studies have revealed that some Erp proteins can serve as bacterial adhesins, binding host proteins such as the complement regulator factor H and the extracellular matrix component laminin. These results suggest that Erp proteins play roles in multiple aspects of mammalian infection."

Recent finding of ospE genes also in B. garinii isolates has raised the question whether, under in vivo-conditions, B. garinii also expresses OspE proteins and consequently induces an antibody response. We set up an IgG ELISA by using recombinant OspE as an antigen. Sixty percent of acute and 64% of convalescent 25 erythema migrans patient samples were positive for anti-OspE antibodies. Anti-OspE antibodies were also found in the sera (83.6%) and cerebrospinal fluids (36%) of patients with neuroborreliosis. Since B. garinii is the major causative agent of neuroborreliosis, the result suggests that OspE is expressed by B. garinii in vivo. Of the 10 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans patients, 80% had anti-OspE antibodies. Anti-OspE antibody positive sera inhibited factor H binding to Borrelia more efficiently than normal control sera (65% vs. 33.7%). Our results indicate that Borrelia spirochetes, including B. garinii, can induce the production of anti-OspE antibodies. This implies that OspE protein is produced in vivo by B. garinii possibly enabling it to escape complement and cause a CNS infection."

The prevalence of birds carrying I. scapularis ticks (mostly nymphs) was 0.35% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.30 to 0.42), but a nested study by experienced observers suggested a more realistic infestation prevalence of 2.2% (95% CI = 1.18 to 3.73). The mean infestation intensity was 1.66 per bird. Overall, 15.4% of I. scapularis nymphs (95% CI = 10.7 to 20.9) were PCR positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, but only 8% (95% CI = 3.8 to 15.1) were positive when excluding nymphs collected at Long Point, Ontario, where B. burgdorferi is endemic. A wide range of ospC and rrs-rrl intergenic spacer alleles of B. burgdorferi were identified in infected ticks, including those associated with disseminated Lyme disease and alleles that are rare in the northeastern United States. Overall, 1.4[corrected]% (95% CI = 0.3 [corrected] to 0.41) of I. scapularis nymphs were PCR positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum. We estimate that migratory birds disperse 50 million to 175 million I. scapularis ticks across Canada each spring, implicating migratory birds as possibly significant in I. scapularis range expansion in Canada. However, infrequent larvae and the low infection prevalence in ticks carried by the birds raise questions as to how B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum become endemic in any tick populations established by bird-transported ticks."

During experimental infections, the lack of these sensors or of their signaling molecules should lead to a deficient immune response. We found out that MyD88, the major adaptor of the Toll/interleukin-1 (Toll/IL-1) receptor signaling pathway, can actually act as a negative regulator of B-cell function in some settings. MyD88-deficient mice infected by Borrelia burgdorferi developed extreme hypergammaglobulinemia compared to wild-type animals, with high levels of immunoglobulin M (IgM) autoantibodies. In vivo, cell transfer experiments and cell blocking assays showed that this phenotype was not linked to the absence of MyD88 in B cells but rather to CD4 T-cell and likely dendritic cell dysfunctions leading to a Th1-to-Th2 cytokine switch. In addition, our results suggest a relative defect in the Ig class switch recombination process, since MyD88 knockout mice developed mostly IgM antibodies. Collectively, these data emphasize the complex role of the Toll/IL-1 receptor pathway in tuning the immune response against infection and avoiding autoimmunity."

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to begin to characterise the pharmacodynamic parameters of single-dose doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease following a tick bite. Based on limited data from published human and murine studies, it was found that there is a direct correlation between efficacy rate and the area under the time-concentration of free antibiotic curve divided by the minimum inhibitory concentration (fAUC/MIC) (R(2)=0.74, using Pearson correlation), but not the maximum concentration of free drug in serum divided by the MIC (fC(max)/MIC) or the time that the free drug concentration remains above the MIC (fT>MIC). To determine the possible implications of these findings for other antimicrobials, it was assumed that the pharmacodynamic properties of doxycycline would be pertinent to azithromycin, an antibiotic whose activity is known to correlate with AUC/MIC. By making such an extrapolation and using pharmacokinetic modelling with conservative assumptions on MIC values against Borrelia burgdorferi, it is hypothesised that a single 500 mg dose of azithromycin in humans should have comparable efficacy to doxycycline for the prevention of Lyme disease. Additional experimental studies are needed to clarify more precisely the pharmacodynamic properties of doxycycline and to validate the accuracy of this hypothesis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is a vector-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted in the United States by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes spp.). LD is most commonly found in the northeastern, mid-Atlantic, and north-central regions of the United States. In 2005, New Jersey reported 38.6 LD cases per 100,000 population, the third-highest incidence in the United States after Delaware and Connecticut. Since 1980, New Jersey has mandated that health-care providers and clinical laboratories report all LD cases to local health departments, which investigate these reports to confirm that they meet the national surveillance case definition. Reports from health-care providers typically include exposure and clinical information needed for case confirmation. In contrast, reports from laboratories do not contain exposure and clinical information, and local health departments must follow up with health-care providers to obtain the missing information needed to confirm a case for surveillance purposes. In 2002, New Jersey expanded its paper-based laboratory reporting system to include electronic laboratory-reporting (ELR) for all laboratory-reportable diseases. During the next 4 years, New Jersey's local health departments noted that the number of ELR reports for LD and the time needed to handle them had begun to impede the departments' abilities to address other public health priorities. In 2006, to assess these concerns, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services evaluated the state's LD surveillance system. This report summarizes the results of that evaluation, which determined that during 2001-2004, the total annual number of LD reports increased nearly fivefold (from 2,460 in 2001 to 11,957 in 2004), but confirmed reports increased only 18% (from 2,371 in 2001 to 2,791 in 2004). ELR represented 51% of reports received during 2001-2006, but only 29% were confirmed upon investigation. These results illustrate the difficulties associated with ELR reporting of LD in New Jersey, especially the use of resources needed to address other public health problems. Other states with similar difficulties might need to reevaluate the resources used to confirm electronically reported LD and other notifiable diseases."

Sixty-two of 66 cultures obtained from biopsies were identified as B. afzelii by PCR. A total of 175 serially collected serum samples were tested by using two different sets of commercial assays: Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG and Enzygnost Borreliosis IgM (DADE Behring, Marburg, Germany) and LIAISON Borrelia IgG and IgM (Diasorin, Saluggia, Italy). Considering only samples obtained at first presentation when EM was clinically evident, 49/66 patients (72.4%) were IgG or IgM positive by Enzygnost, whereas 33/66 (50.0%) patients were IgG or IgM positive by LIAISON. Taking into account the follow-up period, eight patients sero-converted for IgG or IgM by Enzygnost and four by LIAISON. Similar and very good specificity values were obtained by all methods. Testing sera obtained from blood donors (n = 300) and from patients suffering from some of the most common biological conditions possibly resulting in false-positive reactivity in Lyme disease serology (n = 100) showed that Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG was the more specific (98.3%), followed by LIAISON Borrelia IgG (96.5%), and considering IgM tests, Enzygnost Borreliosis IgM showed to be 95.3%% specific, whereas the LIAISON Borrelia IgM was 92.8% specific. Recombinant VlsE antigens obtained from all three B.burgdorferi genospecies pathogenic to humans (included in Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG) greatly improved serodiagnosis of Lyme disease."

As an extracellular pathogen, B. burgdorferi resides primarily in the ECM and connective tissues and between host cells during mammalian infection. The interactions of B. burgdorferi with these host ligands mediated by DbpA and DbpB potentially influence various aspects of infection. Here, we show that both DbpA and DbpB are critical for the overall virulence of B. burgdorferi in the murine host. Disruption of the dbpBA locus led to nearly a 10(4)-fold increase in the 50% infectious dose (ID50). Complementation of the mutant with either dbpA or dbpB reduced the ID50 from over 10(4) to roughly 10(3) organisms. Deletion of the dbpBA locus affected colonization in all tissues of infected mice. The lack of dbpA alone precluded the pathogen from colonizing the heart tissue, and B. burgdorferi deficient for DbpB was recovered only from 42% of the heart specimens of infected mice. Although B. burgdorferi lacking either dbpA or dbpB was consistently grown from joint specimens of almost all infected mice, it generated bacterial loads significantly lower than the control. The deficiency in either DbpA or DbpB did not reduce the bacterial load in skin, but lack of both significantly did. Taken together, the study results indicate that neither DbpA nor DbpB is essential for mammalian infection but that both are critical for the overall virulence of B. burgdorferi."

After unsuccessful therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone, indomethacin and acetazolamide, 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) was injected via the pars plana. Visual acuity improved to 1.0 and macular thickness recovered over 1 month. No changes were found in intraocular pressure. No recurrence of macular edema was seen after 2 years. IVTA can restore visual acuity and reduce macular thickness in macular edema caused by Lyme disease. However, since borreliosis is a systemic disease, previous systemic antibiotic treatment is recommended."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a flat-wave, motile spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Motility is provided by periplasmic flagella (PFs) located between the cell cylinder and an outer membrane sheath. The structure of these PFs, which are composed of a basal body, a hook, and a filament, is similar to the structure of flagella of other bacteria. To determine if hook formation influences flagellin gene transcription in B. burgdorferi, we inactivated the hook structural gene flgE by targeted mutagenesis. In many bacteria, completion of the hook structure serves as a checkpoint for transcriptional control of flagellum synthesis and other chemotaxis and motility genes. Specifically, the hook allows secretion of the anti-sigma factor FlgM and concomitant late gene transcription promoted by sigma28. However, the control of B. burgdorferi PF synthesis differs from the control of flagellum synthesis in other bacteria; the gene encoding sigma28 is not present in the genome of B. burgdorferi, nor are any sigma28 promoter recognition sequences associated with the motility genes. We found that B. burgdorferi flgE mutants lacked PFs, were rod shaped, and were nonmotile, which substantiates previous evidence that PFs are involved in both cell morphology and motility. Although most motility and chemotaxis gene products accumulated at wild-type levels in the absence of FlgE, mutant cells had markedly decreased levels of the flagellar filament proteins FlaA and FlaB. Further analyses showed that the reduction in the levels of flagellin proteins in the spirochetes lacking FlgE was mediated at the posttranscriptional level. Taken together, our results indicate that in B. burgdorferi, the completion of the hook does not serve as a checkpoint for transcriptional regulation of flagellum synthesis. In addition, we also present evidence that the hook protein in B. burgdorferi forms a high-molecular-weight complex and that formation of this complex occurs in the periplasmic space."

Disease susceptibility is associated with the HLA alleles DRB1*0101, 0401, 0402, 0404, 0405 and DRB5*0101, and all these MHC molecules bind the Bb epitope OspA(163-175.) However, not all patients have a proliferative response to this epitope. To identify other possible Bb epitopes involved in this disease process, the algorithm TEPITOPE was used to scan 17 immunogenic Bb proteins for potential T cell epitopes with a refractory arthritis-associated MHC binding profile, and the Bb proteome was searched for peptides with sequence homology to OspA(165-173). Sixteen promising T epitopes were identified and their MHC binding profiles to 13 MHC molecules were verified using in vitro MHC/peptide binding assays. One peptide, BBK32(392-404), had a strong refractory arthritis-associated MHC binding profile, and another GK(297-306) shared sequence homology to OspA(165-173). However, patient cells did not proliferate in response to either peptide making it highly unlikely they were involved in a refractory course. A comparison of the in silico and in vitro results revealed that TEPITOPE correctly predicted 74% of the in vitro binding peptides, but it incorrectly predicted that 44% of the in vitrononbinding peptides would bind. For a particular MHC molecule, concordance between the in silico and in vitro results varied anywhere between 33% and 100%. Therefore, while additional Bb epitopes may be involved in the development of antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, recognition of OspA(163-175) remains the only known Bb epitope associated with this disease course."

		"abstract": "The bba64 (P35) gene of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, encodes a surface-exposed lipoprotein. The expression of bba64 in vitro is tightly regulated and dependent on several environmental factors. In nature, its expression is induced in the tick vector during feeding and maintained during infection of the vertebrate host. The pattern of expression of bba64 suggests that it imparts a critical function to the pathogen. A previous study has shown that the expression of bba64 is down-regulated in the absence of RpoS, suggesting that the alternative sigma factor may be involved in its expression. A DNA-binding protein has also been shown to specifically recognize a sequence in the 5' regulatory region of the gene. Therefore, the contribution of these putative determinants to the differential expression of bba64 was investigated. The role of RpoS was critically evaluated by genetic complementation of the rpoS mutant using a chromosomally targeted copy of the wild-type gene. The results confirm that RpoS is indeed required for the expression of bba64. The role of the upstream DNA-binding site was examined using bba64 promoter-gfp transcriptional fusions in a shuttle vector. The DNA-binding site was studied by targeting mutations to an inverted repeat sequence (IRS), the most prominent feature within the binding site, as well as by deletion of the entire sequence upstream of the basal promoter. Quantitative assessment of gene expression demonstrated that neither the IRS nor the sequence upstream of the promoter was essential for expression. Moreover, the expression of the reporter (GFP) appeared to remain RpoS-dependent in all cases, based on the co-expression of GFP and OspC in a subpopulation of spirochaetes and the selective expression of GFP in the stationary phase. Collectively, the data indicate that RpoS is the sole determinant of differential bba64 expression in cultured spirochaetes."

Analysis of the B. burgdorferi transcriptome in vivo indicates that the bb0365 gene is markedly induced as spirochetes enter the feeding ticks from infected mice. To understand the importance of the bb0365 gene product in the spirochete life cycle, we inactivated this gene in an infectious isolate of B. burgdorferi B31. BB0365-deficient spirochetes were fully pathogenic in mice and survived in diverse murine tissues. When naive ticks engorged on spirochete-infected mice, the B. burgdorferi bb0365 mutant entered ticks but had a markedly decreased survival rate compared with wild type B. burgdorferi. BB0365 therefore is not necessary for B. burgdorferi persistence in the vertebrate host but is required for survival of the Lyme disease agent within the feeding arthropod vector, and strategies for interfering with this gene may potentially interrupt the B. burgdorferi life cycle."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans (EM) is caused primarily by Borrelia afzelii in Europe and solely by Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States. B. burgdorferi infection in the United States has previously been associated with faster expansion of EM lesions and with more associated symptoms, compared with B. afzelii infection in Europe. However, reasons for these differences are not yet known. We determined the Borrelia species infecting 67 US or Austrian patients with EM. The clinical pictures and chemokine and cytokine mRNA levels in lesional skin were then compared in the 19 B. burgdorferi-infected US patients and the 37 B. afzelii-infected Austrian patients, the 2 largest groups. The 19 B. burgdorferi-infected US patients had faster-expanding EM lesions and a median of 4 associated signs and symptoms, whereas the 37 B. afzelii-infected Austrian patients had slower-expanding lesions and usually did not experience associated symptoms. Compared with the EM lesions of B. afzelii-infected Austrian patients, those of B. burgdorferi-infected US patients had significantly higher mRNA levels of chemokines associated with activation of macrophages, including chemoattractants for neutrophils (CXCL1), macrophages (CCL3 and CCL4), and T helper 1 cells (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11). In addition, compared with the EM lesions of Austrian patients, the EM lesions of US patients tended to have higher mRNA levels of the macrophage-associated proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha, and they had significantly higher mRNA expression of the antiinflammatory cytokines interleukin 10 and transforming growth factor beta. The EM lesions of B. burgdorferi-infected US patients expanded faster, were associated with more symptoms, and had higher mRNA levels of macrophage-associated chemokines and cytokines than did the EM lesions of B. afzelii-infected Austrian patients."

		"abstract": "Lyme arthritis results from colonization of joints by Borrelia burgdorferi and the ensuing host response. Using gene array-based differential analysis of B. burgdorferi gene expression and quantitative reverse trancription-polymerase chain reaction, we identified two paralogous spirochete genes, bmpA and bmpB, that are preferentially up-regulated in mouse joints compared with other organs. Transfer of affinity-purified antibodies against either BmpA or BmpB into B. burgdorferi-infected mice selectively reduced spirochete numbers and inflammation in the joints. B. burgdorferi lacking bmpA/B were therefore generated to further explore the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi lacking bmpA/B were infectious in mice, but unable to persist in the joints, and they failed to induce severe arthritis. Complementation of the mutant spirochetes with a wild-type copy of the bmpA and bmpB genes partially restored the original phenotype. These data delineate a role for differentially produced B. burgdorferi antigens in spirochete colonization of mouse joints, and suggest new strategies for the treatment of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Host complement is widely distributed throughout mammalian body fluids and can be activated immediately as part of the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), is naturally resistant to that innate immune defense system of its hosts. One resistance mechanism appears to involve binding fluid-phase regulators of complement to distinct borrelial outer surface molecules known as CRASPs (complement regulator acquiring surface proteins). Using sensitive molecular biology techniques, expression patterns of all three classes of genes encoding the CRASPs of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (BbCRASPs) have been analyzed throughout the natural tick-mammal infection cycle. Each class shows a different expression profile in vivo and the results are summarized herein. Studies on the expression of B. burgdorferi genes using animal models of infection have advanced our knowledge on the ability of the causative agent to circumvent innate immune defenses, the contributions of CRASPs to spirochete infectivity, and the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

Out of 500 persons, 65 (13%) were positive for B burgdorferi specific lgG Females showed higher positivity rate as compared to males (15.86% vs 10.95%). Higher prevalence rate was observed in the age group of 15-30 years in both sexes (11.48% in male and 18.69% in female). Arunachal Pradesh showed higher seroprevalence rate (17.8%) as compared to other North-Eastern states (8.46-9.6%).

Part of the data at the commune level will be obtained from the Polish communicable disease surveillance system and the Central Statistical Office, and part will be obtained using GIS tools from maps prepared by diverse institutions. The outcome studied will be TBE cases assigned to commune of residence or to place of exposure. The explanatory variables will be: land use categories (percent of commune area and their border length), meteorological variables (temperatures, rainfall), socio-economic status of communes (income per capita, unemployment rate), and Lyme borreliosis incidence (as a complex indicator of tick activity and human to tick exposure)."

However, recent epidemiologic history and presence of primary skin lesion facilitate diagnosis in most patients at this stage of the infection. Secondly, insufficient antibiotic treatment of EM may halt development of humoral response without total eradication of the pathogen, which may result in the relapse of arthritis without detectable anti-B. burgdorferi s.l. antibodies for up to several months later--a rather rare phenomenon, which, however, must be taken into consideration in patients with a history of treated EM. A fe cases of seronegative Lyme arthritis not related to previous antibiotherapy have been reported, but i seems an extremely rare condition, and, if suspected, should be confirmed by histopathologic or molecular examination of the material from the affected joint."

Elimination of the pathogen is an effective treatment method in a great majority of patients and can be achieved by a number of antibiotic regimens of confirmed efficacy. Antibiotic therapy lasting for 2 to 4 weeks enables eradication of the infection, followed by resolution of arthritis within weeks to months. If insufficient, the course of therapy may be repeated up to 3 times in a few months' intervals, although effectiveness of repeated treatment is not so well confirmed and probably small. Further symptoms, persisting in spite of proper antibiotherapy, typically are not caused by ongoing infection, but rather by autoimmune phenomena or persistent damage to the joint, so further administration of antibiotics in such patients seems of no benefit."

Cerebrospinal fluid was clear with negative Borrelia Burgdorferi IgG and IgM. Herpes simplex, mycoplasma, coxiella, anaplasma, cryptococcus and hepatitis B were all negative. No oligoclonal bands were detected. Quick improvement ensued after she was given IV Ceftriaxone for 7 days. The patient was discharged on the 8(th) day in stable condition. She continued on doxycycline for 21 days. Transverse myelitis should be included in the differential diagnosis of any patient presenting with acute or subacute myelopathy in association with localized contrast enhancement in the spinal cord especially if flu-like prodromal symptoms were reported. Lyme disease serology is indicated in patients with neurological symptoms keeping in mind that dissociation in Lyme antibody titers between the blood and the CSF is possible."

		"abstract": "Serological diagnosis of Lyme disease may be complicated by antigenic differences between infecting organisms and those used as test references. Accordingly, it would be helpful to include antigens whose sequences are well conserved by a broad range of Lyme disease spirochetes. In the present study, line blot analyses were performed using recombinant complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 (BbCRASP-2) from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 and serum samples from human Lyme disease patients from throughout the United States and Germany. The results indicated that a large proportion of the patients had produced antibodies recognizing recombinant BbCRASP-2. In addition, Lyme disease spirochetes isolated from across North America and Europe were found to contain genes encoding proteins with high degrees of similarity to the B. burgdorferi type strain B31 BbCRASP-2, consistent with the high percentage of serologically positive patients. These data indicate that BbCRASP-2 may be valuable for use in a widely effective serological assay."

He could not remember neither a tick bite nor a local erythematous skin lesion. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis was based on intrathecal production of specifics antibodies. Furthermore, the CSF/blood glucose ratio was decreased (0.14), which was rarely described. Cranial MRI showed left capsulothalamic inflammation and a vasculitis. The patient was successfully treated by ceftriaxone. Neuroborreliosis should be considered in all children with stroke-like episode, even in the absence of a history of a tick bite."

This suggested a requirement for lymphocytes in the development of subacute Lyme arthritis in TLR2(-/-) mice, a feature not commonly associated with this arthritis. The increased pathology of B. burgdorferi-infected TLR2(-/-) mice was also accompanied by an increase in mononuclear cell infiltration. In this study, T cells were found to be responsible for the increase in mononuclear cells in infected TLR2(-/-) C3H mice. Accordingly, transcripts for the IFN-inducible T cell chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were greatly enhanced in joint tissue from TLR2(-/-) mice, as were transcripts for a prototypical IFN-inducible gene IFN-gamma-induced GTPase (igtp). Treatment of murine synovial cells with sonicated B. burgdorferi resulted in induction of transcripts for chemokines and other IFN-inducible genes, irrespective of the presence of TLR2. The presence of T lymphocytes greatly enhanced the transcriptional response of synovial cells. These results suggest that the increased inflammatory cell infiltration in TLR2(-/-) C3H mice is the result of localized overproduction of T cell attracting chemokines."

Control strategies to protect public health regularly fail, due in part to the tendency to focus on a single host species assumed to be the primary reservoir for a pathogen. Here, we present evidence that a diverse set of species can play an important role in determining disease risk to humans using Lyme disease as a model. Host-targeted public health strategies to control the Lyme disease epidemic in North America have focused on interrupting Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) transmission between blacklegged ticks and the putative dominant reservoir species, white-footed mice. However, B. burgdorferi ss infects more than a dozen vertebrate species, any of which could transmit the pathogen to feeding ticks and increase the density of infected ticks and Lyme disease risk. Using genetic and ecological data, we demonstrate that mice are neither the primary host for ticks nor the primary reservoir for B. burgdorferi ss, feeding 10% of all ticks and 25% of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Inconspicuous shrews feed 35% of all ticks and 55% of infected ticks. Because several important host species influence Lyme disease risk, interventions directed at a multiple host species will be required to control this epidemic."

Antibody to the C6 peptide is highly specific for B. burgdorferi and declines following treatment of dogs and humans exposed to B. burgdorferi. A quantitative assay for determining C6 antibody levels was developed and used to measure changes in antibody levels following antibiotic treatment of B. burgdorferi antibody-positive nonclinical dogs. One hundred thirty-two client-owned dogs were used in the study; 64 were negative, 53 of 68 positive animals received treatment, and 15 were untreated controls. Test sera were collected at 3, 6, and 12 months from seropositive dogs receiving treatment and untreated controls. Dogs in the treated group were assigned to moderate-to-high (> or =29 U/ml)- and low (<29 U/ml)-C6-level groups because the change in the C6 level after treatment was dependent on the level prior to treatment. There were significant declines in the 30 dogs with moderate-to-high initial C6 levels that exceeded the maximal declines of the untreated control dogs in all cases at 6 months (16 data points) and 12 months (29 data points) posttreatment. There was little change in C6 level following antibiotic therapy in the 23 dogs with low initial C6 levels. The quantitative C6 antibody test can be used to measure changes in C6 antibody levels following treatment of antibody-positive nonclinical dogs."

Invasive plants and animals such as Scotch broom, zebra mussels, and gypsy moths continue to cause environmental damage and economic losses in agriculture and forestry. Rodents transmit diseases and cause major pre- and postharvest losses, especially in less affluent countries. Each of these problems might benefit from the developing field of Genetic Pest Management that is conceptually based on principles of evolutionary biology. This article briefly describes the history of this field, new molecular tools in this field, and potential applications of those tools. There will be a need for evolutionary biologists to interact with researchers and practitioners in a variety of other fields to determine the most appropriate targets for genetic pest management, the most appropriate methods for specific targets, and the potential of natural selection to diminish the effectiveness of genetic pest management. In addition to producing environmentally sustainable pest management solutions, research efforts in this area could lead to new insights about the evolution of selfish genetic elements in natural systems and will provide students with the opportunity to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the role of evolutionary biology in solving societal problems."

Pericarditis in lupus erythematosus and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, myocarditis in HIV infection and lyme disease are examples of cardiac manifestations of internal diseases. The pathogenetic causes can be manifold, such as direct cytotoxic effects in HIV or Borrelia burgdorferi infections, induced vasculitis and local activation of coagulation factors as in lupus erythematosus or chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Improved treatment options have led to more long-lasting courses of internal diseases, such as in infectious diseases, lupus erythematosus and chronic inflammatory bowel disease, thus cardiovascular complications such as pericarditis and myocarditis gain increasing importance as a consequence of chronic disease and therapy-related damage."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, undergoes rapid adaptive gene expression in response to environmental signals encountered during different stages of its life cycle in the arthropod vector or the mammalian host. Among all the plasmid-encoded genes of B. burgdorferi, several linear plasmid 54 (lp54)-encoded open reading frames (ORFs) exhibit the greatest differential expression in response to mammalian host-specific temperature, pH, and other uncharacterized signals. These ORFs include members of the paralogous gene family 54 (pgf 54), such as BBA64, BBA65, and BBA66, present on lp54. In an attempt to correlate transcriptional up-regulation of these pgf 54 members to their role in infectivity, we inactivated BBA64 and characterized the phenotype of this mutant both in vitro and in vivo. There were no major differences in the protein profiles between the BBA64 mutant and the control strains, while immunoblot analysis indicated that inactivation of BBA64 resulted in increased levels of BBA65. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the ability of the BBA64 mutant to infect C3H/HeN mice compared to that of its parental or complemented control strains as determined by culturing of viable spirochetes from infected tissues. However, enumeration of spirochetes using quantitative real-time PCR revealed tissue-specific differences, suggesting a minimal role for BBA64 in the survival of B. burgdorferi in select tissues. Infectivity analysis of the BBA64 mutant suggests that B. burgdorferi may utilize multiple determinants to establish infection in mammalian hosts."

Given the pronounced strain structure of B. burgdorferi in the northeastern United States, we asked whether the fitness of the different genotypes varies among susceptible vertebrate hosts. The transmission dynamics of two genetically divergent human isolates of B. burgdorferi, BL206 and B348, were analyzed experimentally in white-footed mice and in C3H/HeNCrl mice over a time period of almost 3 months. We found that the initially high transmission efficiency from white-footed mice to ticks declined sharply for isolate B348 but remained considerably high for isolate BL206. In contrast, in C3H/HeNCrl mice, high transmission efficiency persisted for both isolates. Our findings provide proof-of-principle evidence for intrinsic fitness variation of B. burgdorferi strains in vertebrate host species, perhaps indicating the beginnings of adaptive radiation."

A dysfunctional synergism with other predisposing and contributing factors may contribute to autism spectrum disorders by provoking innate and adaptive immune reactions to cause and perpetuate effects in susceptible individuals that result in inflammation, molecular mimicry, kynurenine pathway changes, increased quinolinic acid and decreased serotonin, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity that impair the development of the amygdala and other neural structures and neural networks resulting in a partial Klüver-Bucy Syndrome and other deficits resulting in autism spectrum disorders and/or exacerbating autism spectrum disorders from other causes throughout life. Support for this hypothesis includes multiple cases of mothers with Lyme disease and children with autism spectrum disorders; fetal neurological abnormalities associated with tick-borne diseases; similarities between tick-borne diseases and autism spectrum disorder regarding symptoms, pathophysiology, immune reactivity, temporal lobe pathology, and brain imaging data; positive reactivity in several studies with autistic spectrum disorder patients for Borrelia burgdorferi (22%, 26% and 20-30%) and 58% for mycoplasma; similar geographic distribution and improvement in autistic symptoms from antibiotic treatment. It is imperative to research these and all possible causes of autism spectrum disorders in order to prevent every preventable case and treat every treatable case until this disease has been eliminated from humanity."

Here we report that ingested B. burgdorferi induces significantly greater transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes than do lysates and that live B. burgdorferi, but not B. burgdorferi lysate, is avidly internalized by monocytes, where the bacteria are completely degraded within phagolysosomes. In the course of these experiments, we discovered that live B. burgdorferi also induced a dose-dependent decrease in monocytes but not a decrease in dendritic cells or T cells and that the monocyte population displayed morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Particularly noteworthy was the finding that apoptotic changes occurred predominantly in monocytes that had internalized spirochetes. Abrogation of phagocytosis with cytochalasin D prevented the death response. Heat-killed B. burgdorferi, which was internalized as well as live organisms, induced a similar degree of apoptosis of monocytes but markedly less cytokine production. Surprisingly, opsonophagocytosis of Treponema pallidum did not elicit a discernible cell death response. Our combined results demonstrate that B. burgdorferi confined to phagolysosomes is a potent inducer of cytosolic signals that result in (i) production of NF-kappaB-dependent cytokines, (ii) assembly of the inflammasome and activation of caspase-1, and (iii) induction of programmed cell death. We propose that inflammation and apoptosis represent mutually reinforcing components of the immunologic arsenal that the host mobilizes to defend itself against infection with Lyme disease spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Optimal treatment remains uncertain for patients with cognitive impairment that persists or returns after standard IV antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Patients had well-documented Lyme disease, with at least 3 weeks of prior IV antibiotics, current positive IgG Western blot, and objective memory impairment. Healthy individuals served as controls for practice effects. Patients were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of double-masked treatment with IV ceftriaxone or IV placebo and then no antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was neurocognitive performance at week 12-specifically, memory. Durability of benefit was evaluated at week 24. Group differences were estimated according to longitudinal mixed-effects models. After screening 3368 patients and 305 volunteers, 37 patients and 20 healthy individuals enrolled. Enrolled patients had mild to moderate cognitive impairment and marked levels of fatigue, pain, and impaired physical functioning. Across six cognitive domains, a significant treatment-by-time interaction favored the antibiotic-treated group at week 12. The improvement was generalized (not specific to domain) and moderate in magnitude, but it was not sustained to week 24. On secondary outcome, patients with more severe fatigue, pain, and impaired physical functioning who received antibiotics were improved at week 12, and this was sustained to week 24 for pain and physical functioning. Adverse events from either the study medication or the PICC line were noted among 6 of 23 (26.1%) patients given IV ceftriaxone and among 1 of 14 (7.1%) patients given IV placebo; these resolved without permanent injury. IV ceftriaxone therapy results in short-term cognitive improvement for patients with posttreatment Lyme encephalopathy, but relapse in cognition occurs after the antibiotic is discontinued. Treatment strategies that result in sustained cognitive improvement are needed."

		"abstract": "The aim of the present study was to establish which combination of serological method and Borrelia strain used as an antigen would provide the most appropriate demonstration of borrelial infection in patients with eythema migrans residing in Slovenia. Four different strains were chosen as antigens: two strains of B. afzelii and two strains of B. garinii which differed in their expression of the outer proteins OspA, OspB and OspC. Each individual strain was used as antigen in immunofluorescence test (IFT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) with whole borrelial cells, and EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells. With these 12 different tests, 100 samples were examined for the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies: 50 sera of blood donors and 50 sera of patients with erythema migrans. The latter were further subdivided into skin culture-positive and -negative subgroups. A commercial Western blot (WB) test was performed for 26 sera of the control group and 25 sera of patients with erythema migrans. The four different methods had distinct specificity and sensitivity. The most specific approaches were IFT (100% for IgM and 90-92% for IgG) and the WB test (100% for IgM and 73% for IgG), followed by EIA with whole borrelial cells (80-98% for IgM and 76-84% for IgG) and EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells (76-94% for IgM and 72-80% for IgG). The sensitivity levels of all these tests were low. The most sensitive were EIA tests with whole borrelial cells (28-36% for IgM and 32-42% for IgG) followed by EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells (22-32% for IgM and 24-36% for IgG), the WB test (16% for IgM and 32% for IgG) and IFT (0-2% for IgM and 14-20% for IgG). The following methods gave significant differences between patients and negative controls in detecting IgM antibodies: EIA with whole borrelial cells with both B. afzelii antigens and with antigen B. garinii that expressed OspA and OspC, EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells with antigen B. afzelii that expressed OspA, OspB and OspC. In detecting IgG antibodies, significant differences were observed between EIA with whole borrelial cells and with antigen B. afzelii that expressed OspA and OspB. Borreliae were isolated from the skin of 34/50 (68%) patients with erythema migrans: two strains failed to grow, while 26/32 (81%) strains were identified as B. afzelii, 5/32 (16%) as B. garinii and 1/32 (3%) as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. No statistically significant differences in serologic test results between culture-positive and -negative patients with erythema migrans were found."

		"abstract": "The immunogenicity of peptides and small protein fragments can be considerably enhanced by their presentation on particulate carriers such as capsid-like particles (CLPs) from hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV CLPs are icosahedral nanoparticles formed by 90 or 120 core protein dimers. Insertions into the immunodominant c/e1 B cell epitope, a surface-exposed loop on the HBV capsid protein, are especially immunogenic. Here we investigated whether the HBV core protein can be exploited as a vaccine carrier for whole-chain protein antigens, using two clinically relevant proteins derived from a bacterial human pathogen, the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi. For this purpose we analyzed CLP formation by core fusions with the entire 255-amino-acid ectodomain of outer surface lipoprotein A (OspA), and with two distinct, 189 amino acid long variants of the dimeric OspC (OspC(a), OspC(b)) of B. burgdorferi. OspA appropriately inserted into the HBV core protein yielded a multimerization-competent fusion protein, termed coreOspA. Although only partially assembling into regular CLPs, coreOspA induced antibodies to OspA, including the Ig isotype profile and specificity for the protective epitope \"LA-2\", with an efficiency similar to that of recombinant lipidated OspA, the first generation vaccine against Lyme disease. Moreover, coreOspA actively and passively protected mice against subsequent challenge with B. burgdorferi. Fusions with the two OspC variants were found to efficiently form regular CLPs, most probably by OspC dimerization across different core protein dimers. In mice, both coreOspC preparations induced high-titered antibody responses to the homologous but also to the heterologous OspC variant, which conferred protection against challenge with B. burgdorferi. The data demonstrate the principal applicability of HBV CLPs to act as potent immunomodulator even for structurally complex full-length polypeptide chains, and thus open new avenues for novel vaccine designs."

Lyme borreliosis is prevalent throughout the Northern Hemisphere, and the same Ixodes tick species transmitting the etiologic agents of this disease also serve as vectors of pathogens causing human babesiosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Recently, several novel agents of rickettsial diseases have been described. Despite an explosion of knowledge in the fields of tick biology, genetics, molecular biology, and immunology, transitional research leading to widely applied public health measures to combat tick-borne diseases has not been successful. Except for the vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis virus, and a brief campaign to reduce this disease in the former Soviet Union through widespread application of DDT, success stories in the fight against tick-borne diseases are lacking. Both new approaches to tick and pathogen control and novel ways of translating research findings into practical control measures are needed to prevent tick-borne diseases in the twenty-first century."

A total of 10/397 samples (2.6%) showed IgG-antibodies to R. helvetica at or above a titre of 1/80 as cut-off. 6/137 (4.4%) belonged to the Borrelia positive group, 3/99 (3.0%) to the tick-bitten but Borrelia negative group and 1/161 (0.6%) to the control group. The difference between the tick-exposed groups and the control group was significant in Pearson's 2-sided chi(2) test. In 1 serum sample the presence of antibodies to R. helvetica was further confirmed by Western immunoblot. The study shows that infection with Rickettsia spp. as well as coinfection with Lyme borreliosis needs to be considered in the diagnosis of tick-transmitted infections in Sweden. Owing to a known occurrence of immunological cross-reactivites, however, the results must be cautiously interpreted with regard to species of Rickettsia involved."

Binding of B. burgdorferi to integrin alpha(3)beta(1) on human chondrocytes activates signalling leading to release of several pro-inflammatory mediators, but the B. burgdorferi protein that binds integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and elicits this response has remained unknown. A search of the B. burgdorferi genome for a canonical integrin binding motif, the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) tripeptide, revealed several candidate ligands for integrins. In this study we show that one of these candidates, BBB07, binds to integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and inhibits attachment of intact B. burgdorferi to the same integrin. BBB07 is expressed during murine infection as demonstrated by recognition by infected mouse sera. Recombinant purified BBB07 induces pro-inflammatory mediators in primary human chondrocyte cells by interaction with integrin alpha(3)beta(1). This interaction is specific, as P66, another integrin ligand of B. burgdorferi, does not activate signalling through alpha(3)beta(1). In summary, we have identified a B. burgdorferi protein, BBB07, that interacts with integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and stimulates production of pro-inflammatory mediators in primary human chondrocyte cells."

We here study the infection rate of five Borrelia genospecies: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae in nymphs, by IFA and PCR. 600 nymphs were collected in North Zealand of Denmark. Each nymph was first analysed by IFA. If positive for spirochaetal infection, the genospecies was determined by PCR. The infection rate of B. burgdorferi sensu lato was 15.5%, with the primary genospecies being B. afzelii (64.3%), B. garinii (57.1%), and B. lusitaniae (26.8%). It is the first time B. lusitaniae is documented in Denmark. Even though, the highest infection rate was discovered for B. afzelii and B. garinii, mixed infections are more common than single infections. Fifty-one percent (29/56) of these were infected with two genospecies, 7.1% (4/56) with three, and 5.3% (3/56) with four. We try to explain the high infection rate and the peculiar number of multiple infections, with a discussion of changes host abundance and occurrence of different transmission patterns."

		"abstract": "Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, which may result from infection-induced autoimmunity, is associated with HLA-DR molecules that bind an epitope of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) outer-surface protein A (OspA(165-173)) and with T cell reactivity with this epitope. One potential mechanism to explain these associations is molecular mimicry between OspA(165-173) and a self-peptide. Here, we searched the published human genome for peptides with sequence homology with OspA(165-173). The two peptides identified with the greatest sequence homology with the OspA epitope were MAWD-BP(276-288), which had identity at eight of the nine core amino acid residues, and T-span7(58-70), which had identity at six residues. MAWD-BP mRNA was expressed by synoviocytes, while T-span7 mRNA was not. However, neither peptide bound all of the HLA-DR molecules associated with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. Among 11 patients, 9 had T cell reactivity with OspA(161-170), 6 had responses to MAWD-BP(276-288), and 3 had reactivity with T-span7(58-70), but reactivity with the self-peptides was lower than that induced by the spirochetal epitope. Thus, there remains an association between OspA(165-173) and antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, and infection-induced autoimmunity is an attractive hypothesis to explain this outcome. However, molecular mimicry due to sequence homology between OspA(165-173) and a human peptide seems unlikely to be the critical mechanism."

There is a low probability that the organisms Toxoplasma gondii and Borrelia burgdorferi will be present. To confirm that robotic extraction methods followed by real time PCR will detect as little as one organism/test sample in postal specimens. Human blood samples spiked with decreasing numbers of each organism (range 10(5)-1/per extract) were extracted using two commercial kits on a Qiagen BioRobot EZ1 Workstation. Extracts of whole blood and blood fractions were tested by real time PCR. The effect of storage of blood for 1-6 days at room temperature was also investigated. Maximum sensitivity (1 organism/test sample) was achieved for T gondii with either extraction method; the sensitivity for B burgdorferi was between 1 and 10 organisms/test. Whole blood was the most suitable sample to extract, as both organisms were as likely to be detectable in the red cell as the white cell fraction. Sensitivity was not reduced by storing spiked samples at room temperature for up to 6 days. Inhibitory effects on PCR were not a significant problem provided that samples were extracted using the blood extraction kit. Using appropriate robotic extraction methods, both T gondii and B burgdorferi can be detected by real time PCR with near maximum possible sensitivity in whole blood samples. Blood samples can be transferred to reference laboratories by post without loss of sensitivity over the likely transit period."
