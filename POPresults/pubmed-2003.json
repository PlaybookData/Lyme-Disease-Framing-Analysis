		"abstract": "Mycoplasma species are one of nature's most abundant groups of microbes. These bacteria inhabit a wide diversity of insect, plant, and animal species, including humans. Certain mycoplasma species have been identified in blood-sucking arthropods, including Ixodes ticks. Frequent human exposure to this genus of ticks led us to explore the possibility of tick-mediated transmission of these bacteria. We evaluated 7 residents of central New Jersey who developed fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms, and cognitive disturbance after tick attachment. All 7 of these patients lacked both serological evidence and erythema migrans skin lesions characteristic of Lyme disease. We were able to amplify and quantitate Mycoplasma fermentans-specific DNA from their peripheral blood lymphocytes. After antimicrobial therapy, symptoms subsided, and M. fermentans DNA could no longer be detected in their blood specimens. These findings suggest that a subset of disseminated M. fermentans infections may be a vector-mediated process in humans and should be considered in patients with puzzling musculoskeletal presentations."

The aim of this paper was to analyse infection parameters of Borrelia burgdorferi in a selected populations of Ixodes ricinus. The study was conducted in Tarnowskie Góry administrative district (Krupski Młyn, Zielona, Lubliniec, Tarnowskie Góry, Swierklaniec, Tworóg, and Zbrosławice). A total of 85 ticks were collected with a piece of cloth dragged over the vegetation. The Borrelia burgdorferi infection was confirmed with a PCR method, using flagellin protein gene DNA amplification. DNA of Borrelia burgderferi sensu lato was present in 14 ticks, which constituted 16.5% of the population studied. The percentage of infected females and nymphs was 26.8%, 22.2%, and 5.6%, respectively. A high prevalence of the pathogen (50%) was in ticks revealed in the recreation areas and the community forest in Swierklaniec."

		"abstract": "Wild birds are important to public health because they carry emerging zoonotic pathogens, either as a reservoir host or by dispersing infected arthropod vectors. In addition, bird migration provides a mechanism for the establishment of new endemic foci of disease at great distances from where an infection was acquired. Birds are central to the epidemiology of West Nile virus (WNV) because they are the main amplifying host of the virus in nature. The initial spread of WNV in the U.S. along the eastern seaboard coincided with a major bird migration corridor. The subsequent rapid movement of the virus inland could have been facilitated by the elliptical migration routes used by many songbirds. A number of bird species can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, but most are not competent to transmit the infection to Ixodes ticks. The major role birds play in the geographic expansion of Lyme disease is as dispersers of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks. Aquatic waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of essentially all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations of influenza A virus. Avian influenza strains do not usually replicate well in humans, but they can undergo genetic reassortment with human strains that co-infect pigs. This can result in new strains with a marked increase in virulence for humans. Wild birds can acquire enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp., by feeding on raw sewage and garbage, and can spread these agents to humans directly or by contaminating commercial poultry operations. Conversely, wild birds can acquire drug-resistant enteropathogens from farms and spread these strains along migration routes. Birds contribute to the global spread of emerging infectious diseases in a manner analogous to humans traveling on aircraft. A better understanding of avian migration patterns and infectious diseases of birds would be useful in helping to predict future outbreaks of infections due to emerging zoonotic pathogens."

Major examples are CEE (Central European Encephalitis), ehrlichiosis, chlamydial infections and multiple sclerosis. Currently, the biggest diagnostic problem is the non-standardized laboratory diagnostic work-up. For this reason, even in the presence of a positive or borderline IgG antibody result, unclear symptoms should prompt a differential diagnostic investigation."

Diagnosis is based in particular on the clinical presentation and history of exposure, and, as a rule, is confirmed by serological methods. It must, however, be remembered that the humoral immune response may appear relatively late, so at an early stage, patients are still serologically negative. Depending on the stage involved, oral or peroral antibiotic treatment is applied--however, eradication of the pathogen is unsuccessful in some cases. In future, adjuvant immunotherapy might close the therapeutic gap."

The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on a history of tick-bite, physical examination, and serological tests. In the seronegative patients with Lyme borreliosis symptoms, additional testing should be introduced. The study group was composed of 240 hospitalized patients presented with various clinical symptoms suggesting Lyme borreliosis: 221 of the patients with neurological abnormalities and 19 with oligoarticular arthritis. Citrated blood and serum samples were collected from the patients for culture and serological examination, respectively. Moreover, 173 cerebrospinal and 6 synovial fluid samples were tested. New oligonucleotide primers based on B. burgdorferi sensu lato 16SrRNA gene sequences were designed for the detection of the bacteria in blood, cerebrospinal, and synovial fluid specimens with PCR. Levels of specific antibodies were measured in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and synovial fluid samples using ELISA and Western blot. B. burgdorferi spirochetes from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and synovial fluid samples were cultured in cell line. Extracted and purified B. burgdorferi DNA was identified by PCR with new oligonucleotide primers. Then three genospecies were identified by PCR amplification with other primer sets specific for 16S rDNA and/or by the restriction fragment length polymorphism of 23S(rrl)-5S(rrf). Bacterial DNA were found in samples from 32 patients, including 28 patients with neuroborreliosis and 4 with Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi-specific IgM and/or IgG serum antibodies were detected in 14 of these patients. Fourteen strains of Borrelia garini, 4 strains of Borrelia afzelii and 1 strain of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were identified by PCR. Genospecies were not recognized in 13 specimens. The procedure can be a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for the detection of etiological agents in clinical materials derived from patients with the clinical symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. It can be utilized for both basic research as well as routine laboratory diagnosis."

Between 1996 and 2000, occupational infectious and invasive diseases were diagnosed in 1906 patients. This is about 18% of the total number of diagnosed cases in the period under study. The total number of the diagnosed diseases included 68% of those occurring due to interhuman transmission, 29% of zoonoses and 3% of tropical diseases. The majority of occupational infectious diseases developed in health care workers (66%). This was followed by agriculture, game management and forestry workers (20%). In the group of sick workers, women outnumbered men (74% vs. 26%). The mean age of those affected was 39.2 +/- 11.9, range, 16-79 years. Scabies, viral hepatitis and tuberculosis predominated in the group of transmitted diseases and trichophytoses, erysipeloid and Lyme borreliosis among zoonoses. During the whole period of investigation, scabies occupied the first place among occupational infectious diseases. The increased incidence of diseases is mostly due to epidemics in the general population, and its spread is attributed to a low hygiene and social standards, overcrowding, increased migration that creates a higher risk for the elderly, mentally retarded and immunocompromised subjects. In tropical and subtropical countries, contract workers suffered mostly from malaria, amebiasis and infectious hepatitis A. It was possible to clearly identify occupational infectious and parasitic disease in different working conditions. The results of the survey confirm that infectious and parasitic diseases still create a difficult problem especially among health care and agriculture or forestry workers."

		"abstract": "In spite of some unquestionable positive tendencies observed over the last few years, occupational infectious diseases still pose a serious problem in Poland. During the last thirty years overall as many as 41,000 cases of occupational contagious and invasive diseases were identified. The analysis covered all cases of occupational diseases, reported by sanitary and hygiene stations on a specially designed form, to the Register of Occupational Diseases in Poland over the years 1998-2002. The analyses were performed by the disease entities, the job name, and activity sections classified according to Polish Classification of the Economy, and also by voivodeships. Crude numbers of the diseases reported and rates are presented. For the calculation of incidence rates, the statistics of the national economy employees provided by the Central Statistical Office was applied. In total, 4153 cases of infectious diseases were reported to the Register in 1998-2002. Viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, brucellosis and Lyme borelliosis covered (94.3%) of all cases. The analyzed diseases were identified mostly in two economic activity sections: Health and Social Works and Agriculture, Forestry and Hunting. About 63% of all cases were recorded in health care personnel, mostly in nurses, 1372 cases (33%), physicians (9.9%), laboratory workers (8.1%), orderlies (6.5%), dentists, dental assistants and dental technicians (1.9%). A substantial number of infections diseases were recorded in forestry workers (16.2), mostly foresters (10.9%). The highest rates of occupational diseases were found in the Podlaskie, Mazowieckie, Wielkopolskie, Pomorskie and Slaskie voivodships. At present, Lyme borelliosis and viral hepatitis pose the most serious problem of all infectious occupational diseases in Poland. Despite extensive programs of vaccination against viral hepatitis B, implemented since 1989, this pathology has not as yet been fully eradicated. It can be predicted that in the near future, viral hepatitis C and Lyme borelliosis will mostly influence the epidemiology of infectious occupational diseases in Poland. This situation will continue until relevant vaccines are developed and used in high risk occupational groups."

The represent an important animal group, which connects primary makers with higher trophic levels. They transmit various infectious diseases dangerous for the health of people and domestic and wild animals (trichinosis, leptospirosis, tick encephalitis, Lyme disease, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, etc.). The following species of small rodents live in forest ecosystems of Croatia: Chletrionomys glareolus Schreib., Arvicola terrestris L, M. subterraneus de Sel., M. arvalis Pall., M. agrestis L, M. multiplex Fat., Apodemus agrarius Pall., A. sylvaticus L. and A. flavicollis Melch. Small rodents transmit causative agents of diseases in active (excretion products) of passive (ectoparasites and endoparasites) ways. Their multiplication potential is quite high. Transmission of certain disease sometimes takes place extremely fast due to the high number of rodents, their high movability and distribution, and the fact that they easily get in touch with men and domestic and wild animals. The number of population of each species is directly influenced by abiotic and biotic factors and changes during one year and in a several year period. In a year when the influence of ecologic factors is favorable, it is presumed that the number of these rodents will significantly increase, by which the danger of their damaging effect also increases. The following factors influence the increase of a small rodent population: number and physiologic condition of the population, meteorologic conditions, habitat, food sources, natural enemies, and diseases. The occurrence of an epidemic is closely connected to the number and infectivity of causative agents. Regular control of the number of rodent population and their infectivity can help in planning preventive epidemiologic and sanitary measures to preclude the occurrence of epidemics and individual cases of disease among animals and humans who come in contact with forest (forest workers, holiday makers, hikers, soldiers, tourists, etc.)."

The authors also report the rate of infestation of these small mammals by the tick Ixodes ricinus, as these mammal species are potential reservoirs for this vector. The study focuses on the relationship between the possibility of infestation by I. ricinus and the reservoir competence of the different species under study, as well as the possible spread of disease. The detected rate of seroprevalence indicates that all the investigated animals have had contact with infected ticks."

In a group of 48 patients with different underlying diseases, 51 knee joints were treated by synovectomy in the years 1996 to 2001. Of these, 16 knees were treated by arthroscopic synovectomy (ASS group), nine by open synovectomy (OS group) and 26 by Yttrium 90 radiosynovectomy (YR). The average age was 67 years (range, 30 to 81) and average follow-up was 18 months. The patients' diagnoses involved grade I, II and III gonarthritis in three, 21 and 15 cases, respectively, Lyme disease in one patient, gouty arthropathy in one, rheumatoid arthritis in three and pyogenic arthritis in seven cases. The evaluation was based on three aspects as follows: Subjective feelings of the patient: A, no complaints; B, intermittent complaints; C, no improvement. Joint function and range of motion on clinical examination: A, full function; B, slight motion restriction; C, severe restriction. Recurrence of synovitis: A, no recurrence; B, intermittent and short-term recurrence; C, no improvement. The ASS group showed a high recurrence rate, with no improvement in 44% of the patients. No recurrence was recorded in the OS group. In the patients treated for pyogenic arthritis, 40% had a slight and 40% a severe restriction of joint motion, which is an alarming outcome. In the YR group, radiosynovectomy was effective particularly in the patients with grade I and grade II gonarthritis. In our groups, only a low number of patients were diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, in contrast to the relevant studies mostly including patients with this disorder. However, the high recurrence rate in our ASS group is in agreement with the results of other authors. In comparison to open synovectomy, with no recurrence of synovitis, arthroscopic synovectomy is less radical and does not involve the fibrous capsule. Therefore, the remaining areas of the synovial membrane may give rise to recurrent synovitis. Arthroscopic synovectomy is a minimal invasive but demanding surgical procedure associated with a high recurrence of synovitis. Open synovectomy is a radical intervention with minimum recurrences but is associated with a risk of a restricted range of motion if healing is not complete. It is not suitable for treatment of pyogenic arthritis. Radiosynovectomy is a safe and economic method, with no need of subsequent rehabilitation, which is effective in patients with a milder form of synovitis."

The seasonal pattern of I. ricinus was studied using generalized estimating equations (GEE) with negative binomial error, to consider overdispersion of tick counts and repeated sampling of the same dragging sites from April 1998 to March 1999. Prevalence of infection by B. burgdorferi s.l. was evaluated by PCR and hybridization with genospecies-specific probes. Acarological risk (R) peaked in April (R = 0.2, 95% CI 0.13-0.26) and November (R = 0.29, 95% CI 0.10-0.46). Borrelia garinii and B. valaisiana were the most common genospecies at our study site suggesting a major role of birds as reservoirs. DNA from Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis in humans and animals, was amplified from an adult I. ricinus."

Because of a favorable environment, I. scapularis is also plentiful in the South; however, a correlation with Lyme borreliosis cases does not exist in this region of the United States. Concern existed that something intrinsic to ticks found in Louisiana could mitigate their ability to transmit B. burgdorferi. Therefore, we set out to assess the ability of I. scapularis ticks from Louisiana to become infected with and transmit B. burgdorferi using mice as hosts. In the laboratory, mating adult female ticks collected in southeastern Louisiana were fed on the ears of rabbits. After oviposition and egg hatching, the resulting larvae were fed on mice that had been needle-inoculated with two different strains of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B31 and JD1. Larvae were found to be positive for spirochetes. Additional fed larvae were allowed to molt into the nymphal stage. Flat nymphs remained infected with B. burgdorferi. Infected nymphs were allowed to feed on naïve mice, all of which became infected as shown by culture of ear biopsy specimens. Naïve larvae were then fed on these same mice to assess transmissibility. The resulting engorged larvae harbored spirochetes. We have demonstrated that the I. scapularis ticks found in Louisiana are fully competent to carry and transmit B. burgdorferi infection."

The possible factors associated with the onset, incubation period, clinical manifestations of the organ systems and response to treatment were analyzed. Each of the 30 cases had a history of tick bite for one time or more. The incubation period was 1 to 14 days. All of them were hospitalized for typical erythema migrans. Among the 30 cases, 21 (70%) showed symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infection; 4 (13%) showed circulatory system symptom and manifestations of myocardial lesion; 3 (10%) had joint pain; 1 case (3%) had eye symptom and another case (3%) had nervous system symptoms, such as headache, vomiting, drowsiness, neck stiffness and so on. EEG and spinal fluid test showed some abnormal results. All the 30 cases were positive for IgG antibody to Lyme spirochetes with titers higher than 1:128. Penicillin or cefazolin was effective in treatment of the patients. The incubation period of the disease observed among this series of patients was 1-14 d. Lyme disease in this group of patients involved multiple organ systems while erythema migrans and arthralgia were the most frequently seen manifestations. Most of the patients had a favorable outcome with no sequelae."

When infected and uninfected ticks co-feed on a host, spirochetes are transmitted from ticks to animal and also to uninfected ticks. Here, we used uninfected ticks to co-feed with infected ticks on mice to evaluate this method to detect early infection in mice. A total of 128 mice were challenged by infected nymphs placed in capsules glued on the back of the mice. Three days later uninfected larvae were added in the capsule to co-feed with infected nymphs and were examined for Borrelia infection after natural detachment. Infection in mice was also determined by xenodiagnosis and by spirochete isolation from ear skin biopsy and back skin biopsy taken at the tick attachment site one month after infection. A total of 111 mice were found to be infected by at least one of these four methods. Borrelia infection was observed in 95% of mice by the co-feeding method, in 92% of mice by xenodiagnosis, in 69% and in 68% of mice by cultivation of ear and back skin biopsies, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the co-feeding method is a very sensitive method which can be used to detect very early infection in mice infected by tick bites."

Only I. persulcatus is able to maintain spirochetes alive during molting, and subsequent tick stages transmitted the infection to naive mice. In H. concinna and D. silvarum ticks, spirochetes could not survive after the digestion period of blood and after the molting process was finished, spirochetes were no longer detected. Contrary to H. concinna and D. silvarum, I. persulcatus should be considered the principal vector of Lyme disease in north China."

PMN and PBMC were isolated from heparinized whole blood of patients. The cells were incubated for 18 hs at 37 degrees C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. After 18 hs incubation, supernatant was removed and assessed for IL-15 using ELISA kits. The results obtained showed significant increase in the ability of patient's PMNs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to release IL-15. Although PBMC produced higher concentrations of IL-15 than PMN, the quantitative dominance of PMN in the peripheral blood suggest a significant role for these cells in the defense reactions controlled by this cytokine. Similar changes in the secretion of IL-15 by PMN and PBMC in patient group may be caused by the same regulatory mechanisms which influence the functional abnormalities of the cells examined. A change in the ability of PMN and PBMC to release IL-15 may have various implications for the cellular and humoral response to the Borrelia burgdorferi (B.b.) infection in patients with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is caused by at least three species, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii. Thus microbiological diagnosis in European patients must consider the heterogeneity of Lyme disease borreliae for development of diagnostic tools such as PCR primers and diagnostic antigens. According to guidelines of the German Society of Hygiene and Microbiology, the serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a two-step procedure. A sensitive ELISA differentiating IgM and IgG is recommended as the first step. In case the ELISA is reactive, it is followed by immunoblots (IgM and IgG) as the second step. The reactive diagnostic bands should be clearly identified, which is easy if recombinant antigens are used. The sensitivity and standardization of immunoblots has been considerably enhanced by use of recombinant antigens instead of whole cell lysates. Improved sensitivity resulted from use of recombinant proteins that are expressed primarily in vivo (e.g., VlsE) and combination of homologous proteins from different strains of borrelia (e.g., DbpA). It also appears promising to use recombinant proteins (DbpA, VlsE, others) or synthetic peptides (the conserved C6 peptide derived from VlsE) as ELISA antigens. At present, detection rates for serum antibodies are 20-50% in stage I, 70-90% in stage II, and nearly 100% in stage III Lyme disease. The main goals for the future are to improve specificity in general and sensitivity for diagnosis of early manifestations (stage I and II). Detection of the etiological agent by culture or PCR should be confined to specific indications and specialised laboratories. Recommended specimens are skin biopsy specimens, CSF and synovial fluid. The best results are obtained from skin biopsies with culture or PCR (50-70%) and synovial tissue or fluid (50-70% with PCR). CSF yields positive results in only 10-30% of patients. Methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes are antigen tests in body fluids, PCR of urine, and lymphocyte transformation tests."

The early period of the diseases manifested itself as two forms: erythematous in 1041 (77.5%) patients and erythema-free in 302 (22.5%). The erythematous form was characterized by the occurrence of the major clinical marker--erythema migrans at the site of tick suction. In Russia, the clinical features of the acute phase of borreliotosis were marked by the early (at weeks 2-3 of the disease) affliction of different organs (the liver) and systems (the nervous, cardiovascular, and locomotor ones). The leading clinical types of the erythema-free ITBB were neurological, arthromyalgic, influenza-like, cardiovascular, hepatitis, regional lymphadenitis, and mixed. The diagnosis of ITBB is established on the basis of a characteristic epidemiological history, clinical manifestations by taking into account the most common types of its early period and the data of a serological survey by the proposed algorithm."

Areas for improvement for Naval Disease Reporting System are identified and include additional emphasis on complete reporting on patient history and on Lyme disease antibody testing results. These findings suggest that Lyme disease is an important disease in military medicine, particularly in the eastern United States."

		"abstract": "Less than 20 years elapsed between the 1982 report of the identification and isolation of Borrelia burgdorferi and the licensure and marketing in the USA of a prophylactic vaccine against this pathogen. However, the manufacturer removed the vaccine from the market under 4 years after its release. The low demand undoubtedly was the result of limited efficacy, need for frequent boosters, the high price of the vaccine, exclusion of children, fear of vaccine-induced musculoskeletal symptoms and litigation surrounding the vaccine. Second-generation polyvalent outer surface protein (Osp)C vaccines may overcome some of these concerns but the precise antigenic components required for efficacy are uncertain. The development of the next generation of Lyme disease vaccines is in its infancy."

Tick densities and infection prevalence were not significantly different on properties with and without bird feeders.

Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, was detected by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 44 of 776 (5.67%) Ixodes pacificus ticks and in 3 of 58 (5.17%) Dermacentor variabilis ticks. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agent of HGE, was detected by PCR in 48 (6.19%) I. pacificus ticks and 5 (8.62%) D. variabilis ticks. Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the causative agent of HME, was detected by nested PCR in just five (0.64%) I. pacificus ticks and four (6.9%) D. variabilis ticks. Interestingly, eight (1.03%) I. pacificus ticks were co-infected with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, and just one (0.12%) tick was co-infected with B. burgdorferi and E. chaffeensis. Less than 1% of 353 Dermacentor occidentalis ticks showed evidence of infection with any of the agents tested. To our knowledge, this is the first reported identification of A. phagocytophilum and E. chaffeensis in D. occidentalis ticks from California This study represents the first extensive survey of Lyme and the ehrlichial diseases across multiple areas of Santa Cruz County, and suggests that prevalence of B. burgdorferi in Santa Cruz County may be higher than other areas of the state."

Samples were obtained in 2001-2002 at one locality (Studenka, 49 degrees 44', 18 degrees 05'). Host samples included yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis, n = 106), wood mouse (A. sylvaticus, n = 170) and striped field mouse (A. agrarius, n = 13) from Muridae and bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus, n = 3) and common/field vole (Microtus sp., n = 5) from Microtidae families. An indirect enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antibody test was used for testing heart rinses. Goat immunoglobulins against mouse were used as a conjugate. Antibodies to B. burgdorferi s.l. were found in all species. The highest positivity rate (58.8 % ) was recorded for wood mouse (58.8 % ), bank vole (45.5 % ), and yellow-necked mouse (44.3 % ). Mean positivity rate for both years of collection was 43.7 %, mean annual positivity rate was 60.6 % in 2001, and the value of 21.3 % in 2002 appeared significantly different. Three times as many of the Muridae as of the family Microtidae were caught and the actual number of seropositive Muridae was not significantly higher than Microtidae. Positivity of compared males and females was not significantly different. Results indicate that spirochaetes were widely represented in the northern part of the Czech Republic."

Monocytic ehrlichioses in dogs and humans are transmitted by ticks and primarily caused by E. canis and E. chaffeensis, respectively. E. canis causes canine monocytic ehrlichioses (CME), a potentially fatal disease in dogs that requires rapid and accurate diagnosis in order to initiate appropriate therapy leading to a favorable prognosis. CME is characterized by three stages; 1) acute, 2) subclinical and 3) chronic. Dogs infected with E. canis remain infected for their entire lives, even after receiving antibiotic treatment with doxycycline. The prevalence of E. canis is dependent on the distribution of the vector, Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick, which occurs mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The agent causing canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis (CGE) in Europe has been determined by nucleotide sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene to be similar to both Ehrlichia equi and E. phagocytophila (Anaplasma phagocytophila), and is identical to the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE). The vector of this pathogen in Europe is the common European tick, Ixodes ricinus and its reservoir - wild and domestic animals. Two distinct clinical disease syndromes, including chronic, moderate to sever anemia and polyarthritis, are associated with CGE. In areas infested with vectors of tick-borne agents known to be endemic for Lyme disease, veterinarians may suspect ehrlichiosis in dogs."

		"abstract": "Neurological symptoms are common manifestations of Lyme disease; however, the paucibacillary nature of the spirochete in this environment has precluded a molecular analysis of the spirochete in the CNS. We have now adapted differential expression analysis by using a custom-amplified library (DECAL) in conjunction with Borrelia burgdorferi whole-genome and subgenome arrays to examine in vivo gene expression by B. burgdorferi in a non-human primate (NHP) model of neuroborreliosis. The expression profile of B. burgdorferi was examined in the CNS and heart of steroid-treated and immunocompetent NHPs. Eighty-six chromosomal genes and 80 plasmid-encoded genes were expressed at similar levels in the CNS and heart tissue of both immunocompetent and steroid-treated NHPs. The expression of 66 chromosomal genes and 32 plasmid-encoded genes was increased in the CNS of both immunocompetent and steroid-treated NHPs. It is likely that the expression of these genes is governed by physiological factors specific to the CNS milieu. However, 83 chromosomal and 114 plasmid-encoded genes showed contrasting expression profiles in steroid-treated and immunocompetent NHPs. The effect of dexamethasone on the immune status of the host as well as on the host metabolic pathways could contribute to these differences in the B. burgdorferi transcriptome. Results obtained herein underscore the complex interplay of host factors on B. burgdorferi gene expression in vivo. The results provide a global snapshot of the spirochetal transcriptome in the CNS and should spur the design of experiments aimed at understanding the molecular basis of neuroborreliosis."

Three standardized questions were asked, evaluating their level of specific medical training on Lyme borreliosis as well as their practice regarding treatment and diagnosis of erythema migrans. One third of the general practitioners had already accomplished a continued medical education course on Lyme borreliosis. Half of them considered that the diagnosis of erythema migrans was clinical, while the other half believed that serological confirmation was mandatory. However, the answers of those having received specific education on borreliosis were right (p=0.0079) since in this sub-group 72% considered that the diagnosis was exclusively based on clinical examination, versus 41% of the untrained physicians. Eighty-eight percent used the recommended antibiotic regimens to treat erythema migrans. Three practitioners proposed an inefficient treatment that had exposed the patients to the risk of extra-cutaneous complications of the disease. Fifty percent of the general practitioners working in endemic areas for Lyme borreliosis still believe that seropositivity against Borrelia burgdorferi is required to diagnose erythema migrans, which is untrue. However, this study shows that a specific education on Lyme borreliosis would significantly improve this score."

		"abstract": "The purpose of this study was to characterize auditory function in patients diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Eighteen patients with PTLDS were evaluated and compared to a normal population. Evaluations consisted of pure tone and speech thresholds, word recognition (WRS), acoustic immittance battery, auditory brain stem response (ABR), and loudness discomfort level (LDL). Both seropositive and seronegative patients were evaluated. Audiologists were blinded to patient status. Forty four percent of the patients had one or more abnormal pure tone thresholds compared to gender- and age-adjusted norms. Thirty-one percent showed abnormally reduced LDLs, and 17% had abnormal acoustic reflexes at one or more frequencies. This paper catalogs previously unstudied long-term auditory system sequelae resulting from PTLDS. Our most significant finding was the dramatically reduced loudness tolerance in the presence of either normal or minimally impaired hearing. The clinician is encouraged to consider PTLDS when confronted with these or similar findings in patients having history of Borrelia burgdorferi infection and continued complaints."

The results of the in-house species-independent enzyme immunoassay (i.e. an EIA which can be used to test serum samples from different animal species) showed a strong agreement (kappa: 0.78-0.81) with those of an experimental and a commercially available EIA (Genzyme Virotech, Rüsselsheim, Germany) for the detection of canine IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the in-house EIAs for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi was independent of the antigenic heterogeneity, as demonstrated by the results of sera from dogs suspected of LB with various clinical symptoms: lameness (n = 60), and neurological (n = 60) and skin disorders (n = 52). Because of its high sensitivity for IgM antibodies, the indirect assay (Diagast, Pessac, France) proved to be an interesting tool for the detection of an acute Lyme infection in dogs. However, in this study a positive serological result could not be linked to any clinical symptom that has been related to LB in dogs. Results showed no difference in seroprevalence between dogs considered at high or at low risk of a B. burgdorferi infection. It was concluded that LB is an uncommon disease in the Dutch dog population despite the fact that many of Dutch dogs are infected with B. burgdorferi. Because of this low prevalence, the use of any immunoassay to support the clinical diagnosis of LB in dogs might be of limited value. Nevertheless, the species-independent EIA could be valuable in seroepidemiological studies when sera of several different animal species need to be tested."

Human Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection is associated with Bb-specific secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), which may be important for the elimination of Bb, but this may also cause tissue injury. In order to increase the understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms in chronic neuroborreliosis, we investigated which cell types that secrete IFN-gamma. Blood mononuclear cells from 13 patients with neuroborreliosis and/or acrodermatitis chronicum atrophicans were stimulated with Bb antigen and the phenotypes of the induced IFN-gamma-secreting cells were analyzed with three different approaches. Cells expressing CD8 or TCRgammadelta, which both have cytolytic properties, were the main phenotypes of IFN-gamma-secreting cells, indicating that tissue injury in chronic neuroborreliosis may be mediated by cytotoxic cells."

Their performances in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were compared with that of commercial flagella antigen. IgG ELISAs were performed with three variants of each recombinant antigen originating from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii, and with the IR(6) peptide. IgM antibodies were analysed against OspC and flagella. Of the patients whose CSF contained elevated anti-flagella IgG antibodies, 93% were positive for at least three of the new antigens. Of those with negative or borderline CSF anti-flagella antibodies, 51% were positive for three new antigens. Antibodies to BBK32 were detectable mainly in early disease. Antibodies to DbpA and IR(6) were observed in early and late NB. The use of the new antigens at presentation of the disease improved the laboratory diagnosis of NB. In IgG ELISAs, the diagnostic sensitivity of assays with the new antigens was between 75 and 88%, but was only 52% with the flagella antigen. The discriminatory power between patient and control samples appeared better in the CSF than in the serum. We suggest that assessment of CSF antibodies to at least two antigens, using either flagella and one of the new antigens or two of the new antigens, would improve the current diagnostic yield of NB."

Passive transfer of Arp antiserum into infected SCID mice induced arthritis resolution, but antisera to P37-42, OspA, GT, or six overlapping Arp peptide fragments did not. Results suggest that the arthritis-resolving immunogenicity is specific to Arp, but the relevant epitopes may be conformational."

To investigate muscle involvement in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model of Lyme disease, 16 adult Macaca mulatta animals inoculated with strain N40 of B. burgdorferi sensu strictu by syringe or by tick bite or with strain Pbi of B. burgdorferi genospecies garinii by syringe were studied. Animals were necropsied while immunosuppressed on day 50 (two animals each inoculated with B. burgdorferi N40 by syringe and with B. garinii Pbi by syringe) or on day 90, 40 days after immunosuppression had been discontinued (four animals each inoculated with strain N40 by syringe, with strain N40 by tick bite, and with strain Pbi by syringe). Skeletal muscles removed at necropsy were studied by (i) microscopic examination of hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections for inflammation and tissue injury; (ii) immunohistochemical and digital image analyses for antibody and complement deposition and cellular inflammation; (iii) Western blot densitometry for the presence of antibodies; and (iv) reverse transcription-PCR for measurement of the spirochetal load or C1q (the first component of the complement cascade) synthesis. The results showed that N40 was more infectious for NHPs than Pbi. NHPs inoculated with N40 but not with Pbi developed myositis. The inflammation in skeletal muscle was more severe in NHPs inoculated with N40 by syringe than in those inoculated by tick bite. The predominant cells in the inflammatory infiltrate were T cells and plasma cells. The deposition of antibody and complement in inflamed muscles from N40-inoculated NHPs was significantly higher than that in Pbi-inoculated NHPs. The spirochetal load was very high in the two N40-inoculated NHPs examined while they were immunosuppressed but decreased to minimal levels in the NHPs when immunocompetence was restored. We conclude that myositis can be a prominent feature of Lyme borreliosis depending on the infecting organism and host immune status."

We conducted analyses of Erp expression throughout the entire tick-mammal infectious cycle, which revealed that the bacteria regulate Erp production in vivo. Bacteria within unfed nymphal ticks expressed little to no Erp proteins. However, as infected ticks fed on mice, B. burgdorferi increased production of Erp proteins, with essentially all transmitted bacteria expressing these proteins. Mice infected with B. burgdorferi mounted rapid IgM responses to all tested Erp proteins, followed by strong immunoglobulin G responses that generally increased in intensity throughout 11 months of infection, suggesting continued exposure of Erp proteins to the host immune system throughout chronic infection. As naive tick larvae acquired B. burgdorferi by feeding on infected mice, essentially all transmitted bacteria produced Erp proteins, also suggestive of continual Erp expression during mammalian infection. Shortly after the larvae acquired bacteria, Erp production was drastically downregulated. The expression of Erp proteins on B. burgdorferi throughout mammalian infection is consistent with their hypothesized function as factor H-binding proteins that protect the bacteria from host innate immune responses."

All 7 ticks infected with Babesia microti, were also infected with other pathogens (all 7 among 417 infected ticks, zero amongst the remaining 321 naive ones (chi2 = 5.25, p<0.05). Babesia microti occurred twice with Borrelia afzelii, 3 times with Borrelia garinii, once with both, and once with both B. garinii and TBEV. The prevalence of infection with Borrelia spp. was 34.0%, with Ehrlichia spp. 6.2%, with TBEV 1.5%, and with Ba. microti 0.9%. Babesia microti infection was not found in combination with Ehrlichia sp. or Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. The latter pathogen (prevalence 2.6%), just like Ba. microti, was not encountered as a monoinfection. The data suggest that Ba. microti infection can only survive in I. persulcatus in combination with Borrelia spp. (7 of 7 infections). The disease in humans is more severe and longer-lasting when more than one pathogen is involved. Our observations show that the well known St. Petersburg focus of tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease is also a focus of ehrlichiosis and babesiosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the northern hemisphere and is caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex. A complete presentation of the disease is an extremely unusual observation in which a skin lesion results from a tick bite and is followed by heart and nervous system involvement, and later on by arthritis. Late involvement of eye, nervous system, joints, and skin can also occur. The only sign that enables a reliable clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is erythema migrans. Other features of some diagnostic value are earlobe lymphocytoma, meningoradiculoneuritis (Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome), and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The many other symptoms and signs have little diagnostic value. Microbial or serological confirmation of borrelial infection is needed for all manifestations of the disease except for typical early skin lesions. However, even erythema migrans might not be pathognomonic for Lyme borreliosis, especially in the southern part of the USA where there is no microbiological evidence for infection with the agent. Treatment with antibiotics is beneficial for all stages of Lyme borreliosis, but is most successful early in the course of the illness. Prevention relies mainly on avoiding exposure to tick bites but there is some interest in chemoprophylaxis and also in vaccine development following initial disappointments."

An indirect immunofluorescent assay based on Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on local isolates of Borrelia afzelii and B. burgdorferi s.s., and immunoblot (IB) of B. afzelii were prepared. The serum panels contained 214 serum samples: control group (n=120) and patients at different stages of LB (n=94). The specificity of IB was 96%, of in-house ELISA 93%, and of IFA 89%. In early LB the sensitivity of IFA was 36%, ELISA 67%, and IB 93%. In late-stage LB the sensitivity was: 72% for IFA, 80% for ELISA, and 94% for IB. Comparison of in-house and Behring ELISA showed that the sensitivity of the serological assay could be increased when the test was based on local Borrelia strains. IgM and IgG antibodies from sera of patients with early and late LB most frequently demonstrated reactivity to OspC. The other significant proteins in early LB were: p39, p41 in IgM IB, and p83/100, p39, Osp17 in IgG IB; in late LB: p39, p41 in IgM IB, and p83/100, Osp17, p21 and p43 in IgG IB. Using IB based on local B. afzelii isolates improves the serodiagnosis of early LB in our geographical region."

		"abstract": "All isolates of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi contain multiple, different plasmids of the cp32 family, each of which contains a locus encoding Erp surface proteins. Many of these proteins are known to bind host complement regulatory factor H, enabling the bacteria to avoid killing by the alternative complement pathway during vertebrate infection. In the present study, we characterized the erp loci and cp32 plasmids of strains N40, Sh-2-82, and 297 and compared them to the previously determined cp32 sequences of type strain B31. Bacteria of strain N40 contain 6 different cp32s, those of Sh-2-82 contain 10, and 297 bacteria contain 9 cp32s. Significant conservation between all strains was noted for the cp32 loci responsible for plasmid maintenance, indicating close relationships that appear to correspond with incompatibility groups. In contrast, considerable diversity was found between erp gene sequences, both within individual bacteria and between different strains. However, examples of identities among erp loci were found, with strains Sh-2-82, 297, and B31 each containing three identical loci that likely arose through intrabacterial genetic rearrangements. These studies also found the first evidence of large-scale genetic exchanges between Lyme disease spirochetes in nature, including the apparent transfer of an entire cp32 plasmid between two different bacteria."

Antibodies against B burgdorferi were detected by ELISA and confirmed with Western blot (WB) assays. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. A total of 2,346 serum samples were tested; 297 (12.6%) were positive for ELISA, and 122 of 297 were confirmed by WB. Seroprevalence was 3.43% in Mexico City and 6.2% in the Northeast region of the country. Tamaulipas was the state with the highest seroprevalence. The prevalence of seropositive cases shows that borrelial infection is present in the northeast of Mexico and Mexico City. Identification of clinical cases and infected tick vectors is necessary to confirm the presence of Lyme disease in Mexico."

LysRS1 has been found in most archaea and some bacteria, and LysRS2 has been found in eukarya, most bacteria, and a few archaea, but the two proteins are almost never found together in a single organism. Comparison of structures of LysRS1 and LysRS2 complexed with lysine suggested significant differences in their potential to bind lysine analogues with backbone replacements. One such naturally occurring compound, the metabolic intermediate S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine, is a bactericidal agent incorporated during protein synthesis via LysRS2. In vitro tests showed that S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine is a poor substrate for LysRS1, and that it inhibits LysRS1 200-fold less effectively than it inhibits LysRS2. In vivo inhibition by S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine was investigated by replacing the endogenous LysRS2 of Bacillus subtilis with LysRS1 from the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. B. subtilis strains producing LysRS1 alone were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by S-(2-aminoethyl)-L-cysteine, whereas a WT strain or merodiploid strains producing both LysRS1 and LysRS2 showed significant growth inhibition under the same conditions. These growth effects arising from differences in amino acid recognition could contribute to the distribution of LysRS1 and LysRS2 in different organisms. More broadly, these data demonstrate how diversity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases prevents infiltration of the genetic code by noncanonical amino acids, thereby providing a natural reservoir of potential antibiotic resistance."

Practicing veterinarians, particularly those in the northeastern and upper midwestern states, where Lyme borreliosis is highly endemic, should be familiar with the ecologic features and typical clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis. Interpretation of signs and serologic test results should be made with consideration of the regional prevalence of Lyme borreliosis and the animal's opportunity for exposure to infected Ixodes spp. The availability of recently marketed topical acaracides is a valuable adjunctive measure in prevention of Lyme borreliosis. A maximally effective prevention strategy should include consideration of environmental modification, activity restrictions, routine examinations for ticks, prompt removal of attached ticks, and vaccination. Technologic advances, such as the C6 EIA and the Osp A recombinant vaccine, offer the promise of additional tools for the clinical management and prevention of this tick-borne zoonosis."

For IgM antibody detection sera were additionally pretreated with anti-IgG serum (RF absorbent). Serum samples of 93% of persons from healthy control group were IgM negative and all were IgG negative. Out of 105 patients with EM, 49% were IgM positive and 14 % were borderline. IgG ELISA showed positive results for 17% and borderline for 6% of the patients. Positive and borderline serum samples were examined further by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and immunoblot test with recombinant B. burgdorferi proteins from strain PKo (B. afzelii) - p100, flagellin, OspA and OspC, and internal flagellin fragments from strains PKo and PBi (B. garinii) [B.Wilske, V.Fingerle, P. Herzer et al. 1993. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 182:255]. IFA detected IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi in 47 % of the positive and in none of the borderline by IgM ELISA serum samples as well as IgG antibodies in 83% of the positive and in 50% of the borderline by IgG ELISA samples. Presence of specific antibodies was confirmed by immunoblot in 71 % of the IgM ELISA postive and in 67 % of the IgG ELISA positive sera. In addition, anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies were detected in 60 % of the borderline by IgM ELISA serum samples. IgM serum reactivity was directed mainly against OspC antigen and flagellin and IgG antibodies were directed mainly against flagellin and p100. These findings clearly showed advantages of the ELISA test based on previous pretreatment of sera and capable to detect specific antibodies in more than half of patients with early Lyme borreliosis despite the well-known delayed immune response. IFA was less sensitive than ELISA in detection of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies. An additional examination of ELISA borderline sera by immunoblot revealed more positive results. Serum reactivity to a single OspC antigen seems to be a sufficient criterion for positive IgM immunoblot."

		"abstract": "The etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is capable of circumventing the immune defense of a variety of potential vertebrate hosts. Previous work has shown that interaction of host-derived complement regulators, factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), with up to five complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) expressed by resistant B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates conferred complement resistance. In addition expression of CRASP-1 is directly correlated with complement resistance of Borrelia species. This work describes the functional characterization of BbCRASP-1 as the dominant factor H and FHL-1-binding protein of B. burgdorferi. The corresponding gene, zs7.a68, is located on the linear plasmid lp54 and is different from factor H-binding Erp proteins that are encoded by genes localized on circular plasmids (cp32). Deletion mutants of BbCRASP-1 were generated, and a high affinity binding site for factor H and FHL-1 was mapped to the C terminus of BbCRASP-1. Similarly, the predominant binding site of factor H and FHL-1 was localized to the short consensus repeat 7. Factor H and FHL-1 maintain their cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation when bound to BbCRASP-1, and factor H is up to 6-fold more efficient in mediating C3b conversion than FHL-1. In conclusion, BbCRASP-1 (i). binds the host complement regulators factor H and FHL-1 with high affinity, (ii). is the key molecule of the complement resistance of spirochetes, and (iii). is distinct from the Erp protein family. Thus, BbCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. burgdorferi and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

LB evolves in two stages: a skin lesion called erythema migrans and later, different disseminated forms (articular, neurological, cardiac.). Previous research based on analysis of ospC sequences allowed the definition of 58 groups (divergence of <2% within a group and >8% between groups). Only 10 of these groups include all of the strains isolated from disseminated forms that are considered invasive. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not invasive strains belong to restricted ospC groups by testing human clinical strains isolated from disseminated forms. To screen for ospC genetic diversity, we used single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Previously known ospC sequences from 44 different strains were first tested, revealing that each ospC group had a characteristic SSCP pattern. Therefore, we studied 80 disseminated-form isolates whose ospC sequences were unknown. Of these, 28 (35%) belonged to previously known invasive groups. Moreover, new invasive groups were identified: six of B. afzelii, seven of B. garinii, and one of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. This study confirmed that invasive strains are not distributed among all 69 ospC groups but belong to only 24 groups. This suggests that OspC may be involved in the invasiveness of B. burgdorferi."

Such a test could be employed to ascertain if treatment of early Lyme disease was successful and would be helpful to clinicians assessing patients with lingering posttreatment symptoms. We reported recently that levels of the antibody to C(6), a Borrelia burgdorferi-derived peptide that is used as an antigen in the C(6)-Lyme diagnostic test, declined after successful antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis patients. We assessed retrospectively the change in anti-C(6) antibody titers in 131 patients with either early localized disease (erythema migrans) or disseminated disease. All of these patients were treated with antibiotics and were free of the clinical signs shown at presentation within 12 weeks after the initiation of treatment. Decreases in reciprocal geometric mean titers (rGMT) of the anti-C(6) antibody were quantified for the subpopulation of 45 patients whose baseline rGMT were >/=80 and whose second serum specimens were obtained at least 6 months after the baseline specimen. Eighty percent of this patient group (36 of 45) experienced a >/=4-fold decrease in their rGMT (P < 0.0003). These results suggest that a change in the anti-C(6) antibody titer may serve as an indicator of therapy outcome for patients with localized or disseminated Lyme borreliosis."

In Italy it is endemic in some regions of the northern part of the country and it is more frequent during summer. In Calabria (south Italy) no cases have been reported. To document the presence and indigenous nature of Lyme disease in this territory we conducted a study from 1999 to 2002. We defined as indigenous cases those with erythema migrans with the following characteristics: dimensions equal to or greater than 5 cm; localization on an area of the skin where there was a tick bite; appearance between 4 and 30 days after the tick bite; appearance in patients who had not resided out of Calabria in the previous 3 months. We found 23 patients with the necessary characteristics to be defined indigenous cases. Since 15 of these cases (65.2%) were observed in the October - December trimester and no case was found in the July - September trimester, we suspect that in Calabria the disease follows a seasonal distribution which differs with respect to countries where it is historically endemic."

Altogether, 213 rodents of three species: Apodemus agrarius Pall., A. flavicollis Melchior, Clethrionomys glareolus Schreber were captured. Of 323 engorged ticks, 304 were larvae and 19 nymphs. All ticks collected from vegetation, as well as from rodents were examined for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigenwalt & Brenner s.l. spirochetes by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using PAB 1B29. The seasonal pattern of activity of questing I. ricinus was always bimodal (May/June and August/September). The most abundant tick population occurred in the deciduous forest. The total infection rate in questing ticks was 16.2%. Differences in mean infection prevalence of host-seeking ticks between three biotopes each year were not significant. On average more larvae parasitized on the genus of Apodemus than on C. glareolus. 17.8% of larvae and 31.6% of nymphs fed on rodents harbored spirochetes. The three rodent species contributed to a different degree in to transmission of the pathogen to subadult stages. Approximately 27% of larvae infested on A. agrarius, 22% on C. glareolus, and only 4.2% on A. flavicollis contained spirochetes. The results suggest that the prevalence of A. agrarius and C. glareolus in disturbed urban forests used for leisure activities seems to be crucial for the maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l. in I. ricinus populations."

A chalcid wasp, Ixodiphagus hookeri, in the family Encyrtidae parasitizes populations of the tick on several islands or other geographically isolated sites in New England with high densities of these ticks and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the principal host for adult I. scapularis. Deer densities were reduced at a forested tract in Bridgeport and the Bluff Point Coastal Reserve in Groton, Connecticut, from levels exceeding 90 animals per km2 in 1992 (Bridgeport) and 1994 (Bluff Point) to 17 and 10 animals per km2, respectively, by fall 2001. Tick densities declined with sustained reductions in the population of white-tailed deer. Similarly, prevalence of tick parasitism by Ixodes hookeri declined at both sites from 30 to 25% to <1.0% and was significantly correlated with previous year's deer density at both sites (r(s) = 0.933 and r(s) = 0.867, P < or = 0.0001) and with nymphal tick densities at Bridgeport (r(s) = 0.867, P < or = 0.0001), but was not as well correlated with tick densities in Groton. The virtual disappearance of I. hookeri in this study corresponds with a lack of I. hookeri in mainland I. scapularis at comparable deer and tick densities, suggesting that there is a threshold deer density of approximatley 10-20/km2, with corresponding tick densities necessary for I. hookeri to successfully parasitize I. scapularis."

Using the previously described pBSV2 as a backbone, a shuttle vector, termed pKFSS1, which carries the aadA open reading frame fused to the B. burgdorferi flgB promoter was constructed. The hybrid flgB promoter-aadA cassette confers resistance to spectinomycin and streptomycin in both B. burgdorferi and Escherichia coli. pKFSS1 has a replication origin derived from the 9-kb circular plasmid and can be comaintained in B. burgdorferi with extant shuttle vector pCE320, which has a replication origin derived from a 32-kb circular plasmid, or pBSV2, despite the fact that pKFSS1 and pBSV2 have the same replication origin. Our results demonstrate the availability of a new selectable marker and shuttle vector for genetically dissecting B. burgdorferi at the molecular level."

In the present study a total of 151 adult female ticks Ixodes persulcatus Schulze, collected at three localities in eastern regions of West Siberia, where Lyme disease is endemic, were examined for the presence of the spirochete B. burgdorferi s.l. by polymerase chain reaction targeting the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer regions. Spirochetal DNA was detected in on average 15.2+/-3.0% of the ticks examined. The infection rate of adult ticks with B. burgdorferi s.l. at various localities ranged from 8.6+/-3.4% to 29.0+/-7.6%, being greatest in the northernmost site studied and decreasing southwards. The restriction patterns obtained after MseI digestion of the 23S-5S rRNA intergenic spacer amplicons assigned 23 DNA samples to the following genomic groups: 19 to B. garinii (12 to group NT29 and seven to group 20047(T)), three to B. afzelii, and one to mixed B. afzelii and B. garinii NT29. We have not detected other genospecies, which were found in ticks in Europe, the Russian Far East and Japan. Thus, the ticks examined were associated only with two genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. pathogenic to humans (B. garinii and B. afzelii), and B. garinii was the major genospecies infecting adult I. persulcatus in eastern regions of West Siberia."

		"abstract": "Macrolide antibiotics are highly active in vitro against B.burgdorferi, but have limited efficacy in the treatment of patients with Lyme Disease. As macrolides are less active at a low pH, their poor clinical activity might be due to localization of borrelia to an acidic endosome, and their activity improved by alkalinization of that compartment with hydroxychloroquine. 235 patients with a multi-symptom complex typical of chronic Lyme disease, ie fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and neurocognitive dysfunction and with serologic reactivity against B.burgdorferi were treated with a macrolide antibiotic (eg clarithromycin) and hydroxychloroquine. Eighty % of patients had self-reported improvement of 50% or more at the end of 3 months. After 2 months of treatment, 20% of patients felt markedly improved (75-100% of normal); after 3 months of treatment, 45% were markedly improved. Improvement frequently did not begin until after several weeks of therapy. There were no differences among the three macrolide antibiotics used. Patients who had been on hydroxychloroquine or macrolide antibiotic alone had experienced little or no improvement. Compared to patients ill for less than 3 years, the onset of improvement was slower, and the failure rate higher in patients who were ill for longer time periods. These results support the hypothesis that the Lyme borrelia reside in an acidic endosome and that the use of a lysosomotropic agent augments the clinical activity of macrolide antibiotics in the treatment of patients with chronic Lyme Disease. In contrast, the efficacy of tetracycline in such patients is not affected by hydroxychloroquine."

Different bacterial and viral pathogens interfere with the regulation of apoptosis. This may take place in Lyme borreliosis, in which pathological autoimmune reactions are likely to occur. A study group consisted of 15 patients with erythema migrans (group I), 15 with Lyme arthritis (group II) and 9 with neuroborreliosis (group III); the control group consisted of 10 healthy subjects. The concentrations of the factors involved in apoptosis regulation--transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta 1), soluble Fas (sFas), soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) and protein bcl-2--were measured in serum before (examination 1) and after (examination 2) four weeks of antibiotic treatment. The mean concentration of sFas was significantly higher in all study groups compared to controls in examination 1 and 2, and showed a tendency to increase during treatment. The concentration of sFasL was significantly increased in groups II and III in examination 1. The concentration of bcl-2 was elevated significantly in all groups in examination 1 and dropped during treatment, remaining significantly increased in group I. The concentration of TGF-beta 1 was not significantly elevated except for group II in examination 2. The concentrations of soluble factors involved in the regulation of apoptosis were increased in serum of patients with different forms of Lyme borreliosis. Further studies are necessary to confirm if inappropriate apoptosis of immune cells may contribute to the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "We investigated mechanical unfolding of Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA), a Lyme disease antigen containing a unique single-layer beta-sheet, with atomic force microscopy (AFM). We mechanically stretched a monomeric unit, rather than a tandem repeat, by pulling it from its N and C-terminal residues without using intervening polymer as a spacer. We detected two peaks in the force-extension profile before the final rupture of a fully extended polypeptide, which we interpreted as unfolding of multiple substructures in OspA. The double-peaked unfolding curves are consistent with results of previous thermodynamic studies showing two cooperative units in OspA. The mechanical unfolding processes were reversible, and the two substructures refolded within one second. Mutations near the boundary of the two thermodynamic cooperative units reduced the height of the first unfolding peak to undetectable levels and marginally affected the second one, indicating that the boundary between the two mechanical substructures is related to that previously assigned between the thermodynamic cooperative units. Based on a \"worm-like chain\" analysis of our AFM data, we propose a model for mechanical unfolding of OspA, where nearly a half of the chain is stretched with minimal resistive force, followed by sequential breakdown of C-terminal and N-terminal substructures. Based on these results, we discuss similarities and differences between mechanical and thermodynamic unfolding reactions of OspA. This work demonstrates that AFM study of monomeric proteins can elucidate details of the intramolecular mechanics of protein substructures."

		"abstract": "Only little is known about the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis in Germany. As an example, it is still unclear if there are regional differences in the incidence of Lyme disease in general or of certain clinical manifestations like Lyme arthritis. Moreover, standardization of diagnostic or therapeutic procedures does not exist. Therefore, a Germany-wide questionnaire-based survey was conducted in order to achieve more epidemiological data and to obtain more information about the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches of general practitioners and specialists. A self-designed questionnaire was distributed along with two editions of the journal \"Deutsches Arzteblatt\" (which is delivered to every physician in Germany) and additionally by a pharmaceutical company. During the collection period from March 1, 1998 to February 28, 1999, patients with Lyme disease were reported and information was given about site of infection, diagnostic procedures, clinical symptoms, treatment, and outcome. Altogether 3935 patients were reported. Their mean age was 43.4 years with the peak incidences around the ages of 10 and 60 years. 37.3% of the questionnaires were sent in by general practitioners, 17.6% by dermatologists, 15.7% by pediatricians, 9.7% by internists, and 2.7% by neurologists. 83% of the patients did not have a special infecion risk. The most frequent clinical Lyme manifestation was erythema migrans (EM), which occurred in 50.9% of the patients. 21.3% suffered from general symptoms. Of special interest, 24.5% of the patients had Lyme arthritis (14.7% mon- or oligoarthritis, 9.8% polyarthritis). Therefore, arthritis was more frequently reported than neuroborreliosis (18.4%). Only 16% of the neuroborreliosis patients and 32% of the arthritis patients remembered having had an EM. 189 patients (4.8%) with lymphadenosis cutis benigna and 100 patients (2.5%) with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were reported. In 80.4% of the patients, positive Lyme serology was detected. In a few cases, the diagnosis was established by isolation of borreliae, PCR or histology. 3754 patients were treated by antibiotics. The most frequently used compounds were doxycycline (50.4%), followed by ceftriaxone (22.4%), amoxicillin (13.6%), penicillin (7%), and erythromycin (4.2%) with differences depending on clinical manifestations and specialization of the prescribing physician. In less than 10% of the cases, not evaluated or recommended therapeutic procedures were performed. Lyme disease is endemic throughuot Germany. The most frequent manifestations are EM, followed by Lyme arthritis and neuroborreliosis. Less than one third of patients suffering from disseminated or chronic Lyme disease remembered an EM. Most of the physicians taking part in this survey follow treatment recommendations concerning choice of antibiotics and treatment durations."

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained 16 then 293 white corpuscles/mm3 of lympho-monocytes, increased protein level from 2.67 to 5.83 g/l and an increase in IgG index with oligoclonal distribution of IgG. Serological Elisa analysis for Lyme disease was slightly positive in blood (confirmed by western blot) but clearly in the CSF (IgG and IgM). Treatment with ceftriaxone followed by methylprednisolone provided clinical improvement 3 months later. Acute meningo-encephalitis is often benign, protein-like and of good prognosis: the gnosic visual disorders with posterior leukoencephalopathy are unusual. A blood level of specific antibodies slightly positive on Elisa at the early stage of the infection warrants confirmation by Western blot in the blood and by Elisa in the CSF. Additional corticosteroid therapy may be required in the severe forms that evoke acute disseminated encephalomyelitis."

For this, data on 1062 cases of fevers occurring after the bite of a tick in Udmurtia in 1965-1968, the similar data on 1509 cases in 1983-1987, and the official data on the incidence of these infections in 1996-2000 have been retrospectively analyzed. It has been shown that in Udmurtia the natural foci of lTBB coexisted with those of TBE long before the pathogens of borrelioses were described and notification of the infection of this group was initiated. In the 1990s, there was a drastic rise in the incidence of TBE and lTBB as compared with the 1960s and 1980s, which was due to an increase in the rate of contacts of the population with natural foci and to the better diagnosis of these infections. The prevalence of lTBB coincides with that of TBE. There is a long (more than 30 years) epidemiological effect in eliminating the vector Ixodes persulcatus."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases have increasingly been recognized in the United States as public health problems. The importance of tick-borne diseases has been accelerated by increases in animal populations, as well as increased human recreation in wooded environments that are conducive to tick bites. Babesiosis, usually caused by the intraerythrocytic parasite, Babesia microti and transmitted by the same tick as Lyme disease, has important transfusion implications. Although Lyme disease has not been reported from blood transfusion, newly identified tick-borne diseases such as ehrlichiosis raise additional questions about the role of the tick in transfusion-transmitted diseases. The risk of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis is higher than usually appreciated and in endemic areas represents a major threat to the blood supply. Furthermore, the geographic range of B. microti is expanding, other Babesia spp. have been implicated in transfusion transmission in the western United States, and the movement of blood donors and donated blood components may result in the appearance of transfusion babesiosis in areas less familiar with these parasites. Consequently, a higher degree of clinical suspicion will allow early recognition and treatment of this important transfusion complication. In endemic areas transfusion-transmitted babesiosis is more prevalent than usually believed. The extension of the geographic range of various Babesia spp. and the movement of donors and blood products around the United States has resulted in the risk extending to non-endemic areas. Clinicians should maintain a high degree of clinical suspicion for transfusion-transmitted babesiosis."

		"abstract": "Both soluble and cell-mediated components are involved in the innate immune response of arthropods. Injection of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, results in the secretion of defensin into the hemolymph of the ixodid tick, Dermacentor variabilis. The presence of the peptide is observed as early as 15 min post-challenge and remains present through 18 h post-challenge. As observed in insects and soft ticks, the transcript for defensin is detected as early as 1 h post-challenge in D. variabilis. RT-PCR resulted in an amplicon of 624 bp with a 225 bp region that translates to a 74 amino acid preprodefensin. The defensin encoding region was amplified, cloned and sequenced from the hemocytes. It appears as though defensin is stored in the granulocytes of the hemolymph and secreted into the hemolymph upon bacterial insult. The role of defensin as a contributing factor in determining vector competency is discussed."

Borreliae were characterized by PCR followed by RFLP. The abundance and infection rates of I. ricinus ticks varied greatly between the areas. Two localities were found free of Borrelia. The prevalence of infected ticks ranged from 5 to 19%. Most ticks (96%) were found infected by < 50 spirochetes. Three B. burgdorferi sl species were successfully isolated: B. garinii dominated, followed by B. lusitaniae and B. valaisiana. Additionally, a mixed infection with B. garinii and B. valaisiana was observed. The distribution of the various Borrelia species in the different areas was heterogeneous.

As regards pathogenesis, attention was paid to the mosaic protein structure of the B. burgdorfieri spirochete, particularly of outer surface proteins (Osp) that influence the clinical course and diagnosis of the disease. The presence of various atypical spirochete forms: spheroplastic L (without cell walls), cystic, and granular \"blebs\" may lead to a chronic form of the disease and to a low efficacy of antibiotic therapy. An important part of the pathogenesis is epithelial damage, stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines (mainly IL-1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma), adhesive molecules and acute-phase proteins. Moreover, in the course of the disease not only an impairment of phagocytosis and chemotaxis was found, but also B. burgdorfieri spirochete binding by antibodies into immunological complexes that may maintain chronic inflammation. In terms of the Asbrink classification, complaints predominating in the clinical picture of an early and late stage of the disease were presented, with an emphasis on neuroborreliosis."

We studied the induction by bacteria of host matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in EM skin lesions of patients with acute Lyme disease. In blister fluid from the EM lesions, the expression of MMP-9 was selectively increased by 1900%+/-1037%, compared with blister fluid from the surrounding normal-appearing skin. The expression of all other MMP messenger RNAs was similar in the EM lesions and normal-appearing skin. Selective up-regulation of MMP-9 in the EM lesions was found. Fibroblasts and, to a lesser degree, mononuclear cells were the sources of local MMP-9 production. These results demonstrate specific up-regulation of MMP-9 in the EM skin lesions of patients with acute Lyme disease. Bacterial induction of host proteases may play a role in the dissemination of B. burgdorferi."

This review describes the current knowledge of gene expression by B. burgdorferi in the tick and the mammalian host. The functions of the differentially regulated gene products as well as the factors that influence their expression are discussed. A thorough understanding of the changes in gene expression and the function of the differentially expressed antigens during the life cycle of the spirochete will allow a better control of this prevalent infection and the design of new, second generation vaccines to prevent infection with the spirochete."

By use of various textbooks on perinatal infections, multiple MEDLINE searches, and the reference list of all appropriate manuscripts, the appropriate English language literature was reviewed to define the relationship between various perinatal infections and stillbirths. Infection may cause stillbirth by a number of mechanisms, including direct infection, placental damage, and severe maternal illness. A large variety of organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. In developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which often have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. Ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. However, in areas where syphilis is very prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. Malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. The two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and Coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. Toxoplasma gondii, leptospirosis, Listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, Q fever, and Lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. Because infection-related stillbirth is relatively rare in developed countries, and those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult. However, in certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is so high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible simply by reducing maternal infections."

A recent article of mine, published in this journal, dealing primarily with therapy for Lyme disease, subsequently led to a highly critical commentary on some of its content. Too often, however, the authors of these criticisms came to premature conclusions based mostly on little or no published data. Instead, they relied almost exclusively on highly speculative theories and on citing the uncorroborated published or unpublished findings and anecdotal reports of others in an attempt to substantiate their weak claims. In this reply account of mine, I respond by providing compelling evidence, derived primarily from the extensive peer-reviewed published literature, that runs counter to most of their key critical concerns. Another goal here is to further clarify certain inconsistencies, related to the epidemiology and microbiology of Lyme disease and its causative agent, including the dubious 'cyst forms', that have an important bearing on therapy."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease represents a public health threat of major proportions. The murky science and acrimonious politics of Lyme disease have created barriers to reliable diagnosis and effective treatment of this protean illness. Two major clinical problems with the disease are the absence of a therapeutic end point in treating Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, and the presence of tick-borne co-infections, such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis and bartonellosis, that may complicate the course of the illness. From a pathophysiological standpoint, the affinity of B. burgdorferi for multiple cell types and the presence of non-replicating forms of the spirochete have contributed to persistent infection and failure of simple antibiotic regimens. Newer approaches to the treatment of Lyme disease should take into account its clinical complexity in co-infected patients and the possible need for prolonged combination therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of this potentially debilitating illness. The risk and prevention of human transmission of Lyme disease merit further study."

Seroepidemiologic testing was performed in 102 subjects with a history of tick bite, who either requested examination for a tick bite or were suspected of having tick-borne disease. The study was carried out during the 1998-1999 period in the area of the Vukovar-Srijem, Osijek-Baranya, and Brod-Posavina counties. Serum analysis was performed by indirect immunofluorescence assay for the detection of antibodies to causative agents of human monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent), human babesiosis (Babesia divergens), and rickettsiosis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used for the detection of antibodies to the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the cause of Lyme disease. The assays were performed at the Department of Microbiology, Osijek Public Health Institute in Osijek, and their results were confirmed at the Department of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Ehrlichia chaffensis antibodies were detected in 5 sera, and antibodies to the causative agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in 7 sera. A low titer of antibodies to the etiologic agent of babesiosis (Babesia microti) was detected only in a single serum. Eight sera that were positive for rickettsial antibodies contained rather high titers of antibodies against Rickettsia conorii, the agent of Mediterranean fever, and Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. In six out of these 8 sera, antibodies to Rickettsia typhi, the cause of murine typhus, were detected possibly as a cross-reaction with some \"newly detected\" rickettsia circulating in this part of Europe, most likely Rickettsia slovaca. Positive titer of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi was detected in 15 sera. The agents of human monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis and of possibly newly detected rickettsiae were indirectly demonstrated to circulate in eastern parts of Croatia. The results obtained by IFA failed to provide definite evidence for the circulation of the human babesiosis agent, because the IFA used in our study detected Babesia microti, which prevails in the USA, but not Babesia divergens, which is the predominant cause of the disease in Europe. Serologic evidence for Borrelia burgdorferi infection was demonstrated in 80% of the subjects suspected of having the skin manifestation of Lyme disease."

The levels of OspA and vlsE did not increase markedly in the midgut during feeding, but the mRNA levels of OspC increased significantly during feeding. In tick salivary glands, OspA mRNA levels actually decreased during feeding, while OspC levels increased six orders of magnitude. The mRNA levels of vlsE in tick salivary glands increased significantly only during the last 2 days of tick feeding. Overall, OspA mRNA was more abundant in tick midguts, whereas OspC and vlsE mRNA was more abundant in tick salivary glands. Further studies on the regulation of B. burgdorferi transcription activity during the act of transmission will lead to a better understanding of spirochete transmission dynamics, and hopefully facilitate the development of novel ways of interrupting the spread of Lyme disease."

The present study was conducted to determine whether this in-office test could be useful for detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in cats. Cats owned by clients of a veterinary hospital located in an area hyperendemic for Lyme disease were included in the study. When possible, cats with an outdoor lifestyle, bite wounds, or current tick infestation were recruited for the study to help ensure that animals with a likelihood of exposure to natural infection by B. burgdorferi would be included in the test group. Of the 24 cats tested, 17 samples were positive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi by the C6 ELISA kit. For all 17 of these samples, a duplicate sample tested by immunofluorescent assay (IFA) was in agreement with the ELISA. Five samples were negative by both assays. Two samples that were negative by the C6 ELISA test had low IFA titers (1:100). One of these two discrepant samples was negative and one was positive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi by the Western blot test. It was concluded that the C6 ELISA test performed with good agreement with the IFA and Western blot tests for detection of antibody to B. burgdorferi in the majority of cats tested. The test offers the advantages of producing a result rapidly (approximately 8 minutes), and it requires only two drops of serum, plasma, or whole blood."

It usually circulates among wildlife vertebrate reservoirs and vector ticks but may infect humans, causing multisystem problems. In far western and northern North America, the host reservoirs, tick vectors, and genospecies of Borrelia are well known but not so in the southern U.S., where there is controversy as to the presence of \"true\" LD. Here we report the presence of the LD spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) and Borrelia bissettii, three main reservoir hosts, and two enzootic tick vectors in the southeastern U.S. The two enzootic tick vectors, Ixodes affinis and Ixodes minor, rarely bite humans but are more important than the human biting \"bridge\" vector, Ixodes scapularis, in maintaining the enzootic spirochete cycle in nature. We also report extraordinary longevities and infections in the reservoir rodents Peromyscus gossypinus, Sigmodon hispidus, and Neotoma floridana."

We would like to present our experience with the treatment of borreliosis in collaboration with the Warsaw Medical Academy's Department of Infectious Disease. Fifty-nine children (aged between 14 months to 16 years) were hospitalized or ambulatory treated due to borreliosis during 5 years between 1997 and 2001. Erythema migrans was observed in 50 cases. The main localisations of erythema were: face, neck and chest. One patient showed erythema in several other localisations. Erythema migrans returned in two cases after therapy with Amoxicillin in one case at 6 months, in the other one 12 months later. The incubation period of erythema migrans in children varied from 4 to 30 days. Seven cases from the 59 occurred with central nervous system manifestations. These were children between 6 and 16 years of age. The most frequent (65.5%) clinical manifestations of the central nervous system were meningitis and facial nerve palsy, depression and headaches were observed in 6% of cases. In one case admission to hospital was the result of leucopaenia (2800/mm3), bradycardia, headache and fatigue. The positive serologic test results (Elisa assay) were confirmed in two independent laboratories. We had one patient (5 years old boy) with arthritic manifestations. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was based on clinical manifestations and positive serologic test results (Elisa assay). In the acute stage Elisa assay was positive in 33% only. The erythema migrans cases received treatment with Amoxicillin for two weeks, whilst patients with neuroborreliosis were treated for 4 weeks with Ceftriaxon."

In 4.8% of the cases no IgG bands were present and in 26.2% no IgM bands were present. With the exception of isolated p41 bands (59.5%), no band pattern exceeded 17%. Using manufacturer's instructions, test sensitivity in diagnosis of the early stage of Lyme disease is 61.9%, specificity 98.4% and positive and negative predictive values 92.8% and 88.8% respectively. Applying the EUCALB 5, 6 or 7 rules sensitivity increased to 73.8% although specificity decreased to 89.9%. Of the 129 specific control sera, 41.8% presented IgG anti-p41 and 10.8% IgM anti-p41. Patients with non-Lyme diseases that presented more IgG and IgM bands were those patients with syphilis (88.2%), patients with anti-HIV antibodies (57.8%) and patients with anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) (52.3%)."

Cost analysis takes account of the direct costs of consultation, laboratory tests, antibiotic treatment and management of any sequelae, as well as indirect costs of the loss of healthy time through illness. Standard costs for each element are derived from published information, and the proportions applied to each patient category are estimated from studies described elsewhere in the literature. Of the sample, 295 patients had evidence of early Lyme disease and 31 had late Lyme disease symptoms. Based on these figures, the total annual cost for Lyme disease, when projected to the whole of Scotland, is estimated to be significant at 331,000 Pounds (range 47,000-615,000 Pounds). The range is inevitably wide because it was not possible to document complete clinical and management histories on individual patients. In addition, some late Lyme disease sequelae will require management for more than 1 year, and costs are also identified that could justifiably be included for all the other patients who tested negative for Lyme disease. These data raise the question of whether there is sufficient focus on prevention and the best management of this disease."

Myocarditis and/or pericarditis may occur. Cardiomyopathy has been associated with B. burgdorferi in Europe, but not in the United States. Patients with unexplained atrioventricular block or myopericarditis should be questioned for recent travel to tick-endemic areas, and for a history of erythema migrans rash, \"viral-like\" illness, aseptic meningitis, cranial nerve palsy, radiculitis, or oligoarthritis. However, the absence of a recognized tick bite or rash does not rule out Lyme disease. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis should be supported by the presence of concurrent erythema migrans, or by positive results of 2-step laboratory testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi. False positive results may occur, emphasizing the importance of clinical judgment in attributing specific manifestations to B. burgdorferi infection. Carditis generally resolves spontaneously, but antimicrobial therapy can shorten symptom duration and prevent potential cardiac and non-cardiac sequelae.

Cross-sectional mail survey. United States. A randomly selected national sample of 6,000 pharmacists. None. An updated version of the 1998 study questionnaire was used to collect data about pharmacists' current involvement in adult or childhood immunizations, perceived obstacles to such involvement, and characteristics of pharmacist-administered immunization services. Four mailings in fall 2001 yielded a response rate of 21.2% (1,266 completed, usable surveys out of 5,958 deliverable surveys). Immunization activities that reportedly increased during this period, compared with results from the 1998 survey, include counseling about adult immunizations (increase from 11.9% to 14.7%), nurse-administered childhood immunizations (6.3% to 7.8%), nurse-administered adult immunizations (16.2% to 30.2%), pharmacist-administered childhood immunizations (0.9% to 1.3%), pharmacist-administered adult immunizations (2.2% to 6.8%), and immunization promotion (18.9% to 27.3%). Only counseling for childhood immunizations appears to have decreased slightly, from 13.4% to 8.9%. Willingness to provide all of the above immunization services also increased during the 1998-2001 period. In addition to flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines, pharmacists were administering vaccines for hepatitis A and B, Lyme disease, tetanus, and chicken pox, but flu shots accounted for the majority of immunizations being administered. Pharmacist involvement in childhood and adult immunizations has increased significantly in the last few years. Pharmacists perceived obstacles to their involvement in immunizations as less problematic."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease, exists in nature through a complex enzootic life cycle that involves both ticks and mammals. As Bb transitions between its two diverse niches, profound adaptive changes occur that are reflected in differential patterns of gene expression, particularly involving lipoprotein genes. Using a mutagenesis approach, we show that Rrp2 (gene BB0763), one of the proteins predicted by the Bb genome (www.tigr.org) to be a response regulator of a two-component sensory transduction system, is a pivotal regulator governing the expression of major membrane lipoproteins such as OspC, DbpA, and Mlp8, as well as many other mammalian infection-associated immunogens of Bb. Sequence analysis additionally suggested that Rrp2 is a bacterial enhancer-binding protein, essential for sigma54-dependent gene activation. Mutagenesis of a key amino acid residue within a putative activation domain revealed that Rrp2 controlled lipoprotein expression by governing the expression of the alternative sigma-factor sigmas in a sigma54-dependent manner. We therefore propose a signal transduction pathway involving Rrp2, sigma54, and sigmas, which in concert control the expression of key lipoproteins and other infection-associated immunogens in Bb."

		"abstract": "A novel, fast-growing spirochaete was isolated from the hard tick Hyalomma aegyptium (family Ixodidae, subfamily Metastriata) using Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK) II medium. Tick samples were taken during the summer of 2000 from the Istanbul area in northwestern Turkey. Sixty-seven of 153 adults (44%) and 72 of 185 nymphs (39%) were infected with the novel spirochaete, whereas none of the 20 larvae examined were infected. The optimal growth temperature of the spirochaete in BSK II medium was 34-37 degrees C, and it could grow at 39 degrees C. Doubling times at 34 and 37 degrees C were 5.3 and 5.1 h, respectively. Six pure cultures of the spirochaete were obtained and characterized by microscopic observation, sequence analysis of the flagellin gene (flaB), SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The spirochaete was morphologically similar to those of the genus Borrelia and contained a 41 kDa protein reactive with mAb H9724 specific to the flagellin of a Borrelia species. Polyclonal antibody raised to this spirochaete reacted with several antigen bands, whereas no bands were detected with Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia hermsii, Borrelia turicatae and Borrelia parkeri. The flaB sequences of the six isolates showed high similarity, with sequence similarity values ranging from 99.2 to 100%; however, the similarity of the isolates' flaB sequences to those of the Lyme-disease-related Borrelia and relapsing-fever-associated Borrelia species was less than 90%. These findings suggest that the unique spirochaete is a member of the genus Borrelia, and differs from previously described Borrelia species."

Apoptosis was determined at 0, 4, 24 h by Annexin V binding assay and propidium iodide staining, and by CD95 Apo-1 expression. Analysis was performed by multiparametric flow cytometry on CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 subset of lymphocytes. The binding of Annexin V increased at 24 h in T lymphocytes infected by living spirochetes at ratio 1:50; similar results were obtained with inactivated or sonicated spirochetes and lipidated OspC. The rate of Annexin V binding and pattern of CD95 over-expression were different in CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 subset; interleukine-10 (IL-10) was measured in supernatants of cultures after treatment with Borrelia preparations and with OspA and OspC, lipidated or not. Our data suggest that spirochetes were able to induce apoptosis on lymphocytes; the phenomenon appears associated with number of spirochetes, incubation time and the release of IL-10 in co-cultures. Moreover apoptosis was probably Fas-mediated and the cells involved were prevalently CD4."

We present a case of striatonigral degeneration, a form of multiple system atrophy, in Lyme-associated parkinsonism. A 63-year-old man presented with erythema migrans rash, joint pains, and tremors. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies and polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia burgdorferi were positive. Clinical parkinsonism was diagnosed by several neurologists. Despite treatment, the patient continued to decline, with progressive disability, cognitive dysfunction, rigidity, and pulmonary failure. At autopsy, the brain showed mild basal ganglia atrophy and substantia nigra depigmentation, with extensive striatal and substantia nigral neuronal loss and astrogliosis. No Lewy bodies were identified; however, ubiquitin-positive glial cytoplasmic inclusions were identified in striatal and nigral oligodendroglia. There were no perivascular or meningeal infiltrates, the classic findings of neuroborreliosis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of striatonigral degeneration in a patient with B burgdorferi infection of the central nervous system and clinical Lyme-associated parkinsonism."

Eighty positive clinical specimens (as determined by an independent testing method), including 76 synovial fluid, and 4 cerebral spinal fluid specimens, were found to be positive by the MagNA Pure/real-time PCR method of extraction and detection. This data shows that the MagNA Pure system can be used to extract B. burgdorferi DNA from clinical specimens, and when combined with real-time PCR, the result is an extremely sensitive assay with limited hands on time and rapid turn around times."

Internalized spirochetes were observed in larvae examined after 15 or 45 min immersion at 32 degrees C in liquid culture suspensions of low passage B. burgdorferi strain B31. Larval ticks immersed in low passage strain B31 were able to feed to repletion on white-footed mice. Midguts of larvae contained many spirochetes 1 wk postengorgement, while larvae incubated with high passage strain B31 were free of detectable spirochetes at the same interval. Larvae incubated with low passage strain B31 were competent to transmit the pathogen to mice, as shown by serology, reisolation of B. burgdorferi from mice, and xenodiagnosis. Ticks maintained the infection transstadially to the nymphal stage and transmitted the infection to naive mice, replicating an essential aspect of natural infection. This method requires no special equipment and allows artificial infection of large numbers of ticks at the larval stage. It will facilitate studies of the contribution of specific B. burgdorferi genetic loci to tick colonization."

Both rodent species are capable reservoirs for B. bissettii; infection rates for I. pacificus or I. spinipalpis nymphs fed as larvae on infected animals ranged from 50 to 57%. Moreover, both I. pacificus and I. spinipalpis are efficient vectors of B. bissettii. Viable infections were recorded from all rodents known to be exposed to one or more infected nymphs of I. spinipalpis (seven deer mice, two white mice) or I. pacificus (seven deer mice). In contrast, none of four New Zealand white rabbits fed upon by 90 I. pacificus nymphs with a probable B. bissettii infection rate of >50% became infected or seroconverted. The attachment and feeding success of laboratory-reared nymphs similarly confined with deer mice in muslin-covered wire-mesh cages for 24 h ranged from 0% for I. pacificus to 17-73% for I. spinipalpis. Notably, the I. pacificus nymphs were physiologically capable of feeding; nymphs failing to attach to rodents fed readily when placed in feeding capsules upon rabbits. We conclude that the dusky-footed woodrat and the deer mouse are capable experimental reservoir hosts of B. bissettii, and that both I. spinipalpis and I. pacificus are efficient experimental vectors of B. bissettii. However, the reluctance of I. pacificus nymphs to feed on certain rodents may limit its importance as an enzootic vector of B. burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes."

Nineteen patients (15 females, 4 males; mean age 38 years; range 14 to 61 years) with acute peripheral facial palsy were studied. Following routine otolaryngologic examination, all the patients underwent taste, Schirmer, and stapedial reflex tests to evaluate the level of the palsy. Laboratory examination included routine biochemistry analysis, serum C-reactive protein, rheumatoid factor, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgM and IgG antibodies were sought by ELISA in venous blood samples. Of the patient group, acute facial palsy was localized on the right in 12 patients (63.2%), and on the left in seven patients (36.8%). None of the patients had bilateral involvement. No IgM or IgG seropositivity for Borrelia burgdorferi was detected in the serum samples. In highly endemic areas, it may be helpful to detect or even to eliminate Lyme disease through screening of serum in patients with acute peripheral palsy."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease and Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) are two emergent tick-borne diseases transmitted by the widely distributed European tick Ixodes ricinus. The life cycle of the vector and the number of hosts involved requires the development of complex models which consider different routes of pathogen transmission including those occurring between ticks that co-feed on the same host. Hence, we consider here a general model for tick-borne infections. We assumed ticks feed on two types of host species, one competent for viraemic transmission of infection, the second incompetent but included a third transmission route through non-viraemic transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host. Since a blood meal lasts for several days these routes could lead to interesting nonlinearities in transmission rates, which may have important effects.We derive an explicit formula for the threshold for disease persistence in the case of viraemic transmission, also for the case of viraemic and non-viraemic transmission. From this formula, the effect of parameters on the persistence of infection can be determined. When only viraemic transmission occurs, we confirm that, while the density of the competent host has always a positive effect on infection persistence, the density of the incompetent host may have either a positive effect, by amplifying tick population, or a negative (\"dilution\") effect, by wasting tick bites on an incompetent host. With non-viraemic transmission, the \"dilution\" effect becomes less relevant. On the other hand, if the nonlinearity due to extended feeding is included, the dilution effect always occurs, but often at unrealistically high host densities. Finally, we incorporated the effects of tick aggregation on the hosts and correlation of tick stages and found that both had an important effect on infection persistence, if non-viraemic transmission occurred."

The influence of the route of administering the DNA and the use of oligodeoxynucleotides containing CpG-motifs on the development of the immune response was investigated. In both mouse strains, protein as well as gene-gun immunization induced Th2 type responses, whereas needle injection of plasmid DNA resulted in Th1 type antibody production. Co-injection of CpG-motifs did not significantly modify the response type in any immunization group, as indicated by only marginal changes of antibody subclass distribution. The protection rate after challenge with 10(4) B. burgdorferi organisms per mouse was between 80% and 100% for all groups.

We report the first cases of musical hallucinations in two patients with neurologic Lyme disease. Both subjects were women with clinical and laboratory evidence of chronic Lyme disease, progressive neurologic dysfunction, and abnormal magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. There was no evidence of hearing loss in either case. Musical hallucinations had a sudden onset and took the form of patriotic or operatic music. The auditory hallucinations disappeared with intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy in both patients, but the hallucinations recurred when i.v. antibiotic therapy was discontinued in one case. Response to therapy was accompanied by an increase in the CD57 lymphocyte subset in one patient, whereas recurrent hallucinations were associated with persistently low CD57 levels in the other case. We conclude that musical hallucinations may be associated with neurologic Lyme disease. These auditory hallucinations appear to respond to i.v. antibiotic therapy. Patients with musical hallucinations of unknown cause should be tested for infection with the Lyme disease spirochete."

In humans, neuroborreliosis has been correlated with enhanced concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, a sign of astrogliosis. Rhesus monkeys infected by us with B. burgdorferi showed evidence of astrogliosis, namely astrocyte proliferation and apoptosis. We formulated the hypothesis that astrogliosis could be caused by spirochetal lipoproteins. We established primary cultures of rhesus monkey astrocytes and stimulated the cells with recombinant lipidated outer surface protein A (L-OspA), a model B. burgdorferi lipoprotein, and tripalmitoyl-S-glyceryl-Cys-Ser-Lys(4)-OH (Pam(3)Cys), a synthetic lipopeptide that mimics the structure of the lipoprotein lipid moiety. L-OspA elicited not only astrocyte proliferation but also apoptosis, two features observed during astrogliosis. Astrocytes produced both IL-6 and TNF-alpha in response to L-OspA and Pam(3)Cys. Proliferation induced by L-OspA was diminished in the presence of an excess of anti-IL-6 antibody, and apoptosis induced by this lipoprotein was completely suppressed with anti-TNF-alpha antibody. Hence, IL-6 contributes to, and TNF-alpha determines, astrocyte proliferation and apoptosis, respectively, as elicited by lipoproteins. Our results provide proof of the principle that spirochetal lipoproteins could be key virulence factors in Lyme neuroborreliosis, and that astrogliosis might contribute to neuroborreliosis pathogenesis."

		"abstract": "Articular lesions in 157 patients infected with ixodes tick-borne borreliosis (ITB) in a central Russia's region set on, on the average, in 4 months after tick attack; they were associated with systemic signs of an early disseminated infection and set on less seldom in a late period. The most often encountered systemic signs were as follows: secondary erythema (32% of patients), neurological syndrome (13%), cardio-vascular lesions (22%), ocular lesions (13%) and hepatic lesions (8%). The articular syndrome manifested itself through arthralgia (53 patients) and arthritis (104 patients), which set on quite often in the tick-attack area. There was a peculiarity typical of articular lesions, which made it possible to distinguish them from other rheumatic disease. A dynamic follow-up revealed different clinical variations of Lyme's arthritis and peculiarities of the genetic profile, i.e. a higher prevalence of HLA A2, HLA-B15 and HLA-DR4 as well as of haplo-types HLA A2-B15 and HLAB15-DR4. The articular lesions were associated with an intensive specific humoral immune response. The instrumental examination methods, i.e. ultrasonography of joints as well as scintigraphy of bones and joints, did not reveal any qualitative differences between arthralgia and arthritis, which is indicative of a common nature different-intensity manifestations of arthropathy in thick-borne borreliosis."

In addition, RNA transcription was assessed for several prototype genes, including flaB, ospA, ospC, dbpA, arp, vlsE, fbp, oppA-2, and p37-42. Spirochete numbers were equivalent in C3H and C3H-scid mice at 1 or 2 weeks and then declined in C3H mice, but they continued to rise and then plateaued in C3H-scid mice. Gene transcription was likewise higher in C3H-scid mice than in C3H mice, particularly at 4 or more weeks of infection. Gene transcription showed variation among tissues, with the highest levels of transcription in heart and joint tissue, which are sites of inflammation."

Eleven patients underwent neuropsychological tests and Xenon(133)-regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) studies, using an external detector system. Each rCBF scan was age- and sex-matched to two archival, normal controls. While few differences were noted on gray-matter flow indices (ISI, fg), Lyme patients demonstrated significant flow reductions in white matter index (k(2)) (p=.004), particularly in the posterior temporal and parietal lobes bilaterally (p=.003). Flow reductions in white matter areas were significantly associated with deficits in memory (r=.66, p=.027) and visuospatial organization (r=.62, p=.041). Results suggest that Lyme encephalopathy may be a disease primarily affecting the cerebral white matter."

Dermal leukocytes and cytokines were assessed in fluids aspirated from epidermal suction blisters raised over EM lesions and skin of uninfected controls. Compared with corresponding peripheral blood, EM infiltrates were enriched for T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), contained lower proportions of neutrophils, and were virtually devoid of B cells. Enhanced expression of CD14 and HLA-DR by lesional neutrophils and macrophages indicated that these innate effector cells were highly activated. Staining for CD45RO and CD27 revealed that lesional T lymphocytes were predominantly Ag-experienced cells; furthermore, a subset of circulating T cells also appeared to be neosensitized. Lesional DC subsets, CD11c(+) (monocytoid) and CD11c(-) (plasmacytoid), expressed activation/maturation surface markers. Patients with multiple EM lesions had greater symptom scores and higher serum levels of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-2 than patients with solitary EM. IL-6 and IFN-gamma were the predominant cytokines in EM lesions; however, greater levels of both mediators were detected in blister fluids from patients with isolated EM. Circulating monocytes displayed significant increases in surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)1 and TLR2, while CD11c(+) DCs showed increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4; lesional macrophages and CD11c(+) and CD11c(-) DCs exhibited increases in expression of all three TLRs. These results demonstrate that Borrelia burgdorferi triggers innate and adaptive responses during early Lyme disease and emphasize the interdependence of these two arms of the immune response in the efforts of the host to contain spirochetal infection."

Tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infections were registered in separate systems. Influenza was the most frequently reported infectious disease with 576,449 cases, 63.9% less then in the previous year. The next most numerous were foodborne infections, which were reported in 24,393 cases, including 19,788 cases of infections caused by Salmonella sp. An increase in incidence was observed in the following diseases: viral hepatitis type A, rubella, measles and pertussis. Also the number of recorded cases of Lyme boreliosis and tickborne encephalitis were higher then in 2000. Incidence of AIDS remained within the range recorded during the last few years. In 2001 further drop in incidence of viral hepatitis type B was observed reaching the level of 6.2 per 100,000. It was the result of implemented comprehensive program of prophylactic measures, which brought incidence of this disease from the highest in Europe down to the level close to European average. Infectious diseases contributed to 0.75% of deaths. The most frequent cause of death among infectious diseases was tuberculosis and its sequels (1,061 cases). 13 cases of death due to tuberculosis occurred in people below 30 years of age."

VRPs expressing ospA that accumulated intracellularly (VRP OspA) or that was secreted from host cells (VRP tPA-OspA) were tested. Both VRP OspA and VRP tPA-OspA expressed ospA in immunized mice. Mice vaccinated with VRPs expressing secreted OspA produced significant amounts of anti-OspA antibodies, whereas VRPs expressing intracellular OspA were less immunogenic. The VRP method of delivery induced a Th1 type immune response unlike the recombinant OspA protein in Freund's adjuvant, which induced a mixed (Th1 and Th2) immune response. The VRP tPA-OspA construct induced an immune response that reduced the bacterial load in feeding Ixodes scapularis and blocked transmission to the host. These results indicate that VRPs are capable of providing protection against tick-borne B. burgdorferi, and potentially can be used for developing improved vaccines against Lyme disease."

The arthritogenicity and infectivity of these variants were tested in 3-week-old Syrian hamsters and in a vaccinated hamster model in which formalin-killed B. burgdorferi sensu stricto C-1-11 vaccinated animals develop severe arthritis after challenge with live, pathogenic, low-passage 297 isolate. Non-animal-passaged complement escape variants were infectious in both animal models as demonstrated by re-isolation from the infected animals and competitive PCR. IP injection of animal-passaged complement escape variants caused development of severe arthritis in vaccinated animals 5 weeks post-injection; animal passage of complement escape variants was necessary for isolation of arthritogenic spirochetes from high-passaged, non-arthritogenic, attenuated borrelia cultures. Complement escape variants synthesized outer surface protein E as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analyses. The complement-mediated selection technique in tissue co-culture provides a novel approach to the studies of Lyme disease, enables us to isolate pathogenically distinct borrelia populations from attenuated cultures and prepare a moderately infectious, non-pathogenic live vaccine against this illness."

The study group consisted of 64 patients. Twenty five were treated orally with doxycycline (Doxycyclini hyclas) 0.2 g/day and 39 were treated intravenously with ceftriaxone (Ceftriaxonum natricum) 2.0 g/day; treatment duration in both groups was 28 days. The symptoms of arthritis were most often seen in knee joints--45 patients (70%), then in shoulder joints--20 patients (31%), less frequently in ankle joints, elbow joints. In all patients remission of symptoms was seen after the treatment. The relapse of arthritis was seen slightly more frequently among patients treated with doxycycline 36% (9/25) than among those treated with ceftriaxone--23% (9/35), p = 0.402. The relapse was observed most often among patients older then 50 years. The relapse of Lyme arthritis was seen in about 28% of patients, mainly older than 50 years it and did not depend on the antibiotic administered."

The results of in vitro experiments suggest synthesis of chemokines during Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The aim of this study was to investigate serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of the following chemokines: interleukin-8 (Il-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha and 1 beta (MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta) in patients with neuroborreliosis. The study group consisted of 20 patients admitted to Neuroinfections and Infectious Diseases Department of the Medical University in Białystok. The control group consisted of 12 healthy persons from whom blood samples were obtained, and 10 patients without meningitis, from whom CSF samples were taken for diagnostic purposes. Chemokine concentrations were measured with ELISA kits before treatment (baseline) and after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy (post-treatment). Mean serum concentrations of chemokine were elevated in neuroborreliosis patients at baseline (Il-8--mean +/- SD = 668.25 +/- 661.51 pg/ml, MIP-1 alpha--124.90 +/- 89.37 pg/ml, MIP-1 beta--233.40 +/- 298.40 pg/ml) as compared to these in the control group (Il-8-23.72 +/- 7.68 pg/ml, MIP-1 alpha--36.81 +/- 4.74 pg/ml, MIP-1 beta--70.41 +/- 16.41 pg/ml). Post-treatment mean concentrations of Il-8 (197.70 +/- 285.56 pg/ml) and MIP-1 beta (102.70 +/- 42.56 pg/ml) remained significantly elevated, while the mean concentration of MIP-1 alpha (53.65 +/- 38.50 pg/ml) was insignificantly higher than that in the control group. The Il-8 mean concentration was the most elevated comparing to the controls and has decreased most significantly during the treatment. CSF concentrations of chemokines were significantly elevated both at baseline (Il-8--754.95 +/- 535.83 pg/ml, MIP-1 alpha--24.35 +/- 4.88 pg/ml, MIP-1 beta--27.6 +/- 8.38 pg/ml) and post-treatment (Il-8--98.20 +/- 74.74 pg/ml, MIP-1 alpha--18.60 +/- 2.87 pg/ml, MIP-1 beta--16.90 +/- 4.38 pg/ml) in comparison with the controls (Il-8--10.43 +/- 2.70 pg/ml, MIP-1 alpha--8.17 +/- 1.54 pg/ml, MIP-1 beta--7.27 +/- 1.58 pg/ml). MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta CSF concentrations were significantly lower than their concentrations in serum. The Il-8 CSF concentration did not differ significantly from its serum concentration. However, in some patients Il-8 CSF concentration was much higher than that in the serum, which suggests its significant synthesis within the cns and its role in the pathogenesis of B. burgdorferi meningitis. Chemokine CSF concentrations were not correlated with cytosis and CSF protein concentration. The results indicate the induction of Il-8, MIP-1 alpha and MIP-1 beta synthesis in the course of neuroborreliosis and a decrease of their concentrations during 2 weeks of treatment, however, without reaching the normal values."

In addition, Rickettsia, Leptospira, Mycoplasma species, and more could be involved in dogs diagnosed with a \"doxycycline-responsive\" disease. The author does not recommend treating asymptomatic Borrelia carrier dogs, but does recommend screening them for proteinuria and for exposure to other agents. A positive Lyme titer is a marker of exposure to Ixodes ticks and the agents they carry. The risk/benefit of vaccination will be understood better as the symptomatology and immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease are defined. Meanwhile, tick control is highly recommended for all dogs in Lyme-endemic areas."

One isolate of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, two of Borrelia garinii (Eurasian type), two of Borrelia afzelii, four of Borrelia lusitaniae and one of Borrelia valaisiana were identified. However, no Asian-type B. garinii was found. Interestingly, all Borrelia species that are known to be carried by I. ricinus were discovered among the 10 isolates. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of the Lyme borreliosis agent in Turkey."

The cells were isolated from whole blood of 25 patients and of 10 healthy donors and cultured in the presence of LPS. In the culture supernatants and serum the concentration of IL-6 with ELISA (BioSource) were measured. In patients we observed higher values of IL-6 released by unstimulated PMN and PBMC in compared with control. In contrast to control, we didn't observe increased the release of IL-6 by LPS-stimulated PMN and PBMC as compared to unstimulated cells. In the serum of patient we found increased the concentration of IL-6. The higher ability of PMN and PBMC from patients with Lyme disease to release of IL-6 and the lack response to additional stimulation indicate the activation of PMN and PBMC in vivo."

To improve on the accuracy of these methods and to simplify the procedure for testing large numbers of samples, a solid-phase sandwich hybridization system readily applicable to the detection of PCR products has been designed. This colorimetric detection system relies on the use of polybiotinylated detection probes and of specific capture oligonucleotides covalently linked at allocated positions on nylon membrane strips. From a phylogenetic analysis on a great number of ospA gene sequences, we have designed and synthesized a set of PCR primers specific to the five Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies present in Europe and a subset of probes (capture and detection probes) specific to these five genospecies (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, and B. lusitaniae). This combined PCR hybridization system was evaluated with a large number of various B. burgdorferi isolates and clinical specimens. These analyses clearly showed that the system could be used as a typing method to distinguish five genospecies belonging to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. In addition, the study showed that B. valaisiana strains might be more heterologous than suspected up to now and clustered into three genomic groups."

Three recombinant proteins, Tp0155, Tp0483, and Tp0751, demonstrated sensitivity values that ranged from 28 to 42%. In contrast, three other recombinant proteins exhibited the following sensitivity and specificity values: Tp0453, 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity; Tp92 (Tp0326), 98% sensitivity and 97% specificity; and Gpd (Tp0257), 91% sensitivity and 93% specificity. Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd also were recognized by sera from individuals with early primary syphilis that were nonreactive with the antilipoidal Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test. The reactivities of syphilis patient sera with Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd were proportional to the titers of these sera with the treponemal test MHA-TP (microhemagglutination assay for T. pallidum). Thus, the recombinant T. pallidum antigens Tp0453, Tp92, and Gpd show promise as diagnostic antigens in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based assay."

In this study, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) protocol targeting the Borrelia burgdorferi-specific recA gene was adapted for use with a Lightcycler for rapid detection and quantification of the Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi, in field-collected Ixodes scapularis ticks. The sensitivity of qPCR for detection of B. burgdorferi DNA in infected ticks was comparable to that of a well-established nested PCR targeting the 16S-23S rRNA spacer. Of the 498 I. scapularis ticks collected from four northeastern states (Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey), 91 of 438 (20.7%) nymphal ticks and 15 of 60 (25.0%) adult ticks were positive by qPCR assay. The number of spirochetes in individual ticks varied from 25 to 197,200 with a mean of 1,964 spirochetes per nymphal tick and a mean of 5,351 spirochetes per adult tick. No significant differences were found in the mean numbers of spirochetes counted either in nymphal ticks collected at different locations in these four states (P = 0.23 by one-way analysis of variance test) or in ticks infected with the three distinct ribosomal spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism types of B. burgdorferi (P = 0.39). A high degree of spirochete aggregation among infected ticks (variance-to-mean ratio of 24,877; moment estimate of k = 0.279) was observed. From the frequency distribution data and previously published transmission studies, we estimated that a minimum of 300 organisms may be required in a host-seeking nymphal tick to be able to transmit infection to mice while feeding on mice. These data indicate that real-time qPCR is a reliable approach for simultaneous detection and quantification of B. burgdorferi infection in field-collected ticks and can be used for ecological and epidemiological surveillance of Lyme disease spirochetes."

Laboratory testing of Lyme borreliosis includes culture, antibody detection using ELISA with whole extracts or recombinant chimeric borrelia proteins, immunoblot, and PCR with different levels of sensitivity and specificity for each test. Common skin manifestations of Lyme borreliosis include erythema migrans, lymphocytoma, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The last two conditions are usually caused by B garinii and B afzelii, respectively, which are seen more frequently in Europe than in America. Late extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis are characterised by carditis, neuroborreliosis, and arthritis. We present evidence-based treatment recommendations for Lyme borreliosis and review the prevention of Lyme borreliosis, including the Lyme vaccines."

The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term neuropsychologic and health outcomes of children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease. We conducted a matched cross-sectional study of children with facial nerve palsy in Connecticut who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national surveillance case definition for Lyme disease. We identified children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease from population-based data for the state of Connecticut from 1984 to 1991 as well as from selected clinical practices from 1984 to 1998. For each case, 2 controls without Lyme disease, matched by age, were selected by sequential digit dialing technique. Both patients and controls (or their parents) were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Outcomes included self/parents' reports both of symptoms and of abilities to perform normal daily activities since the diagnosis was made (or for an equivalent period of time for controls). In addition, the patients with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease were evaluated with a battery of neuropsychologic tests. Of the 43 patients, 30% were female and 93% were white. Median age at diagnosis was 8 years (range: 2-18 years). Mean time to follow-up was 49 months (range: 7-161 months). Of the patients, 16% had been treated parenterally with ceftriaxone and 84% had been treated orally with either doxycycline or amoxicillin. Overall, 79% believed they were cured of Lyme disease, 9% believed they were not cured, and 12% did not know. The proportions of patients and of matched controls that reported increased problems with normal daily activities (eg, exercise, academic performance, word recall, sleeping) were similar. Patients with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease were more likely than matched controls to report symptoms of neck pain, changes in behavior, pains in joints or muscles, numbness or funny sensations in nerves, and problems with memory, but three quarters of them did not attribute these problems to Lyme disease. Twenty patients agreed to undergo neuropsychologic testing; all had average to above average scores on tests of IQ (eg, mean IQ was 110.2), memory, learning, attention, concentration, math, reading and spelling performance, executive functioning, abstract thinking, sequential processing, visuospatial scanning, and motor speed. There were no apparent differences in outcomes between children who received oral versus parenteral treatment. The neuropsychologic and health outcomes of children with facial nerve palsy attributable to Lyme disease 7 to 161 months earlier are comparable to those who did not have Lyme disease."

All patients were treated with antibiotics at the time of diagnosis. We evaluated 96 cases on 709 separate occasions (median, eight evaluations per case). The erythema migrans rash resolved within 3 weeks in all of the 94 evaluable cases, none of whom developed an objective extracutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease. Of the 81 cases who were followed for >/=1 year, all but 8 (10%) were asymptomatic at their last visit, a mean (+/- SD) of 5.6 +/- 2.6 years into follow-up, and only 3 (4%) were symptomatic at every follow-up visit. Intercurrent tick bites were reported by 45 cases (47%), and 14 (15%) developed a second episode of erythema migrans. Four other cases who were asymptomatic seroconverted between years 2 and 5. The long-term outcome of patients with erythema migrans after antibiotic therapy was excellent, but patients from a highly endemic area in New York State remained at high risk of re-exposure to ticks and reinfection. Subjective symptoms during follow-up evaluations tended to be mild to moderate, intermittent, and associated with more symptomatic illness at the time of initial diagnosis."

Disease tracking is becoming an increasingly global task requiring implementation of more and more sophisticated control strategies and facilities for sustainable development. A promising initiative involves the use of satellite technology to monitor and forecast the spread of disease. The Health Early Warning System (HEWS) was designed based on successful application of satellite data in food programs as well as in other areas (e.g. weather, farming and fishing). The HEWS integrates data from communications, remote-sensing and positioning satellites. The purpose of this review is to present the main studies containing satellite data on public health in tropical areas. Satellite data has allowed development of more reactive epidemiological tracking networks better suited to increasing population mobility, correlation of environmental factors (vegetation index, rainfall and ocean surface color) with human, animal and insect factors in epidemiological studies and assessment of the role of such factors in the development or reappearance of disease. Satellite technology holds great promise for more efficient management of public health problems in tropical areas."

Mice were either infected with B. burgdorferi for 1 week or left uninfected. Lipoprotein-stimulated LN cells from infected C3H/HeJ mice produced significantly higher levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-gamma than did cells from C57BL/6J mice. Cells from uninfected mice did not respond. No TNF-alpha or IL-1beta were produced by LN cells from infected mice of either strain in response to lipoprotein or B. burgdorferi spirochetes. Unlike with IL-6 or IFN-gamma, LN cells from either strain failed to produce IL-10 in response to lipoproteins. However, the LN cells were able to produce this cytokine in response to B. burgdorferi spirochetes or after incubation with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate/ionomycin, anti-CD3 antibody alone or anti-CD3 combined with anti-CD28 antibodies. Addition of exogenous IL-10 to lipopeptide-stimulated cultures significantly reduced IFN-gamma and IL-6 production in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition was more effective with cells from disease-resistant C57BL/6J mice than with cells from disease-susceptible C3H/HeJ mice. The proclivity to disease of the C3H/HeJ mouse could be simultaneously based on the phenomena of enhanced inflammatory responsiveness to lipoproteins and diminished ability to respond to IL-10. An investigation of the determinants of these two phenomena could be used as a blueprint to elucidate the pathogenesis of Lyme disease in humans."

The ticks were capillary fed B. burgdorferi isolate 610, previously isolated from a dog with Lyme disease and grown in BSK medium. This isolate induced clinical signs in the dogs similar to those for dogs infested with ticks naturally infected with B. burgdorferi. Adult ticks were more efficient than nymphs in transmitting spirochetes to the dogs. One of five dogs infested with nymphal ticks capillary fed B. burgdorferi was skin biopsy culture and serologically positive, and demonstrated lameness. In contrast, all five dogs infested with adult female ticks that had been capillary fed with B. burgdorferi were culture and serologically positive, with one dog developing lameness. The immunoblot profiles of dogs challenged with female ticks infected by capillary feeding (8 weeks post challenge) were similar to immunoblots (4 weeks post challenge) from dogs challenged with naturally infected females collected in the field. These studies demonstrated that B. burgdorferi cultured in BSK medium can be capillary fed to either nymphal or adult female ticks under laboratory controlled conditions for the purpose of transmitting the spirochete to dogs during the tick's blood meal. This tick infection system would be useful for a controlled and defined challenge of vaccinated and non-vaccinated dogs for proper evaluation of vaccine efficacy, which is difficult to achieve using field-collected ticks. Furthermore, this system may also be useful for investigation of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, evaluation of the pathogenicity of new isolates of B. burgdorferi, or evaluation of antibiotic therapy."

Lyme borreliosis spirochetes are primarily transmitted by tick species within this complex. It has been hypothesized that the Lyme vector ticks around the world are closely related and represent a monophyletic group. This implies that vector competence in ixodid ticks for Lyme agents might have evolved only once. To test this hypothesis, we used a molecular phylogenetic approach. Two fragments of mitochondrial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid were sequenced from 11 species in the I. ricinus complex and from 16 other species of Ixodes. Phylogenetic analysis using Bayesian methodology indicated that the I. ricinus complex is not a monophyletic group unless 3 additional Ixodes species are included in it. The known major vectors of Lyme disease agents in different areas of the world are not sister taxa. This suggests that acquisition of the ability to transmit borreliosis agents in species of Ixodes may have multiple origins."

To date, it has retained the leading position among inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), with an average morbidity of 20 patients per year. In 88% of patients, the infection manifested with signs of meningitis or biphasic meningoencephalitis (ME). Monophasic course was recorded in only 12% of patients of older age, during which the first initial stage remained inapparent, and the disease manifested only with ME stage. An abortive type of TBE virus infection with fever, headache and other general symptoms of infection is presented. The initial stage of the disease, without subsequent CNS involvement, is rarely described. To determine the frequency and present epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as diagnostic procedures in patients suffering from abortive type of TBE. A prospective study was conducted in the period from 1997-2002, and included patients with possible tick-borne disease, examined at the Infectious Disease Department of the Koprivnica General Hospital. According to the set criteria, the study included patients of all age groups, sex and occupation, patients with febrile disease (T 38 degrees C) that developed within 6 weeks from the tick bite, patients who showed no signs of ME on their first examination, and patients in whom serologic analysis revealed recent infection with TBE virus. On admission to the hospital, detailed epidemiological and history data were collected, and clinical examination and laboratory testing were performed. ELISA test was used to detect specific IgM and IgG antibodies. At the same time all serum samples were tested for other tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease and human monocyte and granulocyte ehrlichiosis. Oral consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. A total of 127 patients met the study criteria. Specific antibodies to TBE virus were detected in 49 (38.5%) patients. After the latency period, 43 (87.7%) patients developed the second stage of ME disease. An abortive type of infection with TBE virus, without subsequent CNS involvement, was recorded in 6 (12.2%) patients. The diagnosis was confirmed in the first initial stage in 12% of patients and during the second ME stage in the remaining 37 (75.5%) patients. Active immunization against TBE was not conducted in any patient. We report on the first patients diagnosed with an abortive type of TBE virus infection in the Koprivnica-Krizevci County. The frequency of and new knowledge about this type of disease were assessed in the study."

		"abstract": "We previously showed that numerous polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) granule components efficiently kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. In addition, motile, granule-poor cytoplasts (U-Cyt) from human blood PMN can exert anti-Borrelia activity against opsonized B. burgdorferi independently of oxidative mechanisms. Here we show that lysates of U-Cyt also possess anti-Borrelia activity, a portion of which comes from the abundant cytosolic protein calprotectin. The anti-Borrelia activity of U-Cyt lysates and recombinant calprotectin was partially or completely reversed by specific antibody to calprotectin and by Zn(2+), a cation essential for the growth of B. burgdorferi and known to inhibit the antimicrobial activity of calprotectin. Quantitative microscopic and regrowth assays revealed that calprotectin acted in a bacteriostatic fashion against B. burgdorferi. We conclude that calprotectin, a potent bacteriostatic agent from a cell primarily recognized for its oxidative and granular antibacterial mechanisms, may play a modulatory role in infection by the Lyme spirochete, particularly at sites of acute inflammation."

The loss of these plasmids either eliminates infectivity (lp25) or significantly increases the 50% infective dose during a 2-week infection period (lp28-1). This study assessed the kinetics of bacterial dissemination in C3H/HeN mice infected with B. burgdorferi lacking either lp25 or lp28-1, as well as their wild-type parent, and tracked the development of specific borrelial antibodies over a 3-week period. The results indicated that the wild type and the lp28-1(-) strains were able to disseminate throughout the host, whereas the lp25(-) strain was cleared within 48 h of inoculation. While the wild-type B. burgdorferi persisted in tissues for the duration of the study, the lp28-1(-) mutant began clearing at day 8, with no detectable bacteria present by day 18. As expected, the wild-type strain persisted in C3H/HeN mice despite a strong humoral response; however, the lp28-1(-) mutant was cleared coincidently with the development of a modest immunoglobulin M response. The lp28-1(-) mutant was able to disseminate and persist in C3H-scid mice at a level indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells, confirming that acquired immunity was required for clearance in C3H/HeN mice. Thus, within an immunocompetent host, lp28-1-encoded proteins are not required for dissemination but are essential for persistence associated with Lyme borreliosis."

Tibiotarsal joint, ear, and heart tissues were monitored for spirochete numbers at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks postinoculation with 10(5) B. burgdorferi B31 clone 5A4 by using quantitative real-time PCR. The spirochete load in joint and ear tissue remained higher in the C3(-/-) mice than in the wild-type counterparts throughout the 12-week study, whereas the numbers in heart tissue of both groups of mice decreased substantially at 8 to 12 weeks postinfection. Histopathology scores for joint tissue were generally higher in the C3(-/-) mice compared to C57BL/6 controls at 2 and 4 weeks postinfection, which may reflect the presence of higher numbers of bacteria in the joints at these early time points. Levels of anti-B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin G tended to be reduced in the C3(-/-) mice compared to control mice. Furthermore, a 5.5-fold-lower number of the complement-sensitive Borrelia garinii was needed to infect C3(-/-) mice compared to C57BL/6 mice, indicating that its sensitivity to complement is one barrier to infection of the mouse model by B. garinii. These results indicate that the complement system may be important in controlling the early dissemination and progression of B. burgdorferi infection."

		"abstract": "With the exception of Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most prevalent tick-transmitted disease in Europe. Here we report clinical and epidemiologic features of the largest number of children with TBE reported to date and the longest (i.e. 42-year) retrospective survey of pediatric TBE cases from one geographic region. Case records of 371 patients, age 0 to 15 years, with serologically confirmed TBE and hospitalized between 1959 and 2000 at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the General Hospital Celje, Slovenia were reviewed and analyzed. Children represented 23.5% of 1578 confirmed TBE cases in the study period. Children were admitted to hospital throughout the year, but the majority were treated during summer months. In 178 (47.9%) children, a tick bite was noticed before admission. A biphasic course of illness occurred in 249 (67.1%) patients. The most common symptoms and signs of TBE were raised body temperature [>38 degrees C (n = 371)], headache and meningeal signs (n = 346), fatigue (n = 337) and vomiting (n = 327). Meningitis was diagnosed in 232 (62.5%) children, and meningoencephalitis was diagnosed in 139 (37.5%). There was a tendency for greater severity of TBE with increasing age. None of the children with TBE died, and none had permanent sequelae. The results of our study indicate that pediatric TBE is relatively mild disease with favorable outcome."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes a persistent infection in the vertebrate host even though infected animals mount an active immune response against the spirochete. One strategy used by the spirochete to evade vertebrate host immunity is to vary the structure and expression of outer membrane antigens. The vlsE locus represents the best-studied example of antigenic variation in B. burgdorferi. During vertebrate host infection, recombination between the active vlsE locus and silent, partial vlsE copies leads to gene conversion events and the generation of novel alleles at the expression site. In the present study, we followed a population of B. burgdorferi organisms moving through vertebrate host and tick stages to complete one transmission cycle. The major goal of the study was to determine if the vlsE locus was subject to different selective pressure and/or recombination frequency at different stages of the spirochete's life cycle. We report here that the vlsE genetic diversity generated within the rodent host was maintained through the larval and nymphal tick stages. Therefore, naturally infected ticks are likely to transmit spirochete populations with multiple vlsE alleles into naive vertebrate hosts. Although vlsE genetic diversity in mice was maintained through tick stages, the dominant vlsE alleles were different between tick stages as well as between individual ticks. We propose that population-level bottlenecks experienced by spirochetes, especially during the larval-to-nymphal molt, are responsible for individual infected ticks harboring different dominant vlsE alleles. Although vlsE genetic diversity is maintained through tick stages, the VlsE protein is unlikely to be of functional importance in the vector, because the protein was expressed by very few (<1%) bacteria in the vector."

Reported cases of human monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HME and HGE) and cases of \"other ehrlichiosis\" (OE), where the agent was unspecified, originated from 30 states. As anticipated, most HME cases were from the south-central and southeastern United States, while HGE was most commonly reported from the northeastern and upper-Midwestern region. State-level incident reports of 487 HME, 1,091 HGE, and 11 OE cases were evaluated. The average annual incidences of HME, HGE, and OE per million persons residing in states reporting disease were 0.7, 1.6, and 0.2, respectively. The median ages of HME (53 yr) and HGE cases (51 yr) were consistent with published patient series. Most (> 57%) ehrlichiosis patients were male. The results suggest that national surveillance for the ehrlichioses, although imperfect in coverage, will help define endemic regions and may be useful for monitoring long-term trends. Although the data appear representative of the demographic profiles established for HME and HGE, rigorous evaluation of the system is required. Methods are proposed for evaluating the quality and representativeness of HME and HGE surveillance data, using well-established surveillance systems for Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease."

E. canis was identified in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from dogs and Boophilus microplus ticks from goats. A new species of the genus Ehrlichia, closely related to E. chaffeensis, and Anaplasma marginale were found in B. microplus ticks from cattle in Tibet. In northern China, E. chaffeensis was detected in Dermacentor silvarum and I. persulcatus ticks; the granulocytic ehrlichial agents were detected in I. persulcatus ticks from an area where Lyme disease is endemic. Canine ehrlichiosis was found in southern China and E. canis and E. platys were identified in dogs; human ehrlichioses were demonstrated by amplifying the 16S rRNA genes of E. chaffeensis and granulocytic ehrlichial agents from patients' blood specimens. In comparison of 16S rRNA gene sequences, the sequences of E. chaffeensis, E. canis, and E. platys in China were found to be different from that in other countries at certain nucleotide positions. These results reveal that a variety of tick-borne ehrlichial agents and diseases exist in China, and the ehrlichial agents and their tick-vectors are same as or different from that in other countries at species or strain levels."

The available serology results indicate that HGE should be included in the screening panel when a tick-borne disease is suspected. Serological methods were applied; i.e. indirect immunofluorescence and Western Blot analysis. Sixty-five serum samples from 47 patients were analysed, of six patients sequential samples were available. 33.8% of the submitted samples were found positive in indirect immunofluorescence, Western Blot confirmed 46.1% of these positive samples. Although the causative agent and the vector for HGE, Ixodes ticks, are present in Belgium, serology for HGE is seldom solicited. Ehrlichiosis is apparently not always considered as a plausible or possible cause for illness, even when the patient presents with a history of tick bite. We present here a, true be it, incomplete picture of the present situation in Belgium, but nevertheless indicating that it is warranted to test patients with a history of tick bite not only for Lyme disease, but also for HGE."

Seven sera that contained similarly high titers of each response were then chosen randomly and adsorbed with OspC or a truncated OspC (OspC-Dra) containing the 50 amino acids nearest the carboxy terminus. Adsorption with OspC or OspC-Dra completely eliminated the borreliacidal activity in six (86%) of seven sera and significantly decreased the activity in the remaining serum (titer of 10,240 to 1,280). Moreover, OspC antibodies were no longer detected by OspC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or in a Western blot that contained native OspC.

In the present study, where 61% of the forestry workers were seropositive, we also tried to find a correlation between the results of serological tests and PCR tests with the clinical state of the patients. Despite finding IgM antibodies in 10 persons tested, which would indicate their recent infection, no DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in their blood. Also, no DNA of this bacteria was present in 8 persons with IgM and IgG antibodies. No genetic material of the bacteria was found in persons with IgG antibodies, indicating the possibility of chronic infection. The clinical data suggested past symptomatic infection (ECM), or even more often, asymptomatic infection with B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The development of experimental Lyme arthritis has been correlated with the expression of a number of chemokines and cytokines, however, none of these have been measured directly from the arthritic joint. We examined the temporal expression of IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12p70, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, KC, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 directly from the tibiotarsal joint in arthritis-resistant C57BL/6 (B6) and -susceptible C3H/He (C3H) mice. Only the chemokines KC and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were differentially expressed in joints of B6 and C3H mice and correlated with the development of Lyme arthritis. Infection of CXCR2(-/-) mice on either genetic background resulted in a significant decrease in the development of pathology, although infection of CCR2(-/-) mice had little or no effect. Neutrophils in CXCR2(-/-) mice were marginalized within blood vessels and could not enter the joint tissue. These results suggest that chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils into the infected joint is a key requirement for the development of experimental Lyme arthritis."

The diagnosis of Lyme disease was suspected by serologic antibody detection and confirmed by Western immunoblot assay. Pacing was necessary because an unstable escape rhythm persisted. After treatment, atrioventricular conduction recovered. Lyme disease, a tick borne disease, is discussed with emphasis on cardiac involvement: atrioventricular block is a frequent complication of early disseminated disease. If treated with adequate antibiotic therapy, the prognosis is good."

		"abstract": "An understanding of the spatial distribution of the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is a fundamental component in assessing human risk for Lyme disease in much of the United States. Although a county-level vector distribution map exists for the United States, its accuracy is limited by arbitrary categories of its reported presence. It is unknown whether reported positive areas can support established populations and whether negative areas are suitable for established populations. The steadily increasing range of I. scapularis in the United States suggests that all suitable habitats are not currently occupied. Therefore, we developed a spatially predictive logistic model for I. scapularis in the 48 conterminous states to improve the previous vector distribution map. We used ground-observed environmental data to predict the probability of established I. scapularis populations. The autologistic analysis showed that maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures as well as vapor pressure significantly contribute to population maintenance with an accuracy of 95% (p < 0.0001). A cutoff probability for habitat suitability was assessed by sensitivity analysis and was used to reclassify the previous distribution map. The spatially modeled relationship between I. scapularis presence and large-scale environmental data provides a robust suitability model that reveals essential environmental determinants of habitat suitability, predicts emerging areas of Lyme disease risk, and generates the future pattern of I. scapularis across the United States."

We here present a case of a previously healthy woman who was hospitalized for symptoms of meningitis. On the second day of her hospital stay, she developed bilateral facial paresis. Later, the patient developed also tachycardia and dysrhythmias. A thorough diagnostic procedure including lumbar puncture, routine blood investigation with serological tests, MRI of the brain, Holter monitoring and transoesophageal echocardiographia, revealed meningitis with radiculitis, facial paresis and myocarditis. The clinical triad of meningitis, radiculitis and facial palsy is known as the Bannwarth Syndrome (Lyme disease). The patient was treated with ceftriaxone and recovered well. Despite repeatedly taken serological tests, Borrelia burgdorferi immunoglobulins were not detected. Acquired bilateral facial paralysis can occur in several diseases of infectious, neurological, idiopathic, iatrogenic, toxic, neoplastic or traumatic origin. In this article, we review the differential diagnoses and treatment options of bilateral facial paresis and present a scheme that is helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of this condition."

The study to control all active stages of L. scapularis Say was initiated in April 1995, at the Goddard Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Beltsville, Maryland (treated location), and the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center, Laurel, Maryland (non-treated location). The locations had similar flora and fauna, and pre-treatment sampling (April to October 1995) of deer, plots, and mice for I. scapularis indicated nearly similar tick populations at both locations. After pre-treatment sampling, 4 deer '4-poster' stations were placed at NASA, while the control area received none. Ten percent permethrin, supplied to 4 roller covers on each station, was passively transferred to the head, neck, and ears of free-ranging deer feeding at the stations. This treatment resulted in elimination of adult I. scapularis on sampled deer (100% control) by the 2nd y of treatment and reductions of immature tick stages on mice. During the 3rd y of treatment, adult, nymphal, and larval questing ticks were reduced by 91-100% from sampled plots, and nymphal and larval ticks were reduced by 70-95% on sampled mice."

A 74-year-old man presented with rapid onset of weakness, numbness, and tingling in his legs, with symptoms ascending to his hands and forearms within days. He recalled an insect bite to his scapular area 2 weeks earlier. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse hyperintensity from T1 through T12. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay identified infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease. Giemsa-stained blood smears identified ring forms later recognized by polymerase chain reaction as Babesia microti, the piroplasm responsible for babesiosis. Initial examination revealed C7 motor and T3 sensory complete tetraplegia, with recovery to T4 paraplegia by 2 months. The history, physical examination, imaging, and serologic studies were consistent with transverse myelitis related to Lyme disease and babesiosis. The severity and permanence of this patient's deficits were greater than those reported in the majority of previous cases of transverse myelitis due to Lyme disease alone, suggesting a possible role for coinfection with babesiosis."

In the same way, specific primers exist to amplify the OspA gene of B. burgdorferi ss., B. garinii and B. afzelii. The aim of the study was to develop species-specific mAb and PCR primers for the phenotypic and genetic identification of B. valaisiana. This study describes a mAb that targets OspA of B. valaisiana and primers targeting the OspA gene of this species. As the monoclonal antibody A116k did not react with strains NE231, M7, M53 and Frank and no amplification was observed with strains NE231, M7 and M53, the existence of two subgroups among European B. valaisiana species was confirmed. The association of both monoclonal antibody A116k and primers Bval 1F and Bval 1R allows to specific identification of the B. valaisiana isolates belonging to subgroup 1."

The authors conducted a single-center randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial on 55 patients with Lyme disease with persistent severe fatigue at least 6 or more months after antibiotic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 28 days of IV ceftriaxone or placebo. The primary clinical outcomes were improvement in fatigue, defined by a change of 0.7 points or more on an 11-item fatigue questionnaire, and improvement in cognitive function (mental speed), defined by a change of 25% or more on a test of reaction time. The primary laboratory outcome was an experimental measure of CSF infection, outer surface protein A (OspA). Outcome data were collected at the 6-month visit. Patients assigned to ceftriaxone showed improvement in disabling fatigue compared to the placebo group (rate ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.50 to 8.03; p = 0.001). No beneficial treatment effect was observed for cognitive function or the laboratory measure of persistent infection. Four patients, three of whom were on placebo, had adverse events associated with treatment, which required hospitalization. Ceftriaxone therapy in patients with PLS with severe fatigue was associated with an improvement in fatigue but not with cognitive function or an experimental laboratory measure of infection in this study. Because fatigue (a nonspecific symptom) was the only outcome that improved and because treatment was associated with adverse events, this study does not support the use of additional antibiotic therapy with parenteral ceftriaxone in post-treatment, persistently fatigued patients with PLS."

To determine whether antibiotic therapy improves cognitive function in two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies of patients with PTCLD. A total of 129 patients with a physician-documented history of Lyme disease from three study sites in the northeast United States were studied. Seventy-eight were seropositive for IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, and 51 were seronegative. Patients in each group were randomly assigned to receive IV ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 30 days followed by oral doxycycline 200 mg daily for 60 days or matching IV and oral placebos. Assessments were made at 90 and 180 days after treatment. Symptom severity was measured from the cognitive functioning, pain, and role functioning scales of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS). Memory, attention, and executive functioning were assessed using objective tests. Mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. There were no significant baseline differences between seropositive and seronegative groups. Both groups reported a high frequency of MOS symptoms, depression, and somatic complaints but had normal baseline neuropsychological test scores. The combined groups showed significant decreases in MOS symptoms, higher objective test scores, and improved mood between baseline and 90 days. However, there were no significant differences between those receiving antibiotics and placebo. Patients with post-treatment chronic Lyme disease who have symptoms but show no evidence of persisting Borrelia infection do not show objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Additional antibiotic therapy was not more beneficial than administering placebo."

		"abstract": "Antibody responses to outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi may occur during periods of arthritis late in the clinical course of untreated Lyme disease. These antibody responses are paradoxical, given the conclusive evidence demonstrating that B. burgdorferi transmitted to the mammalian host expresses little or no OspA. The parallel occurrence of OspA antibodies and arthritic episodes suggests that OspA expression is upregulated during infection with B. burgdorferi. We hypothesized that this was due to the inflammatory environment caused by the immune response to the spirochete. To test our hypothesis, we adapted an in vivo model that mimics the host-pathogen interaction. Dialysis chambers containing B. burgdorferi were implanted into the peritoneal cavities of mice in the presence or absence of zymosan, a yeast cell wall extract that induces inflammation. Spirochetes were harvested 2 days later, and OspA expression was assessed at the protein and transcription level by Western blotting and real-time reverse transcription-PCR, respectively. Flow cytometry was also utilized to evaluate OspA protein expression on individual spirochetes. B. burgdorferi maintained in an inflammatory in vivo environment show an increased OspA expression relative to B. burgdorferi kept under normal in vivo conditions. Furthermore, host-adapted B. burgdorferi with a low OspA phenotype upregulates OspA expression when transferred to an inflammatory in vivo environment. The results obtained by these techniques uniformly identify inflammation as a mediator of in vivo OspA expression in host-adapted B. burgdorferi, providing insights into the behavior of live spirochetes in the mammalian host."

The Pam(3)Cys modification provides adjuvant activity for inducing humoral responses, suggesting that TLR2 could function as the adjuvant receptor for the OspA vaccine. The importance of TLR2 in the humoral response to OspA was confirmed, because overall levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) were reduced in TLR2-deficient mice, when compared with those in wild-type mice. However, the levels of production of IgG1 were similar in both mouse strains, and the levels of induction of protective immunity were comparable. Unlipidated OspA was not immunogenic in wild-type or TLR2-deficient mice, indicating the lipid modification was active in the absence of TLR2. These findings indicate that the Pam(3)Cys modification of bacterial lipoprotein has adjuvant properties independent of TLR2 signaling."

Typically, plasmid content analysis has been carried out by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and confirmed by Southern hybridization. However, multiple plasmids of virtually identical sizes (e.g., lp28 and cp32) complicate the interpretation of such data. The present study was undertaken to investigate the complete plasmid complements of B. burgdorferi clinical isolates cultivated from patients from a single region where early Lyme disease is endemic. A total of 21 isolates obtained from the skin biopsy or blood samples of Lyme disease patients were examined for their complete plasmid complements by Southern hybridization and plasmid-specific PCR analysis. All clinical isolates harbored at least six of the nine previously characterized cp32s. Fourteen isolates harbored all B31-like linear plasmids, and seven isolates simultaneously lacked lp56, lp38, and some segments of lp28-1. The distinctive plasmid profile observed in these seven isolates was specific to organisms that had ribosomal spacer type 2 and pulsed-field gel type A, which implies a clonal origin for this genotype. The presence of nearly identical complements of multiple linear and circular plasmids in all of the human isolates suggests that these plasmids may be particularly necessary for infection, adaptation, and/or maintenance in the infected host."

		"abstract": "A total of 1,345 Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected from northeastern China were investigated for the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophila and Borrelia burgdorferi by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sixty-two (4.6%) ticks were positive for A. phagocytophila and 454 (33.8%) were positive for B. burgdorferi. Seven (0.5%) were coinfected with both agents. Sequence analysis of 919-basepair PCR amplicons revealed three types of A. phagocytophila. Type 1 was identical to the published sequences of A. phagocytophilas responsible for human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE). The other two variants differed from the HGE agent sequence at one and four positions, respectively. These findings imply that infection with A. phagocytophila poses a potential health threat to both humans and animals in northeastern China, and that ehrlichiosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients with a history of tick bite, particularly when clinical manifestations are atypical for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causing agent of Lyme disease, an infectious disease frequently occurring in the United States, Europe, and Northern Asia. Currently, diagnosis of and vaccination strategies against this pathogen are exclusively based on proteinaceous structures. Here we report on a novel class of immunogenic glycolipids purified from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31. Employing a butanol/water extraction procedure with subsequent Bligh/Dyer extraction of the organic phase, thin layer chromatography analysis revealed the presence of three distinct glycolipids, which were chemically analyzed employing combined gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, and NMR. We identified acylated cholesteryl galactoside (ACG) next to cholesteryl galactoside and alpha-monogalactosyl-diacylglycerol. After extensive purification, the glycolipids investigated failed to cause proinflammatory responses in human cells transfected with human toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 or -4. However, we observed a marked recognition of ACG by sera derived from patients suffering from Lyme disease. These data indicate that newly described ACG is involved in developing host immunity during Lyme disease and thus may be useful for diagnosis and vaccination."

To address the nature of the immune response during the course of B burgdorferi meningoradiculitis, with special respect to the early and late changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Serial immunophenotyping was performed and cytokine measurements were obtained in the peripheral blood and CSF of 12 European patients with definite B burgdorferi meningoradiculitis. Early during infection and before initiation of treatment, we observed high levels of interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, and IL-8, and large numbers of B cells and plasma cells in the CSF of most patients. At the same time, we found a mainly unspecific intrathecal antibody synthesis. During resolution of the infection, cytokine levels normalized rapidly and plasma cells disappeared from the CSF. In parallel, the percentage of B cells in the CSF increased over several months, accompanied by rising levels of intrathecally produced B burgdorferi-specific antibodies. Our findings demonstrate that the early phase of B burgdorferi meningoradiculitis is characterized by a well-coordinated immune response involving specific cytokine release and plasma cell recruitment, followed by a long-lasting, antigen-specific B-cell response in the central nervous system."

Results suggest that I. sinensis can acquire active Lyme disease spirochetes by feeding on infected mice of Kunming strains (KM), and the positive rates of larvae and nymph I. sinensis infected were 94.0% and 92.0%, respectively. I. sinensis maintained active spirochetes during blood digestion and molting periods; the subsequent questing tick stages were also found to be infected and infectious to naive KM mice, which resulted in more than 66.7% spirochete-positive KM mice. I. sinensis can transmit the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia garinii from infected KM mice to naive KM mice during larvae-nymph and nymph-adult periods. Therefore, I. sinensis might be considered as a competent vector of Lyme disease in South China."

We determined the fatty acid type, sugar identity, anomeric configuration, and substituent type and position. The structures were identified as cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside (B. burgdorferi glycolipid 1, BbGL-I), and 1,2-di-O-acyl-3-O-alpha-d-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol (BbGL-II). The major fatty acids were palmitate and oleate. The structures were corroborated by gas-liquid chromatography MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy, fast atom bombardment MS, detailed NMR spectrometry, and metabolic labeling. This is a previously undescribed demonstration of a cholesteryl galactoside in bacteria. Lipopolysaccharide was not detected in B. burgdorferi. The two glycolipids have several properties suggesting they may function as lipopolysaccharide: both are main components of the bacterial membrane, surface exposed, and have a three-domain structure. BbGL-I elicited specific antibodies in mice and rabbits, and BbGL-II elicited antibodies that reacted with both glycolipids."

They are also considered to be important vectors for the transmission of human infectious diseases. In the present study we used polymer chain reaction (PCR) amplification analysis to determine the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi and Ehrlichia phagocytophila, the agents of, respectively, Lyme borreliosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, among ticks inhabiting the area of Monti Lepini, a wild area located in the Latium Region of Italy. A total of 141 I. ricinus ticks (125 nymphs and 16 adults) were collected in the studied area. Total DNAs were extracted from I. ricinus nymphs (pooled in groups of five) and from individual adults. The DNA samples were examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato and E. phagocytophila by PCR using two specific pairs of oligonucleotides that specifically amplify distinct DNA regions of the 16S rRNA genes of the two species. The prevalence of vectors infected with B. burgdorferi s. l. was 16% in pooled nymphs samples, and 12.5% in adult ticks, while E. phagocytophila was found only in pooled nymphs samples (8%). Three genomospecies were identified, namely Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia valaisiana, in samples found positive for B. burgdorferi s. l. No sample was found positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto."

Serum samples were obtained from 52 children with clinically typical and serologically confirmed LA. In IgG ELISAs, at diagnosis, 50 samples were positive for BBK32, 51 for DbpA, 40 for DbpB, and 51 for IR(6). In the posttreatment follow-up, the rate of decline of the antibodies to the recombinant protein antigens or to IR(6) did not appear useful in the prediction of the treatment response or the clinical course of LA. Yet, IR(6) seems to have the greatest potential to be used universally in the diagnostic serology of Lyme borreliosis (LB). Alternate to that, the use of several specific borrelial antigens, in parallel, might improve the accuracy of serology for LB."

Lyme borreliosis is caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks. The disease occurs in endemic pockets with an incidence of from 50 to more than 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Despite increasing knowledge about the virulence factors of the spirochaetes and the immune response of the host, many aspects of the pathogenesis, for example of chronic treatment-resistant disease, are still a matter of debate. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and confirmed by serology. Diagnostic problems arise from patients with non-specific symptoms and a positive IgG serology. In about 80% of the patients, the disease can be cured by adequate antibiotic therapy. Evidence-based guidelines for treatment have been recently published. The only vaccine to prevent Lyme disease, licensed in the USA, has been discontinued due to disappointing sales despite good efficacy and tolerability."

		"abstract": "From tick bite to treatment, Lyme disease is a serious concern for those who reside in parts of the world where this infectious disorder is endemic. It is a multi-system and sometimes multi-stage illness caused by a unique spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, which reaches its human victim after being transmitted by a bite from Ixodid (deer) ticks that are found mostly in certain parts of North America and Europe. Management of Lyme disease patients is usually not problematic, especially in endemic areas, where rapid diagnosis and response to the recommended treatment regimen most often leads to a favourable outcome. Initially this review article describes briefly some of the key historical, epidemiological, microbiological and diagnostic aspects of Lyme disease. With this foundation, there follows a more in-depth coverage on the proper management of asymptomatic tick bite victims and of those suffering from authentic Lyme disease. Much of the key information related to proper therapy is based on results that have accrued from rigorously conducted clinical studies. The final part of this review then concentrates on some of the more controversial issues involving diagnosis and treatment, the availability and possible usefulness of other non-antibiotic treatment options and the prospects for more efficient antibiotic treatment regimens as well as development of a newer class of effective antibiotics, based on promising preclinical data."

Adult ticks showed a significantly higher rate of infection with both borreliae and Anaplasma phagocytophila. Borrelia garinii (55.9%) was detected most frequently, followed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (32.4%), Borrelia afzelii (17.6%), and Borrelia valaisiana (5.9%). Four ticks had dual infection with Borrelia garinii and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Two of the Borrelia-positive ticks were coinfected with Anaplasma phagocytophila."

We compared the prevalence of these spirochetes to that of Lyme disease spirochetes transmitted by the same vector. Relapsing fever-like spirochetes infect 3.5% of questing vector ticks in our three central European sites near the Rhein Valley. These spirochetes differ genetically from their American and Asian analogs while being relatively homogeneous in the region we sampled. The Lyme disease genospecies most commonly detected in central Europe are distributed broadly, whereas those that are less frequently found appear to be place-specific. The absence of co-infected ticks suggests that relapsing fever-like and Lyme disease spirochetes may not share hosts. Exposure risk for relapsing fever-like spirochetes is similar to that of certain Lyme disease genospecies. Although many persons may be bitten by ticks infected by relapsing fever-like spirochetes, health implications remain unknown."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis is becoming a more frequent complication of Lyme disease, primarily due to the increasing incidence of this disease in the United States. Cardiovascular manifestations of Lyme disease often occur within 21 days of exposure and include fluctuating degrees of atrioventricular (AV) block, acute myopericarditis or mild left ventricular dysfunction and rarely cardiomegaly or fatal pericarditis. AV block can vary from first-, second-, third-degree heart block, to junctional rhythm and asystolic pauses. Patients with suspected or known Lyme disease presenting with cardiac symptoms, or patients in an endemic area presenting with cardiac symptoms with no other cardiac risk factors should have a screening electrocardiogram along with Lyme titers. We present a case of third-degree AV block due to Lyme carditis, illustrating one of the cardiac complications of Lyme disease. This disease is usually self-limiting when treated appropriately with antibiotics, and does not require permanent cardiac pacing."

Between April and September of 1999, 317 subjects in Baltimore County, Maryland, were randomized to receive either tick-related or general health-related educational materials bimonthly through the mail. At each of three clinic visits, participants completed a self-administered questionnaire and provided a serum sample. Anti-recombinant tick calreticulin antibody (ARTCA), measured in ng/ micro l, was used as a biomarker of tick bites. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to determine 1) whether the educational intervention was associated with a change in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) and 2) whether change in KAB predicted change in ARTCA levels. Proportions of desired responses increased significantly among intervention subjects versus the comparison group on KAB measures related to examining the body for ticks and insect repellent use. Levels of ARTCA were low among all study subjects. Only six of 37 models exhibited a significant relation between change in a KAB variable and change in ARTCA levels over time. The behavioral intervention was associated with an increase in the KAB measures in the intervention group, but this change was not associated with change in ARTCA levels."

		"abstract": "Host cell binding is an essential step in colonization by many bacterial pathogens, and the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, which colonizes multiple tissues, is capable of attachment to diverse cell types. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are ubiquitously expressed on mammalian cells and are recognized by multiple B. burgdorferi surface proteins. We previously showed that B. burgdorferi strains differ in the particular spectrum of GAGs that they recognize, leading to differences in the cultured mammalian cell types that they efficiently bind. The molecular basis of these binding specificities remains undefined, due to the difficulty of analyzing multiple, potentially redundant cell attachment pathways and to the paucity of genetic tools for this pathogen. In the current study, we show that the expression of decorin-binding protein (Dbp) A and/or DbpB, two B. burgdorferi surface proteins that bind GAGs, is sufficient to convert a high-passage nonadherent B. burgdorferi strain into one that efficiently binds 293 epithelial cells. Epithelial cell attachment was mediated by dermatan sulfate, and, consistent with this GAG-binding specificity, these recombinant strains did not bind EA-Hy926 endothelial cells. The GAG-binding properties of bacteria expressing DbpB or DbpA were distinguishable, and DbpB but not DbpA promoted spirochetal attachment to C6 glial cells. Thus, DbpA and DbpB may each play central but distinct roles in cell type-specific binding by Lyme disease spirochetes. This study illustrates that transformation of high-passage B. burgdorferi strains may provide a relatively simple genetic approach to analyze virulence-associated phenotypes conferred by multiple bacterial factors."

In addition, the predicted amino-terminal sequences of I. scapularis MPs were found by Edman degradation of PVDF-transferred SDS/PAGE-separated tick saliva proteins, indicating that these putative enzymes are secreted. Furthermore, saliva has a metal-dependent proteolytic activity towards gelatin, fibrin(ogen), and fibronectin, but not collagen or laminin. Accordingly, I. scapularis saliva has a rather specific metalloprotease similar to the hemorrhagic proteases of snake venoms. This is the first description of such activity in tick saliva and its role in tick feeding and Borrelia transmission is discussed."

In humans the response to nonspecific B. burgdorferi Ags has required 3-6 weeks. The response to OspA has rarely been detected by conventional methodology until months after infection, despite demonstrable T cell reactivity. Tick inoculation and low-dose intradermal inoculation animal models have been characterized by a comparable response to OspA. Using more sensitive biotin-avidin immunoblots and immune complex (IC) dissociation techniques, we demonstrated in humans that Ab to OspA is formed early but may remain at low levels or bound in IC. To see if this was a universal biologic response, animal models were analyzed by these methods. The results with mice, monkeys and rabbits show that IC Ab to OspA may be detected at the onset of infection. The data suggest that these animal models may be used to understand the immune response to B. burgdorferi and the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. With attention to unique B. burgdorferi Ags, these results are likely to have both clinical and diagnostic importance."

		"abstract": "The approaches to diagnosing and treating Lyme disease (LD) have been improved and refined as a result of basic and clinical research, and considerable practical experience. In addition, there have been recent studies that have allowed improvements in the ability to prevent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. This paper will review the relevant literature and address recent developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of LD. Issues specifically related to the management of children will be identified. Controversies regarding treatment approaches will be examined in some detail. Understanding the clinical manifestations, or stage, of LD is crucial when approaching both diagnosis and treatment. Early localized disease is best diagnosed by recognizing the characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Early disease will frequently, but not always, be accompanied by a detectable antibody response, particularly IgM antibody to the spirochete. Late disease, chiefly arthritis, is generally associated with high levels of IgG antibody. Western blot technology allows confirmation of enzyme immunoassay results and is especially useful when the latter is in the low or equivocal range. Early localized disease responds well to oral antibacterial therapy. Early disseminated disease, often associated with neurologic findings, may require parenteral therapy. The arthritis associated with LD frequently responds to oral antibacterials, but some refractory cases may require intravenous therapy, and occasionally surgery. Doxycycline is the oral antibacterial of choice, while amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil are alternatives that may be preferred in young children. Owing to its long half-life and once daily dose administration, intravenous ceftriaxone has become the accepted standard for parenteral therapy. Tick avoidance has long been the mainstay for preventing LD. Antibacterial prophylaxis, using doxycycline, for tick bites has been shown to be an effective approach to prevention, but its relevance to pediatrics is uncertain. Vaccines designed to prevent infection have also been developed."

From 1992 2000, Dutchess County reported more cases of Lyme disease than any other county in the United States, consistently ranking among the top ten in incidence rates. We analyzed 1992-2000 Dutchess County Lyme disease surveillance data to characterize Lyme disease trends, identify high-risk populations, and examine the frequency of the characteristic lesion, erythema migrans. A Lyme disease case was defined as a person with physician-diagnosed erythema migrans or at least one late manifestation of the disease, with laboratory confirmation. A surveillance database of cases reported in Dutchess County from 1992-2000 was obtained from the New York State Department of Health. Annual incidence rates by age, gender, race, ethnicity, and ZIP codes, and frequency of erythema migrans were calculated. From 1992 through 2000, a total of 9,548 cases of Lyme disease were reported by Dutchess County to the New York State Department of Health, for a crude mean annual incidence rate of 400 cases per 100,000 persons per year. The incidence rate peaked at 683/100,000 in 1996, and then declined from 1998 to 2000. A bimodal age distribution was seen, with the initial peak among children aged 5-9 years (617/100,000) and the second peak among adults aged 60-64 years (627/100,000). A male preponderance was clearly seen between the ages of 5-19 years, and beyond the age of 60 years. Highest incidence rates were reported in central Dutchess County. Onset of illness occurred most frequently in June, July, and August. Ninety-four percent of cases occurred among the predominantly white population, which had the highest incidence rate (431/100,000) among the races. Incidence rate for non-Hispanics was more than double that for Hispanics. Eighty-one percent of reported cases had erythema migrans. While some prevention programs could be broadly targeted to the entire Dutchess County population, other interventions might be most effective if they focused on the high-risk population groups and areas defined in this report. The high proportion of cases with erythema migrans suggests that early diagnosis and treatment should be effective in reducing late-stage complications of Lyme disease in Dutchess County. Surveillance data for other endemic counties and states can be similarly analyzed to enhance and monitor local prevention programs."

Lyme disease and babesiosis have also been reported on the West Coast, but less frequently. Lyme disease presents frequently with a skin lesion known as erythema migrans (EM), and diagnostic tests are not necessary if the lesion is classical. Those patients presenting without EM or with atypical skin lesions may need laboratory confirmation. The most frequently used laboratory modality consists of the 2-step serological assays, employing a sensitive ELISA as a first step, followed by IgG and/or IgM immunoblots. Current guidelines for interpretation are those recommended by the CDC. HGE and babesiosis are febrile illnesses with non-specific signs and symptoms. Both infections may present with routine laboratory abnormalities, including leukopenia and/or thrombocytopenia in HGE and anemia in babesiosis. Moderate elevations of liver enzymes may occur in all three tick-borne infections. Specific diagnostic modalities for acute-phase HGE include buffy coat smear examination, culture and PCR. Culture appears to have the greatest sensitivity of the three tests. Babesiosis can be diagnosed by peripheral blood examination for the intraerythrocytic parasites, PCR or serology. Co-infections with these agents exist, but they should be documented by detection of the organisms rather than by serology, since seroprevalence rates are high in endemic areas."

Following colonization of the skin, spirochetes can disseminate throughout the body, resulting in complications that can include ocular, cardiac, neural, and skeletal disease. We have previously shown that B. burgdorferi expresses two closely related decorin-binding adhesins (DbpA and DbpB) of the MSCRAMM (microbial surface component recognizing adhesive matrix molecule) type that can mediate bacterial attachment to extracellular matrices in the host. Furthermore, three Lys residues in DbpA appear to be critical for the binding of DbpA to decorin. We have now characterized the interaction of DbpA and decorin further by using a synthetic peptide approach. We synthesized a panel of peptides that spanned the DbpA sequence and examined their ability to inhibit the binding of intact DbpA to decorin. From these studies, we identified a decorin-binding peptide that lost this activity if the sequence was either scrambled or if a critical Lys residue was chemically modified. A minimal decorin-binding peptide was identified by examining a set of truncated peptides. One peptide is proposed to contain the primary decorin-binding site in DbpA. By comparing the amino acid sequences of 29 different DbpA homologs from different B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates, we discovered that the identified decorin-binding sequence was quite variable. Therefore, we synthesized a new panel of peptides containing the putative decorin-binding sequence of the different DbpA homologs. All of these peptides were active in our decorin-binding assay, and consensus decorin binding motifs are discussed."

		"abstract": "Immune evasion by Lyme spirochetes is a multifactorial process involving numerous mechanisms. The OspE protein family undergoes antigenic variation during infection and binds factor H (fH) and possibly FHL-1/reconectin. In Borrelia burgdorferi B31MI, the OspE family consists of three paralogs: BBL39 (ErpA), BBP38, and BBN38 (ErpP). BBL39 and BBP38 are identical and therefore are referred to here as BBL39. The goals of this study were to assess the specificity of the antibody (Ab) response to the OspE paralogs and to identify the domains or determinants of OspE that are required for the binding of fH and OspE-targeting Abs that develop during infection. Here we demonstrate that at least some of the anti-OspE Abs produced during infection are paralog specific and that Ab binding requires conformational determinants whose formation requires both the N- and C-terminal domains of OspE. The binding of fH to OspE was also found to be dependent on conformational determinants. It is also demonstrated here that all of the OspE paralogs expressed by B. burgdorferi B31MI are capable of binding fH. The binding of fH to members of the OspF protein family was also assessed. In contrast to an earlier report, no binding of BBO39 or BBR42 to human fH was detected. Lastly, a series of competitive binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses, designed to determine if fH and infection serum Abs bind to the same sites on OspE, revealed that these ligands interact with different regions of OspE."

		"abstract": "We showed that Borrelia burgdorferi-vaccinated interferon gamma-deficient (IFN-gamma(0)) mice challenged with the Lyme spirochete developed a prominent chronic severe destructive osteoarthropathy. The immune response underlying the development of the severe destructive arthritis involves interleukin-17 (IL-17). Treatment of vaccinated IFN-gamma(0) mice challenged with B. burgdorferi with anti-IL-17 antibody delayed the onset of swelling of the hind paws but, more importantly, inhibited the development of arthritis. Histopathologic examination confirmed that treatment with anti-IL-17 antibody prevented the destructive arthropathy seen in vaccinated and challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice. Similar preventive results were obtained when vaccinated and challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice were treated with anti-IL-17 receptor antibody or sequentially with anti-IL-17 antibody followed by anti-IL-17 receptor antibody. By contrast, treatment of vaccinated and challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice with recombinant IL-17 (rIL-17) did not alter the development and progression of arthritis found in vaccinated and challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice without treatment with rIL-17. Therapeutic intervention may be a realistic approach to prevent arthritis, especially if IL-17 is involved in the perpetuation of chronic or intermittent arthritis."

		"abstract": "The general concept that during infection of mice the Borrelia burgdorferi surface protein composition differs profoundly from that of tick-borne or in vitro-cultivated spirochetes is well established. Specific knowledge concerning the differences is limited because the small numbers of spirochetes present in tissue have not been amenable to direct compositional analysis. In this report we describe novel means for studying the antigenic composition of host-adapted Borrelia (HAB). The detergent Triton X-114 was used to extract the detergent-phase HAB proteins from mouse ears, ankles, knees, and hearts. Immunoblot analysis revealed a profile distinct from that of in vitro-cultivated Borrelia (IVCB). OspA and OspB were not found in the tissues of SCID mice 17 days after infection. The amounts of antigenic variation protein VlsE and the relative amounts of its transcripts were markedly increased in ear, ankle, and knee tissues but not in heart tissue. VlsE existed as isoforms having both different unit sizes and discrete lower molecular masses. The hydrophobic smaller forms of VlsE were also found in IVCB. The amounts of the surface protein (OspC) and the decorin binding protein (DbpA) were increased in ear, ankle, knee, and heart tissues, as were the relative amounts of their transcripts. Along with these findings regarding VlsE, OspC, and DbpA, two-dimensional immunoblot analysis with immune sera also revealed additional details of the antigenic composition of HAB extracted from ear, heart, and joint tissues. A variety of novel antigens, including antigens with molecular masses of 65 and 30 kDa, were found to be upregulated in mouse tissues. Extraction of hydrophobic B. burgdorferi antigens from tissue provides a powerful tool for determining the antigenic composition of HAB."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection that can lead to chronic, debilitating problems if not recognized or treated appropriately. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is maintained in nature by a complex enzootic cycle involving Ixodes ticks and mammalian hosts. Many previous studies support the notion that B. burgdorferi differentially expresses numerous genes and proteins to help it adapt to growth in the mammalian host. In this regard, several studies have utilized a dialysis membrane chamber (DMC) cultivation system to generate \"mammalian host-adapted\" spirochetes for the identification of genes selectively expressed during mammalian infection. Here, we have exploited the DMC cultivation system in conjunction with microarray technology to examine the global changes in gene expression that occur in the mammalian host. To identify genes regulated by only mammal-specific signals and not by temperature, borrelial microarrays were hybridized with cDNA generated either from organisms temperature shifted in vitro from 23 degrees C to 37 degrees C or from organisms cultivated by using the DMC model system. Statistical analyses of the combined data sets revealed that 125 genes were expressed at significantly different levels in the mammalian host, with almost equivalent numbers of genes being up- or down-regulated by B. burgdorferi within DMCs compared to those undergoing temperature shift. Interestingly, during DMC cultivation, the vast majority of genes identified on the plasmids were down-regulated (79%), while the differentially expressed chromosomal genes were almost entirely up-regulated (93%). Global analysis of the upstream promoter regions of differentially expressed genes revealed that several share a common motif that may be important in transcriptional regulation during mammalian infection. Among genes with known or putative functions, the cell envelope category, which includes outer membrane proteins, was found to contain the most differentially expressed genes. The combined findings have generated a subset of genes that can now be further characterized to help define their role or roles with regard to B. burgdorferi virulence and Lyme disease pathogenesis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease in humans. The genome of the sequenced type strain B31 MI consists of a linear chromosome, 12 linear plasmids, and 9 circular plasmids. Previous studies by other investigators indicated that some of these plasmids are essential for the survival of the spirochetes in vivo but not in vitro. We have studied plasmid stability during in vitro growth at 23 and 35 degrees C, conditions that approximate the temperatures of the tick vector and the mammalian host, respectively. Starting with two clones that have all 21 plasmids, we investigated plasmid maintenance within the population and on a clonal level. After three passages (27 generations), the cultures were no longer homogeneous and some derivative clones had already lost multiple plasmids. Despite this, one of six clones analyzed after 25 passages (225 generations) retained all but one plasmid (cp9) and was able to complete the mouse-tick-mouse infectious cycle. We analyzed protein composition and regulation of gene expression of clones differing in plasmid content after serial passages. All clones tested exhibited temperature-regulated expression of several proteins, including OspC. In addition, analysis of cultures inoculated from frozen stocks suggests that freezing and/or thawing contributes to heterogeneity in the outgrowth population with respect to plasmid content. Our investigations show that in vitro propagation of a clone leads to a heterogeneous population but that virulent clones can persist through extended passage. We therefore conclude that isogenicity of clones must be confirmed irrespective of their in vitro passage history."

		"abstract": "An unusual feature of bacteria in the genus Borrelia (causative agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever) is a segmented genome consisting of multiple linear DNA molecules with covalently closed hairpin ends, known as telomeres. The hairpin telomeres are generated by a DNA breakage and reunion process (telomere resolution) promoted by ResT, an enzyme using an active site related to that of tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. In this study, we define the minimal sequence requirements for a functional telomere and identify specific basepairs that appear to be important for telomere resolution. In addition, we show that the two naturally occurring and distinct telomere spacings found in B. burgdorferi can both be efficiently processed by ResT. This flexibility for substrate utilization by ResT supports the argument for a single telomere resolvase in Borrelia. Furthermore, although telomere recognition requires sequence specificity in part of the substrate, DNA cleavage is instead position dependent and occurs at a fixed distance from the axis of symmetry and the conserved sequence of box 3 in the different replicated telomere substrates. This positional dependence for DNA cleavage has not been observed previously for a tyrosine recombinase."

The B. burgdorferi outer membrane protein P66 was previously identified as a ligand for beta3-chain integrins by using a variety of biochemical approaches. Although the earlier data suggested that P66 is an adhesin that mediates B. burgdorferi attachment to beta3-chain integrins, lack of genetic systems in B. burgdorferi precluded definitive demonstration of a role for P66 in beta3 integrin attachment by intact borreliae. Recent advances in the genetic manipulation of B. burgdorferi have now made possible the targeted disruption of the p66 gene. Mutants in p66 show dramatically reduced attachment to integrin alphavbeta3. This is, to our knowledge, the first description of the targeted disruption of a candidate B. burgdorferi virulence factor with a known biochemical function that can be quantified, and demonstrates the importance of B. burgdorferi P66 in the attachment of this pathogenic spirochete to a human cell-surface receptor."

The study objectives were to investigate the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of infections among patients who presented with fever after a tick-bite, and to detect newly described pathogens, including Ehrlichia, Babesia and Rickettsia helvetica, in North-Eastern Switzerland. : We studied 75 patients (41 male, 34 female, median age 38 years, among them 10 children) who had fever within 3 weeks after a tick-bite. Paired sera were tested for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Anaplasma (Ehrlichia) phagocytophila, Babesia microti, B. divergens, and Rickettsia helvetica. In addition, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction was used to detect Ehrlichia. Clinical data were obtained at baseline and at 1 and 2 year follow-up. Tick-borne infections were confirmed or possible in 36 (48 %) patients: 7 (9 %) Erythema migrans, 6 (8 %) other specific manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, 6 (8 %) Lyme borreliosis presenting as non-specific febrile illness, 8 (11 %) tick-borne encephalitis, 7 (10 %) granulocytic ehrlichiosis, 1 B. microti infection in a traveler from the US and 6 (8 %) dual infections. In 8 (11 %) patients serological findings were suggesting possible acute or past R. helvetica infection. Among patients with fever after a tick-bite, Lyme borreliosis was most frequently found. There was no evidence for babesiosis among the resident population. Serologic data suggest that human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and R. helvetica infections may be endemic in Switzerland. Among 50 % of the patients no tick-borne infections could be diagnosed."

Although derived from linear plasmids, the vectors are maintained in circular form in B. burgdorferi, indicating that plasmid maintenance functions are conserved, regardless of DNA form. Finally, derivatives of these vectors indicate that paralogous gene family 49 is apparently not required for either circular or linear plasmid replication."

To evaluate different durations of oral doxycycline treatment and the combination of oral doxycycline and a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone for treatment of patients with early Lyme disease. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Single-center university hospital. 180 patients with erythema migrans. Ten days of oral doxycycline, with or without a single intravenous dose of ceftriaxone, or 20 days of oral doxycycline. Outcome was based on clinical observations and neurocognitive testing. Efficacy was assessed at 20 days, 3 months, 12 months, and 30 months. At all time points, the complete response rate was similar for the three treatment groups in both on-study and intention-to-treat analyses. In the on-study analysis, the complete response rate at 30 months was 83.9% in the 20-day doxycycline group, 90.3% in the 10-day doxycycline group, and 86.5% in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (P > 0.2). The only patient with treatment failure (10-day doxycycline group) developed meningitis on day 18. There were no significant differences in the results of neurocognitive testing among the three treatment groups and a separate control group without Lyme disease. Diarrhea occurred significantly more often in the doxycycline-ceftriaxone group (35%) than in either of the other two groups (P < 0.001). Extending treatment with doxycycline from 10 to 20 days or adding one dose of ceftriaxone to the beginning of a 10-day course of doxycycline did not enhance therapeutic efficacy in patients with erythema migrans. Regardless of regimen, objective evidence of treatment failure was extremely rare."

Immunological analyses of serum samples collected from infected patients coupled with comparative sequence analyses indicated that bapA gene sequences are quite stable but the encoded proteins do not provoke a strong immune response in most individuals. Conversely, EppA proteins are much more antigenic but vary widely in sequence between different bacteria. Considerable evidence of insertion, deletion and other mutations within eppA genes was observed. A number of significant recombination events were also found to have occurred in regions flanking bapA genes, while the genes themselves rarely exhibited evidence of mutation, suggesting strong selective pressure to maintain BapA sequences within narrow limits. Data from these and other studies suggest important roles for BapA and EppA during the Borrelia burgdorferi infectious cycle."

It was suggested that different species possess different organotropisms and may preferentially cause distinct clinical manifestations of Lyme disease. Molecular analyses revealed a strong association of B. afzelii with the late cutaneous manifestation acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, whereas B. garinii was predominantly identified in clinical samples from patients with neuroborreliosis. PCR-based analyses of samples from European patients with Lyme arthritis had given controversial results, but B. burgdorferi sensu stricto appears to be the major pathogen. The identity of the infecting species seems to be a major determinant in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis, although its complex immunopathological background and its clinical heterogeneity clearly indicate concomitant factors. Thus, characterization of the infecting organism at the species level on the one hand and linkage of clinical data with pathogenetically relevant immune parameters on the other, shall lead to a more precise understanding of the pathogenesis and the individual clinical course of Lyme borrelioses."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a complex infectious disease affecting multiple organic systems. The most frequent complications are of a dermatological, rheumatological, ophthalmological, cardiac and neurological nature. Among the neurological complications, pseudotumour cerebri is considered to be a rare manifestation of the disease. Hypothyroidism, however, is known to be only infrequently associated to pseudotumour cerebri. Paparone recently reported a case in which Lyme disease and primary hypothyroidism were concurrent, and Becker and Trock described the case of three patients with concurrent thyrotoxicosis and Lyme disease. We present the case of a 19 year old female with pseudotumour cerebri and hypothyroidism secondary to autoimmune thyroiditis, which improved after treating her for concomitant Lyme. We suggest there is a common aetiopathogenic connection between the three processes through autoimmune thyroiditis triggered by Borrelia burgdorferi. Thus, in this patient, the pseudotumour cerebri could be due to either a direct mechanism, triggered by B. burgdorferi, or indirectly, through hypothyroidism secondary to thyroiditis induced by B. burgdorferi, or perhaps to both mechanisms. It might be wise to consider infection by B. burgdorferi in patients with pseudotumour cerebri or thyroiditis coming from areas in which Lyme disease is endemic"

		"abstract": "Lyme disease has been described as one possible cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular neuronitis. The necessity of serological diagnosis and its therapeutic consequences have been discussed controversially. 344 patients with acute sensorineural hearing loss and 66 patients with vestibular neuronitis were examined in retrospect. By means of ELISA (Enzygnost Borreliosis, Dade Behring Marburg) the specific prevalences of IgG- and IgM-antibodies against borrelia in serum were evaluated. The frequency of seroprevalences for both diseases were compared to those given in the literature. Neurootological findings of the seropositive patients were compared with those of seronegative and analysed statistically. 15.7 % of the patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss had positive levels of IgG-antibodies. IgM-titers were elevated in 4.7 % of the patients. The seroprevalences for IgM and IgG were above those described by other investigators for the healthy population. Patients with positive IgM-antibodies showed more often low frequency hearing loss than IgG-positive patients. 18.2 % of the patients with neuronitis vestibularis had IgG- and 1.5 % IgM-antibodies against Borrelia. Whereas IgG occurred more often than known for the healthy population, IgM was within the limit for the healthy population. The seropositive group did not show any remarkable neurootological signs compared with the seronegative group. Because of the elevated seroprevalences Borrelia infections may be one possible but very rare cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vestibular neuronitis. Low frequency hearing loss may be a sign for an infection with Borrelia as an etiological factor especially in combination with seropositive titers. In case of the presence of IgM-antibodies, patients may be treated with oral antibiotics (Doxycyclin, Cefuroxim). In patients with neuronitis vestibularis a neuroborreliosis should be excluded by means of lumbar puncture."

Using the polymerase chain reaction the ticks were examined for 16S rDNA of the Ehrlichia phagocytophila genogroup and for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato recA and flagellin genes. None of the Finnish ticks was found to be infected with E. phagocytophila, whereas 3% of the Estonian ticks were positive for this organism. The rate of Finnish ticks infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato varied from 0% to 11.6% (mean 5%; 9% for adult and 4% for nymphal ticks). The corresponding rate for Estonian ticks was 15%. Borrelia afzelii was the most common genospecies in both Finnish (2.6%) and Estonian (12%) ticks. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in 2.0% of the Finnish ticks, but in none of the Estonian ticks. These results suggest that the E. phagocytophila genogroup is very rare in Finnish ticks, although the ticks were collected from an area endemic for Lyme borreliosis. In Estonia, E. phagocytophila is found in ticks and may cause disease."

All patients admitted to a rheumatology department of a nonendemic area of France for evaluation of joint disease with onset within the last year.

We included 90 patients, 51 women and 39 men, with a mean age of 48.1 +/- 17.9 years. Mean duration of joint symptoms was 4.3 +/- 4.3 months, with a median of 3 months. A patient (1.1%) reported a tick bite and no patients had a history of erythema migrans. Lyme serology was negative in all 90 patients. These results do not support routine Lyme serology in patients living in nonendemic areas and presenting with early inflammatory joint disease. However, Lyme serology remains appropriate in patients with features suggestive of Lyme disease. Given that Lyme disease is amenable to curative treatment, a larger study is in order to confirm our findings."

Our method was to analyze each foundation 'Lyme disease' premise within the context of available medical and veterinary literature, then to reconstruct the disease model consistent with the preponderance of that data. We find the present conceptualization of the illness seriously truncated, with a high likelihood of two distinct but connected forms of human B. burgdorferi infection. The yet-unrecognized form appears to have a broader clinical presentation, wider geographic distribution, and vastly greater prevalence. We conclude that 'Lyme disease' currently acknowledges only its zoonosis arm and is a limited conceptualization of a far more pervasive and unrecognized infection state that must be considered a global epidemic."

Although the borrelial luxS gene functionally complemented a LuxS deficiency in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha, AI-2-like activity could not be detected within B. burgdorferi culture supernatants or concentrated cell lysates. Finally, a luxS-deficient mutant of B. burgdorferi was infectious at wild-type levels when it was intradermally needle inoculated into mice, indicating that expression of luxS probably is not required for infectivity but, at the very least, is not essential for mammalian host adaptation. Our findings also challenge the notion that a LuxS/AI-2 quorum-sensing system is operative in B. burgdorferi."

In one study of a group of uveitis patients, including those with Behçet's disease, increased seropositivity to B. burgdorferi was reported by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi has been found to be as high as 36% in some rural areas of Turkey, although Lyme disease caused by B. burgdorferi is quite rare. In this study, we investigated the seroreactivity to B. burgdorferi antigens in patients with Behçet's disease and compared it with that of healthy and disease controls. This study was conducted in Izmir in western Turkey. B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG antibodies were tested by ELISA in the sera of patients with Behçet's disease ( n=30), rheumatoid arthritis patients as disease controls ( n=31), and healthy controls ( n=31). Positive results were confirmed by Western blotting. The difference in B. burgdorferi seropositivity between the groups was not significant by any method. Seroreactivity to B. burgdorferi antigens by ELISA was detected in 26.7% of the patients with Behçet's disease, 35.5% of those with rheumatoid arthritis, and 19.4% of the healthy controls. Immunoblots were positive in 13.3% of the Behçet's disease patients, 22.6% of the rheumatoid arthritis patients, and 12.9% of healthy controls. These results suggest no association between Behçet's disease and B. burgdorferi infection."

		"abstract": "Many mechanical and systemic conditions can cause joint pain and synovitis. When rheumatologic illness is suspected, the initial evaluation begins with an accurate history, physical examination, and selective use of confirmatory testing, which can help avoid common pitfalls inherent in serologic evaluation. Tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, HLA-B27, uric acid level, and Lyme disease, either alone or in combination, may support certain diagnoses. Using these tests nonselectively may yield false-positive results, causing unnecessary concern and expense. However, using these tests effectively may reduce the number of unneeded invasive procedures."

At 99% specificity, the overall sensitivities for detecting IgG antibody to rVlsE1 or C6 in samples from patients with diverse manifestations of Lyme disease were equivalent to that of 2-tiered testing. When data were considered in parallel, 2 combinations (IgG responses to either rVlsE1 or C6 in parallel with IgM responses to pepC10) maintained high specificity (98%) and were significantly more sensitive than 2-tiered analysis in detecting antibodies to B. burgdorferi in patients with acute erythema migrans. In later stages of Lyme disease, the sensitivities of the in parallel tests and 2-tiered testing were high and statistically equivalent."

Eight (33%) of the 24 patients with early manifestations and 18 (86%) of the 21 patients with late manifestations had a <4-fold decline in IgG anti-VlsE titers approximately 6 months after successful antibiotic treatment. Of 32 additional patients, 13 (50%) with early manifestations and 5 (83%) with late manifestations still had positive anti-VlsE titers 8-15 years after successful antibiotic treatment.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochaete that causes Lyme borreliosis, contains 21 linear and circular plasmids thought to be important for survival in mammals or ticks. Our results demonstrate that the gene BBE22 encoding a nicotinamidase is capable of replacing the requirement for the 25 kb linear plasmid lp25 during mammalian infection. Transformation of B. burgdorferi lacking lp25 with a shuttle vector containing the lp25 gene BBE22 (pBBE22) restored infectivity in mice to a level comparable to that of wild-type Borrelia. This complementation also restored the growth and host adaptation of lp25-B. burgdorferi in dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted in rats. A single Cys to Ala conversion at the putative active site of BBE22 abrogated the ability of pBBE22 to re-establish infectivity or growth in DMCs. Additional Salmonella typhimurium complementation studies and enzymatic analysis demonstrated that the BBE22 gene product has nicotinamidase activity and is most probably required for the biosynthesis of NAD. These results indicate that some plasmid-encoded products fulfil physiological functions required in the enzootic cycle of pathogenic Borrelia."

However, this relationship has not been quantified in terms that would guide wildlife management in areas in which the public is, or is likely to become, exposed to infected ticks. In this study, deer density and tick abundance were measured in an emergent area for Lyme disease at three spatial scales using estimation methods appropriate for each. Simple linear regression was used to relate (1) the number of ticks found on deer at tagging stations in southern Maine to harvest-derived estimates of the density of deer within the towns in which they were killed, (2) tick densities estimated from fall flagging counts to deer densities estimated from pellet group counts made within multiple transects distributed through 5.2-km2 study sites, and (3) tick counts to pellet group counts within the individual transects. At the broadest scale, ticks on deer decreased with elevation and distance from the coast and increased with deer density, although deer and tick presence were only weakly related. Among the 5.2-km2 study sites and within individual transects, tick abundance related more strongly to deer pellet group counts. Few ticks were collected at deer densities <7/km2."

In a prospective surveillance study, 334 persons who hiked the Appalachian Trail for at least 7 days (mean [+/- SD] length of hike, 140 +/- 60 days) in 1997 were interviewed. At the end of their hike, subjects completed a questionnaire on injuries, illnesses, water purification methods, and hygiene practices. Of the 280 backpackers who responded (a combined 38,940 days of wilderness exposure), 69% (n = 192) achieved their goal. The most important reasons for ending a hike prematurely were injury, time limitation, and psychosocial reasons. The most common medical complaints were feet blisters (64%; n = 180), diarrhea (56%, n = 156), skin irritation (51%, n = 143), and acute joint pain (36%, n = 102). The incidence of vector-borne disease was 4% (n = 11); physician-diagnosed Lyme disease was the most common, and 24% of hikers (n = 68) reported tick bites. The risk of diarrhea was greater among those who frequently drank untreated water from streams or ponds (odds ratio [OR] = 7.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.7 to 23; P <0.0001), whereas practicing \"good hygiene\" (defined as routine cleaning of cooking utensils and cleaning hands after bowel movements) was associated with a decreased risk (OR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.97; P =0.04). Diarrhea is the most common illness limiting long-distance hikers. Hikers should purify water routinely, avoiding using untreated surface water. The risk of gastrointestinal illness can also be reduced by maintaining personal hygiene practices and cleaning cookware."

This survey revealed a mean annual percentage of infected ticks of 16.8% (range, 11.7-24.2) in nymphs, 24.9% (range, 16.5-33.6) in females and 26.1% (range, 17.1-37.3) in males.

A prediction of the annual incidence of Lyme borreliosis, based on the frequency of heavily infected or all nymphal I. ricinus ticks, is feasible. The infection rate in I. ricinus correlated significantly with the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index of the last year (in nymphs) or of the year before last (in adults)."

		"abstract": "Despite the fact that parasite dispersal is likely to be one of the most important processes influencing the dynamics and coevolution of host-parasite interactions, little information is available on the factors that affect it. In most cases, opportunities for parasite dispersal should be closely linked to host biology. Here we use microsatellite genetic markers to compare the population structure and dispersal of two host races of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae at the scale of the North Atlantic. Interestingly, tick populations showed high within-population genetic variation and relatively low population differentiation. However, gene flow at different spatial scales seemed to depend on the host species exploited. The black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) had structured tick populations showing patterns of isolation by distance, whereas tick populations of the Atlantic puffin (Fratercula arctica) were only weakly structured at the largest scale considered. Host-dependent rates of tick dispersal between colonies will alter infestation probabilities and local dynamics and may thus modify the adaptation potential of ticks to local hosts. Moreover, as I. uriae is a vector of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in both hemispheres, the large-scale movements of birds and the subsequent dispersal of ticks will have important consequences for the dynamics and coevolutionary interactions of this microparasite with its different vertebrate and invertebrate hosts."

The ticks were examined by dark-field microscopy for borreliae (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the agent of Lyme borreliosis), and attempts were made to culture the spirochetes in BSK-H medium from preparations containing their high numbers. Isolated borreliae were identified by PCR-RFLP analysis using probes directed against ribosomal spacer genes. A total of 797 nymphal and 719 adult (391 female, 328 male) Ixodes ricinus were examined: 16.2% of nymphs, 28.6% of females and 29.0% of males were positive. Dermacentor reticulatus (70 females, 30 males) and Haemaphysalis concinna (12 nymphs, 8 females, 2 males) were negative for spirochetes. The overall prevalence rate of borreliae in I. ricinus from the floodplain forest is slightly higher than the mean European data (i.e., 14% for nymphs, 21% for adults). The difference in infection rate between nymphal and adult ticks was significant, including the proportion of heavily infected (with > 100 borreliae) nymphs (2.1%) vs. adults (7.6%). Prevalence of borreliae in I. ricinus showed a significant decrease during autumn in this ecosystem. Three strains of spirochetes, all of the Borrelia afzelii genomic group, were isolated from female I. ricinus. Moreover, Trypanosoma/Crithidia sp. protozoa and Dipetalonema rugosicauda nematodes were detected in 0.4% and 1.0%, respectively, of all I. ricinus."

To characterize host immunity to B. burgdorferi in humans, we performed serial T cell receptor (TCR) variable beta (TCRBV) chain analyses in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 10 patients with acute neuroborreliosis. In most patients, we found significant differences in TCRBV expression between CSF and peripheral blood T cells, predominantly involving CD8(+) T cells. T cells that accumulated in the CSF had a memory phenotype and expressed high levels of C-C chemokine receptor 5 and CD69. Serial studies demonstrated that CD8(+) T cell accumulation decreased continuously after resolution of the infection. In 2 patients, serial analysis of the TCR-alpha and -beta chain sequences revealed that overexpression of TCRBV in CSF was caused by extensive clonal expansion of CD8(+) T cells. Our findings support the role of CD8(+) T cells during the early host defense against spirochete infection of the CNS."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, the most prevalent arthropod-borne disease in the United States. The genome of the type strain, B31, consists of a 910,725-bp linear chromosome and 21 linear and circular plasmids comprising 610,694 bp. During its life cycle, the spirochete exists in distinctly different environments, cycling between a tick vector and a mammalian host. Temperature is one environmental factor known to affect B. burgdorferi gene expression. To identify temperature-responsive genes, genome arrays containing 1,662 putative B. burgdorferi open reading frames (ORFs) were prepared on nylon membranes and employed to assess gene expression in B. burgdorferi B31 grown at 23 and 35 degrees C. Differences in expression of more than 3.5 orders of magnitude could be readily discerned and quantitated. At least minimal expression from 91% of the arrayed ORFs could be detected. A total of 215 ORFs were differentially expressed at the two temperatures; 133 were expressed at significantly greater levels at 35 degrees C, and 82 were more significantly expressed at 23 degrees C. Of these 215 ORFs, 134 are characterized as genes of unknown function. One hundred thirty-six (63%) of the differentially expressed genes are plasmid encoded. Of particular interest is plasmid lp54 which contains 76 annotated putative genes; 31 of these exhibit temperature-regulated expression. These findings underscore the important role plasmid-encoded genes may play in adjustment of B. burgdorferi to growth under diverse environmental conditions."

Within that population are more children between the ages of 5 and 9. The younger the child, the more difficult it is to diagnose Lyme disease. Children under the age of 19 are at high risk for Lyme disease because of the amount of time spent in outdoor activities during the late spring and summer. These months correlate with the tick breeding cycle and the peak time for outdoor recreational activities. Lyme disease can pose serious health risks in late stage illness. A Lyme disease case study on a school-age child provides comprehensive assessment data, interventions, and educational information for parents. A template of an individualized healthcare plan using standardized language is a guide for school nurses. The value of school nurses as guardians of the public's health is addressed."

		"abstract": "Many cases of Lyme borreliosis have been reported over the years in the region of Lyon, France. The identification and prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in Ixodes ricinus were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the flagellin gene and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Questing Ixodes ricinus larvae, nymphs and adults were collected by the flagging method from deciduous forests in four areas in the Lyon region of France between October 1994 and September 1995 and in June 1998. The overall prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was 13.2% (91/688). No significant differences in prevalence were observed between the different stages and sex of the ixodids or between collection areas. The majority of infections were simple infections (82.4%; 75/91), most of which were due to Borrelia afzelii (41.4%), while coinfections (12.1%) were predominantly (54.5%) a combination of Borrelia valaisiana and Borrelia garinii. No tick was infected with more than two borrelial species, nor was Borrelia lusitaniae identified. The Borrelia valaisiana species was detected for the first time in France, confirming its widespread presence in Europe. This study confirms that the surroundings of Lyon are risk areas for contracting Lyme disease and that no particular clinical manifestations predominate due to the heterogeneous distribution of Borrelia genospecies. Moreover, the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis is a rapid and easy method for genotyping of Borrelia species."

This observation supports for Central Europe the conclusions drawn from North America about nymphal ixodid ticks as the most important vector stage in transmission of LB. In the course of the year, we found the highest proportion of infected nymphal and female ticks taken off humans in June.

This extension of the efficacy study assessed the immunogenicity and tolerability of booster vaccinations administered at 24 and/or 36 months after the first vaccination. This open-label, nonrandomized, single-center, prospective extension, clinical trial was conducted in the general community in New Haven, Connecticut, where Lyme disease is endemic. Blood samples (to determine anti-OspA titer) were collected before administration of the booster doses at months 24 and 36, and at 1 and 12 months after each booster dose was administered. Immune response was assessed via total immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-OspA antibody titers and the proportion of subjects with titers >or=1400 EL.U/mL. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded by the study volunteers on diary cards. A total of 318 volunteers (173 women and 145 men) received at least 1 booster dose of Lyme disease vaccine, administered at 12 or 24 months after the third vaccination of the primary series (months 24 and 36, in relation to the primary series). Eighty-eight subjects of those who received a month-24 booster received a second booster dose at month 36 (12 months after the first booster). Overall, the mean age of the volunteers was 55 years (range, 19 to 73 years). The demographic characteristics of the groups were similar. Most AEs were limited induration and were rated by investigators and subjects as mild to moderate in severity. Administration of I or 2 booster doses did not elicit any patterns of AEs different from those reported in the efficacy trial. After the first booster dose, all volunteers had an anamnestic response and positive test results for total IgG antibody. Geometric mean titers increased at least 12-fold 1 month after the first booster dose at month 24 or 36. More than 96% of volunteers had titers>1400 EL.U/mL and 100% had titers >400 EL.U/mL (minimum seroprotective level) 1 month after the booster dose at month 24 or 36. All booster doses were well tolerated, and the incidence of AEs did not increase after the second booster dose. The immune response generated after the 3-dose primary series waned; booster doses administered at 12 and/or 24 months after the primary series increased antibody levels above seroprotective levels."

An improved understanding of the causes of such variability would aid in prevention and control of the disease, which is transmitted by a spirochete carried in the \"black-legged\" tick, Ixodes scapularis. In this study, the variability in reported Lyme disease incidence between 1993 and 2001 in seven northeastern US states was analyzed as an outcome of weather variability. For all seven states analyzed, significant (p < 0.05) positive relations were found for the correlation of early summer disease incidence with the June moisture index (Palmer Hydrological Drought Index) in the region 2 years previously. The correlations may reflect enhanced nymph tick survival in wetter conditions. Few significant relations were found with same-year moisture index, which suggests that moisture has a greater effect on nymph tick survival following the insect's blood meal than before. In some states, significant correlations were observed related to warmer winter weather a year and a half prior to disease incidence, which may have been due to higher survival and activity levels of the white-footed mouse, the main host for Lyme disease-infected ticks."

We have observed EBV replication in lymphoblastoid cells after superinfection with B. garinii and B. afzelii strains after 1 and 4 h of their interaction. We found that viral and borrelial antigens persisted in the lymphoblasts for 3 and 4 days. Morphological and functional transformation of both agents facilitate their transfer to daughter cells. Association with lymphoblasts and internalization of B. garinii by tube phagocytosis increased replication of viruses more successfully than B. afzelii and chemical inductors. Demonstration of such findings must be interpreted cautiously, but may prove a mixed borrelial and viral cause of severe neurological disease."

We examined C-sensitive and C-resistant strains of B. burgdorferi for deposition of C3 and late C components by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. Despite comparable deposition of C3 on the two strains, the resistant strain exhibited reduced staining for C6 and C7, barely detectable C9, and undetectable poly C9. Based on these findings, we searched for a protein that inhibits assembly of C membrane attack complex and documented an anti-human CD59-reactive molecule on the surface of C-resistant spirochetes by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. A molecule of 80 kDa recognized by polyclonal and monoclonal anti-CD59 Abs was identified in the membrane extract of C-resistant strains by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The molecule was released from the bacterial wall using deoxycholate and trypsin, suggesting its insertion into the bacterial membrane. The CD59-like molecule acts as C inhibitor on Borrelia because incubation with F(ab')(2) anti-CD59 renders the serum-resistant strain exquisitely susceptible to C-mediated killing and guinea pig erythrocytes bearing C5b-8, unlike the RBC coated with C5b-7, are protected from reactive lysis by the bacterial extract. Western blot analysis revealed preferential binding of the C inhibitory molecule to C9 and weak interaction with C8 beta."

In case of neuroborreliosis, serological tests, performed in blood and cerebro-spinal fluid, support the diagnosis and patients recover rapidly with antibacterial treatments. However an accurate diagnosis remains sometimes problematic, especially distinction between a coincidental positive serologic test and a nervous system Lyme borreliosis which require antibiotics. Furthermore, the role of autoimmunity in the pathophysiology of late Lyme disease, antibiotic choice in early disease, duration of treatment, and utility of vaccination are discussed."

However, the bactericidal antibodies are ineffective in the reservoir host, since OspA is expressed by spirochetes only in the vector, but rarely, if at all, in mammals. Using an artificially generated immune serum (anti-10(8) spirochetes) with high protective potential for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment, we have now isolated from an expression library of B. burgdorferi (strain ZS7) three novel genes, zs7.a36, zs7.a66 and zs7.a68. All three genes are located, together with ospA/B, on the linear plasmid lp54, and are expressed in vitro and in ticks. At least temporarily two of them, ZS7.A36 and ZS7.A66, are also expressed during infection. The respective natural antigens are poorly immunogenic ininfected normal mice but elicited antibodies in Lyme disease patients. We show that recombinant preparations of ZS7.A36, ZS7.A66 and ZS7.A68 induce functional antibodies in rabbits capable of protecting immunodeficient mice against subsequent experimental infection. These findings suggest that all three recombinant antigens represent potential candidates for a \"second generation\" vaccine to prevent and/or cure Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The causative agents of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., B. garinii, and B. afzelii, differ in their susceptibility to complement-mediated lysis. This phenomenon apparently depends on the expression of proteins termed complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASP) and their binding to the inhibitory plasma proteins factor H and FHL-1. To characterize these bacterial proteins in more detail we have now isolated from a B. burgdorferi expression library a novel factor H-binding protein. In accordance with our previous studies this protein was termed BbCRASP-3 and represents a novel member of the polymorphic Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family. On the basis of protease accessibility assays using intact spirochetes, BbCRASP-3 is identified as a surface-exposed protein and binds the C-terminal short consensus repeats of factor H. Applying deletion mutants of BbCRASP-3, the factor H-binding site was mapped to the nine-amino-acid motif LEVLKKNLK localized at the C-terminal end of BbCRASP-3. Factor H bound to BbCRASP-3 maintains its cofactor activity in factor I-mediated C3b inactivation. Binding of BbCRASP-3 to factor H can be inhibited by heparin, a physiological ligand of the complement regulator factor H. Blocking of factor-H-binding by soluble BbCRASP-3 leads to an increase of complement deposition on intermediate serum-resistant strain ZS7. In conclusion, BbCRASP-3 has been identified as a novel factor H-binding protein on B. burgdorferi which by conferring complement resistance to the pathogen may contribute to its persistence in the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "To detect evidence of infections preceding early arthritis in Southern Sweden and to compare the clinical outcome of remission during a 6-month followup for patients with and without signs of prior infection. Adult patients with arthritis of less than 3 months' duration were referred from primary health care centers to rheumatologists. All patients were systematically screened for infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and parvovirus B19. Seventy-one patients were included in this study. Twenty-seven (38%) patients had reactive arthritis (ReA), 17 (24%) undifferentiated arthritis, 15 (21%) rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 4 (6%) psoriatic arthritis, and the rest (11%) other diagnoses. Of all the patients, 45% had evidence of a recent infection preceding the arthritis, as indicated by laboratory tests and/or disease history. C. jejuni dominated the ReA group. The occurrence of recent C. trachomatis, B. burgdorferi, C. pneumoniae, and parvovirus B19 infections was low. Overall, 58% of the patients went into remission during the 6-month followup. Of the patients with a preceding infection, 69% went into remission as compared to 38% of the patients without a preceding infection (p = 0.011). Thirty-three percent of the patients with RA were in remission after 6 months. In this population-based cohort, 45% of the patients presenting with a new-onset arthritis had had a prior infection. Campylobacter ReA dominated the ReA group. There were only a few cases preceded by infections by C. trachomatis, B. burgdorferi, C. pneumoniae, and parvovirus B19 infections. Remission during the first 6 months was especially frequent in the group of patients with a prior infection, but the remission rate was relatively high even for arthritis without prior infection."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to mammals by Ixodes ticks and can infect multiple tissues. Host cell attachment may be critical for tissue colonization, and B. burgdorferi cultivated in vitro recognizes heparin- and dermatan sulphate-related glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) on the surface of mammalian cells. To determine whether growth of the spirochaete in the mammalian host alters GAG binding, we assessed the cell attachment activities of B. burgdorferi grown in vitro or in dialysis membrane chambers implanted intraperitoneally in rats. Host-adapted B. burgdorferi exhibited approximately threefold better binding to purified heparin and dermatan sulphate and to GAGs expressed on the surface of cultured endothelial cells. Three B. burgdorferi surface proteins, Bgp, DbpA and DbpB, have been demonstrated previously to bind to GAGs or to GAG-containing molecules, and we show here that recombinant derivatives of each of these proteins were able to bind to purified heparin and dermatan sulphate. Immunofluorescent staining of in vitro-cultivated or host-adapted spirochaetes revealed that DbpA and DbpB were present on the bacterial surface at higher levels after host adaptation. Recombinant Bgp, DbpA and DbpB each partially inhibited attachment of host-adapted B. burgdorferi to cultured mammalian cells, consistent with the hypothesis that these proteins may promote attachment of B. burgdorferi during growth in the mammalian host. Nevertheless, the partial nature of this inhibition suggests that multiple pathways promote mammalian cell attachment by B. burgdorferi in vivo. Given the observed increase in cell attachment activity upon growth in the mammalian host, analysis of host-adapted bacteria will facilitate identification of the cell binding pathways used in vivo."

Recombination between the expression cassette and silent cassettes occurs in vivo, and this process may enable B. burgdorferi to evade the immune response. To determine the characteristics of the vls loci in other Borrelia strains, we have cloned and characterized the vls silent cassette loci of Borrelia garinii Ip90 and Borrelia afzelii ACAI, consisting of 11 vls silent cassettes and 14 vls silent cassettes respectively. The silent cassettes share 90-97% nucleotide sequence identity with one another within the Ip90 vls locus and 84-91% within the ACAI vls locus. In both organisms, the silent cassettes resemble the B31 Vls sequences in overall amino acid similarity (50-65%) and in the presence of six variable regions interspersed between six relatively invariant regions. The vlsE expression sites of these two strains have not been isolated, but transcripts of vlsE were detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for both Ip90 and ACAI. In addition, the occurrence of sequence variation within the vlsE cassette region of these transcripts was verified. This study indicates that the vls loci present in B. garinii Ip90 and B. afzelii ACAI have characteristics similar to those found in B. burgdorferi B31."

This review describes 12 cost-effectiveness analyses done in the past year. Each relates to a different intervention for a variety of rheumatologic conditions including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, the use of cyclooxygenase-II inhibitors, infected total joint replacements, back pain, and Lyme disease. While cost-effectiveness analyses of the use of the new biologic agents in rheumatoid arthritis have been presented at national meetings, these have yet to be published. Proper use of cost-effectiveness analysis could provide valuable evidence about treatment decisions for clinical and public policy makers in rheumatology."

We observe that gamma delta T cells of the V delta 1 subset accumulate in synovial fluid of human Lyme arthritis and are intensely cytolytic toward a wide array of target cells. Particularly striking is that the cytolytic activity is highly prolonged, lasting for at least 3 wk after stimulation of the gamma delta T cells with Borrelia burgdorferi. Cytolysis is largely Fas dependent and results from very high and prolonged expression of surface Fas ligand, which is transcriptionally regulated. This also manifests in a substantial level of self-induced apoptosis of the gamma delta T cells. In this capacity, certain gamma delta T cell subsets may serve as cytolytic sentinels at sites of inflammation, and perhaps at epithelial barriers."

The magnitude of OspA(163-175) binding correlated well with the frequencies of the DRB1 alleles in patients with treatment-resistant arthritis, but the binding of hLFA-1alpha(L330-342) showed only an association with the DRB*04 alleles.

No consensual information exists on the outcome of Borrelia-seropositive patients or on the importance of determining Borrelia antibody titers. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of seropositivity for Borrelia in sudden deafness, describing clinical characteristics and outcomes. This was a prospective observational study. Forty-seven consecutive patients with sudden deafness were enrolled in the study. Demographic data, the presence of tinnitus and vertigo, and low- and high-frequency pure-tone averages were recorded. The percentage of hearing recovery was determined. Data obtained from Borrelia-seropositive patients were described and compared with those from the seronegative group. Titers positive for antibodies were present in 21.3% of the cases. Seropositive and seronegative groups of patients were homogeneous concerning age, sex distribution, the presence of tinnitus and vertigo, and high- and low-frequency hearing thresholds. Hearing outcome was not significantly different between the groups of patients. No distinctive clinical characteristic was found between seropositive and seronegative subjects. The hearing outcome of treated Borrelia-seropositive patients was similar to that of the seronegative group."

This striking contrast in pathogenicity of these two groups of bacteria suggests a fundamental difference in their ability to either exploit or survive in blood. Borrelia hermsii, a tick-borne relapsing-fever spirochete, contains orthologs to glpQ and glpT, genes that encode glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) and glycerol-3-phosphate transporter (GlpT), respectively. In other bacteria, GlpQ hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) while GlpT transports G3P into the cytoplasm. Enzyme assays on 17 isolates of borreliae demonstrated GlpQ activity in relapsing-fever spirochetes but not in Lyme disease spirochetes. Southern blots demonstrated glpQ and glpT in all relapsing-fever spirochetes but not in the Lyme disease group. A Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, that was transformed with a shuttle vector containing glpTQ from B. hermsii produced active enzyme, which demonstrated the association of glpQ with the hydrolysis of phospholipids. Sequence analysis of B. hermsii identified glpF, glpK, and glpA, which encode the glycerol facilitator, glycerol kinase, and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, respectively, all of which are present in B. burgdorferi. All spirochetes examined had gpsA, which encodes the enzyme that reduces dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to G3P. Consequently, three pathways for the acquisition of G3P exist among borreliae: (i) hydrolysis of deacylated phospholipids, (ii) reduction of DHAP, and (iii) uptake and phosphorylation of glycerol. The unique ability of relapsing-fever spirochetes to hydrolyze phospholipids may contribute to their higher cell densities in blood than those of Lyme disease spirochetes."

		"abstract": "In the 20 years since the first agent of Lyme disease was discovered, much interest has focused on the possible biological roles of a few outer surface proteins (Osps) in the alternating life cycle that includes ticks and vertebrate hosts. Two major proteins, OspA and OspC, are differentially regulated by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi during the several days when ticks feed. The reciprocal decrease in OspA with the rapid up-regulation of OspC by the spirochaetes when ticks are feeding suggests that OspA aids in spirochaete attachment while OspC assists in the dissemination of spirochaetes from tick to vertebrate. Future experiments in ticks with mutant spirochaetes that lack these proteins should clarify the speculative functions currently given to these proteins."

We report here on studies that were done with normal and complement-deficient (C3-knockout) mice to determine if the host complement system killed spirochetes within the vector. We found that spirochete numbers within feeding nymphs were not influenced by complement, most likely because host complement was inactivated within the vector. The Lyme disease outer surface protein A (OspA) vaccine is a transmission-blocking vaccine that targets spirochetes in the vector. In experiments with mice hyperimmunized with OspA, complement was not required to kill spirochetes within nymphs and to block transmission from nymphs to the vaccinated host. However, host complement did enhance the ability of OspA antibody to block larvae from acquiring spirochetes. Thus, the effects of OspA antibody on nymphal transmission and larval acquisition appear to be based on different mechanisms."

This review discusses the role of climate change on child health and suggests 3 ways in which this relationship may manifest. First, environmental changes associated with anthropogenic greenhouse gases can lead to respiratory diseases, sunburn, melanoma, and immunosuppression. Second, climate change may directly cause heat stroke, drowning, gastrointestinal diseases, and psychosocial maldevelopment. Third, ecologic alterations triggered by climate change can increase rates of malnutrition, allergies and exposure to mycotoxins, vector-borne diseases (malaria, dengue, encephalitides, Lyme disease), and emerging infectious diseases. Further climate change is likely, given global industrial and political realities. Proactive and preventive physician action, research focused on the differential effects of climate change on subpopulations including children, and policy advocacy on the individual and federal levels could contain climate change and inform appropriate prevention and response."

		"abstract": "The extent to which the biodiversity and community composition of ecosystems affect their functions is an issue that grows ever more compelling as human impacts on ecosystems increase. We present evidence that supports a novel function of vertebrate biodiversity, the buffering of human risk of exposure to Lyme-disease-bearing ticks. We tested the Dilution Effect model, which predicts that high species diversity in the community of tick hosts reduces vector infection prevalence by diluting the effects of the most competent disease reservoir, the ubiquitous white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus). As habitats are degraded by fragmentation or other anthropogenic forces, some members of the host community disappear. Thus, species-poor communities tend to have mice, but few other hosts, whereas species-rich communities have mice, plus many other potential hosts. We demonstrate that the most common nonmouse hosts are relatively poor reservoirs for the Lyme spirochete and should reduce the prevalence of the disease by feeding, but rarely infecting, ticks. By accounting for nearly every host species' contribution to the number of larval ticks fed and infected, we show that as new host species are added to a depauperate community, the nymphal infection prevalence, a key risk factor, declines. We identify important \"dilution hosts\" (e.g., squirrels), characterized by high tick burdens, low reservoir competence, and high population density, as well as \"rescue hosts\" (e.g., shrews), which are capable of maintaining high disease risk when mouse density is low. Our study suggests that the preservation of vertebrate biodiversity and community composition can reduce the incidence of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "We found that Borrelia burgdorferi-vaccinated gamma interferon-deficient (IFN-gamma(0)) mice challenged with B. burgdorferi developed prominent chronic destructive osteoarthropathy. When these mice were treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) antibody, the severity of the destructive osteoarthritis was enhanced and affected the mobility of the animals. In addition, extensive swelling of the hind paws occurred. In contrast, treatment of B. burgdorferi-vaccinated, challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice with recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha) inhibited the development of arthritis, including swelling of the hind paws. Moreover, treatment of vaccinated, challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice with anti-TNF-alpha inhibited fourfold the production of an antibody that kills B. burgdorferi, while treatment of vaccinated, challenged IFN-gamma(0) mice with rTNF-alpha slightly elevated the level of the borreliacidal antibody. These results suggest that the level of TNF-alpha directly or indirectly regulates the production of borreliacidal antibody and the development of vaccine-induced destructive Lyme osteoarthritis. Studies are in progress to determine the mechanism by which TNF-alpha-dependent cytokines generate the destructive arthritis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted by the tick Ixodes scapularis. A 2.9-kb fragment containing a putative spoT gene was isolated from B. burgdorferi genomic DNA by PCR amplification and cloned into a pBAD24 vector. The cloned gene complemented Escherichia coli mutant strain CF1693, which contains deletions of both the relA and spoT genes. The spoT gene in E. coli encodes a bifunctional enzyme capable of synthesizing and degrading (p)ppGpp, which mediates the stringent response during carbon source starvation. B. burgdorferi has been reported to have a stress response to serum starvation. Thin-layer chromatography was used to detect (p)ppGpp extracted from H(3)(32)PO(4)-labeled B. burgdorferi cells starved for serum in RPMI. B. burgdorferi spoT gene expression was characterized during fatty acid starvation. Northern analysis of spoT revealed detectable message at 2.5 min of starvation in RPMI. Expression of spoT during serum starvation increased approximately 6-fold during the 30 min that starvation conditions were maintained. Further, expression of spoT decreased when serum was added to serum-starved cells. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was used to detect spoT mRNA from approximately 10(6) cells starved for serum in RPMI for 2.5 to 30 min or incubated in tick saliva for 15 min. Northern blot analysis suggests that spoT transcript was approximately 900 nucleotides in length. RT-PCR amplification of the transcript using several sets of primers confirmed this finding. Additionally, a truncated clone containing only the first 950 bp of the 2,001-bp spoT open reading frame was able to complement E. coli CF1693. The data suggest that B. burgdorferi exhibits a stringent response to serum starvation and during incubation in tick saliva."

The authors present a consecutive case series of 10 children with acute arthritis consistent with septic arthritis who ultimately were diagnosed with Lyme disease. Fifty percent presented with a fever of 38 degrees C or higher. The peripheral white blood cell count and differential were not elevated, but the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein were significantly elevated. The joint fluid cell count was elevated, with 91% neutrophils. Seven patients in this series underwent emergent joint irrigation and debridement for presumed septic arthritis. The authors suggest that in regions where Lyme disease is endemic, children who present with presumed septic arthritis should also be evaluated for Lyme disease. The authors also present a protocol for evaluation and management of these diagnostically challenging cases."

Monitoring the frequency of specific T cell clonotypes to assess a possible link with the course of disease has been a difficult task with currently available technology. Our goal was to track individual candidate pathogenic T cell clones, selected on the basis of previous extensive studies from patients with immune-mediated disorders of the CNS, including multiple sclerosis, HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis. We developed and applied a highly specific and sensitive technique to track single CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell clones through the detection and quantification of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha or beta chain complementarity-determining region 3 transcripts by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. We examined the frequency of the candidate pathogenic T cell clones in the peripheral blood and CSF during the course of neurological disease. Using this approach, we detected variations of clonal frequencies that appeared to be related to clinical course, significant enrichment in the CSF, or both. By integrating clonotype tracking with direct visualization of antigen-specific staining, we showed that a single T cell clone contributed substantially to the overall recognition of the viral peptide/MHC complex in a patient with HAM/TSP. T cell clonotype tracking is a powerful new technology enabling further elucidation of the dynamics of expansion of autoreactive or pathogen-specific T cells that mediate pathological or protective immune responses in neurological disorders."

Several studies demonstrate that NF-kappaB, or components of the system such as IkappaB kinase (IKK)-alpha, seem to be involved in epidermal development and differentiation. Furthermore, a dysregulation of NF-kappaB is suggested to play an important role in skin pathology, including proliferative disorders, e.g. psoriasis, inflammatory processes such as incontinentia pigmenti (IP), sunburn, Lyme disease, allergic contact dermatitis and autoimmune diseases, as well as also in skin carcinogenesis. However, although the knowledge concerning the role of NF-kappaB in the homeostasis of the skin is steadily increasing, many more questions need to be answered."
