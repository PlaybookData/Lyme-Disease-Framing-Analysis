		"abstract": "Ticks (Arachnida: Acari) are common in Oklahoma and may transmit tick-borne diseases (TBDs) to people. Due to the difficulty in reducing tick populations, awareness of tick bite prevention, proper tick removal, and knowledge of when to seek medical treatment are critical. However, outreach and extension programs are hampered by a lack of knowledge of what community members know about ticks. To address this limitation, we surveyed college students enrolled in three non-major Entomology courses at Oklahoma State University in 2018. Of the 483 students invited to take a survey, 224 (46.4%) students took both surveys. Pre-survey responses indicated lower levels of knowledge of tick biology compared to post-survey responses. For both pre- and post-survey respondents, \"ticks can jump\" and \"ticks reside up in trees\" received the fewest correct responses. A majority of survey respondents considered Lyme disease to be the predominant TBD in Oklahoma, although it is not established in Oklahoma. Supplemental education overcame these knowledge gaps, with the exception of knowledge of Lyme disease which was still considered to be the predominant TBD in the post-survey. Our results can be used to develop assessment tools to improve extension programs and enhance protection from TBDs."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a zoonotic tick-borne infection representing the most frequent vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. The Mediterranean rim is generally described as unsuitable for the European vector, Ixodes ricinus. We conducted an epidemiological study to assess whether I. ricinus was present and study its infection status for tick-borne bacteria. Ticks originating from southeastern France were obtained from flagging sampling and removed from animals and tick-bitten patients. Species level identification used morphological keys and MALDI-TOF MS. Quantitative PCR and sequencing assays were used to detect and identify tick-associated bacteria (Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii) in each specimen. A total of 1232 ticks were collected in several localities. Among these, 863 were identified as I. ricinus (70%). Bacterial screening allowed identification of Lyme group Borrelia among I. ricinus ticks originating from various regional areas. Other emerging tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia miyamotoi and Rickettsia species were also detected. The Alpes-Maritimes region, part of the French Riviera, harbours I. ricinus ticks infected with Lyme group Borrelia and several other tick-borne bacterial agents. Clinicians and outdoor activity participants should be aware of the local Lyme borreliosis transmission risk."

According to ECDC, Poland should be considered as an endemic area. The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin 'Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018' . In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne infectious disease that may confer an increased risk of mental disorders, but previous studies have been hampered by methodological limitations, including small sample sizes. The authors used a nationwide retrospective cohort study design to examine rates of mental disorders following Lyme borreliosis. Using Denmark's National Patient Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register, and including all persons living in Denmark from 1994 through 2016 (N=6,945,837), the authors assessed the risk of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors among all individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts (N=12,156). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression analyses. Individuals with Lyme borreliosis had higher rates of any mental disorder (IRR=1.28, 95% CI=1.20, 1.37), of affective disorders (IRR=1.42, 95% CI=1.27, 1.59), of suicide attempts (IRR=2.01, 95% CI=1.58, 2.55), and of death by suicide (IRR=1.75, 95% CI=1.18, 2.58) compared with those without Lyme borreliosis. The 6-month interval after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of any mental disorder (IRR=1.96, 95% CI=1.53, 2.52), and the first 3 years after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of suicide (IRR=2.41, 95% CI=1.25, 4.62). Having more than one episode of Lyme borreliosis was associated with increased incidence rate ratios for mental disorders, affective disorders, and suicide attempts, but not for death by suicide. Individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in the hospital setting had an increased risk of mental disorders, affective disorders, suicide attempts, and suicide. Although the absolute population risk is low, clinicians should be aware of potential psychiatric sequelae of this global disease."

In both locations, Ixodes species ticks transmit the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria species responsible for causing the infection. The diversity of Borrelia species that cause human infection is greater in Europe; the 2 B. burgdorferi s.l. species collectively responsible for most infections in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii, are not found in the United States, where most infections are caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Strain differences seem to explain some of the variation in the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, which are both minor and substantive, between the United States and Europe. Future studies should attempt to delineate the specific virulence factors of the different species of B. burgdorferi s.l. responsible for these variations in clinical features."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti has gained a foothold in Canada as tick vectors become established in broader geographic areas. B. microti infection is associated with mild or no symptoms in healthy individuals but is transfusion-transmissible and can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. This is the first estimate of clinically significant transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) risk in Canada. The proportion of B. microti-antibody (AB)/nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-positive whole blood donations was estimated at 5.5% of the proportion of the general population with reported Lyme Disease (also tick-borne) based on US data. Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number and proportion of infectious red cell units for three scenarios: base, localized incidence (risk in Manitoba only), and donor study informed (prevalence from donor data). The model simulated 1,029,800 donations repeated 100,000 times for each. In the base scenario 0.5 (0.01, 1.75), B. microti-NAT-positive donations would be expected per year, with 0.08 (0, 0.38) recipients suffering clinically significant TTB (1 every 12.5 years). In the localized incidence scenario, there were 0.21(0, 0.7) B. microti-NAT-positive donations, with 0.04 (0, 0.14) recipient infections (about 1 every 25 years). In the donor study informed scenario, there were 4.6 (0.3, 15.8) B. microti-NAT-positive donations expected, and 0.81 (0.05, 3.14) clinically significant TTB cases per year. The likelihood of clinically relevant TTB is low. Testing would have very little utility in Canada at this time. Ongoing pathogen surveillance in tick vectors is important as B. microti prevalence appears to be slowly increasing in Canada."

In this study, we collected ticks from 39 districts of Istanbul (Turkey) between May and October, from 2013 to 2017, and identified them under stereo-microscope. In addition, we investigated the pathogens that the ticks carry (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia sp. and Babesia sp.) by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We collected a total of 875 ticks from the ground and from various animals and kept them at 4 °C until experiments. We identified 248 Rhipicephalus bursa (28.3% of the total), 205 (23.4%) Rhipicephalus annulatus, 197 (22.5%) Haemaphysalis concinna, 149 (17.0%) Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 24 (2.7%) Hyalomma marginatum, 21 (2.4%) Ixodes ricinus, 13 (1.5%) Rhipicephalus kohlsi, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma anatolicum, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma aegyptium, 5 (0.6%) Dermacentor niveus and 3 (0.3%) Ixodes hexagonus. We included a total of 328 questing ticks in the study: 63 R. bursa, 63 R. sanguineus, 63 R. annulatus, 63 H. concinna, 24 H. marginatum, 21 I. ricinus, 13 R. kohlsi, 5 H. anatolicum, 5 H. aegyptium, 5 D. niveus and 3 I. hexagonus. Multiplex PCR indicated that 80 (24.4%) ticks were infected with Rickettsia sp., 5 (1.5%) with B. burgdorferi and 1 (0.3%) with Babesia sp. Our study indicated that Rickettsia is more common in ticks collected around Istanbul."

Infection is primarily transmitted through Ixodes ticks, and alternatively by blood transfusions from asymptomatic donors. The aim of the study was detection of Babesia seroprevalence in different groups of population with the usage of experimental B. divergens whole-cell slide antigen and commercial B. microti immunofluorescence assay substrate slide. Indirect immunofluorescence assay trial was performed by testing of 145 blood samples of different origins: healthy individuals (60 - blood donors), risk groups (30 - HIV-infected individuals, 30 - Lyme disease patients) and false-positive IFA controls (10 - seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients, 15 - patients with toxoplasmosis). The study revealed Babesia antibodies to B. divergens (6.9%) and B. microti (3.4%) that were detected with higher (p <0.05) frequency in HIV-infected individuals (26.7%) and in Lyme disease patients (16.7%) than at blood donors (1.7%). Diagnostically significant IgG titres were detected at 23.3% HIV-infected individuals, 13.3% Lyme disease patients and by 1.7% of blood donors and patients with seropositive latent toxoplasmosis. Specific IgM were detected at 20.0% HIV-infected individuals and 13.3% Lyme disease patients. 57.1% of diagnostically significant titres in HIV-infected and Lyme disease patients were represented by IgG and IgM. Immunofluorescence assay has a limited use in babesiosis: in acute form with negative microscopy or PCR; in chronic, asymptomatic and subclinical form with low level of parasitemia; and in retrospective and epidemiological studies of the population immune structure. Clinicians need to have increased awareness of babesiosis, and further studies are needed to clarify the optimal management of this infection in risk groups (including HIV-infected patients and blood donors)."

In this study, we systematically evaluated the clinical and epidemiological features of Lyme disease in North India. All samples were tested by using the standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTA). Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for demonstrating Borrelia burgdorferi specific intrathecal IgG antibody synthesis (AI). In addition, a commercial tick-borne bacterial flow chip (TBFC) system and a real-time PCR were also used to detect Borrelia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in patients who were positive by STTA. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed in 18 (7.14%) of the 252 clinically suspected cases by STTA. Neurological involvement was reported in 14 (77.78%) patients, whereas joint and heart involvement was reported in five (27.78%) and three (16.67%) patients, respectively. Lymphocytic pleocytosis (median 37.5 cells/mm3; range 12-175 cells/mm3) in the CSF was seen in 11 of 14 Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) patients. Intrathecal production of Borrelia specific IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 9 (64.28%, n = 14) patients, a highly specific finding for neuroborreliosis. Two patients (11.11%) were also found to be co-infected with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The results of this study show clinical and laboratory evidence of endemic Lyme disease in North India and thus, highlight the importance for travel medicine practitioners and physicians to evaluate for Lyme disease in patients with compatible symptoms and a history of travel to tick risk areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks (n = 1953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene (flaB) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia-positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Recent scholarship supports the use of tick bite encounters as a proxy for human disease risk. Extending entomological monitoring, this study was designed to provide geographically salient information on self-reported tick bite encounters by survey respondents who concomitantly reported a Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis in a state perceived as non-endemic to tick-borne illness. Focusing on Texas, a mixed-methods approach was used to compare data on tick bite encounters from self-reported LD patients with county-level confirmed cases of LD from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as serological canine reports. A greater proportion of respondents reported not recalling a tick bite in the study population, but a binomial test indicated that this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis compared neighboring county-level data and ecological regions. Using multi-layer thematic mapping, our findings indicated that tick bite reports accurately overlapped with the geographic patterns of those patients previously known to be CDC-positive for serological LD and with canine-positive tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis, as well as within neighboring counties and ecological regions. LD patient-reported tick bite encounters, corrected for population density, also accurately aligned with official CDC county hot-spots. Given the large number of counties in Texas, these findings are notable. Overall, the study demonstrates that direct, clinically diagnosed patient reports with county-level tick bite encounter data offer important public health surveillance measures, particularly as it pertains to difficult-to-diagnose diseases where testing protocols may not be well established. Further integration of geo-ecological and socio-demographic factors with existing national epidemiological data, as well as increasingly accessible self-report methods such as online surveys, will contribute to the contextual information needed to organize and implement a coordinated public health response to LD."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms."

		"abstract": "The microbiome of blood-sucking arthropods can shape their competence to acquire and maintain infections with vector-borne pathogens. We used a controlled study to investigate the interactions between Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme disease in Europe, and the bacterial microbiome of Ixodes ricinus, its primary tick vector. We applied a surface sterilization treatment to I. ricinus eggs to produce dysbiosed tick larvae that had a much lower bacterial abundance and a changed bacterial microbiome compared to the control larvae. Dysbiosed and control larvae were fed on B. afzelii-infected mice and uninfected control mice and the engorged larvae were left to molt into nymphs, which were tested for B. afzelii infection and their bacterial microbiome by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Surprisingly, larval dysbiosis had no effect on the vector competence of I. ricinus for B. afzelii, as the nymphal infection prevalence and the nymphal spirochete load were the same between the dysbiosed group and the control group. The strong effect of egg surface sterilization on the tick bacterial microbiome largely disappeared once the larvae molted into nymphs. The most important determinant of the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs was the B. afzelii infection status of the mouse on which the nymphs had fed as larvae. Nymphs that had taken their larval blood meal from an infected mouse had a less abundant but more diverse bacterial microbiome compared to control nymphs. Our study demonstrates that vector-borne infections in the vertebrate host shape the microbiome of the arthropod vector. IMPORTANCE Many blood-sucking arthropods transmit pathogens that cause infectious disease. For example, Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit the bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme disease in humans. Ticks also have a microbiome, which can influence their ability to acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens like B. afzelii. We sterilized I. ricinus eggs with bleach, and the tick larvae that hatched from these eggs had a dramatically reduced and changed bacterial microbiome compared to control larvae. These larvae were fed on B. afzelii-infected mice and the resultant nymphs were tested for B. afzelii and their bacterial microbiome. We found that our manipulation of the bacterial microbiome had no effect on the ability of the tick larvae to acquire and maintain populations of B. afzelii. In contrast, we found that B. afzelii infection had dramatic effects on the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs. Our study demonstrates that infections in the vertebrate host can shape the tick microbiome."

		"abstract": "Deer management (e.g., reduction) has been proposed as a tool to reduce the acarological risk of Lyme disease. There have been few opportunities to investigate Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto dynamics in the absence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in midwestern North America. A pair of islands in Lake Michigan presented a unique opportunity to study the role of alternative hosts for the adult stage of the blacklegged tick for maintaining a tick population as a deer herd exists on North Manitou Island but not on South Manitou Island, where coyotes (Canis latrans) and hares (Lepus americanus) are the dominant medium mammals. Additionally, we were able to investigate the maintenance of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in small mammal communities on both islands, which were dominated by eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). From 2011 to 2015, we surveyed both islands for blacklegged ticks by drag cloth sampling, bird mist netting, and small and medium-sized mammal trapping. We assayed questing ticks, on-host ticks, and mammal biopsies for the Lyme disease pathogen, B. burgdorferi. We detected all three life stages of the blacklegged tick on both islands. Of the medium mammals sampled, no snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus, 0/23) were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, but 2/2 coyotes (Canis latrans) sampled on South Manitou Island in 2014 were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, suggesting that coyotes played a role in maintaining the tick population in the absence of deer. We also detected I. scapularis ticks on passerine birds from both islands, providing support that birds contribute to maintaining as well as introducing blacklegged ticks and B. burgdorferi to the islands. We observed higher questing adult and nymphal tick densities, and higher B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in small mammals and in adult ticks on the island with deer as compared to the deer-free island. On the islands, we also found that 25% more chipmunks were tick-infested than mice, fed more larvae and nymphs relative to their proportional abundance compared to mice, and thus may play a larger role compared to mice in the maintenance of B. burgdorferi. Our investigation demonstrated that alternative hosts could maintain a local population of blacklegged ticks and an enzootic cycle of the Lyme disease bacterium in the absence of white-tailed deer. Thus, alternative adult blacklegged tick hosts should be considered when investigating deer-targeted management tools for reducing tick-borne disease risk, especially when the alternative host community may be abundant and diverse."

In 2014, CDC examined questions from a prospective nationwide survey of U.S. Hispanic adults conducted via the Offerwise QueOpinas panel regarding ticks and LD. From October to November, a total of 2,649 surveys were released and 1,006 completed surveys returned. Overall, 44% of respondents reported routinely practising at least one form of personal protection against tick bites, and wearing repellent was the most commonly reported method (29%). Approximately 6% of respondents reported a tick bite for either themselves or someone in their household during the previous 12 months. An individual or household diagnosis of LD in the previous year was reported by 2% of respondents, with the highest proportion of diagnoses reported by respondents from high LD incidence states. The annual incidence of healthcare provider-diagnosed LD in the survey population was higher than national surveillance estimates for reported LD among U.S. Hispanic persons during 2000-2013. As annual incidence of LD continues to increase, it is important to ensure equitable access to information about LD, including disease transmission, manifestations, and prevention recommendations. Results from this survey can help inform public health outreach focused on effective tick bite prevention methods and early recognition of LD."

		"abstract": "In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape."

Subunit and bacterin vaccines are available for the prevention of LD in dogs. LD bacterin vaccines, which are comprised of cell lysates of two strains of B. burgdorferi, contain over 1000 different proteins and cellular constituents. In contrast, subunit vaccines are defined in composition and consist of either outer surface protein (Osp)A or OspA and an OspC chimeritope. In this study, we comparatively assessed antibody responses to OspA and OspC induced by vaccination with all canine bacterin and subunit LD vaccines that are commercially available in North America. Dogs were administered a two-dose series of the vaccine to which they were assigned (3 weeks apart): Subunit-AC, Subunit-A, Bacterin-1, and Bacterin-2. Antibody titers to OspA and OspC were determined by ELISA and the ability of each vaccine to elicit antibodies that recognize diverse OspC proteins (referred to as OspC types) assessed by immunoblot. While all of the vaccines elicited similar OspA antibody responses, only Subunit-AC triggered a robust and broadly cross-reactive antibody response to divergent OspC proteins. The data presented within provide new information regarding vaccination-induced antibody responses to key tick and mammalian phase antigens by both subunit and bacterin LD canine vaccine formulations."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) have complex life cycles involving tick vectors and vertebrate hosts. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the zoonotic circulation of TBPs. In this study, we used a One Health approach to study the possible circulation of TBPs in ticks, animals and humans within a rural household in the foothills of the Fruška Gora mountain, northern Serbia. The presence of TBP DNA was assessed using microfluidic PCR (25 bacterial species, 7 parasite species, 5 bacterial genera, 3 parasite genera) in animal, human and tick samples and the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) RNA was screened for using RT-qPCR on tick samples. In addition, Lyme borreliosis serology was assessed in patients sera. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ixodes ricinus ticks were identified on dogs and Haemaphysalis punctata was identified on house walls. Rickettsia helvetica was the most common pathogen detected in pooled R. sanguineus and I. ricinus tick samples, followed by Hepatozoon canis. None of the H. punctata tick samples tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia monacensis were the most frequent pathogens detected in dogs, followed by Rickettsia felis, whereas Anaplasma bovis was the only pathogen found in one of the goats tested. None of the human blood samples collected from family members tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Although microfluidic PCR did not detect Borrelia sp. in any of the tested tick or blood samples, a family member with a history of Lyme disease was seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). We conclude that, despite the presence of TBPs in tick and vertebrate reservoirs, there is no evidence of infection with TBPs across various components of the epidemiological chain in a rural Fruška Gora household."

		"abstract": "Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m2) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m2) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised."

To date, B. mayonii has been isolated from two vertebrate host species in Minnesota: field-caught white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque; Rodentia: Cricetidae) and American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben). Here, we describe the first detection of B. mayonii in field-caught eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus L. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)) from northern Wisconsin. During our study, we captured 530 unique small mammals and found an infection prevalence of 23.50% in field-caught eastern chipmunks (4/17) and 1.19% in Peromyscus spp. (5/420). Mean larval and nymphal burdens were determined for captured Blarina brevicauda (0, 0), Glaucomys volans (0.29, 0.14), Myodes gapperi (0.27, 0), Napaeozapus insignis (0, 0.25), Peromyscus spp. (1.88, 0.11), T. striatus (1.06, 0.65), and Sorex cinereus (0.09, 0). The high B. mayonii infection prevalence in eastern chipmunks suggests that the species may be an important reservoir for B. mayonii in the Upper Midwest."

		"abstract": "Transmission of the causative agents of numerous infectious diseases might be potentially conducted by various routes if this is supported by the genetics of the pathogen. Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host-pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans' habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

Information regarding tick infestations and pathogens transmitted by ticks is important for the identification and prevention of disease. This study was a large-scale investigation of ticks collected from dogs and their associated environments in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It included detecting six prevalent tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma spp., A. platys, Borrelia spp., Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis, and E. chaffeensis). A total of 2293 ticks (1110 pools) were collected. Haemaphysalis longicornis (98.60%) was the most frequently collected tick species, followed by Ixodes nipponensis (0.96%) and H. flava (0.44%). Anaplasma spp. (24/1110 tick pools; 2.16%) and Borrelia spp. (4/1110 tick pools; 0.36%) were detected. The phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA genes revealed that the Anaplasma spp. detected in this study were closely associated with A. phagocytophilum reported in humans and rodents in the ROK. Borrelia spp. showed phylogenetic relationships with B. theileri and B. miyamotoi in ticks and humans in Mali and Russia. These results demonstrate the importance of tick-borne disease surveillance and control in dogs in the ROK."

Host blood protein digestion, essential for tick development and reproduction, occurs in tick midgut digestive cells driven by cathepsin proteases. Little is known about the regulation of the digestive proteolytic machinery of I. ricinus. Here we characterize a novel cystatin-type protease inhibitor, mialostatin, from the I. ricinus midgut. Blood feeding rapidly induced mialostatin expression in the gut, which continued after tick detachment. Recombinant mialostatin inhibited a number of I. ricinus digestive cysteine cathepsins, with the greatest potency observed against cathepsin L isoforms, with which it co-localized in midgut digestive cells. The crystal structure of mialostatin was determined at 1.55 Å to explain its unique inhibitory specificity. Finally, mialostatin effectively blocked in vitro proteolysis of blood proteins by midgut cysteine cathepsins. Mialostatin is likely to be involved in the regulation of gut-associated proteolytic pathways, making midgut cystatins promising targets for tick control strategies."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato - the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis - are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study 'Ticking on Pandora's Box' has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases - individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease - and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis. This article describes the background and design of the study protocol of 'Ticking on Pandora's Box'. With our study we hope to provide insight into the prevalence, clinical presentation and disease burden of the tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis, babesiosis, B. miyamotoi disease, neoehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and tick-borne encephalitis and to assist in test development as well as provide recommendations for national guidelines.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi) can cause a variety of clinical manifestations including Lyme neuroborreliosis. Following the tick-borne transmission, B. burgdorferi initially evade immune responses, later symptomatic infection is associated with occurrence of specific antibody responses. We hypothesized that B. burgdorferi induce immune hyporesponsiveness or immune suppression and aimed to investigate patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis ability to respond to immune stimulation. An observational cohort study investigating the stimulated immune response by standardized whole blood assay (TruCulture®) in adult patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis included at time of diagnosis from 01.09.2018-31.07.2020. Reference intervals were based on a 5-95% range of cytokine concentrations from healthy individuals (n = 32). Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis and references were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Heatmaps of cytokine responses were generated using the webtool Clustvis. In total, 22 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (19 definite, 3 probable) were included. In the unstimulated samples, the concentrations of cytokines in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis were comparable with references, except interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-1β and IL-8, which were all significantly below the references. Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis had similar concentrations of most cytokines in all stimulations compared with references. IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-17A were lower than references in multiple stimulations. In this exploratory cohort study, we found lower or similar concentrations of circulating cytokines in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis at time of diagnosis compared with references. The stimulated cytokine release in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis was in general slightly lower than in the references. Specific patterns of low IL-12 and IFN-γ indicated low Th1-response and low concentrations of IL-17A did not support a strong Th17 response. Our results suggest that patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis elicit a slightly suppressed or impaired immune response for the investigated stimulations, however, whether the response normalizes remains unanswered."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are a growing problem in many parts of the world, and their surveillance and control touch on challenging issues in medical entomology, agricultural health, veterinary medicine, and biosecurity. Spatial approaches can be used to synthesize the data generated by integrative One Health surveillance systems, and help stakeholders, managers, and medical geographers understand the current and future distribution of risk. Here, we performed a systematic review of over 8,000 studies and identified a total of 303 scientific publications that map tick-borne diseases using data on vectors, pathogens, and hosts (including wildlife, livestock, and human cases). We find that the field is growing rapidly, with the major Ixodes-borne diseases (Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in particular) giving way to monitoring efforts that encompass a broader range of threats. We find a tremendous diversity of methods used to map tick-borne disease, but also find major gaps: data on the enzootic cycle of tick-borne pathogens is severely underutilized, and mapping efforts are mostly limited to Europe and North America. We suggest that future work can readily apply available methods to track the distributions of tick-borne diseases in Africa and Asia, following a One Health approach that combines medical and veterinary surveillance for maximum impact."

		"abstract": "The most commonly reported vector-borne and tick-borne disease (TBD) in the United States is Lyme disease. Individuals with Lyme disease may present with a wide array of symptoms with resultant musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiac manifestations that may cause them to seek physical therapist services. The symptoms may develop insidiously and with a variable presentation among individuals. Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose patients early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that patients may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to patients for whom referral is recommended."

		"abstract": "Ticks and the pathogens they transmit, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths, constitute a growing burden for human and animal health worldwide. The ability of some animal species to acquire resistance to blood-feeding by ticks after a single or repeated infestation is known as acquired tick resistance (ATR). This resistance has been associated to tick-specific IgE response, the generation of skin-resident memory CD4+ T cells, basophil recruitment, histamine release, and epidermal hyperplasia. ATR has also been associated with protection to tick-borne tularemia through allergic klendusity, a disease-escaping ability produced by the development of hypersensitivity to an allergen. In addition to pathogen transmission, tick infestation in humans is associated with the α-Gal syndrome (AGS), a type of allergy characterized by an IgE response against the carbohydrate Galα1-3Gal (α-Gal). This glycan is present in tick salivary proteins and on the surface of tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agents of Lyme disease and granulocytic anaplasmosis. Most α-Gal-sensitized individuals develop IgE specific against this glycan, but only a small fraction develop the AGS. This review summarizes our current understanding of ATR and its impact on the continuum α-Gal sensitization, allergy, and the AGS. We propose that the α-Gal-specific IgE response in humans is an evolutionary adaptation associated with ATR and allergic klendusity with the trade-off of developing AGS."

		"abstract": "SUMMARYThe Borrelia spp. are tick-borne pathogenic spirochetes that include the agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. As part of their life cycle, the spirochetes traffic between the tick vector and the vertebrate host, which requires significant physiological changes and remodeling of their outer membranes and proteome. This crucial proteome resculpting is carried out by a diverse set of proteases, adaptor proteins, and related chaperones. Despite its small genome, Borrelia burgdorferi has dedicated a large percentage of its genome to proteolysis, including a full complement of ATP-dependent proteases. Energy-driven proteolysis appears to be an important physiological feature of this dual-life-cycle bacterium. The proteolytic arsenal of Borrelia is strategically deployed for disposal of proteins no longer required as they move from one stage to another or are transferred from one host to another. Likewise, the Borrelia spp. are systemic organisms that need to break down and move through host tissues and barriers, and so their unique proteolytic resources, both endogenous and borrowed, make movement more feasible. Both the Lyme disease and relapsing fever Borrelia spp. bind plasminogen as well as numerous components of the mammalian plasminogen-activating system. This recruitment capacity endows the spirochetes with a borrowed proteolytic competency that can lead to increased invasiveness."

While advances in sequencing technologies have accelerated a descriptive understanding of the tick microbiome, molecular and mechanistic insights into the tick microbiome are only beginning to emerge. Progress is stymied by technical difficulties in manipulating the microbiome and by biological variables related to the life cycle of Ixodid ticks. This review highlights these challenges and examines avenues to understand the significance of the tick microbiome in tick biology."

Nervous system involvement is known as Lyme neuroborreliosis; it only occurs in disseminated Lyme disease and is manifested by the classic triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis. Timeline is a significant factor when staging Lyme manifestations. However, certain cases do not follow the typical presentation timelines described in most literature. We report a case of a 66-year-old male who presented with progressively worsening generalized body aches, severe fatigue, and new-onset urine retention for two weeks. Physical examination revealed severe pain with neck flexion and lying supine and diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed a positive Lyme immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody with lymphocytic pleocytosis on lumbar puncture. He was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone for early disseminated Lyme disease. His radicular pain responded well to therapy, and he regained full bladder function. Bannwarth syndrome (BWS) is a term applied to the constellation of painful radiculoneuritis characterized as severe, burning, often dermatomal pain. In most cases, BWS affects the limbs, with only a few reported cases of sacral radiculitis causing neurogenic urinary dysfunction. Early recognition of this rare presentation associated with Lyme disease and treatment with antibiotics can prevent disease progression and detrimental neurological sequelae."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes of the family Borreliaceae are, with one exception, tick-borne pathogens of a variety of vertebrates. The family at present comprises two genera: Borrelia (Swellengrebel), which includes the agents of relapsing fever, avian spirochetosis, and bovine borreliosis, and Borreliella (Gupta et al.), which includes the agents of Lyme disease and was formerly known as 'Borrelia burgdorferi sensulato complex'. The two genera are distinguished not only by their disease associations but also biological features in the tick vector, including tissue location in unfed ticks and transovarial transmission. Borrelia species transmitted by argasid (soft) ticks tend to have more exclusive relationships with their tick vectors than do other Borrelia species and all Borreliella species that have ixodid (hard) ticks as vectors. The division of genera is supported by phylogenomic evidence from whole genomes and by several specific molecular markers. These distinguishing phylogenetic criteria also applied to three new species or isolates of Borrelia that were discovered in ixodid ticks of reptiles, a monotreme, and birds. Although the deep branching of the family from other spirochetes has been a challenge for inferences about evolution of the family, the discovery of related microorganisms in the gut microbiota of other arachnids suggests an ancestral origin for the family as symbionts of ticks and other arachnids."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases in California include Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi), infections with Borrelia miyamotoi, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum). We surveyed multiple sites and habitats (woodland, grassland, and coastal chaparral) in California to describe spatial patterns of tick-borne pathogen prevalence in western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). We found that several species of Borrelia-B. burgdorferi, Borrelia americana, and Borrelia bissettiae-were observed in habitats, such as coastal chaparral, that do not harbor obvious reservoir host candidates. Describing tick-borne pathogen prevalence is strongly influenced by the scale of surveillance: aggregating data from individual sites to match jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., county or state) can lower the reported infection prevalence. Considering multiple pathogen species in the same habitat allows a more cohesive interpretation of local pathogen occurrence. IMPORTANCE Understanding the local host ecology and prevalence of zoonotic diseases is vital for public health. Using tick-borne diseases in California, we show that there is often a bias to our understanding and that studies tend to focus on particular habitats, e.g., Lyme disease in oak woodlands. Other habitats may harbor a surprising diversity of tick-borne pathogens but have been neglected, e.g., coastal chaparral. Explaining pathogen prevalence requires descriptions of data on a local scale; otherwise, aggregating the data can misrepresent the local dynamics of tick-borne diseases."

On examination, he was febrile and had left leg pain with passive range of motion. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and elevated aminotransaminases. Due to his recent travel to the Northeastern United States, he was suspected of having a possible tick-borne illness. Serologies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, and the patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. He was treated with doxycyline, atovaquone and azithromycin, leading to resolution of symptoms. While co-infection with Lyme disease is common, infection with three tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever (RF), caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, is a globally distributed, vector-borne disease with high prevalence in developing countries. To date, signaling pathways required for infection and virulence of RF Borrelia spirochetes are unknown. Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), synthesized by diadenylate cyclases (DACs), is a second messenger predominantly found in Gram-positive organisms that is linked to virulence and essential physiological processes. Although Borrelia is Gram-negative, it encodes one DAC (CdaA), and its importance remains undefined. To investigate the contribution of c-di-AMP signaling in the RF bacterium Borrelia turicatae, a cdaA mutant was generated. The mutant was significantly attenuated during murine infection, and genetic complementation reversed this phenotype. Because c-di-AMP is essential for viability in many bacteria, whole-genome sequencing was performed on cdaA mutants, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified potential suppressor mutations. Additionally, conditional mutation of cdaA confirmed that CdaA is important for normal growth and physiology. Interestingly, mutation of cdaA did not affect expression of homologs of virulence regulators whose levels are impacted by c-di-AMP signaling in the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi Finally, the cdaA mutant had a significant growth defect when grown with salts, at decreased osmolarity, and without pyruvate. While the salt treatment phenotype was not reversed by genetic complementation, possibly due to suppressor mutations, growth defects at decreased osmolarity and in media lacking pyruvate could be attributed directly to cdaA inactivation. Overall, these results indicate CdaA is critical for B. turicatae pathogenesis and link c-di-AMP to osmoregulation and central metabolism in RF spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. Though human infection is mostly transmitted in a limited geography, the range has expanded in recent years. One notable area of recent expansion is in the mountainous region of southwestern Virginia. The ecological factors that facilitate or constrain the range of human Lyme disease in this region remain uncertain. To evaluate this further, we obtained ecological data, including remotely sensed data on forest structure and vegetation, weather data, and elevation. These data were aggregated within the census block groups of a 9,153 km2 area around the cities of Blacksburg and Roanoke, VA, an area with heterogeneous Lyme disease transmission. In this geographic area, 755 individuals were reported to have Lyme disease in the 10 yr from 2006 to 2015, and these cases were aggregated by block group. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to evaluate which environmental variables influenced the abundance of Lyme disease cases. Higher elevation and higher vegetation density had the greatest effect size on the abundance of Lyme disease. Measures of forest edge, forest integrity, temperature, and humidity were not associated with Lyme disease cases. Future southward expansion of Lyme disease into the southeastern states may be most likely in ecologically similar mountainous areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease that is widespread throughout the northern hemisphere. Ixodes ricinus is present throughout metropolitan France, except for the Mediterranean region. The debate revolves around whether or not a chronic form of Lyme disease exists. This controversy is not limited to France but has been reported worldwide. In France, in 2019, 24 scientific societies representing the medical disciplines most involved in Lyme disease, including the Société Française de Rhumatologie (French Rheumatology Society [SFR]) and the Société de Pathologie Infectieuse de la Langue Française (French Infectious Disease Society-SPILF), published recommendations on the management of Lyme borreliosis following a submission to the Director General of Health. These recommendations conflict with those of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), a multi-specialties independent group of physician, on a key point: whether to add a new nosological entity labeled as \"persistent polymorphous signs and symptoms (or syndrome) possibly due to tick bite.\" The creation of this new syndrome risks should increase anchoring bias, leading to the attribution of all symptoms to a possible tick bite, without considering differential diagnoses. Lyme disease has been extensively studied. Erythema migrans is the primary clinical manifestation. In the presence of nonmetabolic, nonseptic monoarthritis involving the knee or radiculitis of a lower limb during the summer, Lyme disease should be suspected. Serologic testing for Lyme disease is reliable in the case of late forms such as chronic arthritis, while the detection of Borrelia DNA in synovial fluid by PCR is inconsistent. Sometimes, the serology can be misleading in early forms such as radiculitis. Treatment is based on doxycycline for 14 days in early forms (radiculitis), or 28 days in late forms (arthritis). Arthritis can persist or recur after antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of a diffuse polyalgia syndrome (fibromyalgia) following Lyme disease does not seem to differ much from that in the general population. It is not improved by prolonged antibiotic therapy, which is therefore not recommended."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), is a life-threatening disease with clinical symptoms ranging from non-specific to severe inflammation of the central nervous system. Despite TBE is a notifiable disease in Serbia since 2004, there is no active TBE surveillance program for the serologic or molecular screening of TBEV infection in humans in the country. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the TBEV exposure among tick-infested individuals in Serbia during the year 2020. A total of 113 individuals exposed to tick bites were recruited for the study and screened for anti-TBEV antibodies using a commercial indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) test. Blood samples from 50 healthy donors not exposed to tick bites were included as a control group. Most of the enrolled patients reported infestations with one tick, being I. ricinus the most frequent tick found in the participants. The TBEV seroprevalence was higher (13.27%, 15 total 113) in tick-infested individuals than in healthy donors (4%, 2 total 50), although the difference was not significant. Notably, male individuals exposed to tick bites showed five times higher relative risk (RR) of being TBEV-seropositive than healthy donors of the same gender (RR= 5.1, CI = 1.6-19; p = 0.007). None of the seropositive individuals developed clinical manifestations of TBE, but the first clinical-stage of Lyme borreliosis (i.e., erythema migrans) was detected in seven of them. Potential TBEV foci were identified in rural areas, mostly in proximity or within the Fruška Gora mountain. We conclude that the Serbian population is at high risk of TBEV exposure. Further epidemiological studies should focus on potential TBEV foci identified in this study. The implementation of active surveillance for TBEV might contribute to evaluating the potential negative impact of TBE in Serbia."

From our search, we were able to find evidence of eight tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, Babesiosis, Lyme disease, Bourbon virus disease, Colorado tick fever disease, Tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever) affecting the bone. Pathological bone effects most commonly associated with tick-borne infections were disruption of bone marrow function and bone loss. Most research to date on the effects of tick-borne pathogen infections on bone has been quite preliminary. Further investigation of this topic is warranted."

However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later \"febrile patients\") based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in Serbia and other European countries. Rabies is a fatal zoonosis distributed worldwide and is caused by the rabies virus. Professionals at risk of rabies-including veterinarians, hunters, communal service workers, and forestry workers-overlap with some professions at a higher risk of exposure to tick bites and tick-borne pathogen infections. We hypothesized that individuals identified by the public health system as at risk of rabies virus infection, and consequently vaccinated against rabies virus, also share a higher likelihood of Borrelia exposure. To test our hypothesis, a case-control study was carried out during 2019 in Serbia to determine the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies in two case groups (individuals at risk and vaccinated against rabies virus) and a control group (individuals without risk of rabies). Individuals vaccinated against rabies following either \"pre-exposure protocol\" (PrEP, n = 58) or \"post-exposure protocol\" (PEP, n = 42) were considered as rabies risk groups and healthy blood donors (n = 30) as the control group. The results showed higher Borrelia seroprevalence in PrEP (17.2%; 10/58) and PEP (19.0%; 8/42) groups compared with the control group (6.67%; 2/30). Furthermore, odds ratio (OR) analysis showed that risk of rabies (in either the PrEP (OR = 2.91) or PEP (OR = 3.29) groups) is associated with increased odds of being seropositive to Borrelia. However, the difference in Borrelia seroprevalence between groups was not statistically significant (Chi-square (χ²) test p > 0.05). The shared odds of LB and rabies exposure found in this study suggest that, in countries where both diseases occur, the common citizen can be at risk of both diseases when in a risky habitat. These findings are important to guide physicians in targeting high-risk groups, and diagnose LB, and to guide decision-makers in targeting control and prevention measures for both infections in risk areas."

		"abstract": "In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country. The conclusion of this review is extending the requirement of greater efforts in research and government management for the diagnosis and treatment and as well as prevention of these diseases so that tick-borne disease burden should be minimizing in India."

The study included 60 people: 30 people with the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis and 30 healthy people aged 18-47. The mean age in the study group was 28.6 years. As a research tool, the General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) by Goldberg was used along with a socio-demographic questionnaire. The subjects diagnosed with neuroborreliosis obtained higher results in GHQ-28, both on individual scales: Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety, Insomnia, Social Dysfunction, Severe Depression, as well as the overall result, which is an indicator of the mental health status. As much as 70% of the patients experienced difficulties in functioning in the social area, 66% in the professional area, and 60% in the educational area. No impact of the disease on functioning in the family area has been demonstrated. The results of the study indicate some significant differences in the mental health status of people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis and that of healthy people. The patients obtained significantly higher results in GHQ-28 than the healthy subjects, which proves the poor mental health of the former. It was also confirmed that people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis experience difficulties in functioning in the social, professional and educational areas. Therefore, it becomes crucial to deepen research into mental health in tick-borne diseases, including neuroborreliosis, and to adapt and implement appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.

		"abstract": "Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

		"abstract": "A tick infestation is one of the most common arthropod-related skin diseases in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Ticks also act as an infectious disease vector for humans. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a highly mortal central nervous system infection caused by TBE virus (TBEV), has sporadically occurred there recently. However, there have been no epidemiological data on the current surveillance of human tick bites and the prevalence of TBEV in human-feeding ticks. This study was performed to clarify those indeterminate issues. One hundred and fifty-three ixodid ticks feeding on humans were collected from 150 outpatients in Hokkaido during the season of April to August 2018. None of the cases showed any infectious symptoms. These ticks were morphologically identified to species, and a cytopathic assay on baby hamster kidney cells was carried out to detect TBEV from each tick. The tick collection consisted of 108 Ixodes persulcatus (one nymph and 107 adult females), 44 female Ixodes ovatus, and one female Haemaphysalis japonica. No tick extracts showed positive results of the cytopathic assay, suggesting the non-existence of TBEV in the present specimens. However, the survey to detect TBEV from human-feeding ticks is still important to monitor the occurrence of TBE, because human tick bites by I. ovatus, a possible vector of TBEV, are increasing even in the northern and eastern areas of Hokkaido."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Over a 15-year period (2004-2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2 years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Tick saliva is a rich source of pharmacologically and immunologically active molecules. These salivary components are indispensable for successful blood feeding on vertebrate hosts and are believed to facilitate the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Here we present the functional and structural characterization of Iripin-3, a protein expressed in the salivary glands of the tick Ixodes ricinus, a European vector of tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. Belonging to the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors, Iripin-3 strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of serine proteases kallikrein and matriptase. In an in vitro setup, Iripin-3 was capable of modulating the adaptive immune response as evidenced by reduced survival of mouse splenocytes, impaired proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, suppression of the T helper type 1 immune response, and induction of regulatory T cell differentiation. Apart from altering acquired immunity, Iripin-3 also inhibited the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition to its functional characterization, we present the crystal structure of cleaved Iripin-3 at 1.95 Å resolution. Iripin-3 proved to be a pluripotent salivary serpin with immunomodulatory and anti-hemostatic properties that could facilitate tick feeding via the suppression of host anti-tick defenses. Physiological relevance of Iripin-3 activities observed in vitro needs to be supported by appropriate in vivo experiments."

The objective of this report was to perform preliminary serological survey of hospitalized population for LB. Methods: Sera were collected from 203 patients of a hospital located in Western Ukraine. Most patients showed clinical signs that were compatible with LB such as arthritis (n = 29), neurological signs (n = 35), and erythema migrans (EM)-like lesions (n = 60) or unrelated to LB (n = 79). The specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot for anti-Borrelia antibodies. Results: LB was confirmed in 8.6%, 34.5%, and 50% of the patients, who exhibited neurological signs, arthritis, or EM-like lesions, respectively. Anti-Borrelia antibodies were also detected in 6.3% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Conclusions: This study provides the first preliminary data on the seroprevalence of LB in Ukraine. Future studies are warranted to investigate more subsets of the Ukrainian population for this emerging tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "Ticks are obligate hematophagous parasites and are important vectors of a wide variety of pathogens. These pathogens include spirochetes in the genus Borrelia that cause Lyme disease, rickettsial pathogens, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, among others. Due to their prolonged feeding period of up to two weeks, hard ticks must counteract vertebrate host defense reactions in order to survive and reproduce. To overcome host defense mechanisms, ticks have evolved a large number of pharmacologically active molecules that are secreted in their saliva, which inhibits or modulates host immune defenses and wound healing responses upon injection into the bite site. These bioactive molecules in tick saliva can create a privileged environment in the host's skin that tick-borne pathogens take advantage of. In fact, evidence is accumulating that tick-transmitted pathogens manipulate tick saliva composition to enhance their own survival, transmission, and evasion of host defenses. We review what is known about specific and functionally characterized tick saliva molecules in the context of tick infection with the genus Borrelia, the intracellular pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Additionally, we review studies analyzing sialome-level responses to pathogen challenge."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD. As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins (n=645) than uninfected ticks (n=376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H2O2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H2O2, and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H2O2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD."

		"abstract": "Pathogen species often consist of genetically distinct strains, which can establish mixed infections or coinfections in the host. In coinfections, interactions between pathogen strains can have important consequences for their transmission success. We used the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which is the most common cause of Lyme disease in Europe, as a model multi-strain pathogen to investigate the relationship between coinfection, competition between strains, and strain-specific transmission success. Mus musculus mice were infected with one or two strains of B. afzelii, strain transmission success was measured by feeding ticks on mice, and the distribution of each strain in six different mouse organs and the ticks was measured using qPCR. Coinfection and competition reduced the tissue infection prevalence of both strains and changed their bacterial abundance in some tissues. Coinfection and competition also reduced the transmission success of the B. afzelii strains from the infected hosts to feeding ticks. The ability of the B. afzelii strains to establish infection in the host tissues was strongly correlated with their transmission success to the tick vector. Our study demonstrates that coinfection and competition between pathogen strains inside the host tissues can have major consequences for their transmission success."

The presence of Theileria equi genetic material was detected in 37 out of 512 examined horses (7.2%), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 9 (1.8%). The DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi was found in 11 out of 204 examined horses (5.4%).

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is predominantly caused by Borrelia afzelii and transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Although Borrelia behavior throughout tick development is quite well documented, specific molecular interactions between Borrelia and the tick have not been satisfactorily examined. Here, we present the first transcriptomic study focused on the expression of tick midgut genes regulated by Borrelia. By using massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE), we searched for tick transcripts expressed differentially in the midgut of unfed, 24h-fed, and fully fed I. ricinus nymphs infected with B. afzelii. In total, we identified 553 upregulated and 530 downregulated tick genes and demonstrated that B. afzelii interacts intensively with the tick. Technical and biological validations confirmed the accuracy of the transcriptome. The expression of five validated tick genes was silenced by RNA interference. Silencing of the uncharacterized protein (GXP_Contig_30818) delayed the infection progress and decreased infection prevalence in the target mice tissues. Silencing of other genes did not significantly affect tick feeding nor the transmission of B. afzelii, suggesting a possible role of these genes rather in Borrelia acquisition or persistence in ticks. Identification of genes and proteins exploited by Borrelia during transmission and establishment in a tick could help the development of novel preventive strategies for Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Throughout its enzootic cycle, the Lyme disease spirochete Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi, senses and responds to changes in its environment using a small repertoire of transcription factors that coordinate the expression of genes required for infection of Ixodes ticks and various mammalian hosts. Among these transcription factors, the DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in B. burgdorferi during periods of nutrient limitation and is required for mammalian infectivity. In many pathogenic bacteria, the gene regulatory activity of DksA, along with the alarmone guanosine penta- and tetra-phosphate ((p)ppGpp), coordinate the stringent response to various environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of DksA in regulating the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase and its role in the regulation of RpoS-dependent gene expression required for B. burgdorferi infectivity. Using in vitro transcription assays, we observed recombinant DksA inhibits RpoD-dependent transcription by B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase independent of ppGpp. Additionally, we determined the pH-inducible expression of RpoS-dependent genes relies on DksA, but this relationship is independent of (p)ppGpp produced by Relbbu. Subsequent transcriptomic and western blot assays indicate DksA regulates the expression of BBD18, a protein previously implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS. Moreover, we observed DksA was required for infection of mice following intraperitoneal inoculation or for transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Together, these data suggest DksA plays a central role in coordinating transcriptional responses in B. burgdorferi required for infectivity through DksA's interactions with RNA polymerase and post-transcriptional control of RpoS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus, the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "A growing global health concern, Lyme disease has become the most common tick-borne disease in the United States and Europe. Caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), this disease can be debilitating if not treated promptly. Because diagnosis is challenging, prevention remains a priority; however, a previously licensed vaccine is no longer available to the public. Here, we designed a six component vaccine that elicits antibody (Ab) responses against all Borrelia strains that commonly cause Lyme disease in humans. The outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia was fused to a bacterial ferritin to generate self-assembling nanoparticles. OspA-ferritin nanoparticles elicited durable high titer Ab responses to the seven major serotypes in mice and non-human primates at titers higher than a previously licensed vaccine. This response was durable in rhesus macaques for more than 6 months. Vaccination with adjuvanted OspA-ferritin nanoparticles stimulated protective immunity from both B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii infection in a tick-fed murine challenge model. This multivalent Lyme vaccine offers the potential to limit the spread of Lyme disease."

A total of 105 field surveys were done from 2016 to 2018 in 41 sites, from north to south, in the prefecture. All 4806 ticks collected were identified and classified by species, sex, and developmental stage. Twelve species were recorded: Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis hystricis, Haemaphysalis japonica, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Ixodes ovatus, Ixodes nipponensis, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes monospinosus, Ixodes columnae, and Ixodes turdus. The major tick species in Niigata prefecture were H. flava, H. longicornis, and I. ovatus and they comprised 93.4% of all samples. These three species have one generation per year. Climatic and anthropogenic factors may be involved in the substantial change of the endemic species composition from a previous tick survey (1959) in the Niigata prefecture. These factors include increasing temperatures, introduction of new hosts such as the wild boar, highway construction, and a rural exodus facilitating animal migration and reproduction. Tick hosts suitable for the transmission of Japanese spotted fever, Lyme borreliosis, and SFTS occur in Niigata prefecture. Heightened awareness of these three tick-borne diseases is needed for preparation and disease prevention."

		"abstract": "In children, tick-borne encephalitis and neuroborreliosis are common infections affecting the central nervous system. As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "Exposure of sheep to Borreliaburgdorferi sensulato (s.I.) complex, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis (LB), has been reported in tick-abundant areas worldwide, while no data have been reported in Greece. The aim of the study was to identify the hematological alterations in sheep with seropositivity against Borrelia burgdorferi (s.I.). Blood samples were obtained from 318 tick infested sheep for blood analysis and serological determination of IgG and IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi by indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay after exclusion of endo-ectoparasites and other tick-borne infections. A total number of 162 sheep met the inclusion criteria, allocated in four groups based on the presence or absence of IgG and/or IgM; sheep found negative for IgM and IgG (Group A), positive for IgM (Group B), positive for both IgM and IgG (Group C) and positive for IgG (Group D). Anemia, thrombocytopenia and normal or decreased leukocyte count, mainly due to lymphopenia were the main hematological features observed in seropositive sheep. The presence of these features raises the suspicion of Borrelia infection in tick infested sheep. The seropositivity of 23.58% in sheep raises concerns of Borrelia circulation, especially in rural areas and potential risk of transmission to humans."

Most commonly, it presents with seventh cranial nerve palsy, often mimicking stroke and atypical rash (erythema migrans). Atypical presentations include abdominal pain, ileus/pseudo-obstruction and constipation thought to be due to autonomic dysfunction. Other less common presentations include Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormones (SIADH). Lyme disease should be a differential when a patient presents from Lyme endemic areas with abdominal pain, constipation and SIADH in the setting of other causes of gastrointestinal and renal symptoms ruled out.

		"abstract": "In the United States, exposure to human-biting ixodid ticks can occur while spending time on residential properties or in neighborhood green spaces as well as during recreational or occupational activities on public lands. Human-biting tick species collectively transmit >15 species of pathogenic microorganisms and the national burden of tick-borne diseases is increasing. The prospect of a new Lyme disease vaccine for use in humans provides hope for substantial reduction in the >450,000 estimated annual cases of Lyme disease but this breakthrough would not reduce cases of other tick-borne diseases, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsiosis, and Powassan encephalitis. One intriguing question is to what extent a new Lyme disease vaccine would impact the use of personal protection measures acting broadly against tick-bites. The main tick vector for Lyme disease spirochetes in the eastern United States, Ixodes scapularis, also transmits causative agents of anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan encephalitis; and this tick species co-occurs with other human-biting vectors such as Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis. It therefore is important that a new Lyme disease vaccine does not result in reduced use of tick-bite prevention measures, such as tick repellents, permethrin-treated clothing, and frequent tick checks. Another key issue is the continuing problem with tick exposure on residential properties, which represents a heavily used outdoor environment the residents cannot reasonably avoid and where they tend to spend large amounts of time outside. As it may not be realistic to keep up daily vigilance with personal protective measures against tick-bites on residential properties during many months of every year, homeowners may also consider the option to suppress host-seeking ticks by means of deer fencing, landscaping, vegetation management, and use of products to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks infesting rodents. When considering the full range of options for actions that can be taken to suppress host-seeking ticks on residential properties, it is clear that individual homeowners face a difficult and bewildering task in deciding what to do based on very general guidance from public health agencies (developed without the benefit of a strong evidence base) and often without ready access to local public health professionals experienced in tick control. This situation is not satisfactory but cannot be corrected without first addressing knowledge gaps regarding the impact of peridomestic tick control measures on host-seeking ticks, human tick-bites, and tick-borne diseases. In parallel with this effort, there also is a need to increase the local public health workforce with knowledge of and experience with tick control to provide better access for homeowners to sound and objective advice regarding tick control on their properties based on key characteristics of the landscaping, habitat composition, and use patterns by wild animal tick hosts as well as the residents."

		"abstract": "Although tick-borne diseases account for a large number of health care visits in the United States, clinical practices for tick bite and Lyme disease treatment and prevention are not well understood. The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli's DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

		"abstract": "Canadians face an emerging threat of Lyme disease due to the northward expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. We evaluated the degree of I. scapularis population establishment and Borrelia burgdorferi occurrence in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 2017-2019 using active surveillance at 28 sites. We used a field indicator tool developed by Clow et al. to determine the risk of I. scapularis establishment for each tick cohort at each site using the results of drag sampling. Based on results obtained with the field indicator tool, we assigned each site an ecological classification describing the pattern of tick colonization over two successive cohorts (cohort 1 was comprised of ticks collected in fall 2017 and spring 2018, and cohort 2 was collected in fall 2018 and spring 2019). Total annual site-specific I. scapularis density ranged from 0 to 16.3 ticks per person-hour. Sites with the highest density were located within the Greenbelt zone, in the suburban/rural areas in the western portion of the city of Ottawa, and along the Ottawa River; the lowest densities occurred at sites in the suburban/urban core. B. burgdorferi infection rates exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern. Of the 23 sites for which data for two tick cohorts were available, 11 sites were classified as \"high-stable\", 4 were classified as \"emerging\", 2 were classified as \"low-stable\", and 6 were classified as \"non-zero\". B. burgdorferi-infected ticks were found at all high-stable sites, and at one emerging site. These findings suggest that high-stable sites pose a risk of Lyme disease exposure to the community as they have reproducing tick populations with consistent levels of B. burgdorferi infection. Continued surveillance for I. scapularis, B. burgdorferi, and range expansion of other tick species and emerging tick-borne pathogens is important to identify areas posing a high risk for human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the face of ongoing climate change and urban expansion."

		"abstract": "The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.IMPORTANCE Blood-feeding arthropod microbiomes often play important roles in disease transmission, yet the factors that structure tick microbial communities in the Neotropics are unknown. Utilizing ticks collected from live animals in neotropical forest fragments, this study teases apart the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tick-associated factors on tick microbial composition as well as which specific microbes contribute to differences across tick species, tick life stages, the mammals they fed on, and the locations from where they were sampled. Furthermore, this study provides revelations of how notable tick-associated bacterial genera are interacting with other tick-associated microbes as well as the forest animals they encounter."

When the disease affects the central nervous system, it is referred to as neuroborreliosis. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is most often caused by Borrelia garinii. Although it is known that in the host Lyme borreliae spread from the tick bite site to distant tissues via the blood vasculature, the adherence of Lyme borreliae to human brain microvascular endothelial cells has not been studied before. Decorin binding proteins are adhesins expressed on Lyme borreliae. They mediate the adhesion of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan, and the lysine residues located in the binding site of decorin binding proteins are important to the binding activity. In this study, we show that lysine residues located in the canonical binding site can also be found in decorin binding proteins of Borrelia garinii, and that these lysines contribute to biglycan and decorin binding. Most importantly, we show that the lysine residues are crucial for the binding of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan expressing human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which in turn suggests that they are involved in the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis."

Here we present results of a study on tick-borne pathogens detected from tick vectors and rodent reservoirs from an ongoing 5-yr tick suppression study in the Lyme disease-endemic state of Maryland, where human-biting tick species, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes), are abundant. During the 2017 tick season, we collected 207 questing ticks and 602 ticks recovered from 327 mice (Peromyscus spp. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)), together with blood and ear tissue from the mice, at seven suburban parks in Howard County. Ticks were selectively tested for the presence of the causative agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [s.l.]), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), babesiosis (Babesia microti), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 'Panola Mountain' Ehrlichia) and spotted fever group rickettsiosis (Rickettsia spp.). Peromyscus ear tissue and blood samples were tested for Bo. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s), A. phagocytophilum, Ba. microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi. We found 13.6% (15/110) of questing I. scapularis nymphs to be Bo. burgdorferi s.l. positive and 1.8% (2/110) were A. phagocytophilum positive among all sites. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was found in 71.1% (54/76) of I. scapularis nymphs removed from mice and 58.8% (194/330) of captured mice. Results from study on tick abundance and pathogen infection status in questing ticks, rodent reservoirs, and ticks feeding on Peromyscus spp. will aid efficacy evaluation of the integrated tick management measures being implemented."

A total of 270 patients presenting with a constellation of digestive symptoms - and who had no apparent digestive pathology and reported no prior diagnosis or treatments for VBI - were analyzed. Before the initial visit, all patients completed a review of systems medical history form, which comprised 19 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and 73 non-GI-related symptoms and conditions. Patients were tested for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by lactulose breath test. VBI (babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis) was established using 1 or more of several blood tests. Odds ratio (OR) analysis determined associations between exposure to VBI, SIBO, and presenting symptoms/conditions. Two age groups (≤35 years and ≥36 years) were studied using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratum-based test. A higher OR (2.03, 95% CI: 1.5-3.6) was found between patients with ≥3 digestive symptoms and positive blood tests for ≥1 VBI. Five of the 19 GI symptoms were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: food intolerance, indigestion, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and heartburn. A similar association in patients with ≥3 non-GI symptoms (OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.3-6.4) was observed. Five of the 73 non-GI symptoms/conditions were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: chest pain, shortness of breath, extremity or joint pain, anxiety, and night sweats. Having ≥3 of any digestive or nondigestive symptoms generated significant relative risk of being VBI-positive. Presence of SIBO alone did not identify significant relative risk for a VBI, and age was not a confounder. Findings revealed an association between positive blood tests for vector-borne illness and chronically symptomatic patients regardless of whether symptoms were digestive or nondigestive. The manifestation of 3 or more gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms should raise suspicion for a VBI."

A region immediately downstream of the 16S rRNA gene, which included the gene encoding SdhC, was sequenced. For the A. phagocytophilum strains from patients no sequence differences were detected in this region. In contrast, significantly fewer ticks had a sequence encoding SdhC that was identical to that of the human strains (11/16 vs. 16/16, p = 0.04). This variation is consistent with the premise that not all A. phagocytophilum strains present in nature are able to cause clinical illness in humans. A strain referred to as A. phagocytophilumVariant-1 that is regarded as non-pathogenic for humans was previously described using a different typing method. Data from the current study suggest that both typing methods are identifying the same non-pathogenic strains."

The age, sex, and geographic composition of the enrolled population during 2010-2018 remained proportionally stable, despite fluctuations in the number of enrollees. Annual incidence of Lyme disease diagnoses per 100,000 enrollees ranged from 49 to 88, ≈6-8 times higher than that observed for cases reported through notifiable disease surveillance. Age and sex distributions among Lyme disease diagnoses in MarketScan were similar to those of cases reported through surveillance, but proportionally more diagnoses occurred outside of peak summer months, among female enrollees, and outside high-incidence states. Misdiagnoses, particularly in low-incidence states, may account for some of the observed epidemiologic differences. Commercial claims provide a stable data source to monitor trends in Lyme disease diagnoses, but certain important characteristics warrant further investigation."

The environmental and human components of Lyme disease risk in open habitats remain unknown. We quantified the environmental hazard and risk factors for human tick bite exposure among treeless islands with low and high Lyme disease incidence in the Western Isles. We found a higher prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks on high-incidence than on low-incidence islands (6.4% vs. 0.7%); we also found that residents of high-incidence islands reported increased tick bite exposure. Most tick bites (72.7%) occurred <1 km from the home, including many in home gardens. Residents of high Lyme disease incidence islands reported increasing problems with ticks; many suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. We highlight the benefits of an integrated approach in understanding the factors that contribute to Lyme disease emergence."

Hard ticks are obligate haematophagous ectoparasites that serve as vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi. Studies on the presence of Lyme borreliosis in Egyptian animals and associated ticks are scarce. This study was conducted to detect B. burgdorferi in different tick vectors and animal hosts. Three hundred animals (dogs=100, cattle=100, and camels=100) were inspected for tick infestation. Blood samples from 160 tick-infested animals and their associated ticks (n=1025) were collected and examined for the infection with B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The identified tick species were characterized molecularly by PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 region. The overall tick infestation rate among examined animals was 78.33% (235/300). The rate of infestation was significantly higher in camels (90%), followed by cattle (76%) and dogs (69%); (P = 0.001). Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, and both Hyalomma dromedarii and Amblyomma variegatum, were morphologically identified from infested dogs, cattle, and camels; respectively. Molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region confirmed the morphological identification, as well as displayed high similarities of R. sanguineus, H. dromedarii, and A. Variegatu with ticks identified in Egypt and various continents worldwide. Just one dog (1.67%) and its associated tick pool of R. sanguineus were positive for B. burgdorferi infection. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for B. burgdorferi in dog and R. sanguineus tick pool showed a 100% homology. Analyzed data revealed a relatively low rate of B. burgdorferi infection, but a significantly high prevalence of tick infestation among domesticated animals in Egypt, which possesses a potential animal and public health risk. Additionally, molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region was a reliable tool to discriminate species of ticks and confirmed the morphological identification."

To date, in the US, LD diagnostics is primarily based on validated two-tiered serological testing, which overall exhibits low sensitivity among other drawbacks. In the present study, a potential of Raman spectroscopy (RS) to detect Bb infection in mice has been explored. For that, C3H mice were infected with wild-type Bb strains, 297, B31, or B31-derived mutant, ∆vlsE. Blood samples taken prior to and post Bb infection were subjected to RS. The data demonstrated that RS did not directly detect Bb spirochetes in blood, but rather sensed biochemical changes associated with Bb infection. Despite Bb infection-associated blood changes detectable by RS were very limited, the partial least square discriminant analysis showed that the average true positive rates were 86% for 297 and 89% for B31 and ∆vlsE."

		"abstract": "The ecology of vector-borne diseases in a region can be attributed to vector-host interactions. In the United States, tick-borne pathogens are the cause of the highest number of reported vector-borne diseases. In the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, have increased in incidence, with tick-host-pathogen interactions considered a contributing factor to this increase. Ticks become infected with pathogens after taking a blood meal from a systemically infected host or through a localized infection while co-feeding on a host with other infected ticks. The host not only plays a role in pathogen acquisition by the tick, but can also facilitate dispersal of the tick locally within a region or over greater distances into new geographical ranges outside of their historical distributional range. In this study conducted in southeastern Virginia (USA), we examined the interaction between both resident and migratory bird species and Ixodes ticks, the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) the main causative agent of Lyme disease on the East coast of the United States. Over a two-year period (2012-2014), 1879 passerine birds were surveyed, with 255 Ixodes ticks tested for the presence of Borrelia spp. Eighty passerine birds (4.3 %) representing 17 bird species were parasitized by at least one Ixodes tick, but only three bird species were parasitized by Ixodes ticks that tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. Twenty Ixodes ticks (7.8 %) tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. with nearly all collected from resident bird species including the Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) and brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum). Given that millions of birds pass through southeastern Virginia during migration, even with the low number of Ixodes ticks parasitizing passerine birds and the low prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.s. found within Ixodes ticks collected, the sheer volume of passerine birds suggests they may play a role in the maintenance and dispersal of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Virginia."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector of several tick-borne pathogens, including those causing Lyme disease and babesiosis, in the eastern United States and active collection methods for this species include dragging or wild animal sampling. Nest boxes targeting mice may be an alternative strategy for the surveillance and collection of immature I. scapularis feeding on these hosts and would be much safer for animals compared to small mammal trapping. We constructed double-walled insulated nest boxes (DWINs) with collection tubes mounted below the nesting chamber and deployed eleven in southern Wisconsin from June until September of 2020. The DWINs were occupied by Peromyscus spp. and birds (wren species, Troglodytidae family). We collected 192 ticks from collection tubes, all of which were identified as either I. scapularis (95%) or Dermacentor variabilis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (5%). Only 12% (21/182) and 20% (2/10) of I. scapularis and D. variabilis were blood-fed, respectively. The high proportion of unfed ticks found in collection tubes may be due to grooming by hosts inside the nest boxes. Alternatively, immature ticks may have climbed trees and entered the DWIN seeking a host. Results suggest that nest boxes could be a tool for finding ticks in areas of low density or at the leading edge of invasion, when small mammal trapping or drag sampling is not feasible."

However, the relevance of different tick-borne diseases (TBDs) may vary in human vs. veterinary medicine, which is consequently reflected by the availability of human vs. veterinary diagnostic tests. Yet, as TBDs gain importance in both fields and rare zoonotic pathogens, such as Babesia spp., are increasingly identified as causes of human disease, a One Health approach regarding development of new diagnostic tools may lead to synergistic benefits. This review gives an overview on zoonotic protozoan, bacterial and viral tick-borne pathogens worldwide, discusses commonly used diagnostic techniques for TBDs, and compares commercial availability of diagnostic tests for humans vs. domestic animals, using Germany as an example, with the aim of highlighting existing gaps and opportunities for collaboration in a One Health framework."

		"abstract": "This study was designed to determine the quality of life, diagnostic, and illness-related experiences of patients who self-report a diagnosis with Lyme disease (LD) and/or who are experiencing chronic illness in Texas, a state considered non-endemic for tick-borne illness. This exploratory study found that self-reported LD respondents have multisystem health problems that result in very poor quality of life. Lyme disease respondents experience multiple and severe symptoms, particularly flu-like illness, extreme fatigue, back and neck pain, and anxiety and depression. These symptoms were present at similar levels among all LD respondents, whether their diagnosis was clinical or serological. For all LD respondents, this study points to quality of life experiences that are powerfully negative. Practitioners and disease surveillance experts may consider LD when multisystem symptoms are severe, other etiologies are ruled out, and quality of life is threatened."

		"abstract": "Ticks exist on all continents and carry more zoonotic pathogens than any other type of vector. Ticks spend most of their lives in the external environment away from the host and are thus expected to be affected by changes in climate. Most empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate or predict range shifts or increases in ticks and tick-borne diseases, but there can be a lot of heterogeneity in such predictions. Tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. Modeling studies can help tease apart and understand the roles of different drivers of change. Predictive models can also be invaluable in projecting changes according to different climate change scenarios. However, validating these models remains challenging, and estimating uncertainty in predictions is essential. Another focus for future research should be assessing the resilience of ticks and tick-borne pathogens to climate change."

		"abstract": "Dogs in the US are commonly infected with vector-borne pathogens, including heartworm and tick-borne disease agents. The geographic distribution of both arthropod vectors and the pathogens they transmit continues to expand. To describe the current geographic distribution and prevalence of antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. in dogs, we summarized over 144 million test results from 2013 to 2019, inclusive, by county, state, and region. Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas. Annual reports of human cases of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis were associated with percent positive canine results by state for the three tick-borne disease agents (R2 = 0.812, 0.521, and 0.546, respectively). Within endemic areas, percent positive test results for all three tick-borne agents demonstrated evidence of geographic expansion. Large scale analysis of results from screening dogs in practice for evidence of vector-borne infections, including those with zoonotic importance, continues to be a valuable strategy for understanding geographic trends in infection risk over time."

		"abstract": "In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space."

This study was performed retrospectively on CSF and serum samples collected from children evaluated for LNB (n = 233) and controls with other specific neurological disorders (n = 59) in a Swedish Lyme endemic area. For anti-Borrelia antibody index, the IDEIA Lyme Neuroborreliosis kit (Oxoid) was used. Two in-house real-time PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA gene were evaluated (TaqMan® and LUX™). Among patients classified as LNB cases (n = 102), five children (5%) were Borrelia PCR-positive in CSF with the TaqMan® assay. In the Non-LNB group (n = 131), one patient was Borrelia PCR positive with the TaqMan® assay. Among controls (n = 59), all CSF samples were PCR negative. When amplifying and sequencing ospA, we found B. garinii (n = 2), B. afzelii (n = 2), B. bavariensis (n = 1), and one untypable (n = 1). With the LUX™ technology, all CSF samples were PCR negative. The TaqMan® assay could detect only few cases (n = 6) of B. burgdorferi s.l. in CSF among children with LNB and the sensitivity was very low (5%). However, using larger CSF volumes and centrifugation of samples, the PCR technique could still be useful as a complementary diagnostic method when evaluating LNB. Furthermore, detection of spirochete DNA in clinical matrices, including CSF, is the method of choice for studying epidemiological aspects of LNB, a tick-borne emerging disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the leading tick-borne illness in the United States. However, due to, in part, to the significant number of proteins of unknown function encoded across the complex fragmented genome, the molecular mechanisms of B. burgdorferi infection remain largely undefined. Previous work identified the virulence determinant gene, bbk13, which is critical for B. burgdorferi's ability to establish a productive disseminated infection. BBK13 is an immunogenic, non-surface exposed protein of unknown function predicted to harbor an N-terminal transmembrane domain and annotated as a member of the SIMPL domain protein superfamily (PF04402). In eukaryotes, SIMPL domain proteins have been shown to contribute to NF-kappa-B signaling but have no known functions in prokaryotes. Herein we investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of BBK13 toward elucidation of its function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed secondary and tertiary structural homology between BBK13 and two other prokaryotic SIMPL domain proteins for which the crystal structures have been solved, Brucella abortus BP26 and Campylobacter jejuni cjSLP. Furthermore, comparable to BP26, recombinant BBK13 self-assembled into multimeric complexes in vitro and endogenous BBK13 was found in large oligomeric complexes in the spirochete membrane. Together these data suggest that the oligomeric structure of BBK13 may be important for the molecular function of this critical infection protein."

		"abstract": "Over the past three decades, citizens of Maine in the northeastern United States have experienced increasing blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) abundance and rising incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overabundance has been considered one cause of the high incidence of tick-borne diseases on offshore islands of New England. Most of Maine's 15 offshore, unbridged island communities have a history of concern about ticks, Lyme disease, and white-tailed deer overabundance, but have been challenged to keep deer numbers down through hunting or culls. This history has led to perennial, often divisive community debates about whether and how to reduce the size of their deer herds. In 2016 we conducted a convenience sample survey of year-round and summer residents of Maine's offshore islands to quantify the level of concern about Lyme disease, and assess the motivations and level of support for deer herd reduction. Among respondents, 84 % agreed Lyme disease was a problem on their island and 61 % supported deer herd reduction. Agreement that Lyme disease was a problem was associated with having acquired tick-borne disease as well as with tick bites without disease. Respondents ranked deer overabundance as a top cause of tick abundance and tick-borne disease and supported deer herd reduction as an approach to reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Other problems associated with deer overabundance (vehicle collisions, damage to landscaping, and damage to forests) also motivated support for deer reduction. Approval of doe permits, an expanded archery season, and sharpshooting as reduction methods was greater than an expanded firearms season. Respondents felt responsibility for tick control fell to the town for the most part, and recognized that multiple factors have contributed to the tick problem in Maine, not just deer."

Coinfection with multiple tick-borne pathogens may amplify severity of disease and complicate diagnosis and treatment. By testing 13,400 Ixodes ticks from 17 US states spanning five geographical regions for etiological agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto [s.s.] and Borrelia mayonii), Borrelia miyamotoi disease (Borrelia miyamotoi), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and babesiosis (Babesia microti) we show that B. burgdorferi s.s. was the most prevalent and widespread pathogen. Borrelia miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, and B. microti were widespread but less prevalent than B. burgdorferi s.s. Coinfections with B. burgdorferi s.s. and A. phagocytophilum or B. microti were most common in the Northeast and occurred at rates higher than expected based on rates of single infections in that region."

		"abstract": "Many species have experienced dramatic changes in both geographic range and population sizes in recent history. Increases in the geographic range or population size of disease vectors have public health relevance as these increases often precipitate the emergence of infectious diseases in human populations. Accurately identifying environmental factors affecting the biogeographic patterns of vector species is a long-standing analytical challenge, stemming from a paucity of data capturing periods of rapid changes in vector demographics. We systematically investigated the occurrence and abundance of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks at 532 sampling locations throughout New York State (NY), USA, between 2008 and 2018, a time frame that encompasses the emergence of diseases vectored by these ticks. Analyses of these field-collected data demonstrated a range expansion into northern and western NY during the last decade. Nymphal abundances increased in newly colonised areas, while remaining stable in areas with long-standing populations over the last decade. These trends in the geographic range and abundance of nymphs correspond to both the geographic expansion of human Lyme disease cases and increases in incidence rates. Analytic models fitted to these data incorporating time, space, and environmental factors, accurately identified drivers of the observed changes in nymphal occurrence and abundance. These models accounted for the spatial and temporal variation in the occurrence and abundance of nymphs and can accurately predict nymphal population patterns in future years. Forecasting disease risk at fine spatial scales prior to the transmission season can influence both public health mitigation strategies and individual behaviours, potentially impacting tick-borne disease risk and subsequently human disease incidence."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, is increasing in incidence and geographic distribution as the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, spreads to new regions. We re-construct the spatial-temporal invasion of the tick and human disease in the Midwestern US, a major focus of Lyme disease transmission, from 1967 to 2018, to analyse the influence of spatial factors on the geographic spread. A regression model indicates that three spatial factors-proximity to a previously invaded county, forest cover and adjacency to a river-collectively predict tick occurrence. Validation of the predictive capability of this model correctly predicts counties invaded or uninvaded with 90.6% and 98.5% accuracy, respectively. Reported incidence increases in counties after the first report of the tick; based on this modelled relationship, we identify 31 counties where we suspect I. scapularis already occurs yet remains undetected. Finally, we apply the model to forecast tick establishment by 2021 and predict 42 additional counties where I. scapularis will probably be detected based upon historical drivers of geographic spread. Our findings leverage resources dedicated to tick and human disease reporting and provide the opportunity to take proactive steps (e.g. educational efforts) to prevent and limit transmission in areas of future geographic spread."

		"abstract": "Ticks are globally distributed arthropods and a public health concern due to the many human pathogens they carry and transmit, including the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. As tick species' ranges increase, so do the number of reported tick related illnesses. The microbiome is a critical part of understanding arthropod biology, and the microbiome of pathogen vectors may provide critical insight into disease transmission and management. Yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the microbiome of wild ticks, including what effect the presence of multiple tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) has on the microbiome. In this study we chose samples based on life stage (adult or nymph) and which TBPs were present. We used DNA from previously extracted Ixodes scapularis ticks that tested positive for zero, one, two or three common TBPs (B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti). We produced 16S rRNA amplicon data for the whole tick microbiome and compared samples across TBPs status, single vs multiple coinfections, and life stages. Focusing on samples with a single TBP, we found no significant differences in microbiome diversity in ticks that were infected with B. burgdorferi and ticks with no TBPs. When comparing multiple TBPs, we found no significant difference in both alpha and beta diversity between ticks with a single TBP and ticks with multiple TBPs. Removal of TBPs from the microbiome did not alter alpha or beta diversity results. Life stage significantly correlated to variation in beta diversity and nymphs had higher alpha diversity than adult ticks. Rickettsia, a common tick endosymbiont, was the most abundant genus. This study confirms that the wild tick microbiome is highly influenced by life stage and much less by the presence of human pathogenic bacteria."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, can acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) responsible for diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [ANPH]), babesiosis (Babesia microti [BABE]), Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [BBSL]), and the relatively novel relapsing fever-like illness, Borrelia miyamotoi (BMIY) disease in the northeastern United States. Coinfections with these pathogens are becoming increasingly more common in I. scapularis and their hosts, likely attributed to their shared enzootic cycles. Urban habitats are favorable to host species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and these ungulates are known to be important to I. scapularis for reproduction and dispersal in North America. To understand the relationship between TBPs, white-tailed deer, and I. scapularis, we sampled eight sites across central Maryland collecting I. scapularis using standard tick dragging/flagging methods and retrieved others from deer carcasses. Pathogenic TBP species in each tick were determined using qPCR. In total, 903 adult ticks (deer: n = 573; questing: n = 330) revealed landscape-level prevalence of ANPH (27.8%), BABE (1.3%), BBSL (14.6%), and BMIY (0.8%) as singular infections overall. However, secondary coinfections of ANPH and BBSL were highest (9.9%) in ticks feeding from deer while associations of BBSL and BABE (4.2%) were highest in questing ticks. Results from this study provide evidence suggesting that adult I. scapularis acquire pathogenic species through phenologically associated host use, and thus, subsequent infections found in adults may provide insights into coinfection relationships."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an emerging vector-borne zoonotic disease of increasing public health importance in Canada. As part of its mandate, the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network (CLyDRN) launched a pan-Canadian sentinel surveillance initiative, the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN), in 2019. To create a standardized, national sentinel surveillance network providing a real-time portrait of the evolving environmental risk of Lyme disease in each province. A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used in the selection of sentinel regions. Within each sentinel region, a systematic drag sampling protocol was performed in selected sampling sites. Ticks collected during these active surveillance visits were identified to species, and Ixodes spp. ticks were tested for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti and Powassan virus. In 2019, a total of 567 Ixodes spp. ticks (I. scapularis [n=550]; I. pacificus [n=10]; and I. angustus [n=7]) were collected in seven provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The highest mean tick densities (nymphs/100 m2) were found in sentinel regions of Lunenburg (0.45), Montréal (0.43) and Granby (0.38). Overall, the Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence in ticks was 25.2% (0%-45.0%). One I. angustus nymph from British Columbia was positive for Babesia microti, a first for the province. The deer tick lineage of Powassan virus was detected in one adult I. scapularis in Nova Scotia. CaLSeN provides the first coordinated national active surveillance initiative for tick-borne disease in Canada. Through multidisciplinary collaborations between experts in each province, the pilot year was successful in establishing a baseline for Lyme disease risk across the country, allowing future trends to be detected and studied."

		"abstract": "Ticks transmit a diverse array of microbes to vertebrate hosts, including human pathogens, which has led to a human-centric focus in this vector system. Far less is known about pathogens of ticks themselves. Here, we discover that a toxin in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) horizontally acquired from bacteria-called domesticated amidase effector 2 (dae2)-has evolved to kill mammalian skin microbes with remarkable efficiency. Secreted into the saliva and gut of ticks, Dae2 limits skin-associated staphylococci in ticks while feeding. In contrast, Dae2 has no intrinsic ability to kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne Lyme disease bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest ticks resist their own pathogens while tolerating symbionts. Thus, just as tick symbionts can be pathogenic to humans, mammalian commensals can be harmful to ticks. Our study underscores how virulence is context-dependent and bolsters the idea that \"pathogen\" is a status and not an identity."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a tick-borne, zoonosis of adults and children caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The ailment, widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, continues to increase globally due to multiple environmental factors, coupled with increased incursion of humans into habitats that harbor the spirochete. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex. In North America, B. burgdorferi causes nearly all infections; in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii are most associated with human disease. The spirochete's unusual fragmented genome encodes a plethora of differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins that play a seminal role in the bacterium's ability to sustain itself within its enzootic cycle and cause disease when transmitted to its incidental human host. Tissue damage and symptomatology (i.e., clinical manifestations) result from the inflammatory response elicited by the bacterium and its constituents. The deposition of spirochetes into human dermal tissue generates a local inflammatory response that manifests as erythema migrans (EM), the hallmark skin lesion. If treated appropriately and early, the prognosis is excellent. However, in untreated patients, the disease may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly involving the central nervous system, joints, or heart. A small percentage (~10%) of patients may go on to develop a poorly defined fibromyalgia-like illness, post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) unresponsive to prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Below we integrate current knowledge regarding the ecologic, epidemiologic, microbiologic, and immunologic facets of Lyme disease into a conceptual framework that sheds light on the disorder that healthcare providers encounter."

		"abstract": "Tick bites in Australia are linked to the transmission of a variety of infectious diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife. Despite this recognition, little is currently known about the variety of potential pathogens that are carried and transmitted by Australian ticks. In this study, we attempted to expand knowledge of Australian tick-borne bacterial pathogens by analyzing various tick species from the state of Queensland for potential human pathogens belonging to the Rickettsia, Coxiella and Borrelia genera. A total of 203 ticks, comprising of four genera and nine different tick species, were screened by specific qPCR assays. An overall Rickettsia qPCR positivity of 6.4% (13/203) was detected with rickettsial DNA found in four tick species (Ixodes holocyclus, I. tasmani, Amblyommatriguttatum, and Haemaphysalis longicornis). Amplification and analysis of several rickettsial genes from rickettsial qPCR positive samples identified sequences closely related to but genetically distinct from several previously described cultured and uncultured rickettsial species in the Rickettsia spotted fever subgroup. No ticks were positive for either Coxiella or Borrelia DNA. This work suggests that a further diversity of rickettsiae remain to be described in Australian ticks with the full importance of these bacteria to human and animal health yet to be elucidated."

		"abstract": "Birds can act as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens and can also disperse pathogen-containing ticks to both nearby and remote localities. The aims of this study were to estimate tick infestation patterns on migratory birds and the prevalence of different Borrelia species and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks removed from birds in south-eastern Sweden. Ticks were collected from resident and migratory birds captured at the Ottenby Bird Observatory, Öland, Sweden, from March to November 2009. Ticks were molecularly identified to species, and morphologically to developmental stage, and the presence of Borrelia bacteria and TBEV was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. A total of 1339 ticks in the genera Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, and Ixodes was recorded of which I. ricinus was the most abundant species. Important tick hosts were the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), Blackbird (Turdus merula), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), and Common whitethroat (Sylvia communis). Borrelia bacteria were detected in 25% (285/1,124) of the detached ticks available for analysis. Seven Borrelia species (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi (s.s.), B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. turdi, B. valaisiana, and B. miyamotoi) were identified. B. turdi was recorded for the first time in ticks in Sweden. The number of Borrelia cells per tick ranged from 2.0 × 100 to 7.0 × 105. B. miyamotoi-containing ticks contained a significantly higher median number of Borrelia cells than B. burgdorferi (s.l.)-containing ticks. B. garinii and B. miyamotoi were the most prevalent Borrelia species in tick larvae. Larvae of I. ricinus with B. garinii were removed from seven bird species, particularly S. communis and A. trivialis, which may suggest that the larvae had contracted the Borrelia bacteria from or via these birds. Also, a high percentage of tick larvae containing B. miyamotoi was removed from E. rubecula. All ticks were negative for TBEV. The results corroborate the view that the contributions of birds to human disease are substantial, particularly as blood hosts for ticks and for their short-, medium-, and long-distance dispersal. Moreover, several ground-foraging bird species appear to be important for the maintenance and dispersal of Borrelia species. The absence of TBEV in the ticks conforms to other similar studies."

		"abstract": "Although the prevalence of Lyme and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) continues to rise, there is conflicting information regarding the best approach to management. The Lifespan Lyme Disease Clinic (LDC) is an academic out- patient clinic for Lyme and other TBDs. A chart review of 218 new patients between March and November 2018 was conducted. Symptoms most commonly reported included fatigue (66.5%), joint pain (58.2%), cognitive difficulty (32.1%), and headaches (27.9%). Most (87.1%) patients had received TBD-directed antibiotic treatment prior to their first appointment. Of the 136 patients who had experienced more than 6 months of symptoms attributed to Lyme, 55.1% had positive two-tiered serologies. Many patients characterized themselves as having \"chronic Lyme\" or had a diagnosis of \"post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome,\" a condition for which there is no clear consensus on pathophysiology or treatment. Outlined here are some lessons learned and practical approaches used by LDC physicians in caring for this patient population."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spp. is the most common human tick-borne disease in Europe. Although seroprevalence studies are conducted in several countries, rates of seroconversion and seroreversion are lacking, and they are essential to determine the risk of infection. Seropositivity was determined using a two-step approach-first, a serological screening assay, and in the event of a positive or equivocal result, a confirmatory immunoblot assay. Seroconversion and seroreversion rates were assessed from blood samples taken from participants included in two nation-wide population-based surveys. Moreover, the impact of antigen reactivity on seroreversion rates was assessed. The seroprevalence of antibodies reacting against B. burgdorferi spp. in the German population was 8.5% (95% CI 7.5-9.6) in 1997-99 and 9.3% (95% CI 8.3-10.4) in 2008-2011. Seroprevalence increased with age, up to 20% among 70-79 year-olds. The age-standardized seroprevalence remained the same. The yearly seroconversion rate was 0.45% (95% CI: 0.37-0.54), and the yearly seroreversion rate was 1.47% (95% CI: 1.24-2.17). Lower levels of antibodies were associated with seroreversion. Participants with a strong response against antigen p83 had the lowest odds on seroreversion. Given the yearly seroreversion rate of 1.47% and a seroprevalence up to 20% in the oldest age groups, at least 20% of the German population becomes infected with B. burgdorferi in their lifetime. The slight increase in seroprevalence between the two serosurveys was caused by an aging population."

		"abstract": "The relapsing fever group Borrelia miyamotoi is an emerging tick-borne pathogen. Diagnosis of infection is currently mainly based on serological methods detecting antibodies against B. miyamotoi glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ). Here, we scrutinized the reliability of GlpQ as a diagnostic marker and compared the seroprevalence in different study populations and by applying various immunoblotting methods. Antibodies were detected in the sera of 7/53 hunters and in 1/11 sera of Lyme neuroborreliosis patients. Furthermore, 17/74 sera of persons with high concentrations of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (α-Bbsl) antibodies reacted strongly with B. miyamotoi GlpQ in immunoblots. The B. miyamotoi GlpQ seroprevalence was 7/50 in α-Bbsl negative persons. In healthy blood donors from commercial suppliers and from the Austrian Red Cross, seroprevalences were 5/14 and 10/35, respectively. Strikingly, two B. miyamotoi PCR-positive cases from Austria had negative GlpQ serology, indicating poor sensitivity. Finally, when we analyzed sera of dogs, we found α-B. miyamotoi GlpQ antibody seroprevalence in tick-free dogs (n = 10) and in tick-exposed dogs (n = 19) with 2/10 and 8/19, respectively. Thus, our results indicate that GlpQ-based B. miyamotoi serology holds neither specificity nor sensitivity."

		"abstract": "In the territory of the Primorsky region, the nosoareas of causative agents of tick-borne infections often coincide and lead to mixed infection of ticks, which causes the mixed pathology in humans . We investigated ixodid ticks taken from people during the epidemic season of 2019 for the spectrum of pathogens of transmissible infections to determine the degree of their mono- and mixed infection. 651 specimens of ixodid ticks investigated. RNA/DNA pathogens was determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TBEV antigen by ELISA. The presence in ticks of pathogens of the following diseases was detected: Lyme borreliosis (35.3%), tick-borne replasing fever (11.3%), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (2.6%), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (2.4%), tick-borne encephalitis (1.8%), tick-borne ricketsiosis (1.0%). As agents of mono-infections, the virus of TBE, ehrlichia, anaplasma and rickettsia in ticks occurred less frequently than in combination with other pathogens. A high frequency of occurrence B. burgdorferi s.l. in mono-infection detected (58.7%). B. miyamotoi has met evenly at ticks with mono- and mixed infections. Total mixed infection of ticks was 23.1%. Borrelia have been identified in all mixed cases. Variants of double combinations (95.5 % of cases from all mixed infections) were as follows: B. burgdorferi s. l. + A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi s.l. + E. chaffeensis / E. muris, B. burgdorferi s.l. + TBEV, B. burgdorferi s.l. + R. heilongjiangensis, B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi. The most frequent combination was B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi (37.8% of all mixed infections). In triple infection of B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + TBEV and B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + B. miyamotoi, the frequency of occurrence for each combination was 2.2%. Given the above, a complex laboratory diagnosis of tick-borne infections in individuals who have been bitten by a tick is necessary, including the detection of all pathogens common in focal areas."

		"abstract": "Babesiosis is a blood-borne disease found mainly in the United States caused by a parasitic piroplasm. While most infections are mild to moderate in immunocompetent hosts, life-threatening complications can occur in those with significant comorbidities like congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is sparse literature discussing the complications of Babesia microti infection or the pathophysiology and management thereof. A literature review was conducted to consolidate the current knowledge about the disease, pathophysiology, and proposed management of all potential complications based on risk factors and other clinical information. A MeSH cross-references strategy was employed in PubMed using the search terms \"babesia\" and \"babesiosis\" and the established associated conditions, and the search expanded to increase capture. Only papers written in the English language and discussing human subjects in the North American patient population were included. The initial search yielded 315 papers and, after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a final number of 18 was reviewed. The various complications and pathophysiology thereof are then discussed according to organ system. Babesia is a subversive parasite associated with a variety of conditions. We hope a better appreciation of all potential presentations and complications will help clinicians manage this increasingly common zoonosis and reduce adverse effects. More research is recommended into the pathophysiology and prevention of complications following this and other tick-borne illnesses."

To improve our understanding of the general U.S. population's experiences with tick exposure and use of personal prevention methods, we used data from ConsumerStyles, a web-based, nationally representative questionnaire on health-related topics. Questions addressed tick bites and LD diagnosis in the last year, use of personal prevention methods to prevent tick bites, and willingness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine. Of 10,551 participants surveyed over three years, 12.3 % reported a tick bite for themselves or a household member in the last year, including 15.4 % of participants in high LD incidence (LDI) states, 16.3 % in states neighboring high LDI states, and 9.4 % in low LDI states. Participants in high LDI states and neighboring states were most likely to use personal prevention methods, though 46.6 % of participants in high LDI states and 53.9 % in neighboring states reported not using any method. Participants in low LDI states, adults ≥ 75 years of age, those with higher incomes, and those living in urban housing tended to be less likely to practice personal prevention methods. Likeliness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine was high in high LDI (64.5 %), neighboring (52.5 %), and low LDI (49.7 %) states. Targeted educational efforts are needed to ensure those in high LDI and neighboring states, particularly older adults, are aware of their risk of LD and recommended personal prevention methods."

Nearly all of the patients (98%) had no prior B. miyamotoi testing, indicating that clinicians rarely test for this emerging tick-borne pathogen. Compared to patients who solely tested positive for Lyme disease antibodies, patients with B. miyamotoi antibodies presented with significantly more sleepiness and pain. A prospective study is needed to ascertain the relationship between the presence of B. miyamotoi antibodies and persistent symptoms."

		"abstract": "In Europe, ticks are responsible for the transmission of several pathogens of medical importance, including bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) complex, the agents of Lyme borreliosis. In France, the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region is considered a hot spot for human tick-borne pathogen infections, with an estimated annual rate of 156 cases of Lyme borreliosis per 100,000 inhabitants. Although several studies have assessed the abundance of ticks in rural areas, little consideration has been given thus far to urban green spaces in France. This study aimed to estimate tick abundance in three parks, two urban (U1, U2) and one peri-urban (PU), in and around the city of Lyon (France). A forest in a rural area was used as a control (C). Tick sampling campaigns were performed in each site in April, May, June, July, and October 2019 using the dragging method. One hundred transects of 10 m2 each were randomly chosen in each park in places frequented by humans. The sampling sessions were carried out under semi-controlled abiotic conditions. Ticks were stored in 70% ethanol and identified to species and developmental stage under a light microscope using morphological keys. A total of seven ticks (nymphs and adults) were collected in the two urban parks (six in U1 and one in U2), while 499 ticks were sampled in the peri-urban park. Of the 506 ticks collected, 504 were identified as Ixodes ricinus, one as Dermacentor marginatus, and one as Ixodes frontalis. In the peri-urban park, ticks were mainly collected under the forest cover and at forest edges. Tick density under forest cover was 7.1 times higher in the control site than in the peri-urban park throughout the survey period. This study confirmed the presence of ticks in all of the parks surveyed, although their occurrence in the urban parks was very rare compared to the peri-urban park and the control site. These results should serve as a basis for the implementation of preventive measures."

We utilized mass spectrometry enhanced by affinity hydrogel particles (analytical sensitivity = 2.5 pg/mL) to study tick pathogen-specific proteins shed in the urine of patients with (1) erythema migrans rash and acute symptoms, (2) post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), and (3) clinical suspicion of tick-borne illnesses (TBI). Targeted pathogens were Borrelia, Babesia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, Francisella, Powassan virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Colorado tick fever virus. Specificity was defined by 100% amino acid sequence identity with tick-borne pathogen proteins, evolutionary taxonomic verification for related pathogens, and no identity with human or other organisms. Using a cut off of two pathogen peptides, 9/10 acute Lyme Borreliosis patients resulted positive, while we identified zero false positive in 250 controls. Two or more pathogen peptides were identified in 40% of samples from PTLDS and TBI patients (categories 2 and 3 above, n = 59/148). Collectively, 279 distinct unique tick-borne pathogen derived peptides were identified. The number of pathogen specific peptides was directly correlated with presence or absence of symptoms reported by patients (ordinal regression pseudo-R2 = 0.392, p = 0.010). Enhanced mass spectrometry is a new tool for studying tick-borne pathogen infections."

We analyzed retrospective surveillance data for Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus/rickettsial diseases, and tularemia diagnosed in Indiana from 2009 to 2016. We used chi-square cross tabulation to test gender, age group, and county classification (rural, rural-mixed, urban) differences in tickborne disease. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc Conover test to identify differences in summated tickborne disease by county classification. Finally, we used retrospective space-time permutation models in SaTScan to test the hypothesis of complete spatiotemporal randomness of tickborne disease. We found more Lyme disease diagnoses among Indiana residents 44 years of age or younger compared with those over 44 years. Conversely, more ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia were reported in Indiana residents aged over 44 years of age. An analysis of summated tickborne disease by county showed significantly higher diagnosis reported in urban counties, compared with rural and rural-mixed counties. Finally, 2 significant clusters of summated tickborne disease were observed in south-central Indiana in 2014 and in western Indiana from 2010 to 2011. The detection of tickborne disease clusters, coupled with the finding that significant differences exist in the diagnosis of tickborne diseases between urban, rural, and rural-mixed counties in Indiana, suggests a need for continued surveillance of the counties observed within these clusters."

		"abstract": "Arthropods pests are most frequently associated with both plants and vertebrate animals. Ticks, in particular the blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis Say and Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), are associated with wildlife hosts and are the primary vectors of Lyme disease, the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Immature blacklegged ticks in the eastern United States frequently use small mammals from the genus Peromyscus as hosts. These mice are competent reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, as well as other tick-borne pathogens. To conduct surveillance on immature ticks and pathogen circulation in hosts, capture and handling of these small mammals is required. While protocols for rearing and pest surveillance on plants are common, there are very few protocols aimed at entomologists to conduct research on vertebrate-arthropod relationships. The goal of this manuscript is to provide a practical template for trapping Peromyscus spp. for vector and vector-borne pathogen surveillance and ecology for professionals that may not have a background in wildlife research. Important considerations are highlighted when targeting P. leucopus Rafinesque and P. maniculatus Wagner. Specifically, for tick and tick-borne disease-related projects, materials that may be required are suggested and references and other resources for researchers beginning a trapping study are provided."

Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement 'I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves 'outdoorsy', results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

		"abstract": "To provide better care for patients suspected of having a tick-transmitted infection, the Clinic for Tick-borne Diseases at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark was established. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate diagnostic outcome and to characterize demographics and clinical presentations of patients referred between the 1st of September 2017 to 31st of August 2019. A diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, symptoms, serology and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The patients were classified as definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis manifestations was initiated in accordance with the national guidelines. Patients not fulfilling the criteria of Lyme borreliosis were further investigated and discussed with an interdisciplinary team consisting of specialists from relevant specialties, according to individual clinical presentation and symptoms. Clinical information and demographics were registered and managed in a database. A total of 215 patients were included in the study period. Median age was 51 years (range 17-83 years), and 56 % were female. Definite Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 45 patients, of which 20 patients had erythema migrans, 14 patients had definite Lyme neuroborreliosis, six had acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, four had multiple erythema migrans and one had Lyme carditis. Furthermore, 12 patients were classified as possible Lyme borreliosis and 12 patients as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. A total of 146 patients (68 %) did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of Lyme borreliosis. Half of these patients (73 patients, 34 %) were diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis including inflammatory diseases, cancer diseases and two patients with a tick-associated disease other than Lyme borreliosis. A total of 73 patients (34 %) were discharged without sign of somatic disease. Lyme borreliosis patients had a shorter duration of symptoms prior to the first hospital encounter compared to patients discharged without a specific diagnosis (p<0.001). When comparing symptoms at presentation, patients discharged without a specific diagnosis suffered more often from general fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, 66 % of all referred patients were given a specific diagnosis after ended outpatient course. A total of 32 % was diagnosed with either definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome; 34 % was diagnosed with a non-tick-associated diagnosis. Our findings underscore the complexity in diagnosing Lyme borreliosis and the importance of ruling out other diseases through careful examination."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that transmit a variety of pathogens to host animals and humans, causing severe infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. In a certain combination of animal and tick species, tick infestation elicits acquired immunity against ticks in the host, which can reduce the ability of ticks to feed on blood and to transmit pathogens in the following tick infestations. Therefore, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of acquired tick resistance (ATR) can advance the development of anti-tick vaccines to prevent tick infestation and tick-borne diseases. Basophils are a minor population of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream and are rarely observed in peripheral tissues under steady-state conditions. Basophils have been reported to accumulate at tick-feeding sites during re-infestation in cattle, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. Selective ablation of basophils resulted in a loss of ATR in guinea pigs and mice, illuminating the essential role of basophils in the manifestation of ATR. In this review, we discuss the recent advance in the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying basophil recruitment to the tick-feeding site and basophil-mediated ATR."

Although Lyme disease accounts for the majority of tick-borne disease cases in the U.S., tularemia cases have been increasing over the past decade, with >220 cases reported yearly. However, when comparing Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) and Francisella tularensis (causative agent of tularemia), the low infectious dose (<10 bacteria), high morbidity and mortality rates, and potential transmission of tularemia by multiple tick vectors have raised national concerns about future tularemia outbreaks. Despite these concerns, little is known about how F. tularensis is acquired by, persists in, or is transmitted by ticks. Moreover, the role of one or more tick vectors in transmitting F. tularensis to humans remains a major question. Finally, virtually no studies have examined how F. tularensis adapts to life in the tick (vs. the mammalian host), how tick endosymbionts affect F. tularensis infections, or whether other factors (e.g., tick immunity) impact the ability of F. tularensis to infect ticks. This review will assess our current understanding of each of these issues and will offer a framework for future studies, which could help us better understand tularemia and other tick-borne diseases."

Between April and October 2017, a total of 504 questing Ixodid ticks (77% Ixodes ricinus and 23% Dermacentor reticulatus) were collected from six regions and city of Minsk, in Belarus. All ticks were analyzed by RT-PCR amplification for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Anaplasma phagocytophillum, Ehrlihia muris, and Borrelia miyamotoi. B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp. were the most commonly detected tick-borne pathogens, with prevalence rates of 31.08% and 33.7%, respectively. A. phagocytophillum was found in 104 (20.63%), and 107 (21.2%) ticks were positive for E. muris. TBEV was detected in 83 (16.47%). Circulation of Borrelia miyamotoi spirochete in I. ricinus ticks in Brest, Gomel, and Minsk region was detected for the first time. Our data provide a basis for further studies to determine the distribution and abundance of different tick species in Belarus and therefore a capacity to predict where cases of important tick-borne diseases may occur."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with hotspots in the Northeast and Midwest. Integrated vector control for mosquito-borne disease prevention is often organized at the community level, but tick control is primarily coordinated at the household and individual level. Management of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say), the vector of the causative agent of Lyme disease in the Midwest and eastern United States in peridomestic environments may be critical as many tick encounters are reported to occur in the yard. Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness of a widely available and low-cost pesticide that targets common lawn pests and is labeled for use against ticks. In June 2019, we evaluated a granular form of gamma-cyhalothrin in a placebo-controlled residential backyard study (n = 90) in two communities in Wisconsin. The product applied by the research team reduced nymphal blacklegged ticks in plots established in the lawn part of the ecotone by 97% one week after application at both communities and by 89-97% three to four weeks postapplication. The proportion of homes with at least one nymphal tick postapplication was significantly lower at acaricide-treated homes and ranged from 4.2 to 29.2% compared with placebo homes where at least one nymphal tick was found at 50-81.5% of homes. These results support the efficacy of a low-cost do-it-yourself strategy for homeowners seeking to reduce blacklegged ticks in the yard."

Borrelia valaisiana, B. yangtzensis, and B. tanukii were found only in the southern regions with B. valaisiana being the most common, whereas B. yangtzensis and B. tanukii were only found on Jeju Island. Our study is the first to describe the nationwide prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in ticks from wild rodents in the ROK. Continuous surveillance in ticks, animals, humans, and different regions is required to avoid disease distribution and possible transmission to humans in the ROK."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, spread by the Ixodes tick, is typically associated with a single \"bull's eye rash\" that emergency physicians are comfortable recognizing and treating during the summer months when this disease is most prevalent. However, Lyme disease can also present in disseminated forms that are more difficult to diagnose. We describe a phenomenon of disseminated Lyme with multiple rash complexes that is unrecognized by clinicians. A 65-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented with flu-like symptoms including headache, nausea, and arthralgias, as well as a nonpruritic rash on her lower limbs. On physical examination, multiple red, blanching patches with a diameter of up to 20 cm were seen. Although she was initially thought to have a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug reaction as her skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi was negative, an immunoglobulin M test for B. burgdorferi was found to be positive during her emergency department visit. Despite the diverging results, a diagnosis of early-disseminated Lyme was made. She was discharged home on a 3-week course of oral doxycycline, and a complete resolution of her symptoms was noted on a follow-up visit. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: With the incidence of Lyme disease and its atypical presentations on the rise, the emergency physician should be aware of the other rashes that are associated with this disease, particularly those associated with disseminated cutaneous Lyme. Early diagnosis of the disseminated forms of Lyme is critical to prevent the occurrence of life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological complications known to occur with this disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi Current diagnosis of early Lyme disease relies heavily on clinical criteria, including the presence of an erythema migrans rash. The sensitivity of current gold-standard diagnostic tests relies upon antibody formation, which is typically delayed and thus of limited utility in early infection. We conducted a study of blood and skin biopsy specimens from 57 patients with a clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans. Samples collected at the time of diagnosis were analyzed using an ultrasensitive, PCR-based assay employing an isothermal amplification step and multiple primers. In 75.4% of patients, we directly detected one or more B. burgdorferi genotypes in the skin. Two-tier testing showed that 20 (46.5%) of those found to be PCR positive remained serologically negative at both acute and convalescent time points. Multiple genotypes were found in three (8%) of those where a specific genotype could be identified. The 13 participants who lacked PCR and serologic evidence for exposure to B. burgdorferi could be differentiated as a group from PCR-positive participants by their levels of several immune markers as well as by clinical descriptors such as the number of acute symptoms and the pattern of their erythema migrans rash. These results suggest that within a Mid-Atlantic cohort, patient subgroups can be identified using PCR-based direct detection approaches. This may be particularly useful in future research such as vaccine trials and public health surveillance of tick-borne disease patterns."

It appears in 3 to 15% of all cases of acute Lyme disease, and includes meningitis, cranial neuritis, and painful radiculoneuritis as the most common manifestations. We report a case of acute neuroborreliosis that manifested as extended isolated cervical myelitis. Not only the manifestation as isolated myelitis in the early stages of borreliosis represents a rarity, but also the strong contrast between mild clinical symptoms and pronounced imaging findings in this case is remarkable."

		"abstract": "People with occupations that require them to spend time working outdoors in suitable tick habitats are predicted to be at an increased risk for tick-borne diseases (TBDs). However, few studies have assessed the risks of outdoor employees in the United States. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect data on exposure to ticks and TBD infections among U.S. Forest Service employees in a high TBD incidence region of northern Wisconsin, and to examine employee knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding TBDs to help guide future education and prevention programs. Chi-square contingency tables, calculations of odds ratios, and logistic regression models were used to identify associations among self-reported employee factors, the proportion of correctly answered knowledge questions, their ranked concern for TBDs, adherence to practicing preventive behaviors, and willingness to pay for protective measures. Ninety-five employees completed the survey. Nearly all respondents (97%) reported recent tick exposure, with 27% reporting encountering 10 or more ticks per week during peak tick season. Employee knowledge of TBD was high (median score: 80% correct). Fifty-nine percent of respondents had high concern for TBDs, and there was high adherence to conducting body checks for ticks (83% reported always doing them), but only moderate use of tick repellents (24% reported always and 60% reported occasionally using). High concern for TBD (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.32 [95% confidence intervals, 1.97-20.28]), a history of TBD diagnosis (aOR = 5.88 [1.41-24.55]), and older age (≥ 46 years) (aOR = 3.29 [1.00-10.84]) were positively associated with high practice adherence. Respondents suggested they would be willing to pay for personal protective methods and get a hypothetical vaccine for Lyme disease, but not community-wide efforts to control ticks. Our study provides evidence that U.S. Forest Service employees in Wisconsin represent a high risk group for TBD, and despite relatively high TBD knowledge and engagement in tick protection activities, efforts are needed to reduce their risks for tick bites. More generally, our findings suggest that studies to better understand the factors related to the adoption and effectiveness of public health interventions are needed."

The genomes of relapsing fever borreliae and Lyme disease borreliae consist of multiple linear and circular plasmids in addition to the chromosome. Previous work with B. burgdorferi sensu lato found diminished infectivity upon continuous in vitro culture passage that was attributable to plasmid loss. The effect of long-term culture passage on B. miyamotoi is not known. We generated a series of plasmid-specific primer sets and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect the 14 known plasmids of B. miyamotoi North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. We assessed the plasmid content of B. miyamotoi LB-2001 over 64 culture passages spanning 15 months and determined that strain LB-2001 retained all plasmids upon prolonged in vitro cultivation and remained infectious in mice. We also found that strain LB-2001 lacks plasmid lp20-1 which is present in strain CT13-2396. These results suggest that B. miyamotoi remains genetically stable when cultured and passaged in vitro."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus is the vector of various pathogens, including Chlamydiales bacteria, which potentially cause respiratory infections. In this study, we modeled the spatial distribution of I. ricinus and associated Chlamydiales over Switzerland from 2009 to 2019. We used a total of 2,293 ticks and 186 Chlamydiales occurrences provided by a Swiss Army field campaign, a collaborative smartphone application, and a prospective campaign. For each tick location, we retrieved from Swiss federal data sets the environmental factors reflecting the topography, climate, and land cover. We then used the Maxent modeling technique to estimate the suitability of particular areas for I. ricinus and to subsequently build the nested niche of Chlamydiales bacteria. Results indicate that I. ricinus habitat suitability is determined by higher temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, lower temperature during the driest months, and a higher percentage of artificial and forest areas. The performance of the model was improved when extracting the environmental variables for a 100-m radius buffer around the sampling points and when considering the climatic conditions of the 2 years previous to the sampling date. Chlamydiales bacteria were favored by a lower percentage of artificial surfaces, drier conditions, high precipitation during the coldest months, and short distances to wetlands. From 2009 to 2018, we observed an extension of areas suitable to ticks and Chlamydiales, associated with a shift toward higher altitude. The importance of considering spatiotemporal variations in the environmental conditions for obtaining better prediction was also demonstrated.IMPORTANCEIxodes ricinus is the vector of pathogens including the agent of Lyme disease, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, and the less well-known Chlamydiales bacteria, which are responsible for certain respiratory infections. In this study, we identified the environmental factors influencing the presence of I. ricinus and Chlamydiales in Switzerland and generated maps of their distribution from 2009 to 2018. We found an important expansion of suitable areas for both the tick and the bacteria during the last decade. Results also provided the environmental factors that determine the presence of Chlamydiales within ticks. Distribution maps as generated here are expected to bring valuable information for decision makers in controlling tick-borne diseases in Switzerland and establishing prevention campaigns. The methodological framework presented could be used to predict the distribution and spread of other host-pathogen pairs to identify environmental factors driving their distribution and to develop control or prevention strategies accordingly."

		"abstract": "Borreliosis is the most frequently transmitted tick-borne disease in Europe. It is difficult to estimate the incidence of tick bites and associated diseases in the German population due to the lack of an obligation to register across all 16 federal states of Germany. The aim of this study is to show that Google data can be used to generate general trends of infectious diseases on the basis of borreliosis and tick bites. In addition, the possibility of using Google AdWord data to estimate incidences of infectious diseases, where there is inconsistency in the obligation to notify authorities, is investigated with the perspective to facilitate public health studies. Google AdWords Keyword Planner was used to identify search terms related to ticks and borreliosis in Germany from January 2015 to December 2018. The search volume data from the identified search terms was assessed using Excel version 15.23. In addition, SPSS version 24.0 was used to calculate the correlation between search volumes, registered cases, and temperature. A total of 1999 tick-related and 542 borreliosis-related search terms were identified, with a total of 209,679,640 Google searches in all 16 German federal states in the period under review. The analysis showed a high correlation between temperature and borreliosis (r=0.88), and temperature and tick bite (r=0.83), and a very high correlation between borreliosis and tick bite (r=0.94). Furthermore, a high to very high correlation between Google searches and registered cases in each federal state was observed (Brandenburg r=0.80, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania r= 0.77, Saxony r= 0.74, and Saxony-Anhalt r=0.90; all P<.001). Our study provides insight into annual trends concerning interest in ticks and borreliosis that are relevant to the German population exemplary in the data of a large internet search engine. Public health studies collecting incidence data may benefit from the results indicating a significant correlation between internet search data and incidences of infectious diseases."

However, data on ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine are scarce. The objective of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in engorged and questing ixodid ticks collected from five administrative regions (oblasts) of Ukraine, namely Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Ternopil, and Vinnytsia. The ticks were collected from both wild and domestic animals and from vegetation. Of 524 ixodid ticks collected, 3, 99, and 422 ticks were identified as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes ricinus, and Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. DNA samples individually extracted from 168 questing and 354 engorged adult ticks were subjected to pathogen-specific PCR analyses. The mean prevalence in I. ricinus and D. reticulatus were, respectively: 10 % (10/97) and 3 % (12/422) for A. phagocytophilum; 69 % (67/97) and 52 % (220/422) for members of the Anaplasmataceae family; 25 % (24/97) and 28 % (117/422) for Rickettsia spp.; 3 % (3/97) and 1 % (6/422) for Babesia spp.; and 9 % (9/97) and 5 % (20/422) for Bartonella spp. Overall, between the five cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of any of the pathogens for the respective ticks (p > 0.05). The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in the questing and engorged I. ricinus varied from 0 to 27 % and 14-44%, respectively, with no statistical significance identified between the five cities (p > 0.05). In addition to reporting the updated data for Kyiv and Ternopil, this study is the first to provide the prevalences of the tick-borne pathogens for Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Vinnytsia. This investigation is also the first to detect Neoehrlichia mikurensis in ixodid ticks from Ukraine. These new data will be useful for medical and veterinary practitioners as well as public health officials when diagnosing infections and when implementing measures to combat tick-borne diseases in Ukraine."

This study aimed to assess the incidence, clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of serologically confirmed paediatric LD in the Republic of Ireland over a 5-year period. A retrospective review of records from accredited laboratories performing Borrelia burgdorferi serological testing was undertaken. Proformas were distributed to clinicians of children and adolescents with positive Lyme serology. Data were requested regarding clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. Updated NICE guidelines were used to classify clinical cases. Serology testing for B. burgdorferi was performed on 2908 samples. Sixty-three (2.2%) children were two-tier positive, generating a crude annual incidence rate of 1.15/100,000. Proformas were returned for 55 (87%) and 47 met clinical and laboratory criteria for LD. Twenty-seven (57%) presented with non-focal symptoms (erythema migrans and/or influenza-like symptoms), and 20 (43%) with focal symptoms (cranial nerve involvement, 11; CNS involvement, 8; arthritis, 1). Median age at presentation was 8.2 (2.5-17.9) years. Seventeen (36%) acquired LD overseas. Twenty-five (83%) of the remaining 30 children acquired infection in the West/Northwest of Ireland. Full resolution of symptoms was reported in 97% of those with available data. Serologically confirmed LD in children is relatively rare in the Republic of Ireland. Ninety-eight percent of children tested were seronegative. Of the seropositive cases, 40% could have been diagnosed based on clinical findings alone. Neurological presentations (40%) were common. Full resolution of symptoms occurred in almost all (97%) where data were available."

		"abstract": "Most vector-borne pathogens cause zoonotic diseases. These zoonoses often have wild animal reservoirs that play a significant role in disease epidemiology. However, pet animals have also been implicated in transmission of zoonotic agents to humans. To exemplify, dogs are competent reservoir hosts for several zoonotic vector-borne bacteria and protozoa. Despite that vector-borne diseases can be life-threatening for both pets and humans, studies on pathogen seroprevalence are very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the serological prevalence of six zoonotic vector-borne agents in dogs from the South Central region of Texas (US). Electronic medical records of dogs, presenting over 2014-2019 for elective ovariohysterectomy or castration at a high volume spay and neuter clinic, were reviewed for serological testing. Sera from 418 dogs were tested for the Dirofilaria immitis antigen, and antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Ehrlichia ewingi, using a commonly available commercial test kit. Descriptive statistics were computed to characterize the respective seroprevalence rates of the dog population. The study involved 192 (46%) male and 226 (54%) female dogs. Overall, 85 (20%) dogs tested positive for at least one of the 6 pathogens investigated. The highest seroprevalence rate averaged over the 6-year period was 11.7% for D. immitis followed by 8.4% for E. canis and/or E. ewingii, 4.3% for A. phagocytophilum and/or A. platys, and 0.2% for B. burgdorferi. The co-exposure or co-infection was only detected in 3.8% of the dog population. Together, opportunistic testing of dogs presenting for elective surgical procedures may provide an effective way of assessing seroprevalence and/or risk factors for common vector-borne diseases within a geographic region of concern."

		"abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding treatment of Lyme disease patients who do not respond fully to initial short-term antibiotic therapy. Choosing the best treatment approach and duration remains challenging because treatment response among these patients varies: some patients improve with treatment while others do not. A previous study examined treatment response variation in a sample of over 3500 patients enrolled in the MyLymeData patient registry developed by LymeDisease.org (San Ramon, CA, USA). That study used a validated Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale to identify three treatment response subgroups among Lyme disease patients who remained ill: nonresponders, low responders, and high responders. The present study first characterizes the health status, symptom severity, and percentage of treatment response across these three patient subgroups together with a fourth subgroup, patients who identify as well. We then employed machine learning techniques across these subgroups to determine features most closely associated with improved patient outcomes, and we used traditional statistical techniques to examine how these features relate to treatment response of the four groups. High treatment response was most closely associated with (1) the use of antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and alternative treatments, (2) longer duration of treatment, and (3) oversight by a clinician whose practice focused on the treatment of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an acellular membrane that covers the gut epithelium in arthropods and physically separates it from the lumen. The structure is thought to play an important role in tick biology. The PM is also known to impact the persistence of tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi, although limited information is available about its molecular constituents or their biological significance. Herein, we characterise a novel PM-associated gut protein in Ixodes scapularis ticks, annotated as Peritrophic Membrane Chitin Binding Protein (PM_CBP), for its role in the integrity and function of the matrix. The PM_CBP displays homology to the chitin deacetylase metalloenzyme, shows upregulation during tick feeding, and is localized at the luminal surface of the gut epithelium. The structural integrity of the PM was impaired both by the knock down of PM_CBP expression via RNA interference and by treatment with anti-PM_CBP antibodies, as revealed by its electron microscopic appearance. Additionally, the duration of tick engorgement on mice and the passage of experimentally-inoculated fluorescent dextran molecules across the PM are affected by the knock down of PM_CBP expression. The transfer of anti-PM_CBP antibodies into the tick gut impacted the overall composition of the resident microbiome, and also influenced B. burgdorferi acquisition in ticks and its transmission to mice. Taken together, these data highlight the biological significance of the Ixodes PM and suggest that the targeting of its molecular constituents may contribute to the development of novel interventions against tick-borne infections."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 300,000 infections annually. Antibiotic intervention cures Lyme disease in the majority of cases; however, 10 to 20% of patients develop posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), a debilitating condition characterized by chronic fatigue, pain, and cognitive difficulties. The underlying mechanism responsible for PTLDS symptoms, as well as a reliable diagnostic tool, has remained elusive. We reasoned that the gut microbiome may play an important role in PTLDS given that the symptoms overlap considerably with conditions in which a dysbiotic microbiome has been observed, including mood, cognition, and autoimmune disorders. Analysis of sequencing data from a rigorously curated cohort of patients with PTLDS revealed a gut microbiome signature distinct from that of healthy control subjects, as well as from that of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Notably, microbiome sequencing data alone were indicative of PTLDS, which presents a potential, novel diagnostic tool for PTLDS.IMPORTANCE Most patients with acute Lyme disease are cured with antibiotic intervention, but 10 to 20% endure debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, neurological complications, and myalgias after treatment, a condition known as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The etiology of PTLDS is not understood, and objective diagnostic tools are lacking. PTLDS symptoms overlap several diseases in which patients exhibit alterations in their microbiome. We found that patients with PTLDS have a distinct microbiome signature, allowing for an accurate classification of over 80% of analyzed cases. The signature is characterized by an increase in Blautia, a decrease in Bacteroides, and other changes. Importantly, this signature supports the validity of PTLDS and is the first potential biological diagnostic tool for the disease."

		"abstract": "It is often suggested that due to climate and environmental policy changes, the risk from tick-borne disease is increasing, particularly at the geographical limits of the vector distribution. Our project aimed to determine whether this was true for the risk of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland which is the western-most limit of Ixodes ricinus, the European vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The availability of a historical data set of tick infection rates compiled in the 1990s represented a unique opportunity as it provided a baseline against which current data could be compared. Following construction of a spatial predictive model for the presence and absence of I. ricinus based on data from 491 GPS locations visited between 2016 and 2019, 1404 questing nymphs from 27 sites were screened for the presence of Borrelia spp. using a TaqMan PCR aimed at the 23S rRNA gene sequence. All positive ticks were further analysed by nested PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the 5 S-23 S intergenic spacer. The model indicated that areas with the highest probability of tick presence were mostly located along the western seaboard and the Shannon and Erne river catchments, coinciding with historical high incidence areas of bovine babesiosis, while the infection rate of questing nymphs with B. burgdorferi s.l. and the prevalence of the various genospecies have remained surprisingly stable over the last 3 decades. Clear communication of the potential disease risk arising from a tick bite is essential in order to allay undue concerns over tick-borne diseases among the general public."

		"abstract": "The dynamics of zoonotic vector-borne diseases are determined by a complex set of parameters including human behavior that may vary with socio-ecological contexts. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. The Northeast and upper Midwest are the regions most affected - two areas with differing levels of urbanization and differing sociocultural settings. The probability of being infected with Lyme disease is related to the risk of encounters with Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which reflects both the environmental tick hazard and human behaviors. Herein, we compare behavioral and peridomestic risk factors perceived to influence the risk for human-tick encounters between two high-incidence states in the Northeast (New York and New Jersey) and one high-incidence state in the Midwest (Wisconsin). We used a smartphone application, The Tick App, as a novel survey tool, during spring and summer of 2018. Adaptive human behavior was identified in the relationship between outdoor activities and the use of methods to prevent tick bites. More frequent recreational outdoor activities and gardening (a peridomestic activity) were associated with a 1.4-2.3 times increased likelihood of using personal protective measures to prevent tick bites, when accounting for demographics and previous Lyme diagnosis. Most outdoor activities were more frequently reported by participants from the Midwest (n = 697), representing an older demographic, than the Northeast (n = 396). Participants from the Northeast were less likely to report use of personal protective measures to prevent tick bites, but a larger proportion of participants from the Northeast reported application of environmental pesticides targeting ticks or mosquitoes or other insects on their property (34 % of 279 versus 22 % of 616 participants) and interventions to reduce the presence of peridomestic deer compared to participants from the Midwest (e.g. 20 % of 278 versus 7% of 615 participants reported having a deer proof fence). Participants from the Midwest were more likely to kill rodents on their property (28 % versus 13 %). These differences illustrate the need for further assessment of personal behavior and tick exposure in these two Lyme disease-endemic regions to aid in targeted public health messaging to reduce tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne, multisystemic disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Standard treatments for early Lyme disease include short courses of oral antibiotics but relapses often occur after discontinuation of treatment. Several studies have suggested that ongoing symptoms may be due to a highly antibiotic resistant form of B. burgdorferi called biofilms. Our recent clinical study reported the successful use of an intracellular mycobacterium persister drug used in treating leprosy, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone), in combination therapy for the treatment of Lyme disease. In this in vitro study, we evaluated the effectiveness of dapsone individually and in combination with cefuroxime and/or other antibiotics with intracellular activity including doxycycline, rifampin, and azithromycin against Borrelia biofilm forms utilizing crystal violet biofilm mass, and dimethyl methylene blue glycosaminoglycan assays combined with Live/Dead fluorescent microscopy analyses. Dapsone, alone or in various combinations with doxycycline, rifampin and azithromycin produced a significant reduction in the mass and protective glycosaminoglycan layer and overall viability of B. burgdorferi biofilm forms. This in vitro study strongly suggests that dapsone combination therapy could represent a novel and effective treatment option against the biofilm form of B. burgdorferi."

This article describes GI and hepatic symptoms of several tickborne diseases - Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky mountain spotted fever, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, tickborne relapsing fever, Q fever and babesiosis. GI and hepatic symptoms are quite common in Lyme disease patients. The prognosis is generally favourable with antibiotics treatment, however, serious courses have been described. Lyme disease should be a part of differential diagnosis of liver tests elevation and GI symptoms in patients from endemic regions regardless erythema migrans presence. Ehrlichiosis should be a part of differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness with GI symptoms especially in the presence of leukopenia/thrombocytopenia and/or liver tests elevation. Tularemia should be considered as a rare etiology of cholestatic hepatopathy and a history of a tick bite. In general, the importance of careful patient interviewing, including the history of a tick bite, can be highlighted also as a part of investigation of patients with seemingly unrelated GI and/or hepatic symptoms."

		"abstract": "Most tick-related studies in Europe have been conducted in nonurban areas, but ticks and tick-borne pathogens also occur in urban green spaces. From a public health perspective, risks regarding tick-borne infections should be studied in these urban areas, where contacts between infected ticks and humans may be more frequent than elsewhere, due to high human activity. We examined the risk of encountering an infected tick in urban green spaces in Helsinki, Finland. We collected ticks at nine sites throughout Helsinki, recorded the prevalence of several pathogens and identified areas with a high potential for contacts between infected ticks and humans. Moreover, we explored the relationship between the density of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks and locally diagnosed cases of borreliosis and compared the potential for human-tick encounters in Helsinki to those in nonurban areas in south-western Finland. During 34.8 km of cloth dragging, 2,417 Ixodes ricinus were caught (402 adults, 1,399 nymphs and 616 larvae). From analysed nymphs, we found 11 distinct tick-borne pathogens, with 31.5% of nymphs carrying at least one pathogen. Tick activity was highest in August and September, leading to the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l., and concurrently infection risk, to also be highest during this time. Nymph densities varied between the sampling sites, with obvious implications to spatial variation in infection risk. While ticks and tick-borne pathogens were found in both Helsinki and nonurban areas in south-western Finland, the estimates of human activity were generally higher in urban green spaces, leading to a higher potential for human-tick contacts therein. The presence of ticks and tick-borne pathogens and high local human activity in urban green spaces suggest that they form potential foci regarding the acquisition of tick-borne infections. Risk areas within cities should be identified and knowledge regarding urban ticks increased."

		"abstract": "Studies of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Europe focus on pathogens with principal medical importance (e.g. Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis), but we have limited epidemiological information on the neglected pathogens, such as the members of the genera Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Babesia and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis. Here, we integrated an extensive field sampling, laboratory analysis and GIS models to provide first publicly available information on pathogen diversity, prevalence and infection risk for four overlooked zoonotic TBDs in the Czech Republic. In addition, we assessed the effect of landscape variables on the abundance of questing ticks at different spatial scales and examined whether pathogen prevalence increased with tick density. Our data from 13,340 ticks collected in 142 municipalities showed that A. phagocytophilum (MIR = 3.5%) and Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (MIR = 4.0%) pose geographically uneven risks with localized hotspots, while Rickettsia (MIR = 4.9%) and Babesia (MIR = 1.1%) had relatively homogeneous spatial distribution. Landscape variables had significant effect on tick abundance up to the scale of 1 km around the sampling sites. Questing ticks responded positively to landscape diversity and configuration, especially to forest patch density that strongly correlates with the amount of woodland-grassland ecotones. For all four pathogens, we found higher prevalence in places with higher densities of ticks, confirming the hypothesis that tick abundance amplifies the risk of TB infection. Our findings highlight the importance of landscape parameters for tick vectors, likely due to their effect on small vertebrates as reservoir hosts. Future studies should explicitly investigate the combined effect of landscape parameters and the composition and population dynamics of hosts on the host-vector-pathogen system."

Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (sNPH) based on chronic infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi (Bb) is an even rarer entity, that with the right treatment is potentially curable. A 67-year-old male with a slow onset of progressive balance problems, also presented unspecified dizziness, urge feeling, neck soreness and discrete cognitive complaints. An MRI scan revealed an enlarged ventricular system compatible with NPH. After further liquor dynamic procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed with the surprising results of lymphocytic pleocytosis, and signs of increased antibody production. Microbiology revealed chronic neuroborreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics accordingly. At the one-year follow-up no symptoms remained and the ventricular system almost normalized. We describe the 7th published case of sNPH secondary to chronic Borreliosis in a previous healthy adult. Existing published literature has been reviewed and previous cases showed similarly nearly full clinical recovery. Primary/idiopathic NPH (iNPH) is treated with the surgical intervention of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and can be mistaken for a sNPH. The awareness of rare causes of sNPH like chronic Borreliosis is important as it is easily treated non surgically."

		"abstract": "Ticks are responsible for spreading harmful diseases including Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Understanding tick population dynamics and predicting risk of tick-borne disease insurgence helps to design preventive actions against the disease spread. Using a compartmental model describing the pathogen transmission among ticks and hosts, we study the influence of host-targeted tick control strategies with chemical insecticides on tick population and disease transmission dynamics. Our analysis shows that in areas with rapid-growing population of ticks, host-targeted controls using chemical insecticides may enhance disease persistence and even turn a disease-free area to a disease endemic area. Therefore, the complex dynamics of pathogen spread among ticks and hosts should be carefully examined when designing tick control strategies."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is established in several regions of Ontario, Canada, and continues to spread into new geographic areas across the province at a rapid rate. This poses a significant public health risk since I. scapularis transmits the Lyme disease-causing bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and other pathogens of potential public health concern. The objective of this study was to develop species distribution models for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi to predict and compare the potential distributions of the tick vector and the Lyme disease pathogen as well as the ecological factors most important for species establishment. Ticks were collected via tick dragging at 120 sites across southern, central, and eastern Ontario between 2015 and 2018 and tested for tick-borne pathogens. A maximum entropy (Maxent) approach was used to model the potential distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi. Two independent datasets derived from tick dragging at 25 new sites in 2019 and ticks submitted by the public to local health units between 2015 and 2017 were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the models. The model for I. scapularis showed high suitability for blacklegged ticks in eastern Ontario and some regions along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, and moderate suitability near Algonquin Provincial Park and the Georgian Bay with good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.898; ticks from public: AUC = 0.727). The model for B. burgdorferi showed a similar predicted distribution but was more constrained to eastern Ontario, particularly between Ottawa and Kingston, and along Lake Ontario, with similarly good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.958; ticks from public: AUC = 0.863. The ecological variables most important for predicting the distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi included elevation, distance to deciduous and coniferous forest, proportions of agricultural land, water, and infrastructure, mean summer/spring temperature, and cumulative annual degree days above 0°C. Our study presents a novel application of species distribution modelling for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Ontario, Canada, and provides an up to date projection of their potential distributions for public health knowledge users."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases is dramatically increasing across the United States. While the rapid rise in Lyme disease is clear, the causes of it are not. Modeling Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary Lyme disease vector in the eastern United States, presents an opportunity to disentangle the drivers of increasing Lyme disease, including climate, land cover, and host populations. We improved upon a recently developed compartment model of ordinary differential equations that simulates I. scapularis growth, abundance, and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) by adding land cover effects on host populations, refining the representation of growth stages, and evaluating output against observed data. We then applied this model to analyze the sensitivity of simulated I. scapularis dynamics across temperature and land cover in the northeastern United States. Specifically, we ran an ensemble of 232 simulations with temperature from Hanover, New Hampshire and Storrs, Connecticut, and land cover from Hanover and Cardigan in New Hampshire, and Windsor and Danielson in Connecticut. Consistent with observations, simulations of I. scapularis abundance are sensitive to temperature, with the warmer Storrs climate significantly increasing the number of questing I. scapularis at all growth stages. While there is some variation in modeled populations of I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi among land cover distributions, our analysis of I. scapularis response to land cover is limited by a lack of observations describing host populations, the proportion of hosts competent to serve as B. burgdorferi reservoirs, and I. scapularis abundance."

A high-throughput 16S V1-V2 rRNA gene-based metagenomics assay was developed and evaluated using >13,000 residual samples from patients suspected of having tick-borne illness and >1,000 controls. Taxonomic predictions for tick-borne bacteria were exceptionally accurate, as independently validated by secondary testing. Overall, 881 specimens were positive for bacterial tick-borne agents. Twelve tick-borne bacterial species were detected, including two novel pathogens, representing a 100% increase in the number of tick-borne bacteria identified compared to what was possible by initial PCR testing. In three blood specimens, two tick-borne bacteria were simultaneously detected. Seven bacteria, not known to be tick transmitted, were also confirmed to be unique to samples from persons suspected of having tick-borne illness. These results indicate that 16S V1-V2 metagenomics can greatly simplify diagnosis and accelerate the discovery of bacterial tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Companion animals can become infected with tick-borne diseases (TBDs) becoming a reservoir for human transfer, thereby damaging human health. To evaluate whether companion animals are infested with ticks harboring human TBD pathogens, we detected TBD pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and cats brought to animal hospitals in the Yamagata prefecture of Japan. An investigation of 164 adult ticks collected from 88 dogs and 41 cats between March and July 2018 revealed that this region was dominated by three tick species, Ixodes ovatus (n = 95, 57.9%), Ixodes nipponensis (n = 37, 22.6%) and Haemaphysalis flava (n = 10, 6.1%). To evaluate their pathogenic potential, we went on to test each tick for spotted fever group rickettsiae, Lyme disease borreliae, relapsing fever borreliae, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (formerly SFTS virus). Our results identified two I. ovatus ticks infected with Borrelia miyamotoi, which causes emerging relapsing fever; several I. nipponensis ticks infected with Rickettsia monacensis, which cause rickettsiosis; and several Ixodes persulcatus ticks infected with Rickettsia helvetica, which can also cause rickettsiosis. These results suggest that dogs and cats, and veterinary professionals and pet owners, in the Yamagata prefecture have some risk of exposure to several TBDs. This means that there should be continuous monitoring and reporting of TBDs, even those known to be uncommon in Japan, in both companion animals and humans to ensure the health and safety of both humans and animals in Japan."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases affecting humans and animals are on the rise worldwide. Vaccines constitute an effective control measure, but very few are available. We selected Lyme borreliosis, a bacterial infection transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes, to validate a new concept to identify vaccine candidates. This disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Although attempts to develop a vaccine exist, none have been successfully marketed. In tick-borne diseases, the skin constitutes a very specific environment encountered by the pathogen during its co-inoculation with tick saliva. In a mouse model, we developed a proteomic approach to identify vaccine candidates in skin biopsies. We identified 30 bacterial proteins after syringe inoculation or tick inoculation of bacteria. Discovery proteomics using mass spectrometry might be used in various tick-borne diseases to identify pathogen proteins with early skin expression. It should help to better develop sub-unit vaccines based on a cocktail of several antigens, associated with effective adjuvant and delivery systems of antigens. In all vector-borne diseases, the skin deserves further investigation to better define its role in the elaboration of protective immunity against pathogens."

Major examples include Plasmodium, Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp. manipulating the behavior of mosquitoes, sand flies and kissing bugs, respectively. However, research on how pathogens can modify tick behavior is patchy. This review focuses on current knowledge about the behavioral changes triggered by Anaplasma, Borrelia, Babesia, Bartonella, Rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in tick vectors, analyzing their potential adaptive significance. As a general trend, being infected by Borrelia and TBEV boosts tick mobility (both questing and walking activity). Borrelia and Anaplasma infection magnifies Ixodes desiccation resistance, triggering physiological changes (Borrelia: higher fat reserves; Anaplasma: synthesis of heat shock proteins). Anaplasma infection also improves cold resistance in infected ticks through synthesis of an antifreeze glycoprotein. Being infected by Anaplasma, Borrelia and Babesia leads to increased tick survival. Borrelia, Babesia and Bartonella infection facilitates blood engorgement. In the last section, current challenges for future studies are outlined."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease and anaplasmosis are tick-borne bacterial diseases caused by Borreliella and Anaplasma species, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the exposure of eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) in the northeastern United States to tick-borne pathogens has not been conducted. In this report, we assess the serological status of 128 eastern coyotes harvested in Pennsylvania in 2015 and 2017 for antibodies to Borreliella burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum Immunoblot and dot blot approaches were employed to test each plasma sample by using cell lysates and recombinant proteins as detection antigens. The results demonstrate high seropositivity incidences of 64.8% and 72.7% for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, respectively. Antibodies to both pathogens were detected in 51.5% of the plasma samples, indicating high potential for coinfection. Antibodies to the B. burgdorferi proteins DbpB, VlsE, DbpA, BBA36, and OspF (BBO39) were detected in 67.2, 63.3, 56.2, 51.6, and 48.4% of the plasma samples, respectively. Antibodies to the A. phagocytophilum P44 and P130 proteins were detected in 72.7 and 60.9% of the plasma samples, respectively.IMPORTANCE The incidence of Lyme disease (Borreliella burgdorferi) and anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) are increasing in North America and Europe. The causative agents of these debilitating tick-transmitted infections are maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving Ixodes ticks and diverse mammals and birds. It has been postulated that predators directly or indirectly influence the dynamics of the enzootic cycle and disease incidence. Here, we demonstrate high seropositivity of eastern coyotes for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum As coyotes become established in urban and suburban environments, interactions with humans, companion animals, and urban/suburban wildlife will increase. Knowledge of the pathogens that these highly adaptable predators are exposed to or carry, and their potential to influence or participate in enzootic cycles, is central to efforts to reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases in humans and companion animals."

		"abstract": "An increased risk for glomerulonephritis and a higher prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato have been reported in Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of laboratory abnormalities suggestive of kidney disease in clinically healthy BMDs compared to a control population and to investigate if there is a correlation with the occurrence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, Ehrlichia canis, and Anaplasma (A.) spp. and with the occurrence of Dirofilaria (D.) immitis antigen. A total of 197 BMDs and 57 control dogs were included in the study. Laboratory evidence of kidney disease was defined as renal azotemia and/or proteinuria with a urine protein creatinine ration of more than 0.5 in an inactive urine sediment. A SNAP®4Dx® ELISA (IDEXX, Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA) was used to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, E. canis and Anaplasma spp. and antigen of D. immitis. Laboratory evidence of kidney disease was significantly more common in BMDs than in control dogs (17.8% versus 1.8%) (p = 0.005). The proportion of BMDs with anti-B. burgdorferi sensu latu antibodies and anti-A. phagocytophilum antibodies was significantly higher in BMDs (p <  0.001). However, an association between these findings could not be identified. BMDs are more often affected by kidney disease and have a higher prevalence of antibodies to bacterial pathogens transmitted by Ixodes ticks than control dogs. However, a causal relationship between these two variables could not be established due to a lack of association between these two findings."

		"abstract": "To predict the risk of tick-borne disease, it is critical to understand the ecological factors that determine the abundance of ticks. In Europe, the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) transmits a number of important diseases including Lyme borreliosis. The aim of this long-term study was to determine the abiotic and biotic factors driving the annual abundance of I. ricinus at a location in Switzerland where Lyme borreliosis is endemic. Over a 15-year period (2004 to 2018), we monitored the abundance of I. ricinus ticks on a monthly basis at three different elevations on Chaumont Mountain in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically two years after a masting event. We used AIC-based model selection to determine which ecological variables drive annual variation in tick density. We found that elevation site, year, seed production by beech trees two years prior, and mean annual relative humidity together explained 73.2% of the variation in our annual estimates of nymph density. According to the parameter estimates of our models, (i) the annual density of nymphs almost doubled over the 15-year study period, (ii) changing the beech tree seed production index from very poor mast (1) to full mast (5) increased the abundance of nymphs by 86.2% two years later, and (iii) increasing the field-collected mean annual relative humidity from 50.0 to 75.0% decreased the abundance of nymphs by 46.4% in the same year. Climate variables collected in the field were better predictors of tick abundance than those from nearby weather stations indicating the importance of the microhabitat. From a public health perspective, the increase in nymph abundance is likely to have increased the risk of tick-borne disease in this region of Switzerland. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that seed production by deciduous trees is a critical driver of the abundance of I. ricinus, and hence the risk of tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "Borreliosis (Lyme disease) is a spirochetal disease caused by the species complex of Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks. Recorded to be the most common tick-borne disease in the world, the last two decades have seen an increase in disease incidence and distribution, exceeding 360 000 cases in Europe alone. If untreated, infection may cause skin symptoms, arthritis, and neurological or cardiac complications. Borrelia spirochetes have developed strategies to evade the mammalian host immune system. These include the complement system, which is an important first-line defense mechanism against invading microbes. To evade the complement, spirochetes bind soluble complement regulators factor H (FH), factor H-like protein, and C4bp to their outer surfaces. B. burgdorferi spirochetes can inhibit the classical pathway of complement by the outer surface protein (Osp) BBK32, which blocks the activation of the C1 complex, composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s. The FH-binding proteins of borreliae include Osps OspE, CspA, and CspZ. Following repeated infections, antibodies against these proteins develop and may provide functional immunity against borreliosis. This review discusses critical immune evasion strategies, focusing on complement evasion by borreliae."

		"abstract": "Because ixodid ticks are vectors of zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia, information of their abundance, seasonal variation in questing behaviour and pathogen prevalence is important for human health. As ticks are invading new areas northwards, information from these new areas are needed. Taiga tick (Ixodes persulcatus) populations have been recently found at Bothnian Bay, Finland. We assessed seasonal variation in questing abundance of ticks and their pathogen prevalence in coastal deciduous forests near the city of Oulu (latitudes 64-65°) in 2019. We sampled ticks from May until September by cloth dragging 100 meters once a month at eight study sites. We calculated a density index (individuals/100 m2) to assess seasonal variation. Samples were screened for Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) (including B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) and B. valaisana), Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Francisella tularensis and Bartonella spp., Babesia spp. and for the tick-borne encephalitis virus. All except one nymph were identified as I. persulcatus. The number of questing adults showed a strong peak in May (median: 6.5 adults/100 m2), which is among the highest values reported in northern Europe, and potentially indicates a large population size. After May, the number of questing adults declined steadily with few adults still sampled in August. Nymphs were present from May until September. We found a striking prevalence of Borrelia spp. in adults (62%) and nymphs (40%), with B. garinii (51%) and B. afzelii (63%) being the most common species. In addition, we found that 26% of infected adults were coinfected with at least two Borrelia genospecies, mainly B. garinii and B. afzelii, which are associated with different host species. The coastal forest environments at Bothnian Bay seem to provide favourable environments for I. persulcatus and the spread of Borrelia. High tick abundance, a low diversity of the host community and similar host use among larvae and nymphs likely explain the high Borrelia prevalence and coinfection rate. Research on the infestation of the hosts that quantifies the temporal dynamics of immature life stages would reveal important aspects of pathogen circulation in these tick populations."

However, information on tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in the QTPA and on the molecular characteristics of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in the area is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Rickettsia spp. infecting yaks, Tibetan sheep and camels in this area. A total of 276 animals were screened. Overall, 84.5% (164/194) of yaks, 58% (23/40) of Tibetan sheep, and 38% (16/42) of camels tested positive for at least one pathogen. Theileria spp., Anaplasma ovis and spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. were detected as TBPs in the current study with overall infection rates of 10.9% (30/276), 8.3% (23/276) and 62.9% (171/276), respectively. Further study revealed that 1.5% (3/194) of the yaks were infected with Theileria sp. OT3, 1.5% (3/194) with T. luwenshuni, 6.2% (12/194) with T. uilenbergi, 1.1% (2/194) with T. ovis and 82% (159/194) with SFG Rickettsia spp. It was also shown that 58% (23/40) of the Tibetan sheep were infected with A. ovis and 15% (6/40) with T. ovis. Among the camels, 10% (4/42) were infected with T. equi, while 29% (12/42) were positive for Rickettsia spp. Sequence analysis revealed that the Rickettsia spp. infecting yaks and camels were Rickettsia raoultii and Rickettsia slovaca. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and characterization of these pathogens in yaks, Tibetan sheep and camels in the country, except for T. luwenshuni infections in yaks."

B. miyamotoi is transmitted by the same tick vector (Ixodes spp.) as B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), the causative agent of Lyme disease, therefore laboratory assays to differentiate BMD from Lyme disease are needed to avoid misdiagnoses and for disease confirmation. We previously performed a global immunoproteomic analysis of the murine host antibody response against B. miyamotoi infection to discover antigens that could serologically distinguish the two infections. An initial assessment identified a putative lipoprotein antigen, here termed BmaA, as a promising candidate to augment current research-based serological assays. In this study, we show that BmaA is an outer surface-associated protein by its susceptibility to protease digestion. Synthesis of BmaA in culture was independent of temperature at either 23 °C or 34 °C. The BmaA gene is present in two identical loci harbored on separate plasmids in North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. bmaA-like sequences are present in other B. miyamotoi strains and relapsing fever borrelia as multicopy genes and as paralogous or orthologous gene families. IgM and IgG antibodies in pooled serum from BMD patients reacted with native BmaA fractionated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. IgG against recombinant BmaA was detected in 4 of 5 BMD patient serum samples as compared with 1 of 23 serum samples collected from patients with various stages of Lyme disease. Human anti-B. turicatae serum did not seroreact with recombinant BmaA suggesting a role as a species-specific diagnostic antigen. These results demonstrated that BmaA elicits a human host antibody response during B. miyamotoi infection but not in a tested group of B. burgdorferi-infected Lyme disease patients, thereby providing a potentially useful addition for developing BMD serodiagnostic tests."

		"abstract": "Metagenomic studies have revealed the presence of a filarial nematode in Ixodes scapularis. The phylogeny of this agent, and its potential for human infection, are unknown. We used existing metagenomic data from I. scapularis to determine the phylogeny of this tick-associated nematode and employed quantitative PCR to determine if the presence of this agent had an effect on the burden of Borrelia burgdorferi. We also developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System assay using the Av33 antigen as a target to investigate the presence of antibodies against this nematode in 128 serum specimens from patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis. To demonstrate assay utility, we used 15 sera from patients with onchocerciasis as controls. We show that this agent is a new species in the genus Monanema and its presence in vector ticks does not impact the burden of B. burgdorferi. We did not detect IgG antibodies to this agent in 127 of 128 sera from patients with Lyme disease or babesiosis. One sample had reactivity above the threshold, but at the low-level equivalent to the least reactive onchocerciasis sera. This low positive signal could be a result of cross-reacting antibodies, antibodies from a previous infection with a filarial nematode, or, less likely, a exposure to the Ixodes scapularis-associated nematode. We found no evidence that this nematode contributes to the spectrum of human tick-borne infections."

		"abstract": "Schoolyards and suburban parks are two environments where active tick surveillance may inform local management approaches. Even in a state such as New York with a robust active tick surveillance programme operated by the state Department of Health, these settings are not routinely covered. The goal of this study was to highlight the importance of active surveillance for tick-borne pathogens by describing their prevalence in ticks collected from schoolyards and suburban parks and to guide the use of integrated pest management in these settings. Tick dragging was performed in three regions of New York State: Long Island, the Lower Hudson Valley and the Capital Region. A total of 19 schoolyards and 32 parks were sampled. The location, habitat and weather at the time of tick collection were recorded. Ticks were speciated and tested for the presence of 17 pathogens with a novel application of nanoscale real-time PCR. The causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Powassan virus disease were all detected from Ixodes scapularis in various sites throughout the capital region and south-eastern counties of New York state. The most common agent detected was Borrelia burgdorferi, and coinfection rates were as high as 36%. This surveillance study also captured the first of the invasive Asian longhorned tick species, Haemaphysalis longicornis, in New York state (collected 2 June 2017). Results from this study highlight the importance of collaborative efforts and data sharing for improvement of surveillance for tick-borne disease agents."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a well-recognized public health problem in the USA, however, other tick-borne diseases also have major public health impacts. Yet, limited research has evaluated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases within endemic regions. Using laboratory data from a large healthcare system in north-central Wisconsin from 2000-2016, we applied a Kulldorf's scan statistic to analyze spatial, temporal and seasonal clusters of laboratory-positive cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis at the county level. Older males were identified as the subpopulation at greatest risk for non-Lyme tick-borne diseases and we observed a statistically significant spatial and temporal clustering of cases (p < 0.05). HGA risk shifted from west to east over time (2000-2016) with a relative risk (RR) ranging from 3.30 to 11.85, whereas babesiosis risk shifted from south to north and west over time (2004-2016) with an RR ranging from 4.33 to 4.81. Our study highlights the occurrence of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases, and identifies at-risk subpopulations and shifting spatial and temporal heterogeneities in disease risk. Our findings can be used by healthcare providers and public health practitioners to increase public awareness and improve case detection."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are of substantial concern worldwide in both humans and animals. Several hard tick species are of medical and veterinary interest in Europe, and changes in the range of tick species can affect the spread of zoonotic pathogens. The aim of the present study was to map the current prevalence and distribution pattern of ticks and related tick-borne pathogens in Latvia, a Baltic state in northern Europe. Nearly 4600 Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus and Dermacentor reticulatus tick samples were collected in all regions of Latvia during 2017-2019 and were screened by molecular methods to reveal the prevalence and distribution pattern of a wide spectrum of tick-borne pathogens. New localities of D. reticulatus occurrence were found in western and central Latvia, including the Riga region, indicating that the northern border of D. reticulatus in Europe has moved farther to the north. Among the analyzed ticks, 33.42% carried at least one tick-borne pathogen, and 5.55% of tick samples were positive for two or three pathogens. A higher overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens was observed in I. ricinus (34.92%) and I. persulcatus (31.65%) than in D. reticulatus (24.2%). The molecular analysis revealed the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus, Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. Overall, 15 and 7 tick-borne pathogen species were detected in Ixodes spp. and D. reticulatus ticks, respectively. This is the first report of Borrelia miyamotoi in Latvian field-collected ticks. This large-scale countrywide study provides a snapshot of the current distribution patterns of Ixodes and Dermacentor ticks in Latvia and gives us a reliable overview of tick-borne pathogens in Latvian field-collected ticks."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is one of the most prevalent tick-borne emerging infections in North America, Europe, and far Eastern Asia including Korea and Japan. This study was undertaken with the aim of a comparative and quantitative analysis of the epidemiological aspects of LD infections in Korea and Japan from 2011 to 2016. The raw data analyzed in this study were obtained from the websites of the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Korea, and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan. In total 65 cases of LD were observed with a cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of 0.22 per million population in Korea from 2011 to 2016. During the same period in Japan, there were 75 cases of LD with a CIR of 0.10 [significantly higher than that in Korea (p <0.01)]. Further, the results showed that in Korea, LD incidence was slightly higher in women than in men; but in Japan, the case was reverse, with incidence much higher in men than women. The proportion of cases differed significantly by age-specific adjusted groups within both countries (p <0.01). In both the countries, the incidence of LD was highest among those aged ≤20 yr (93.8% cases in Korea, and 94.7% cases in Japan). Cases peaked in autumn (46.7% of total cases) in Korea and in summer (60.0%) in Japan (p <0.01). The counties in rural areas had a significantly higher proportion of cases than the capital cities in both the countries (p <0.01). The study indicates that LD in Korea and Japan is an emerging zoonosis, and pose a serious risk to public health. The results underscore the continued emergency of LD and provide a basis for targeting prevention campaigns to a population with increasing incidence. Proper information, education and communication (IEC) activities can be helpful in reducing the spread of infection."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia genus contains two major clades, the Lyme borreliosis group, which includes the causative agents of Lyme disease/borreliosis (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and other related B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies), and the relapsing fever borreliosis group (B. hermsii, B. turicatae, and B. parkeri). Other unclassified reptile- and echidna-associated Borrelia spp. (i.e., B. turcica and 'Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi', respectively) do not belong in either of these two groups. In North America, Borrelia spp. from both of the major clades are important pathogens of veterinary and public health concern. Lyme disease is of particular interest because the incidence in the northeastern United States continues to increase in both dogs and humans. Birds have a potentially important role in the ecology of Borrelia species because they are hosts for numerous tick vectors and competent hosts for various Borrelia spp. Our goal was to investigate the prevalence of Borrelia spp. in four free-living species of upland game birds in Pennsylvania, USA including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), and American woodcock (Scolopax minor). We tested 205 tissue samples (bone marrow and/or spleen samples) from 169 individuals for Borrelia using a flagellin gene (flab) nested PCR, which amplifies all Borrelia species. We detected Borrelia DNA in 12% (24/205) of samples, the highest prevalence was in wild turkeys (16%; 5/31), followed by ruffed grouse (13%; 16/126) and American woodcock (3%; 1/35). All pheasants (n = 13) were negative. We sequenced amplicons from all positive game birds and all were B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Our results support previous work indicating that certain species of upland game birds are commonly infected with Borrelia species, but unlike previous studies, we did not find any relapsing fever borreliae."

		"abstract": "Population-level surveys for Dirofilaria immitis in wild canids typically rely on identification of the parasite at necropsy. More recently, some studies have employed the use of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test. However, since the assay was designed for use with domestic dogs it needs to be validated for use with wild canids for accurate interpretation of results. We therefore evaluated the performance of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test for detection of D. immitis in wild canids in southern Ontario. Overall, 199 wild canid carcasses were collected from across the region and assessed for the presence of D. immitis parasites at necropsy; ten were infected. Lung tissue extract (LE) and thoracic fluid filter paper extract (TFE) prepared from each wild canid were tested via the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test, which simultaneously tests for the presence of D. immitis antigen and antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., and Ehrlichia spp. The prevalence adjusted bias adjusted kappa (PABAK) and Gwet's first-order-agreement coefficient (AC1) were used to assess the level of agreement between sample pairs. The PABAK and AC1 between LF and TFE applied to the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test and the necropsy-confirmed D. immitis status indicated a very high level of agreement for all sample pairs. Compared to necropsy-confirmed D. immitis status, the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test for D. immitis antigen in LE was 80 % (95 % CI 44.4-97.5%) and 98.9 % (95 % CI 96.2-99.9%), respectively. For the TFE, the sensitivity was 70 % (95 % CI 34.8-93.3%) and the specificity was 97.9 % (95 % CI 94.7-99.4%). With respect to the tick-borne pathogen components, 1.5 % (3/199; 95 % CI 0.3-4.5%) of wild canids tested positive for B. burgdorferi antibody; 1.0 % (2/199; 95 % CI 0-3.8%) of LE samples were positive and 0.5 % (1/199; 95 % CI 0-3.1%) of TFE samples were positive. No samples tested positive for antibody to Anaplasma spp. (95 % CI 0-2.3%) or Ehrlichia spp. (95 % CI 0-2.3%). Collectively, the results suggest that the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test may be a suitable test for use with LE and TFE for the detection of D. immitis antigen in wild canids from southern Ontario."

This case demonstrates a 20-year-old male patient presenting with complaints of annular skin rash, malaise, fever, and lightheadedness after significant outdoor exposure. Physical exam revealed multiple large targetoid lesions on the back and extremities. The rash had raised borders and centralized clearing consistent with erythema migrans chronicum. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone due to clinical suspicion for Lyme carditis. ELISA and Western blot tests were reactive for Lyme IgM and IgG, confirming the diagnosis. The AV block resolved by hospital day four and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Early identification of disease allowed for effective treatment with no adverse outcomes or sequelae."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The current therapeutic approach to this disease is limited to antibiotics. However, after their administration, about 20% of patients experience delayed onset of this illness manifesting as lingering persistent symptoms. To determine a suitable approach that would help reduce this number, we examined the efficacy of a composition of polyphenolic compounds (baicalein, luteolin, and rosmarinic acid) with fatty acids (monolaurin and cis-2-decenoic acid), and iodine/kelp in a Lyme disease animal model and volunteers. The results showed that 4 weeks of dietary intake of this composition reduced the spirochete burden in animal tissues by about 75%. Basic and differential blood parameters did not show significant differences between control animals and the animals fed with this composition. Also, hepatic and renal toxicity markers were not changed and apoptosis was not observed. Relevant inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were elevated in infected animals but normalized in infected and treated animals. A small observational study revealed that after administration of this composition to 17 volunteers three times per day for 6 months, 67.4% of the volunteers with late or persistent LD, and not receptive to previous antibiotic application, responded positively, in terms of energy status as well as physical and psychological wellbeing to supplementation with this composition, while 17.7% had slight improvement, and 17.7% were none responsive. We concluded that this specific composition revealed feasible benefits in late or persistent LD management, although double-blind controlled clinical trials are warranted."

This tick-borne zoonosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and, worldwide, presents with at least 20 different types of rashes. Certain cutaneous rashes are inherently interconnected to various stages of Lyme disease. In this study, five Canadian Lyme disease patients from a multi-age range presented various phases of the acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) rash. In each case of ACA, the underlying etiological pathogen was the Lyme disease spirochete. Although ACA rashes are normally found on the lower extremities, this study illustrates that ACA rashes are not directly correlated with a tick bite, geographic area, age, Bbsl genospecies, exercise, or any given surface area of the body. Case 4 provides confirmation for an ACA rash and gestational Lyme disease. One patient (Case 5) puts forth a Bbsl and Bartonella sp. co-infection with a complex ACA rash. This study documents ACA rashes on Lyme disease patients for the first time in Canada."

Tick-borne pathogens include viruses (e.g. tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan); bacteria, such as the causative agents of Lyme disease, spotted fever rickettsiosis and human anaplasmosis; and malaria-like protozoan parasites causing babesiosis. Tick-borne diseases are emerging due to the geographical expansion of their tick vectors, especially in the northern hemisphere. Two examples of this phenomenon are Ixodes scapularis and Amblyomma americanum, which have expanded their ranges in the USA in recent decades and are responsible for the continuous emergence of Lyme disease and human ehrlichiosis, respectively. This phenomenon is also occurring worldwide and is reflected by the increasing number of tick-borne encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever cases in Europe and Asia. In this review, we provide a concise synopsis of the most medically important tick-borne pathogen worldwide, with a particular emphasis on emerging public health threats."

The geographic expansion of B. miyamotoi in the US also extends to other Lyme endemic areas such as the Midwestern US. Co-infections with other tick borne diseases (TBD) may contribute to the severity of the disease. On Long Island, NY, 3-5% of ticks are infected by B. miyamotoi, but little is known about the frequency of B. miyamotoi infections in humans in this particular region. The aim of this study was to perform a chart review in all patients diagnosed with B. miyamotoi infection in Stony Brook Medicine (SBM) system to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of B. miyamotoi infection in Suffolk County, NY. In a 5 year time period (2013-2017), a total of 28 cases were positive for either IgG EIA (n = 19) or PCR (n = 9). All 9 PCR-positive cases (median age: 67; range: 22-90 years) had clinical findings suggestive of acute or relapsing infection. All these patients were thought to have a TBD, prompting the healthcare provider to order the TBD panel which includes a B. miyamotoi PCR test. In conclusion, B. miyamotoi infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis for flu-like syndromes during the summer after a deer tick bite and to prevent labeling a case with Lyme disease."

In this case, we report a 30-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with one week of diffuse, increasing weakness in the upper/lower extremities and face after a recent gastrointestinal illness and travel to the Northeastern United States. Areflexia was noted in bilateral lower extremities. Lumbar puncture results together with clinical presentation were consistent with a diagnosis of GBS. Lab results later revealed a possible Lyme infection in cerebrospinal fluid, which along with recent travel to endemic area gave high suspicion for Lyme disease. The patient was treated for both diseases with significant improvement. Taking a good history is an essential first step in diagnosis, as travel history was key in testing for Lyme."

		"abstract": "An estimated 300,000 cases of Lyme disease occur in the United States annually. Disseminated Lyme disease may result in carditis, arthritis, facial palsy or meningitis, sometimes requiring hospitalization. We describe the epidemiology and cost of Lyme disease-related hospitalizations. We analysed 2005-2014 data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Databases to identify inpatient records associated with Lyme disease based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We estimated the annual number and median cost of Lyme disease-related hospitalizations in the United States in persons under 65 years of age. Costs were adjusted to reflect 2016 dollars. Of 20,983,165 admission records contained in the inpatient databases during the study period, 2,823 (0.01%) met inclusion criteria for Lyme disease-related hospitalizations. Over half of the identified records contained an ICD-9-CM code for meningitis (n = 614), carditis (n = 429), facial palsy (n = 400) or arthritis (n = 377). Nearly 60% of hospitalized patients were male. The median cost per Lyme disease-related hospitalization was $11,688 (range: $140-$323,613). The manifestation with the highest median cost per stay was carditis ($17,461), followed by meningitis ($15,177), arthritis ($13,012) and facial palsy ($10,491). Median cost was highest among the 15- to 19-year-old age group ($12,991). Admissions occurring in January had the highest median cost ($13,777) for all study years. Based on extrapolation to the U.S. population, we estimate that 2,196 Lyme disease-related hospitalizations in persons under 65 years of age occur annually with an estimated annual cost of $25,826,237. Lyme disease is usually treated in an outpatient setting; however, some patients with Lyme disease require hospitalization, underscoring the need for effective prevention methods to mitigate these serious cases. Information from this analysis can aid economic evaluations of interventions that prevent infection and advances in disease detection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne human disease in Europe, and Borrelia garinii, which is associated with avian reservoirs, is one of the most genetically diverse and widespread human pathogenic genospecies from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex. The clinical manifestations of LD are known to vary between regions and depend on the genetic strain even within Borrelia genospecies. It is thus of importance to explore the genetic diversity of such pathogenic borreliae for the wide range of host and ecological contexts. In this study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to investigate the local population structure of B. garinii in Ixodes ricinus ticks. The study took place in a natural wetland in Slovakia, temporally encompassing spring and autumn bird migration periods as well as the breeding period of resident birds. In total, we examined 369 and 255 ticks collected from 78 birds and local vegetation, respectively. B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 43.4% (160/369) of ticks recovered from birds and in 26.3% (67/255) of questing ticks, respectively. Considering the ticks from bird hosts, the highest prevalence was found for single infections with B. garinii (22.5%). Infection intensity of B. garinii in bird-feeding ticks was significantly higher than that in questing ticks. We identified ten B. garinii sequence types (STs) occurring exclusively in bird-feeding ticks, two STs occurring exclusively in questing ticks, and one ST (ST 244) occurring in both ticks from birds and questing ticks. Four B. garinii STs were detected for the first time herein. With the exception of ST 93, we detected different STs in spring and summer for bird-feeding ticks. Our results are consistent with previous studies of the low geographic structuring of B. garinii genotypes. However, our study reveals some consistency in local ST occurrence and a geographic signal for one of the clonal complexes."

		"abstract": "In Europe, ticks are major vectors of both human and livestock pathogens (e.g. Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis, bovine babesiosis). Agricultural landscapes, where animal breeding is a major activity, constitute a mosaic of habitat types of various quality for tick survival and are used at different frequencies by wild and domestic hosts across seasons. This habitat heterogeneity, in time and space, conditions the dynamics of these host-vector-pathogen systems and thus drives acarological risk (defined as the density of infected ticks). The principal objective of the OSCAR project (2011-2016) was to examine the links between this heterogeneity and acarological risk for humans and their domestic animals. Here, we present the data associated with this project. This paper reports a database on the distribution and densities of I. ricinus ticks - the most common tick species in French agricultural landscapes - and the prevalence of three tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.) in two sites in north-western (\"Zone Atelier Armorique\": ZA site) and south-western (\"Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne\": VG site) France. The distribution and density of ticks along a gradient of wooded habitats, as well as biotic variables, such as the presence and abundance of their principal domestic (livestock) and wild hosts (small mammals), were measured from forest cores and edges to more or less isolated hedges, all bordering meadows. Ticks, small mammals and information on local environmental conditions were collected along 90 transects in each of the two sites in spring and autumn 2012 and 2013 and in spring 2014, corresponding to the main periods of tick activity. Local environmental conditions were recorded along each tick and small mammal transect: habitat type, vegetation type and characteristics, slope and traces of livestock presence. Samples consisted of questing ticks collected on the vegetation (mainly I. ricinus nymphs), biopsies of captured small mammals and ticks fixed on small mammals. In the VG site, livestock occurrence and abundance were recorded each week along each tick transect.A total of 29004 questing ticks and 1230 small mammals were captured during the study across the two sites and over the five field campaigns. All questing nymphs (N = 12287) and questing adults (N = 646) were identified to species. Ticks from small mammals (N = 1359) were also identified to life stage. Questing nymphs (N = 4518 I. ricinus) and trapped small mammals (N = 908) were analysed for three pathogenic agents: A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.In the VG site, the average prevalence in I. ricinus nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp. were, respectively 1.9% [95% CI: 1.2-2.5], 2.5% [95% CI: 1.8-3.2] and 2.7% [95% CI: 2.0-3.4]. In small mammals, no A. phagocytophilum was detected, but the prevalence for Borrelia spp. was 4.2% [95% CI: 0.9-7.5]. On this site, there was no screening of small mammals for Babesia spp. In ZA site, the average prevalence in nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia were, respectively 2.2% [95% CI: 1.6-2.7], 3.0% [95% CI: 2.3-3.6] and 3.1% [95% CI: 2.5-3.8]. In small mammals, the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and Borrelia spp. were, respectively 6.9% [95% CI: 4.9-8.9] and 4.1% [95% CI: 2.7-5.9]. A single animal was found positive for Babesia microti at this site amongst the 597 tested."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an emerging infection in Canada caused by the bacterium belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, which is transmitted via the bite of an infected blacklegged tick. Populations of blacklegged ticks continue to expand and are now established in different regions in Canada. It usually takes more than 24 hours of tick attachment to transfer B. burgdorferi to a human. The diagnosis of early localized Lyme disease is made by clinical assessment, as laboratory tests are not reliable at this stage. Most patients with early localized Lyme disease will present with a skin lesion (i.e., erythema migrans) expanding from the tick bite site and/or non-specific \"influenza-like\" symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, myalgia, and fever). Signs and symptoms may occur from between 3 and 30 days following the tick bite. The care of pregnant patients with a tick bite or suspected Lyme disease should be managed similarly to non-pregnant adults, including the consideration of antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment. The primary objective of this committee opinion is to inform practitioners about Lyme disease and provide an approach to managing the care of pregnant women who may have been infected via a blacklegged tick bite. Health care providers who care for pregnant women or women of reproductive age. Women of reproductive age. In November 2018, Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for 2 main categories: (1) Lyme disease and (2) other tick-borne diseases. Because the main focus was Lyme disease, and considering the limited number of the articles, no further filters were applied for publication time or type of study. For other tick-borne diseases, the results were restricted to a publication date within the last 10 years (2008-2018). The search terms were developed using MeSH terms and keywords including Lyme Disease, Pregnancy, Pregnant Women, Pregnancy Complications, Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Babesiosis, Tularemia, Powassan Virus, Encephalitis Viruses, Tick-Borne, Tick-Borne Diseases, Colorado Tick Fever, Q Fever, Relapsing Fever, and Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness. All articles on Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases with a target population of pregnant women were included; other groups and populations were excluded. The content and recommendations of this committee opinion were drafted and agreed upon by the authors. The Board of Directors of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada approved the final draft for publication."

		"abstract": "Both incidence and geographical range of tick-borne disease has increased across the USA. Similar to people, dogs are hosts for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs also share our homes and beds, making them both a sentinel for the ticks in our backyards but also increasing our exposure to ticks. Measures to better track, prevent, and/or treat tick-borne diseases in companion animals can lead to better control and prevention of human tick-borne disease. This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA. Human patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely (P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk (P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely (P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely (P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp. Tick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well."

Caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), this disease can be debilitating if not treated promptly. Because diagnosis is challenging, prevention remains a priority; however, a previously licensed vaccine is no longer available to the public. Here, we designed a six component vaccine that elicits antibody (Ab) responses against all Borrelia strains that commonly cause Lyme disease in humans. The outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia was fused to a bacterial ferritin to generate self-assembling nanoparticles. OspA-ferritin nanoparticles elicited durable high titer Ab responses to the seven major serotypes in mice and non-human primates at titers higher than a previously licensed vaccine. This response was durable in rhesus macaques for more than 6 months. Vaccination with adjuvanted OspA-ferritin nanoparticles stimulated protective immunity from both B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii infection in a tick-fed murine challenge model. This multivalent Lyme vaccine offers the potential to limit the spread of Lyme disease."

The most well-known is alcohol dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for detoxifying the organism after alcohol ingestion. Other targets and modes of action of disulfiram, that may present problematic side effects, are less commonly mentioned. The French Federation against Tick Borne Diseases (French acronym, FFMVT), which associates three main Lyme patient organizations, MDs and PhDs, has recently been alerted to severe and persistent toxic events in a patient suffering from a late disseminated form of Lyme Disease following disulfiram intake. FFMVT reacted by launching a national call to examine whether other patients in France following a similar treatment could be identified, and what benefits, or side effects could be reported. The statements of 16 patients taking disulfiram have been collected and are presented here. Thirteen out of 16 patients reported toxic events, and seven out of 16 reported benefits for at least part of their symptoms. Based on the collected observations, it seems too early to promote disulfiram as a promising new treatment until the reasons underlying the reported toxicities have been explored, and the results of a well-conducted double blind clinical trial published. The importance of taking into account patient-reported outcomes in Lyme Disease is underlined by the present study."

		"abstract": "Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States. Development of tick control tools have focused primarily on the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Application of acaricides or entomopathogenic fungal agents to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks on rodents can suppress I. scapularis abundance in residential landscapes, but evidence is lacking for impact on human tick bites or tick-borne disease. Similar studies remain limited for the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Other knowledge gaps include how well homeowners and pest control companies perform in the broadcast application of tick-killing products, relative to high efficacy reported in research studies, and the tick-killing potential of natural product formulations exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration. Area-wide control based on preventing ticks from feeding on their main reproductive host, the white-tailed deer, can suppress populations of both I. scapularis and A. americanum. Some studies also suggest an impact on Lyme disease cases, but this needs to be further validated in larger-scale intervention studies. The effectiveness, scale, cost, and implementation of various tick management strategies are important considerations in efforts to reduce human tick encounters and tick-borne disease. Additional barriers include weak incentives for industry and academia to develop, test, and register new tick and pathogen control technologies, including vaccines targeting humans, tick reproductive hosts, or wildlife pathogen reservoirs. Solutions will need to be 'two-pronged': improving the tick and pathogen control toolbox and strengthening the public health workforce engaging in tick control at local and state levels."

		"abstract": "For the development of sustainable control of tick-borne diseases, insight is needed in biological factors that affect tick populations. Here, the ecological interactions among Ixodiphagus hookeri, Ixodes ricinus, and two vertebrate species groups were investigated in relation to their effects on tick-borne disease risk. In 1129 questing ticks, I. hookeri DNA was detected more often in I. ricinus nymphs (4.4%) than in larvae (0.5%) and not in adults. Therefore, we determined the infestation rate of I. hookeri in nymphs from 19 forest sites, where vertebrate, tick, and tick-borne pathogen communities had been previously quantified. We found higher than expected co-occurrence rates of I. hookeri with deer-associated Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and lower than expected rates with rodent-associated Borrelia afzelii and Neoehrlichia mikurensis. The prevalence of I. hookeri in nymphs varied between 0% and 16% and was positively correlated with the encounter probability of ungulates and the densities of all life stages of I. ricinus. Lastly, we investigated the emergence of I. hookeri from artificially fed, field-collected nymphs. Adult wasps emerged from seven of the 172 fed nymphs. From these observations, we inferred that I. hookeri is parasitizing I. ricinus larvae that are feeding on deer, rather than on rodents or in the vegetation. Since I. hookeri populations depend on deer abundance, the main propagation host of I. ricinus, these wasps have no apparent effect on tick populations. The presence of I. hookeri may directly interfere with the transmission cycle of A. phagocytophilum, but not with that of B. afzelii or N. mikurensis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is one of the major tick-borne diseases in Europe. Events of the translocation of Borrelia across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) involve multiple interactions between borrelial surface proteins and receptors on the brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In this study, we aimed to identify proteins of Borrelia that plausibly interact with hBMECs. The surface proteome of live Borrelia (a neuroinvasive strain of B. garinii) was crosslinked with biotin prior to its incubation with hBMECs. The interacting proteins were recovered by affinity purification, followed by SWATH-MS. Twenty-four interacting candidates were grouped into outer membrane proteins (n = 12) and inner membrane proteins (n = 12) based on the subcellular location as per the predictions of LocateP. Other algorithms like TMHMM 2.0 and LipoP, ontology search and literature review were subsequently applied to each of the identified protein candidates to shortlist the most probable interactors. Six proteins namely, LysM domain protein, BESBP-5, Antigen S1, CRASP-1 (Bg071), Erp23 protein and Mlp family Lipoprotein were selected to produce their recombinant forms and experimentally validate their interaction with hBMECs. All the recombinant proteins interacted with hBMECs, in ELISA and immunocytochemistry. We present here a high-throughput approach of generating a dataset of plausible borrelial ligands followed by a systematic bioinformatic pipeline to categorize the proteins for experimental validation."

		"abstract": "Tickborne diseases that affect patients in the United States include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, and tickborne relapsing fever. Tickborne diseases are increasing in incidence and should be suspected in patients presenting with flulike symptoms during the spring and summer months. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and death. Location of exposure, identification of the specific tick vector, and evaluation of rash, if present, help identify the specific disease. Lyme disease presents with an erythema migrans rash in 70% to 80% of patients, and treatment may be initiated based on this finding alone. RMSF presents with a macular rash starting on the wrists, forearms, and ankles that becomes petechial. RMSF has a higher rate of mortality than other tickborne diseases; therefore, empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended for all patients, including pregnant women and children, when high clinical suspicion is present. Testing patient-retrieved ticks for infections is not recommended. Counseling patients on the use of protective clothing and tick repellents during outdoor activities can help minimize the risk of infection. Prophylactic treatment after tick exposure in patients without symptoms is generally not recommended but may be considered within 72 hours of tick removal in specific patients at high risk of Lyme disease."

To provide an overview of the array of pathogenic microorganisms carried by I scapularis ticks in the Upper Midwest. A literature review was conducted to collect and analyze current information about I scapularis lifestyle, transmission, microorganisms carried by the arthropod vector, and the diseases that occur as a result of infections with these microorganisms in the Upper Midwest. Diagnosis of co-infection from tick-borne zoonosis in humans has increased over the last 2 decades. Since I scapularis can transmit multiple pathogens, it is clinically important because different diagnostic testing and treatment strategies may need to be implemented for a patient with I scapularis-borne infection(s). This review has concentrated on I scapularis-transmitted diseases affecting the Upper Midwest and has explored the ecology of the I scapularis vector and its role in pathogen transmission."

They are enhanced by burning of fossil fuels and the emission of huge amounts of CO2 gas which resulted in greenhouse effect. It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2-5 °C in the next decades. As a result, the earth will exhibit marked climatic changes characterized by extremer weather events in the coming decades, such as the increase in temperature, rainfall, summertime, droughts, more frequent and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes. Epidemiological disease cycle includes host, pathogen and in certain cases intermediate host/vector. A complex mixture of various environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity) determines the suitable habitat/ecological niche for every vector host. The availability of suitable vectors is a precondition for the emergence of vector-borne pathogens. Climate changes and global warming will have catastrophic effects on human, animal and environmental ecosystems. Pathogens, especially neglected tropical disease agents, are expected to emerge and re-emerge in several countries including Europe and North America. The lives of millions of people especially in developing countries will be at risk in direct and indirect ways. In the present review, the role of climate changes in the spread of infectious agents and their vectors is discussed. Examples of the major emerging viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases are also summarized."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne disease surveillance in North America has long focused on Lyme disease, though there is currently a significant shift towards comprehensive pathogen surveillance in ticks. Central California has often been overlooked in regular tick-borne pathogen surveillance despite the presence of numerous medically important tick species. The bacterial genus Rickettsia contains tick-borne species that are known pathogens, such as those in the spotted fever group; nonpathogenic endosymbionts; and many species with unknown pathogenic potential. Five common tick species (Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls [Acari: Ixodidae], Dermacentor occidentalis Marx [Acari: Ixodidae], D. variabilis Say, Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille [Acari: Ixodidae], and Ornithodoros parkeri Cooley [Acari: Argasidae]) of California were collected by both traditional and modern techniques, and subsequently screened for Rickettsia spp. Many individuals from all five tick species were PCR positive for Rickettsia spp., and a combination of species-specific primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, and DNA sequencing was used to further characterize the species composition in these ticks. Probable Rickettsia philipii (Rickettsia 364D) was detected in one (1.56%) D. occidentalis collected in Fresno County; R. rhipicephali was detected in 23.4% of D. occidentalis from Fresno Co.; R. bellii was detected in 88.2% of D. variabilis, 7.8% of D. occidentalis, and in one R. rhipicephalus (1.1%) from Fresno Co.; R. monacensis str. Humboldt was detected in three (100%) of I. pacificus collected in both Fresno and Madera Co.; and an uncharacterized Rickettsia was detected in (26.4%) of O. parkeri collected in both Fresno and Madera Co. The findings in this study highlight the need for ongoing surveillance in this region of California."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). After an initial tick bite, it spreads from the deposition site in the dermis to distant tissues of the host. It is generally believed that this spirochete disseminates via the hematogenous route. Borrelia persica causes relapsing fever and is able to replicate in the blood stream. Currently the exact dissemination pathway of LB pathogens in the host is not known and controversially discussed. In this study, we established a strict intravenous infection murine model using host-adapted spirochetes. Survival capacity and infectivity of host-adapted B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) were compared to those of B. persica (Bp) after either intradermal (ID) injection into the dorsal skin of immunocompetent mice or strict intravenous (IV) inoculation via the jugular vein. By in vitro culture and PCR, viable spirochetes and their DNA load in peripheral blood were periodically monitored during a 49/50-day course post-injection, as well as in various tissue samples collected at day 49/50. Specific antibodies in individual plasma/serum samples were detected with serological methods. Regardless of ID or IV injection, DNA of Bp was present in blood samples up to day 24 post-challenge, while no Bbss was detectable in the blood circulation during the complete observation period. In contrast to the brain tropism of Bp, Bbss spirochetes were found in ear, skin, joint, bladder, and heart tissue samples of only ID-inoculated mice. All tested tissues collected from IV-challenged mice were negative for traces of Bbss. ELISA testing of serum samples showed that Bp induced gradually increasing antibody levels after ID or IV inoculation, while Bbss did so only after ID injection but not after IV inoculation. This study allows us to draw the following conclusions: (i) Bp survives in the blood and disseminates to the host's brain via the hematogenous route; and (ii) Bbss, in contrast, is cleared rapidly from the blood stream and is a tissue-bound spirochete."

Human disease caused by B. miyamotoi was first described in Russia and later in the USA and Japan. Additionally, five cases of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients and one case in an apparently immunocompetent patient were described. We investigated the presence of B. miyamotoi in I. ricinus nymphs and in patients suspected of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, in Alsace (France), an endemic area for I. ricinus ticks and Lyme borreliosis, using direct (PCR) and indirect diagnosis (glycerophosphoryldiester-phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) serology). Borrelia miyamotoi was found in 2.2% of 4354 ticks collected between 2013 and 2016. None of the 575 blood samples, collected from the patients suspected of HGA, was found positive for B. miyamotoi by PCR. Acute and late sera from 138 of these 575 patients were available. These paired sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against the B. miyamotoi GlpQ antigen. A total of 14 out of 138 patients had at least one positive parameter (i.e. anti-GlpQ IgG and/or IgM). One patient seroconverted for IgG, and three had isolated IgM in the acute serum. These three patients were treated with doxycycline which could have prevented seroconversion. After reviewing clinical data and other biological tests performed, co-exposure among different microorganisms vectored by ticks or serological cross-reactivity could not be ruled out in these different cases. One patient had persistent IgG, which strongly suggests previous exposure to B. miyamotoi. Humans can be exposed to B. miyamotoi through tick bites in Alsace. We present serological data for possible B. miyamotoi exposure or infection of patients with fever after tick bite. Future studies should determine the incidence, clinical course and burden of this emerging tick-borne disease in other parts of Western Europe."

Clinical manifestations vary greatly, with localized skin findings functioning as early signs of the disease, followed by disseminated disease. The rarest dermatologic presentation of Lyme is a borrelial lymphocytoma, occurring distinctly in Europe and caused typically by Borrelia afzelii. We report a case of a Caucasian 5-year-old European-American boy with slowly progressing, painless edema and erythema of his right pinna. Travel history revealed significant exposure to ticks during a recent trip to Eastern Europe. Laboratory testing for Borrelia burgdorferi demonstrated mixed positivity. He was treated with a 21-day course of amoxicillin, with complete resolution of symptoms and no sign of secondary Lyme disease. Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease in North America, although not uncommon in Europe. Diagnosis is made by the presence of a painless erythematous swelling typically found on the ear lobe, nipples, or testes. Laboratory tests are available but with low sensitivity, therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a clinical diagnosis to be made. Treatment for isolated borrelial lymphocytoma is doxycycline 4 mg/kg up to 100 mg twice daily, whereas for children less than 8 years of age amoxicillin 50 mg/kg divided three times daily, for 3-4 weeks, is preferred."

Objectives: We estimated the prevalence of questing blacklegged ticks vectoring three zoonotic pathogens in Vilas County, Wisconsin. Materials and Methods: We collected 461 adult blacklegged ticks and used PCR to screen for the presence of pathogens that cause Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and babesiosis (Babesia microti). Results: We found that 52.5% of ticks carried at least one pathogen. The estimated infection prevalence in the tick population was 17.4% (Lyme disease), 14.3% (HGA), and 6.5% (babesiosis). Multiple pathogens were present in 14.3% of ticks surveyed. Conclusion: About half of questing ticks tested in this study carried at least one zoonotic pathogen. Coinfection was common in our study area and, if not properly recognized, leads to greater risk of underdiagnosis."

Long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing has demonstrated high initial protection against bites from blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), in laboratory settings, and sustained protection against bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in field tests. However, long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has not been field tested among outdoor workers who are frequently exposed to blacklegged ticks. We conducted a 2-yr randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial among 82 outdoor workers in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Participants in the treatment arm wore factory-impregnated permethrin clothing, and the control group wore sham-treated clothing. Outdoor working hours, tick encounters, and bites were recorded weekly to assess protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin-impregnated garments. Factory-impregnated clothing significantly reduced tick bites by 65% in the first study year and by 50% in the second year for a 2-yr protective effect of 58%. No significant difference in other tick bite prevention method utilization occurred between treatment and control groups, and no treatment-related adverse outcomes were reported. Factory permethrin impregnation of clothing is safe and effective for the prevention of tick bites among outdoor workers whose primary exposure is to blacklegged ticks in the northeastern United States."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus constitutes the main European vector tick for the Lyme borreliosis pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), the relapsing fever borrelia Borrelia miyamotoi, as well as Anaplasma phagocytophilum and several Rickettsia species. Under laboratory conditions, a transovarial transmission to the next tick generation is described for Rickettsia spp. and Borrelia spp., especially regarding B. miyamotoi, whereas the efficiency of transovarial transfer under field conditions is largely unstudied. In order to better estimate the potential infection risk by tick larvae for humans and animals, 1500 I. ricinus larvae from 50 collected \"nests\" (larvae adhering to the flag in a clumped manner) were individually examined for Borrelia, Rickettsia and A. phagocytophilum DNA using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Thirty-nine of 50 nests each (78.0%, 95% CI: 64.0-88.5%) were positive for Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp. DNA, and in three nests (6.0%, 95% CI: 1.3-16.5%) A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected. Overall, DNA from at least one pathogen could be detected in 90.0% (45/50, 95% CI: 78.2-96.7%) of the nests. Of the 1500 larvae, 137 were positive for Borrelia spp. DNA (9.1%, 95% CI: 7.7-10.7%), 341 for Rickettsia spp. DNA (22.7%, 95% CI: 20.6-24.9%) and three for A. phagocytophilum DNA (0.2%, 95% CI: 0-0.6%). Quantity of Borrelia spp. and Anaplasma spp. DNA in positive larvae was low, with 2.7 × 100Borrelia 5S-23S gene copies and 2.4 × 101A. phagocytophilum msp2/p44 gene copies detected on average, while Rickettsia-positive samples contained on average 5.4 × 102gltA gene copies. Coinfections were found in 66.0% (33/50, 95% CI: 51.2-78.8%) of the nests and 8.6% (38/443, 95% CI: 6.1-11.6%) of positive larvae. In fact, larvae had a significantly higher probability of being infected with Borrelia spp. or Rickettsia spp. when both pathogens were present in the nest. This study provides evidence for transovarial transmission of Rickettsia spp. and Borrelia spp. in I. ricinus under field conditions, possibly facilitating pathogen persistence in the ecosystem and reducing the dependence on the presence of suitable reservoir hosts. Further studies are needed to prove transovarial transmission and to explain the surprisingly high proportion of nests containing Rickettsia and/or Borrelia DNA-positive larvae compared to infection rates in adult ticks commonly reported in other studies."

The potential of this invasive tick vector to transmit pathogens will be determined through its association to hosts, such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), which is the primary reservoir for the causative agent of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) and other zoonotic pathogens. Larval H. longicornis were placed on P. leucopus; 65% of the larvae (n = 40) moved off the host within a short period of time, and none engorged. By contrast, larval blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) did not move from where they were placed in the ear of the mouse. A laboratory behavioural assay was then conducted to assess the interaction of H. longicornis with the hair of potential mammalian host species in the U.S.A. H. longicornis larvae were significantly less likely to enter the hair zone of P. leucopus and humans compared to the hair of domestic cats, domestic dogs and white-tailed deer. This study identifies a tick-host interaction behaviour, which can be quantified in a laboratory assay to predict tick-host associations and provides insights into how ticks select a host."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are an important cause of human morbidity and mortality in the United States. The past several decades have witnessed an increase in both the number of recognized tick-borne pathogens and the number of tick-borne disease cases, whereas tick surveys have revealed substantial geographic expansions of tick populations throughout the country. Multiple laboratory testing options exist for diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, including serology, microscopy, and molecular-based methods. The preferred approach varies by the specific disease, locally available test options, and the stage of illness at patient presentation. Accurate and timely detection of tick-borne illness is of utmost importance, as prompt treatment is strongly linked to better outcomes. This review covers the clinical manifestations and preferred diagnostic approaches for important bacterial, viral, and parasitic tick-borne diseases in the United States, including Lyme disease, tick-borne relapsing fever, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever rickettsioses, and babesiosis. Infection with emerging pathogens such as Borrelia miyamotoi, Powassan virus, Heartland virus, Colorado tick fever virus, and Bourbon virus are also covered. Our understanding of tick-borne diseases in the United States continues to improve with the detection of novel pathogens and development of new diagnostic modalities. While conventional diagnostic methods, including serology and microscopy, will play an ongoing role in the diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, implementation of advanced molecular diagnostics will further broaden our understanding of these diseases by facilitating detection of emerging pathogens and providing more accurate and timely diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne infection in many regions of Eurasia. Antibody detection is the most frequently used laboratory test, favoring a two-step serodiagnostic algorithm; immunoenzymatic detection of antibodies to C6 has been shown to perform similarly to a standard two-step workflow. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of the C6 Lyme ELISA kit compared to a standard two-step algorithm in three laboratories located in the northeastern region of Italy which cater to areas with different LD epidemiology. A total of 804 samples were tested, of which 695 gave concordant results between C6 testing and routine workflow (564 negative, 131 positive). Wherever available, clinical presentation and additional laboratory tests were analyzed to solve discrepancies. The C6 based method showed a good concordance with the standard two-step algorithm (Cohen's κ = 0.619), however, the distribution of discrepancies seems to point towards a slightly lower specificity of C6 testing, which is supported by literature and could impact on patient management. The C6 ELISA, therefore, is not an ideal stand-alone test; however, if integrated into a two-step algorithm, it might play a part in achieving a sensitive, specific laboratory diagnosis of LD."

Pregnant women represent the single largest vulnerable group in populations due to a relative immune deficiency status. Infections in pregnant women have the added gravity of potential infection in the developing fetus which may have catastrophic consequences including death in-utero or lifelong debilitation. Currently there is a paucity of data surrounding tick-borne infections in pregnancy and long-term outcomes for mother and infant for conditions like Lyme disease and co-infections. At present there are no established international surveillance systems to identify and gain understanding of these infections in pregnancy. Furthermore, the removal of Congenital Lyme Disease from ICD-11 codes hampers dialogue and characterization of borreliosis in pregnancy and stifles future developments of this understudied domain. This review makes the case for further study and re-opening a dialogue of tick-borne infections in pregnancy."

However, this approach suffers from a lack of sensitivity in early Lyme disease. Ongoing efforts to develop more sensitive antibody detection technologies and other diagnostic approaches are dependent upon the availability of quality-assured biospecimens linked to reliable clinical data. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Horn et al. (E. J. Horn, G. Dempsey, A. M. Schotthoefer, U. L. Prisco, et al., J Clin Microbiol 58:e00032-20, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00032-20) described the development of the Lyme Disease Biobank. Clinically categorized case patients with early Lyme disease and healthy controls were identified (without laboratory diagnostic testing) from three sites where Lyme disease is endemic. Subjects provided whole blood and urine, which were processed and stored at a central biorepository. Whole blood, serum, and urine aliquots were prepared and are available to investigators developing laboratory diagnostics for Lyme disease. After obtaining samples, extensive laboratory testing was performed, including serologic and nucleic acid amplification testing for B. burgdorferi and other tick-borne pathogens. Direct detection methods yielded few positive results. Relative to the findings for another commonly used biorepository cohort, the results of this testing demonstrated a low seropositive rate, as determined by standard two-tiered testing. Additionally, relatively few subjects demonstrated seroconversion with testing of convalescent-phase samples. This clinical and serologically defined cohort of samples from Lyme disease and control cases from areas of Lyme disease endemicity offers an additional valuable resource for novel test development that includes alternate specimen types."

Lyme disease has a wide variety of clinical manifestations, as a result of which physicians of diverse disciplines are coming into contact with such patients. A 58-year-old man was seen at the emergency room with a symptomatic Wenckebach-type second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and periods of 2:1 AV block. Four weeks previously the patient had noticed a red skin lesion on his left lower leg. Under the working diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme disease with cardiac involvement, treatment with ceftriaxone was started. This diagnosis was supported by a positive Borrelia PCR and culture of a skin biopsy and positive Borreliaserology. The AV conduction disorders resolved completely after 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics and it was not necessary to implant a pacemaker. A Borrelia infection is a reversible but rare cause of AV conduction disorders. In the event of sudden onset of symptoms or a severe or progressive AV conduction disorder, Lyme carditis should be considered, especially if the medical history or physical examination provides clues for Lyme disease."

The current model of individual responsibility for tick control evolved from a scenario in the 1990s focusing strongly on exposure to blacklegged ticks and Lyme disease spirochetes in peridomestic settings of the northeastern United States. Today, the threat posed by human-biting ticks is more widespread across the eastern United States, increasingly complex (multiple tick species and >10 notable tickborne pathogens), and, across tick species, more spatially diffuse (including backyards, neighborhood green spaces, and public recreation areas). To mitigate tick-associated negative societal effects, we must consider shifting the responsibility for tick control to include both individual persons and professionally staffed tick-management programs."

		"abstract": "A bioinformatics approach was employed to identify transcriptome alterations in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of well-characterized human subjects who were diagnosed with early disseminated Lyme disease (LD) based on stringent microbiological and clinical criteria. Transcriptomes were assessed at the time of presentation and also at approximately 1 month (early convalescence) and 6 months (late convalescence) after initiation of an appropriate antibiotic regimen. Comparative transcriptomics identified 335 transcripts, representing 233 unique genes, with significant alterations of at least 2-fold expression in acute- or convalescent-phase blood samples from LD subjects relative to healthy donors. Acute-phase blood samples from LD subjects had the largest number of differentially expressed transcripts (187 induced, 54 repressed). This transcriptional profile, which was dominated by interferon-regulated genes, was sustained during early convalescence. 6 months after antibiotic treatment the transcriptome of LD subjects was indistinguishable from that of healthy controls based on two separate methods of analysis. Return of the LD expression profile to levels found in control subjects was concordant with disease outcome; 82% of subjects with LD experienced at least one symptom at the baseline visit compared to 43% at the early convalescence time point and only a single patient (9%) at the 6-month convalescence time point. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we developed an efficient computational framework to identify sets of 20 classifier genes that discriminated LD from other bacterial and viral infections. These novel LD biomarkers not only differentiated subjects with acute disseminated LD from healthy controls with 96% accuracy but also distinguished between subjects with acute and resolved (late convalescent) disease with 97% accuracy.IMPORTANCE Lyme disease (LD), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the United States. We examined gene expression patterns in the blood of individuals with early disseminated LD at the time of diagnosis (acute) and also at approximately 1 month and 6 months following antibiotic treatment. A distinct acute LD profile was observed that was sustained during early convalescence (1 month) but returned to control levels 6 months after treatment. Using a computer learning algorithm, we identified sets of 20 classifier genes that discriminate LD from other bacterial and viral infections. In addition, these novel LD biomarkers are highly accurate in distinguishing patients with acute LD from healthy subjects and in discriminating between individuals with active and resolved infection. This computational approach offers the potential for more accurate diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme disease. It may also allow improved monitoring of treatment efficacy and disease resolution."

		"abstract": "Ticks are important human and animal parasites and vectors of many infectious disease agents. Control of tick activity is an effective tool to reduce the risk of contracting tick-transmitted diseases. The castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) is the most common tick species in Europe. It is also a vector of the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis, which are two of the most important arthropod-borne diseases in Europe. In recent years, increases in tick activity and incidence of tick-borne diseases have been observed in many European countries. These increases are linked to many ecological and anthropogenic factors such as landscape management, climate change, animal migration, and increased popularity of outdoor activities or changes in land usage. Tick activity is driven by many biotic and abiotic factors, some of which can be effectively managed to decrease risk of tick bites. In the USA, recommendations for landscape management, tick host control, and tick chemical control are well-defined for the applied purpose of reducing tick presence on private property. In Europe, where fewer studies have assessed tick management strategies, the similarity in ecological factors influencing vector presence suggests that approaches that work in USA may also be applicable. In this article we review key factors driving the tick exposure risk in Europe to select those most conducive to management for decreased tick-associated risk."

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalences of Anaplasma spp. (A. phagocytophilum/A. platys), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia spp. (E. canis/E. ewingii), and Ehrlichia chaffeensis in dogs across the Republic of Korea in 2017 and 2018. A total of 2215 serum samples collected from 938 companion dogs, 969 shelter dogs, and 308 military working dogs were examined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescence immunoassay (IFA) kits. Data collected for each animal, including breed, sex, age, region, season, and dog type, were used for statistical analysis. The overall seroprevalence was highest for Anaplasma spp. (15.1 %), followed by Ehrlichia spp. (10.3 %), B. burgdorferi sensu lato (6.4 %), E. chaffeensis (2.3 %), and B. gibsoni (1.7 %). One hundred and sixty-one dogs had antibodies against two or three different pathogens. The most common combinations were Anaplasma spp. - Ehrlichia spp. (2.1 %), Anaplasma spp. - E. chaffeensis (1.4 %), and Anaplasma spp. - B. burgdorferi sensu lato (1.2 %). Season was significantly associated with the seroprevalences of B. burgdorferi sensu lato and Ehrlichia spp., with dogs presenting the highest percentage of positive results during summer. Anaplasma spp. and B. gibsoni were significantly more prevalent in the northern and southern regions, respectively. The seroprevalences of Anaplasma spp., B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and Ehrlichia spp. were significantly higher in military working dogs, while the seroprevalence of E. chaffeensis was higher in companion dogs. The current findings are important for future surveillance of canine tick-borne pathogens and designing appropriate approaches for the diagnosis and control of these pathogens in the Republic of Korea."

Compared with other European countries, the United Kingdom (UK) is considered to have a low incidence of LB, although this varies regionally. To determine whether an association exists between tick bite consultations and LB incidence in the UK, retrospective questionnaires were sent to general practitioners (GPs) in high (Wiltshire), medium (Cumbria) and low (Wales) incidence areas. During 2011, the greatest incidence of consultations for tick bites was reported by GPs in Cumbria (204 consultations per 100,000 inhabitants), followed by Wiltshire (160 per 100,000 population) and Wales (54 per 100,000 population). In Wiltshire and Cumbria, GPs predominantly provided advice on tick removal, whilst Welsh GPs mostly advised patients on tick bite prevention. Focusing on Cumbria during 2011-2013, 72.5% of GPs removed ticks from patients (incidence of 101 consultations per 100,000 population), and more GPs diagnosed LB based on clinical features than laboratory-confirmed diagnoses. To date, this is the first study to investigate the incidence of tick bite consultations and LB in England and Wales."

		"abstract": "Climate change threatens human health, but there remains a lack of evidence on the economic toll of climate-sensitive public health impacts. We characterize human mortality and morbidity costs associated with 10 climate-sensitive case study events spanning 11 US states in 2012: wildfires in Colorado and Washington, ozone air pollution in Nevada, extreme heat in Wisconsin, infectious disease outbreaks of tick-borne Lyme disease in Michigan and mosquito-borne West Nile virus in Texas, extreme weather in Ohio, impacts of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York, allergenic oak pollen in North Carolina, and harmful algal blooms on the Florida coast. Applying a consistent economic valuation approach to published studies and state estimates, we estimate total health-related costs from 917 deaths, 20,568 hospitalizations, and 17,857 emergency department visits of $10.0 billion in 2018 dollars, with a sensitivity range of $2.7-24.6 billion. Our estimates indicate that the financial burden of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and associated medical care is a key dimension of the overall economic impact of climate-sensitive events. We found that mortality costs (i.e., the value of a statistical life) of $8.4 billion exceeded morbidity costs and lost wages ($1.6 billion combined). By better characterizing health damages in economic terms, this work helps to shed light on the burden climate-sensitive events already place on U.S. public health each year. In doing so, we provide a conceptual framework for broader estimation of climate-sensitive health-related costs. The high health-related costs associated with climate-sensitive events highlight the importance of actions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts."

		"abstract": "Background and objective: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB), is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia. The risk of infection depends on the geographical area, ecological factors, and human behavior. Clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have a wide range, but the most frequent clinical symptom, which is also a diagnostic symptom, is a skin rash called erythema migrans (EM). The disease is very common worldwide. In Lithuania, the disease frequency is 99.9 cases per 100,000 population (Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Lithuania, 2017). The main aim of this study was to obtain the baseline characteristics of the disease regarding the infected Lithuanian population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS about all Lyme disease (A69.2) diagnosed patients over a three-year period (from 2014 to 2016) in Lithuania. Results: In 2014-2016, 7424 (crude incidence rate 85.4) cases with LB were diagnosed in Lithuania. Most of them (4633 (62.4%)) were identified in women. Older people were more likely to suffer from LB. Urban residents were 2.6 times more often affected that those living in villages. Tick bites were primarily observed in high season months, from May to September (90%), with the highest peak in July. There was a higher number of observed tick bites (p = 0.003) in the urban residents. Erythema migrans occurred in 75.6% LB cases, while other symptoms did not exceed a quarter of all LB cases. There were 7353 (99.6%) cases where LB was confirmed via clinical symptoms and/or laboratory tests. Also, 1720 (23.2%) patients were tested for LB immunoglobulins. Conclusions: This study found a high incidence of Lyme disease in Lithuania. We elucidated the baseline characteristics regarding the infected Lithuanian population which may ease medical clinicians' work on new Lyme diagnoses."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex spirochetes. Through a complex enzootic cycle, the bacteria transfer between two different hosts: Ixodes ticks and mammalian organisms. At the start of the tick blood meal, the spirochetes located in the tick gut upregulate the expression of several genes, mainly coding for outer surface proteins. Outer surface proteins belonging to the paralogous gene family 54 (PFam54) have been shown to be the most upregulated among the other borrelial proteins and the results clearly point to the potential importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. The significance of PFam54 proteins is confirmed by the fact that of all ten PFam54 proteins, BBA64 and BBA66 are necessary for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from infected Ixodes ticks to mammalian hosts. To enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and to promote the development of novel therapies against Lyme disease, we solved the crystal structure of the PFam54 member BBA65. Additionally, we report the structure of the B. burgdorferi BBA64 orthologous protein from B. spielmanii. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of five PFam54 members and several related proteins, we performed a comprehensive structural analysis for this important group of proteins. In addition to revealing the molecular aspects of the proteins, the structural data analysis suggests that the gene families PFam54 and PFam60, which have long been referred to as separate paralogous families, should be merged into one and designated as PFam54_60."

Asymptomatic subjects from endemic and nonendemic origins demonstrated a seroreactivity rate of approximately 4% that was similar to other commercial assays evaluated in this study. Coupled to this result was the observation that the Lyme Total assay retained a high first-tier specificity of 96% while demonstrating a relatively high sensitivity of 91% among a well-characterized CDC Premarketing Lyme serum panel. The Lyme Total assay also performs well under a modified two-tier algorithm (sensitivity, 84.4 to 88.9%; specificity, 98.4 to 99.5%). Furthermore, the new assay is able to readily detect early Lyme infection in patient samples from outside North America."

A simple classification system was previously established to help validate the disease based on clinical features (classes I-IV). Drawing on historical and pathological parallels with syphilis, we formulated a more detailed staging system based on clinical features as well as severity of skin lesions and corresponding histopathological infection patterns, as determined by anti-Borrelia immunohistochemical staining. Clinical classes I-IV of MD are further categorized as mild, moderate and severe, or stages A, B and C, respectively, based on histopathological findings. Stage A lesions demonstrated little or no immune infiltrates and little or no disorganization of cells; macrophages were not present, and hemorrhage was negligible. Extracellular isolated spirochetes and intracellular staining of keratinocytes in the lower epidermis was occasionally seen. Stage C lesions demonstrated positive staining of keratinocytes in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum and positive intracellular staining of macrophages for Borrelia. Aggregate Borrelia colonies were frequently encountered, hemorrhage was frequent, and intracellularly stained fibroblasts were occasionally seen. Stage B lesions demonstrated a pattern intermediate between Stages A and C. The enhanced staging system provides objective criteria to assess the severity of dermopathy in MD. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment for MD based on this staging system related to Borrelia infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an increasing public health problem. Current laboratory testing is insensitive in early infection, the stage at which appropriate treatment is most effective in preventing disease sequelae. The Lyme Disease Biobank (LDB) collects samples from individuals with symptoms consistent with early LD presenting with or without erythema migrans (EM) or an annular, expanding skin lesion and uninfected individuals from areas of endemicity. Samples were collected from 550 participants (298 cases and 252 controls) according to institutional review board-approved protocols and shipped to a centralized biorepository. Testing was performed to confirm the presence of tick-borne pathogens by real-time PCR, and a subset of samples was tested for Borrelia burgdorferi by culture. Serology was performed on all samples using the CDC's standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTTA) for LD. LD diagnosis was supported by laboratory testing in 82 cases, including positive results by use of the STTTA, PCR, or culture or positive results by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for cases presenting with EM lesion sizes of >5 cm. The remaining 216 cases had negative laboratory testing results. For the controls, 43 were positive by at least one of the tiers and 6 were positive by use of the STTTA. The results obtained with this collection highlight and reinforce the known limitations of serologic testing in early LD, with only 29% of individuals presenting with EM lesion sizes of >5 cm yielding a positive result using the STTTA. Aliquots of whole blood, serum, and urine from clinically characterized patients with and without LD are available to investigators in academia and industry for evaluation or development of novel diagnostic assays for LD, to continue to improve upon currently available methods."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), which is caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, is the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere. Spirochetes are transmitted by Ixodes ticks and maintained in diverse vertebrate animal hosts. Following tick bite, spirochetes initially establish a localized infection in the skin. However, they may also disseminate hematogenously to several distal sites, including heart, joints, or the CNS. Because they need to survive in diverse microenvironments, from tick vector to mammalian hosts, spirochetes have developed multiple strategies to combat the numerous host defense mechanisms. One of these strategies includes the production of a number of complement-regulator acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) which encompass CspA, CspZ, and OspE paralogs to blunt the complement pathway. These proteins are capable of preventing complement activation on the spirochete surface by binding to complement regulator Factor H. The genes encoding these CRASPs differ in their expression patterns during the tick-to-host infection cycle, implying that these proteins may exhibit different functions during infection. This review summarizes the recent published reports which investigated the roles that each of these molecules plays in conferring tick-borne transmission and dissemination in vertebrate hosts. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights into LD pathobiology and may facilitate the identification of new targets for preventive strategies against Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Existing estimates of Lyme disease spread are delayed a year or more. We introduce Lymelight-a new method for monitoring the incidence of Lyme disease in real-time. We use a machine-learned classifier of web search sessions to estimate the number of individuals who search for possible Lyme disease symptoms in a given geographical area for two years, 2014 and 2015. We evaluate Lymelight using the official case count data from CDC and find a 92% correlation (p < 0.001) at county level. Importantly, using web search data allows us not only to assess the incidence of the disease, but also to examine the appropriateness of treatments subsequently searched for by the users. Public health implications of our work include monitoring the spread of vector-borne diseases in a timely and scalable manner, complementing existing approaches through real-time detection, which can enable more timely interventions. Our analysis of treatment searches may also help reduce misdiagnosis of the disease."

		"abstract": "The Channel Islands are British Crown dependencies located in the English Channel to the west of the Normandy coast in northern France. Whilst there have been studies investigating tick occurrence and distribution in different habitats on the mainland of the UK and in France, the Channel Islands have been relatively understudied. As such, little is known about whether the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus, is present, and whether there is a potential risk of Lyme borreliosis on the Channel Islands. To ascertain the presence of I. ricinus on the three largest islands in the archipelago: Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney, surveys of ticks questing in the vegetation and ticks feeding on hosts were undertaken during April and May 2016. Across all three islands, the highest numbers of ticks were found in woodland habitats. Ixodes ricinus was the predominant questing tick species found on Jersey, and Ixodes ventalloi the most common questing tick species on Alderney and Guernsey, with little or no evidence of questing I. ricinus on either island. During field studies on small mammals, I. ricinus was the predominant tick species feeding on Jersey bank voles (Myodes glareolus caesarius), with Ixodes hexagonus the most common species infesting hedgehogs on Guernsey. We propose that the greater diversity of small mammals on Jersey may be important in supporting immature stages of I. ricinus, in contrast to Guernsey and Alderney. Morphological identification of tick species was confirmed by PCR sequencing based on amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (cox1) gene (COI DNA barcoding). To date, there have been few records of human tick bites in the Channel Islands, suggesting that the current risk from tick-borne disease may be low, but continued reporting of any human tick bites, along with reporting of cases of Lyme borreliosis will be important for continued assessment of the impact of tick-borne diseases in the Channel Islands."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis using the current two-tier algorithm is constrained by low sensitivity for early-stage infection and ambiguity in determining treatment response. We recently developed a protein microarray biochip that measures diagnostic serum antibody targets using grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) technology. This strategy requires microliters of blood serum to enable multiplexed biomarker screening on a compact surface and generates quantitative results that can be further processed for diagnostic scoring. The GC-FP biochip was used to detect serum antibodies in patients with active and convalescent LD, as well as various negative controls. We hypothesized that the quantitative, high-sensitivity attributes of the GC-FP approach permit: 1) screening of antibody targets predictive for LD status, and 2) development a diagnostic algorithm that is more sensitive, specific, and informative than the standard ELISA and Western blot assays. Notably, our findings led to a diagnostic algorithm that may be more sensitive than the current standard for detecting early LD, while maintaining 100% specificity. We further show that analysis of relative antibody levels to predict disease status, such as in acute and convalescent stages of infection, is possible with a highly sensitive and quantitative platform like GC-FP. The results from this study add to the urgent conversation regarding better diagnostic strategies and more effective treatment for patients affected by tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "Cases of tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States, and new tick-borne pathogen species causing human illness are being discovered. The specific etiology is generally difficult to diagnose based on clinical signs and symptoms alone, because of their generalized nature and often lack of a known tick bite. For some infections, such as Lyme disease and spotted fever group rickettsioses, serology remains the most appropriate laboratory diagnostic tool, but for others such as anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, direct detection in the blood is preferred for rapid diagnosis. In Kentucky, USA, the area served by our laboratory, the most commonly reported tick-borne illnesses include spotted fever group rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease, but of these three diseases, only ehrlichiosis is well-suited for direct detection using PCR methods during the acute stage of illness. We report here the validation of a duplex real-time PCR assay using whole blood specimens on the Luminex ARIES® instrument, combining DNA extraction, amplification and detection into a one-step process. This method allows for rapid and sensitive detection of acute infections with Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum using whole blood specimens. We included A. phagocytophilum to monitor emergence of this pathogen in Kentucky, since surrounding states have reported many more cases than Kentucky."

		"abstract": "The relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia hermsii and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto each produces an abundant, orthologous, outer membrane protein, Vtp and OspC, respectively, when transmitted by tick bite. Gene inactivation studies have shown that both proteins are essential for spirochete infectivity when transmitted by their respective tick vectors. Therefore, we transformed a vtp-minus mutant of B. hermsii with ospC from B. burgdorferi and examined the behavior of this transgenic spirochete in its soft tick vector Ornithodoros hermsi. IFA staining indicated up to 97.8 % of the transgenic B. hermsii upregulated OspC in the ticks' salivary glands compared to no more than 12.8 % in the midgut, similar to our previous findings with wild-type B. hermsii producing Vtp. Transformation with ospC also restored B. hermsii infectivity to mice when fed upon by infected ticks. Previous sequence analysis of Vtp for 79 isolates and DNA samples of B. hermsii in our laboratory showed this protein is highly polymorphic with 9 divergent amino acid types, yet strikingly the signal peptide is identical among all samples and the same for all OspC signal peptides for B. burgdorferi and related species examined to date. Searches in multiple genome sequences for other species of relapsing fever spirochetes failed to find the same signal peptide sequence to help identify potential transmission-associated proteins. However, some candidate signal peptides with highly similar sequences were found and worthy of future efforts with other species. While OspC of B. burgdorferi restored infectivity to a Vtp-minus mutant of B. hermsii, the functions of these proteins are not known. Our results should stimulate investigators to search for orthologous transmission-associated proteins in other tick-borne spirochetes to better understand how this group of pathogens has coevolved with diverse tick vectors."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States, and the number of cases reported each year continues to rise. The complex nature of the relationships between the pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto), the tick vector (Ixodes scapularis Say), multiple vertebrate hosts, and numerous environmental factors creates challenges for understanding and predicting tick population and pathogen transmission dynamics. LYMESIM is a mechanistic model developed in the late 1990s to simulate the life-history of I. scapularis and transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi s.s. Here we present LYMESIM 2.0, a modernized version of LYMESIM, that includes several modifications to enhance the biological realism of the model and to generate outcomes that are more readily measured under field conditions. The model is tested for three geographically distinct locations in New York, Minnesota, and Virginia. Model-simulated timing and densities of questing nymphs, infected nymphs, and abundances of nymphs feeding on hosts are consistent with field observations and reports for these locations. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of temperature in host finding for the density of nymphs, the importance of transmission from small mammals to ticks on the density of infected nymphs, and temperature-related tick survival for both density of nymphs and infected nymphs. A key challenge for accurate modeling of these metrics is the need for regionally representative inputs for host populations and their fluctuations. LYMESIM 2.0 is a useful public health tool that downstream can be used to evaluate tick control interventions and can be adapted for other ticks and pathogens."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato, the causative agent of tick-borne Lyme borreliosis (LB), has a limited metabolic capacity and needs to acquire nutrients, such as amino acids, fatty acids, and nucleic acids, from the host environment. Using X-ray crystallography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, microscale thermophoresis, and cellular localization studies, we show that basic membrane protein D (BmpD) is a periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter system binding to purine nucleosides. Nucleosides are essential for bacterial survival in the host organism, and these studies suggest a key role for BmpD in the purine salvage pathway of B. burgdorferi sensu lato Because B. burgdorferisensu lato lacks the enzymes required for de novo purine synthesis, BmpD may play a vital role in ensuring access to the purines needed to sustain an infection in the host. Furthermore, we show that, although human LB patients develop anti-BmpD antibodies, immunization of mice with BmpD does not confer protection against B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe. In addition, the relapsing-fever spirochaete Borrelia miyamotoi, which has been associated with febrile illness and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised persons, is present in Europe. This study investigated Borrelia prevalence and species distribution in ticks removed from humans and sent as diagnostic material to the Institute for Parasitology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, in 2013-2017. A probe-based real-time PCR was carried out and Borrelia-positive samples were subjected to species determination by reverse line blot (RLB), including a B. miyamotoi-specific probe. The overall Borrelia-infection rate as determined by real-time PCR was 20.02 % (510/2547, 95 % CI: 18.48-21.63 %), with annual prevalences ranging from 17.17 % (90/524, 95 % CI: 14.04-20.68 %) in 2014 to 24.12 % (96/398, 95 % CI: 19.99-28.63 %) in 2015. In total, 271/475 (57.1 %) positive samples available for RLB were successfully differentiated. Borrelia afzelii was detected in 30.53 % of cases (145/475, 95 % CI: 26.41-34.89), followed by B. garinii/B. bavariensis (13.26 % [63/475], 95 % CI: 10.34-16.65). Borrelia valaisiana occurred in 5.89 % (28/475, 95 % CI: 3.95-8.41), B. spielmanii in 4.63 % (22/475, 95 % CI: 2.93-6.93), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.)/B. carolinensis in 2.32 % (11/475, 95 % CI: 1.16-4.11), B. lusitaniae in 0.63 % (3/475, 95 % CI: 0.13-1.83) and B. bisettiae in 0.42 % (2/475, 95 % CI: 0.05-1.51) of positive ticks. Borrelia kurtenbachii was not detected, while B. miyamotoi was identified in 7.37 % (35/475, 95 % CI: 5.19-10.10) of real-time PCR-positive samples. Sanger sequencing of B. garinii/B. bavariensis-positive ticks revealed that the majority were B. garinii-infections (50/52 successfully amplified samples), while only 2 ticks were infected with B. bavariensis. Furthermore, 6/12 B. burgdorferi s.s./B. carolinensis-positive samples could be differentiated; all of them were identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Thirty-nine ticks (8.21 %, 95 % CI: 5.90-11.05) were coinfected with two different species. Comparison of the species distribution between ticks removed from humans in 2015 and questing ticks collected in the same year and the same area revealed a significantly higher B. afzelii-prevalence in diagnostic tick samples than in questing ticks, confirming previous observations. The obtained data indicate that Borrelia prevalence fluctuated in the same range as observed in a previous study, analysing the period from 2006 to 2012. Detection of B. miyamotoi in 7.37 % of Borrelia-positive samples points to the fact that clinicians should be aware of this pathogen as a differential diagnosis in cases of febrile illness."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is currently known to transmit 7 pathogens responsible for Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tick-borne relapsing fever, ehrlichiosis, and Powassan encephalitis. Ixodes scapularis can also be colonized by endosymbiotic bacteria including those in the genus of Rickettsia. We screened 459 I. scapularis ticks submitted to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Tick Testing Laboratory with the objectives to (1) examine differences in infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi, (2) evaluate whether prevalence of co-infections occur at the same frequency that would be expected based on single infection, and (3) determine the presence of rickettsial endosymbionts in I. scapularis. The prevalence of infection in I. scapularis was highest with Bo. burgdorferi sensu lato (nymph = 45.8%; female = 47.0%), followed by A. phagocytophilum (nymph = 4.0%; female = 6.9%), Ba. microti (nymph = 5.7%; female = 4.7%), and Bo. miyamotoi (nymph = 0%; female = 7.3%). We also identified rickettsial endosymbionts in 93.3% of I. scapularis. Nymphs were significantly more likely to be infected with Bo. burgdorferi if they were infected with Ba. microti, whereas adult females were significantly more likely to be infected with Bo. burgdorferi if they were infected with A. phagocytophilum. Our study suggests that the infection prevalence of Bo. burgdorferi is not independent of other co-circulating pathogens and that there is a substantially higher infection of Bo. miyamotoi in I. scapularis females compared with nymphs in this study. High prevalence of infection and co-infection with multiple pathogens in I. scapularis highlights the public health consequences in Connecticut, a state endemic for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases."

However, enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammals and ticks is poorly characterized throughout much of the region. Here we report prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammal and tick communities in the understudied region of southern California. We found B. burgdorferi s.l. in 1.5% of Ixodes species ticks and 3.6% of small mammals. Infection was uncommon (~0.3%) in Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent to humans in western North America, but a diversity of spirochetes-including Borrelia bissettiae, Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, and B. burgdorferi s.s.-were identified circulating in Ixodes species ticks and their small mammal hosts. Infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. is more common in coastal habitats, where a greater diversity of Ixodes species ticks are found feeding on small mammal hosts (four species when compared with only I. pacificus in other sampled habitats). This provides some preliminary evidence that in southern California, wetter coastal areas might be more favorable for enzootic transmission than hotter and drier climates. Infection patterns confirm that human transmission risk of B. burgdorferi s.s. is low in this region. However, given evidence for local maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l., more studies of enzootic transmission may be warranted, particularly in understudied regions where the tick vector of B. burgdorferi s.s. occurs."

We evaluated serological evidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), West Nile (WN), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), Yersiniosis, Lyme Disease (LD), and brucellosis in 1033 patients presenting with acute febrile illness at 9 health care facilities from diverse ecological zones of Kenya: arid and semiarid (Garissa District Hospital, Lodwar District Hospital, Marigat District Hospital, Gilgil District Hospital), Lake Victoria basin (Kisumu District Hospital, Alupe District Hospital, Kombewa Sub-County Hospital), Kisii highland (Kisii District Hospital), and coastal (Malindi District Hospital). Epidemiological information of the patients such as geography, age, gender, and keeping animals were analyzed as potential risk factors. Of the 1033 samples, 619 (59.9%) were seropositive to at least one pathogen by IgM (current exposure), IgG/IgM (recent exposure), and IgG (past exposure). Collective seroprevalence for current, recent, and past to the pathogens was 9.4%, 5.1%, and 21.1% for LD; 3.6%, 0.5%, and 12.4% for WN; 0.9%, 0.5%, and 16.9% for HEV; 5.8%, 1.3%, and 3.9% for brucellosis; 5.7%, 0.2%, and 2.3% for yersiniosis; 1.7%, 0%, and 6.2% for TBE; and 0.4%, 0%, and 1.9% for CCHF. Brucellosis risk was higher in patients recruited at Garissa District Hospital (odds ratio [OR] = 3.41), HEV (OR = 2.45) and CCHF (OR = 5.46) in Lodwar District Hospital, LD in Alupe District Hospital (OR = 5.73), Kombewa Sub-district hospital (OR = 8.17), and Malindi District hospital (OR = 3.3). Exposure to LD was highest in the younger age group, whereas yersiniosis did not vary with age. Age was a significant risk for WN, brucellosis, CCHF, TBE, and HEV and in those aged >14 years there was an increased risk to WN (OR = 2.30, p < 0.0001), brucellosis (OR = 1.84, p = 0.005), CCHF (OR = 4.35, p = 0.001), TBE (OR = 2.78, p < 0.0001), and HEV (OR = 1.94, p = 0.0001). We conclude that LD is pervasive and constitutes a significant health burden to the study population, whereas yersiniosis and CCHF are not significant threats. Going forward, community-based studies will be needed to capture the true seroprevalence rates and the associated risk factors."

The aim of the article is to introduce the treating physicians to a meaningful microbiological diagnostic procedure. Most important messages include that (I) the suspected diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is first based on anamnestic data and clinical symptoms (compare \"case definitions\") which is substantiated by microbiological examinations; (II) microbiological diagnostics - primarily antibody detection, downstream PCR and culture - are only indicated if there are indicative symptoms, with typical erythema migrans not requiring microbiological diagnostics; (III) keep in mind: The more unspecific the symptoms are the lower the positive and the higher the negative predictive value of microbiological testing; (IV) serological diagnosis should follow a two-step procedure: a sensitive ELISA as first step, if reactive followed by immunoblot (IgM and IgG). Detection rates are ca. 50 % in localized, 70- > 90 % in disseminated early and nearly 100 % (only IgG relevant) in late disease; (V) in the immunoblot early forms of disease show a narrow band spectrum, late forms show a broad spectrum; (VI) methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes include lymphocyte activation or transformation tests (LTT, MELISA, ELISPOT), PCR or antigen detection from urine or blood, lymphocyte subpopulations, or direct detection of borreliae from patient material using dark field- or focus floating microscopy."

		"abstract": "Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have the potential to act as disease reservoirs for wildlife and are important sentinels for common circulating pathogens. Therefore, the infectious disease seroprevalence among domestic dogs in northern Botswana may be indicative of pathogen exposure of various wildlife species. The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria immitis, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus, and canine distemper virus in domestic dogs as proxies of disease prevalence in the local wildlife in the Okavango Delta region of Botswana. Statistical analysis assessed crude and factor-specific seroprevalence proportions in relation to age, sex, and geographical location as predictors of seropositivity. Logistic regression was used to identify adjusted predictors of seropositivity for each of the pathogens of interest. Samples from 233 dogs in a total of seven locations in Maun, Botswana, and surrounding villages were collected and serologically analyzed. No dogs were seropositive for B. burgdorferi, while low seroprevalence proportions were observed for Anaplasma spp. (2.2%) and D. immitis (0.9%). Higher seroprevalence proportions were observed for the tick-borne pathogen Ehrlichia spp. (21.0%), and 19.7% were seropositive for canine adenovirus (hepatitis). The highest seroprevalence proportions were for canine parvovirus (70.0%) and canine distemper virus (44.8%). The predictors of seropositivity revealed that adults were more likely to be seropositive for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, and canine parvovirus than juveniles, and location was a risk factor for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and Ehrlichia spp. Results indicate that increasing tick control and vaccination campaigns for domestic dogs may improve the health of domestic animals, and potentially wildlife and humans in the Okavango Delta since viral and vector-borne bacterial pathogens can be transmitted between them."

We used real-time polymerase chain reaction assays to test for three species of spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) in 1,858 nymphal A. americanum collected from Monmouth County, New Jersey, a coastal county with endemic Lyme disease and established tick surveillance. Out of the 1,858 tested, 465 (25.0%) were infected with Rickettsia amblyommatis Karpathy, a species of undetermined pathogenicity found frequently in A. americanum, while 1/1,858 (0.05%) contained Rickettsia rickettsii Brumpt, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. No ticks tested positive for mildly pathogenic Rickettsia parkeri Lackman, and no ticks were co-infected with multiple Rickettsia spp. Our results indicate that A. americanum could be involved in transmission of R. rickettsii to humans in New Jersey, albeit rarely. The much higher rates of R. amblyommatis infection are consistent with hypotheses that human sera reacting to this species could contribute to reports of mild SFGR cases."

		"abstract": "This study is aimed at evaluating the awareness among hunters and foresters concerning the activities undertaken for the prevention of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> infections. The study group included 236 hunters from Poland and 339 foresters from Ukraine. The study was based on an original questionnaire including questions which concerned the applied methods of removing ticks attached to the skin, the kind of preventive measures undertaken to avoid tick bites, the evaluation of knowledge concerning the prevention of tick-borne diseases, as well as the participants' willingness to be educated on this issue. Removing a tick with a pair of tweezers by a simple vertical move was more frequently practiced by the hunters (16.5%). Spreading an oily substance over a tick to make it go out on its own was more often applied by the foresters (18.8%). The occurrence of <i>erythema migrans</i> was more frequently reported by the foresters (47.2%). Among the persons declaring no knowledge of the prevention of tick-borne diseases, 77.8% of the hunters and 61.5% of the foresters were willing to gain such knowledge, and 11.1% of the hunters and 21.2% of the foresters did not want any education on this issue. The hunters more often than the foresters applied repellents and checked their body after returning from green areas. Education is needed in certain groups undertaking hobby or vocational activities in forest areas of Poland and Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake research on the preferences concerning the choice of repellents among the groups at risk of tick bites. Med Pr. 2020;71(1):59-68."

		"abstract": "The genus Borrelia comprises spirochaetal bacteria maintained in natural transmission cycles by tick vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts. The main groups are represented by a species complex including the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and relapsing fever group Borrelia. Borrelia miyamotoi belongs to the relapsing fever group of spirochetes and forms distinct populations in North America, Asia, and Europe. As all Borrelia species B. miyamotoi possess an unusual and complex genome consisting of a linear chromosome and a number of linear and circular plasmids. The species is considered an emerging human pathogen and an increasing number of human cases are being described in the Northern hemisphere. The aim of this study was to produce a high quality reference genome that will facilitate future studies into genetic differences between different populations and the genome plasticity of B. miyamotoi. We used multiple available sequencing methods, including Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT) supplemented with highly accurate Illumina sequences, to explore the suitability for whole genome assembly of the Russian B. miyamotoi isolate, Izh-4. Plasmids were typed according to their potential plasmid partitioning genes (PF32, 49, 50, 57/62). Comparing and combining results of both long-read (SMRT and ONT) and short-read methods (Illumina), we determined that the genome of the isolate Izh-4 consisted of one linear chromosome, 12 linear and two circular plasmids. Whilst the majority of plasmids had corresponding contigs in the Asian B. miyamotoi isolate FR64b, there were only four that matched plasmids of the North American isolate CT13-2396, indicating differences between B. miyamotoi populations. Several plasmids, e.g. lp41, lp29, lp23, and lp24, were found to carry variable major proteins. Amongst those were variable large proteins (Vlp) subtype Vlp-α, Vlp-γ, Vlp-δ and also Vlp-β. Phylogenetic analysis of common plasmids types showed the uniqueness in Russian/Asian isolates of B. miyamotoi compared to other isolates. We here describe the genome of a Russian B. miyamotoi clinical isolate, providing a solid basis for future comparative genomics of B. miyamotoi isolates. This will be a great impetus for further basic, molecular and epidemiological research on this emerging tick-borne pathogen."

Thousands are dying worldwide of once easily treatable diseases. Ozone therapy, extensively studied, may be a valuable adjunctive or stand-alone therapy. Ebola again ravages Africa with over 2000 already dead, carrying a 65% mortality rate. The world desperately needs safe, inexpensive and effective anti-infective therapy to which microbes will not develop resistance. Oxidation therapies have shown an extremely high safety profile, lacking credible reports of significant injury beyond vein irritation. Ozone therapy, the most studied and least expensive to perform, is in itself a germicide, not an antibiotic, and improves several physiological parameters essential for infection defense. Recent reports indicate very favorable responses to both bacterial and viral disease, inclusive of Ebola. Despite lack of commercial profitability (not patentable), medicine would do well to revisit its pre-antibiotic era oxidation therapy roots, especially ozone in the current crisis."

		"abstract": "Increases in tick-borne disease prevalence and transmission are important public health issues. Efforts to control these emerging diseases are frustrated by the struggle to control tick populations and to detect and treat infections caused by the pathogens that they transmit. This review covers tick-borne infectious diseases of nonrickettsial bacterial, parasitic, and viral origins. While tick surveillance and tracking inform our understanding of the importance of the spread and ecology of ticks and help identify areas of risk for disease transmission, the vectors are not the focus of this document. Here, we emphasize the most significant pathogens that infect humans as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that they cause. Although detection via molecular or immunological methods has improved, tick-borne diseases continue to remain underdiagnosed, making the scope of the problem difficult to assess. Our current understanding of the incidence of tick-borne diseases is discussed in this review. An awareness of the diseases that can be transmitted by ticks in specific locations is key to detection and selection of appropriate treatment. As tick-transmitted pathogens are discovered and emerge in new geographic regions, our ability to detect, describe, and understand the growing public health threat must also grow to meet the challenge."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a complex tick-borne zoonosis that poses an escalating public health threat in several parts of the world, despite sophisticated healthcare infrastructure and decades of effort to address the problem. Concepts like the true burden of the illness, from incidence rates to longstanding consequences of infection, and optimal case management, also remain shrouded in controversy. At the heart of this multidisciplinary issue are the causative spirochetal pathogens belonging to the Borrelia Lyme complex. Their unusual physiology and versatile lifestyle have challenged microbiologists, and may also hold the key to unlocking mysteries of the disease. The goal of this review is therefore to integrate established and emerging concepts of Borrelia biology and pathogenesis, and position them in the broader context of biomedical research and clinical practice. We begin by considering the conventions around diagnosing and characterizing Lyme disease that have served as a conceptual framework for the discipline. We then explore virulence from the perspective of both host (genetic and environmental predispositions) and pathogen (serotypes, dissemination, and immune modulation), as well as considering antimicrobial strategies (lab methodology, resistance, persistence, and clinical application), and borrelial adaptations of hypothesized medical significance (phenotypic plasticity or pleomorphy)."

		"abstract": "Ecological factors, host characteristics and/or interactions among microbes may all shape the occurrence of microbes and the structure of microbial communities within organisms. In the past, disentangling these factors and determining their relative importance in shaping within-host microbiota communities has been hampered by analytical limitations to account for (dis)similar environmental preferences ('environmental filtering'). Here we used a joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) approach to characterize the bacterial microbiota of one of the most important disease vectors in Europe, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, along ecological gradients in the Swiss Alps. Although our study captured extensive environmental variation along elevational clines, the explanatory power of such large-scale ecological factors was comparably weak, suggesting that tick-specific traits and behaviours, microhabitat and -climate experienced by ticks, and interactions among microbes play an important role in shaping tick microbial communities. Indeed, when accounting for shared environmental preferences, evidence for significant patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence among microbes was found, which is indicative of competition or facilitation processes. Signals of facilitation were observed primarily among human pathogens, leading to co-infection within ticks, whereas signals of competition were observed between the tick endosymbiont Spiroplasma and human pathogens. These findings highlight the important role of small-scale ecological variation and microbe-microbe interactions in shaping tick microbial communities and the dynamics of tick-borne disease."

To study the epidemiology of LD in Canadian children using the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) to better understand exposure history, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of paediatric LD cases in Canada. A structured questionnaire was completed by paediatricians for each LD case reported as part of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from 2014 to 2017. There were 95 cases that met inclusion criteria as confirmed or probable cases. The median age was 7 years; 38 % were 5-9 years and 35 % were 10-15 years of age. Most cases were acquired in known Canadian endemic locations; 5 were acquired during travel to the US. Most cases were reported from Nova Scotia and Ontario (46 % and 38 % respectively). The most common clinical presentation was arthritis (59 % of all cases), which is a manifestation of the late disseminated stage of LD. Late disseminated disease presented through the year, whereas early LD (Erythema migrans) and early disseminated LD presented during the summer and fall. Antibiotic choice and duration of therapy generally followed accepted guidelines. This study of the clinical spectrum of LD in Canadian children underlines the need for preventive measures to protect children in Canada from emerging LD, and the need for health care provider awareness."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tick-borne infections in the United States has risen significantly in the past decade. Ticks can transmit a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, that can cause serious illnesses. Therefore, the use of rapid, sensitive, and specific multiplex tests is important to identify the pathogen(s) in the acute phase and determine appropriate treatment to minimize the severity of the disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ChromaCode's research use only (RUO) nine-target high-definition PCR (HDPCR) tick-borne pathogen (TBP) panel using 379 retrospective, remnant whole-blood and synovial fluid specimens previously submitted to Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories and tested by clinically validated real-time PCR assays for Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia spp., or Lyme Borrelia spp. The performance characteristics evaluated included positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the ARUP laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). All tested targets had an initial PPA greater than 97.0%, except Ehrlichia ewingii, with a PPA of 88.9%. The NPAs for all targets were between 98.8% and 100%. The TBP panel detected three coinfections, with two of Babesia microti and A. phagocytophilum and one of B. microti and E. chaffeensis, which were confirmed by the LDTs. There were 16 samples with discordant results compared to the LDT results, five of which were resolved by repeat testing on the TBP panel and bidirectional sequencing. Following discrepant resolution, the final PPA and NPA for the TBP panel were 97.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.2% to 99.0%) and 99.6% (95% CI, 99.3% to 99.8%), respectively, with an overall agreement of 99.5% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.7%) with the LDTs."

Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression, current tests are insensitive in early stage LD, with a sensitivity of <50%. Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 h). To address these challenges, we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care (POC) test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA). We trained a deep-learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets and then blindly tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-) = 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0%, respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning, the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3%, with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7%, respectively."

		"abstract": "Birds are hosts for several zoonotic pathogens. Because of their high mobility, especially of longdistance migrants, birds can disperse these pathogens, affecting their distribution and phylogeography. We focused on Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which includes the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, as an example for tick-borne pathogens, to address the role of birds as propagation hosts of zoonotic agents at a large geographical scale. We collected ticks from passerine birds in 11 European countries. B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in Ixodes spp. was 37% and increased with latitude. The fieldfare Turdus pilaris and the blackbird T. merula carried ticks with the highest Borrelia prevalence (92 and 58%, respectively), whereas robin Erithacus rubecula ticks were the least infected (3.8%). Borrelia garinii was the most prevalent genospecies (61%), followed by B. valaisiana (24%), B. afzelii (9%), B. turdi (5%) and B. lusitaniae (0.5%). A novel Borrelia genospecies \"Candidatus Borrelia aligera\" was also detected. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of B. garinii isolates together with the global collection of B. garinii genotypes obtained from the Borrelia MLST public database revealed that: (a) there was little overlap among genotypes from different continents, (b) there was no geographical structuring within Europe, and (c) there was no evident association pattern detectable among B. garinii genotypes from ticks feeding on birds, questing ticks or human isolates. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the population structure and evolutionary biology of tick-borne pathogens are shaped by their host associations and the movement patterns of these hosts."

		"abstract": "Cattle grazing has been suggested to reduce the risk for Lyme borreliosis by decreasing the density of questing Ixodes ricinus infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We tested the hypotheses that cattle grazing used in woodland management decreases the density of questing I. ricinus, and that it decreases the nympal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. We further expected the nympal infection prevalence of tick-borne pathogens that utilize cattle as amplifying hosts, namely Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia sensu stricto, to increase. To test these hypotheses, we compared the densities of questing I. ricinus between twenty pairs of plots in grazed and ungrazed forest areas. The density of I. ricinus adults, but not nymphs, was lower in areas grazed by cattle than in ungrazed areas. Nymphs were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia s.s. DNA from twelve paired areas. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia s.s. from qPCR-positive tick lysates were identified further to the ecotype and species level, respectively, by DNA sequencing. The infection prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was lower, and infection prevalence of Babesia s.s., identified as Babesia venatorum, was higher in grazed areas. In contrast, infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi s.l. or B. miyamotoi did not differ between grazed and ungrazed areas. As a consequence, conventional cattle grazing in forested areas had no effect on the densities of questing nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and B. miyamotoi. Similarly, we found no effect of cattle grazing on the density of infected nymphs with B. venatorum. The marked difference in the densities of questing nymphs infected with A. phagocytophilum could potentially be explained by the presence of a higher density of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in ungrazed areas, as the majority of typed A. phagocytophilum from ungrazed areas were the non-zoonotic ecotype II, which is associated with roe deer."

		"abstract": "In Scandinavia, the distribution of ticks is expanding and tick-borne diseases constitute growing health risks. While the probability of getting a tick-borne disease after a tick bite is low, the health impacts can be large. This, as well as other characteristics of these diseases make tick-related risks difficult for laypeople to assess and perceived risk may differ substantially from actual risk. Understanding risk perceptions is important since it is the perceived risk, rather than actual risk, that determine behaviour and even more so for new and emerging risks. The aim of this study is to investigate knowledge and risk perceptions related to tick bites and the tick-borne diseases Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). By analysing risk perceptions and knowledge, the study helps inform the development of public health strategies in response to the increasing incidence of these diseases in Scandinavia. Two thousand, six hundred sixty-eight respondents in Denmark, Norway and Sweden answered an online questionnaire with 48 questions, including 7 questions on risk perceptions and 9 knowledge questions. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse statistical differences between country sub-samples, gender and age groups. A multivariate regression model was used to analyse factors associated with risk perceptions. Risk perceptions were on average high in comparison with scientific estimates, with respondents grossly overrating the probability of contracting LB or TBE if bitten by a tick. Also, the average perceived seriousness of a single tick bite and of getting LB or TBE was high. Knowledge on the other hand was low, especially among men and the youngest age group (18-29 years). Higher levels of knowledge about tick-borne diseases were associated with lower perceived seriousness of tick bites and LB and higher perceived seriousness of TBE. Also, having been diagnosed with LB was negatively associated with the perceived seriousness of LB. Our results indicate that informing about ticks and tick-borne diseases would be a relevant public health strategy as it could make risk perceptions better aligned with actual risk. Should the TBE virus spread further in Denmark and Norway, increasing knowledge about TBE vaccination would be especially important."

		"abstract": "The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial illness that occurs in areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. Early infection typically presents as generalized symptoms with an erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion. Dissemination of the pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi can result in multiple EM skin lesions or in extracutaneous manifestations such as Lyme neuroborreliosis. Metabolic biosignatures of patients with early Lyme disease can potentially provide diagnostic targets as well as highlight metabolic pathways that contribute to pathogenesis. Sera from well-characterized patients diagnosed with either early localized Lyme disease (ELL) or early disseminated Lyme disease (EDL), plus healthy controls (HC), from the United States were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative analyses were performed between ELL, or EDL, or ELL combined with EDL, and the HC to develop biosignatures present in early Lyme disease. A direct comparison between ELL and EDL was also performed to develop a biosignature for stages of early Lyme disease. Metabolic pathway analysis and chemical identification of metabolites with LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated alterations of eicosanoid, bile acid, sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and acylcarnitine metabolic pathways during early Lyme disease. These metabolic alterations were confirmed using a separate set of serum samples for validation. The findings demonstrated that infection of humans with B. burgdorferi alters defined metabolic pathways that are associated with inflammatory responses, liver function, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Additionally, the data provide evidence that metabolic pathways can be used to mark the progression of early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The present study aimed to detect and characterize Borrelia spp. in ticks attached to dogs in Korea. Overall, 562 ticks (276 pools) attached to dogs were collected and tested for Borrelia infection by PCR targeting the 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (rrf-rrl). One tick larva (pool level, 0.4%; individual level, 0.2%) was confirmed by sequencing Borrelia garinii, a zoonotic pathogen. For molecular characterization, the outer surface protein A (ospA) and flagellin genes were analyzed. Phylogenetic ospA analysis distinguished B. garinii from B. bavariensis, which has been recently identified as a novel Borrelia species. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis showed that single gene analysis involving rrf-rrl or flagellin was not sufficient to differentiate B. garinii from B. bavariensis. In addition, the B. garinii-infected tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by sequencing according to mitochondrial 16S rRNA and the second transcribed spacer region. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the molecular detection of B. garinii in I. nipponensis parasitizing a dog in Korea. Continuous monitoring of tick-borne pathogens in ticks attached to animals is required to avoid disease distribution and possible transmission to humans."

There are not many data available regarding the differences in the course of NB in children and adults. The aim of our study was to compare the clinical course of NB between children and adults. Retrospective analysis of medical documentation of 181 patients with NB was performed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group I: 57 children with NB; Group II: 124 adults with NB. Medical data, such as patients' age, sex, place of living (residence), time from a tick bite, subjective complaints, general examination results, laboratory parameters and treatment were analyzed. In children, the most common symptoms were headache (89.5%), neck stiffness (64.9%) and nausea and vomiting (56.1%). In adults, the most common symptoms were headache (77.4%), facial nerve palsy (59.7%), neck stiffness (59.7%), vertigo (41.9%) and lumbosacral region pain (37.1%). Bannwarth's syndrome was observed in 10.5% of children and 36.3% of adults. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in children, the pleocytosis at admission was higher than in adults, but protein concentration was significantly lower. There were no differences in percentage of mononuclear cells in CSF smear between the groups. In CSF examination after treatment, a decrease in pleocytosis and protein concentration was observed in both groups. Analysis of effectiveness of treatment mostly with third generation cephalosporins (defined as complete recovery) between the groups, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the use of the log-rank test, showed no significant differences between children and adults (log-rank P = 0.619). In children, NB more frequently presented as meningitis, and in adults in the form of Bannwarth's syndrome. CSF pleocytosis in children with NB was higher than in adults, while the protein concentration in children was lower. Outcomes in children and adults were favorable and did not differ after standard NB treatment."

		"abstract": "Prey modify their behavior in response to variation in predation risk, and such modifications can affect trophic processes such as disease transmission. However, variation in predation risk is complex, arising from direct risk from the predator itself and indirect risk due to the environment. Moreover, direct risk typically stems from multiple predators and varies over timescales (e.g., a predator nearby vs. its seasonal activities). We implemented a field-based experiment to disentangle these sources of risk and relate them to antipredator behavior in rodents. We modeled rodent occurrence and activity as a function of short- and long-term risk from a primary predator, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), long-term risk from a second predator, coyotes (Canis latrans), and environmental variables. We found that long-term red fox activity strongly reduced rodent occurrence and that cues of nearby red fox presence decreased rodent activity by > 50%. In addition, this activity reduction was dynamic in that varied according to the background level of long-term red fox activity. Importantly, rodents did not respond to environmental variables (moonlight, temperature, and habitat) or long-term coyote activity. These results bear upon recent work that suggests predators can alter tick-borne disease dynamics via induced antipredator behavior of rodents, which are hosts for pathogens and ticks. Specifically, our study corroborates the hypothesis that red foxes act as important proximal agents in regulating tick-borne diseases by reducing rodent activity. More generally, this study highlights the need to consider the dynamic nature of prey antipredator response across landscapes with variable long-term predation risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease and human babesiosis are the most common tick-borne zoonoses in the Temperate Zone of North America. The number of infected patients has continued to rise globally, and these zoonoses pose a major healthcare threat. This tick-host-pathogen study was conducted to test for infectious microbes associated with Lyme disease and human babesiosis in Canada. Using the flagellin (flaB) gene, three members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex were detected, namely a Borrelia lanei-like spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss), and a distinct strain that may represent a separate Bbsl genospecies. This novel Bbsl strain was detected in a mouse tick, Ixodes muris, collected from a House Wren, Troglodytes aedon, in Quebec during the southward fall migration. The presence of Bbsl in bird-feeding larvae of I. muris suggests reservoir competency in three passerines (i.e., Common Yellowthroat, House Wren, Magnolia Warbler). Based on the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, three Babesia species (i.e., Babesia divergens-like, Babesia microti, Babesia odocoilei) were detected in field-collected ticks. Not only was B. odocoilei found in songbird-derived ticks, this piroplasm was apparent in adult questing blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, in southern Canada. By allowing live, engorged ticks to molt, we confirm the transstadial passage of Bbsl in I. muris and B. odocoilei in I. scapularis. Bbss and Babesia microti were detected concurrently in a groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, in Western Ontario. In Alberta, a winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, which was collected from a moose, Alces alces, tested positive for Bbss. Notably, a B. divergens-like piroplasm was detected in a rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, collected from an eastern cottontail in southern Manitoba; this Babesia species is a first-time discovery in Canada. This rabbit tick was also co-infected with Borrelia lanei-like spirochetes, which constitutes a first in Canada. Overall, five ticks were concurrently infected with Babesia and Bbsl pathogens and, after the molt, could potentially co-infect humans. Notably, we provide the first authentic report of I. scapularis ticks co-infected with Bbsl and B. odocoilei in Canada. The full extent of infectious microorganisms transmitted to humans by ticks is not fully elucidated, and clinicians need to be aware of the complexity of these tick-transmitted enzootic agents on human health. Diagnosis and treatment must be administered by those with accredited medical training in tick-borne zoonosis."

Maine, USA, is a high Lyme disease incidence state, with rising incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses associated with increasing I. scapularis abundance and northward range expansion. Members of the public submitted ticks to a tick identification program (1990-2013). From these passive surveillance data, we characterized temporal trends in I. scapularis submission rate (an index of abundance), comparing Maine's northern tier (seven counties) versus southern tier (nine counties). In the northern tier, the I. scapularis submission rate increased throughout the duration of the time series, suggesting I. scapularis was emergent but not established. By contrast, in the southern tier, submission rate increased initially but leveled off after 10-14 yr, suggesting I. scapularis was established by the mid-2000s. Active (field) surveillance data from a site in the southern tier-bird tick burdens and questing adult tick collections-corroborated this leveling pattern. Lyme disease incidence and I. scapularis submission rate were temporally correlated in the northern but not southern tier. This suggested a decoupling of reported disease incidence and entomological risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by a tick-borne bacterium Borrelia sp. This zoonotic infection is common in the Northern Hemisphere, e.g., Europe. Clinical presentation may involve multisystem symptoms and depends on the stage of the disease. The involvement of nervous system in Lyme disease is commonly referred to as neuroborreliosis. Neuroborreliosis may involve meningitis, mononeuritis multiplex, or cranial neuritis including the inflammation of vestibulocochlear nerve. In the late or chronic stage of Lyme disease, vestibular involvement may be the sole presentation, although such cases are rare. Our study was designed to present our own case and review the available literature reporting cases of neuroborreliosis with vertigo/dizziness and severe balance instability as a main disease symptom. The studies were obtained by searching the following databases: PubMed, Medline, and Embase. We included case reports of Lyme disease presenting with vertigo or gait disorders as the main symptom, written in the English language. Initially, 60 papers were identified. After analyzing the abstracts, seven manuscripts focusing on 13 clinical cases were included in this review. We conclude that the patients with neuroborreliosis sometimes present vertigo/dizziness, but rarely gait ataxia as a sole symptom. These complaints are usually accompanied by a hearing loss. Antibiotic treatment is usually effective. Balance instability in the patients with neuroborreliosis may persist but it responds well to vestibular rehabilitation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex spirochetes. The spirochete is located in the gut of the tick; as the infected tick starts the blood meal, the spirochete must travel through the hemolymph to the salivary glands, where it can spread to and infect the new host organism. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of the key outer surface protein BBE31 from B. burgdorferi and its orthologous protein BSE31 (BSPA14S_RS05060 gene product) from B. spielmanii. BBE31 is known to be important for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from the gut to the hemolymph in the tick after a tick bite. While BBE31 exerts its function by interacting with the Ixodes scapularis tick gut protein TRE31, structural and mass spectrometry data revealed that BBE31 has a glutathione (GSH) covalently attached to Cys142 suggesting that the protein may have acquired some additional functions in contrast to its orthologous protein BSE31, which lacks any interactions with GSH. In the current study, in addition to analyzing the potential reasons for GSH binding, the three-dimensional structure of BBE31 provides new insights into the molecular details of the transmission process as the protein plays an important role in the initial phase before the spirochete is physically transferred to the new host. This knowledge will be potentially used for the development of new strategies to fight against Lyme disease."

The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2017 in comparison to the situation in previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on data from the annual bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017”. (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2018, NIZP-PZH, GIS). In 2017 were registered 21,514 Lyme disease cases i.e. 1.48% more than in the previous year and 2,324 people were hospitalized. Epidemiological situation in Western European countries and Poland are similar. A slightly increase in 2017 and lack of a clear trend in individual voivodeships may indicate, that a very high level of sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance has been achieved."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti can lead to severe babesiosis in immunosuppressed populations, but due to high numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical reporting is unable to define its geographic distribution. Although Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is endemic throughout Pennsylvania (PA), human babesiosis is under recognized, despite sharing the same vector and primary reservoir host. Ixodes ticks are known to carry B. microti throughout PA, but information about pathogen prevalence in small mammal reservoirs remains limited. Characterizing B. microti prevalence in these small mammals can elucidate mechanisms of pathogen spread and define geographic areas where humans are at risk of infection. We tested 692 small mammals across eight contiguous counties in central PA for molecular evidence of B. microti and B. burgdorferi. In total, six different small mammal species were collected. The overall prevalence of B. microti was 32% with similar rates observed across all counties. Surprisingly, this was higher than the prevalence of B. burgdorferi at 21%. In fact, high rates of B. microti were found in all six species, and both pathogens were identified in 11% of mammals tested. The prevalence of B. microti was highest in Myodes gapperi (southern red-backed vole) at 39% despite Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) being considered the primary reservoir host for B. microti. In conclusion, B. microti has a high prevalence across multiple small mammal species throughout central PA. This prevalence is greater than B. burgdorferi despite a much higher incidence of Lyme disease compared to babesiosis in PA. Although it remains unknown how the prevalence of B. microti in small mammal hosts corresponds to human infection rates, the high pathogen prevalence of B. microti suggests that it is an emerging pathogen in this area. Currently, babesiosis is not a reportable disease in PA, and additional studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical significance in this geographic region."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens pose a considerable disease burden in Europe and North America, where increasing numbers of human cases and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens has renewed interest in resolving the mechanisms underpinning their geographical distribution and abundance. For Borrelia burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, transmission of infection from one generation of ticks to another occurs when older nymphal ticks infect younger larval ticks feeding on the same host, either indirectly via systemic infection of the vertebrate host or directly when feeding in close proximity. Here, expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, and the related tick type-reproduction number, T, are derived that account for the observation that larval and nymphal ticks tend to aggregate on the same minority of hosts, a tick feeding behaviour known as co-aggregation. The pattern of tick blood meals is represented as a directed, acyclic, bipartite contact network, with individual vertebrate hosts having in-degree, kin, and out-degree, kout, that respectively represent cumulative counts of nymphal and larval ticks fed over the lifetime of the host. The in- and out-degree are not independent when co-aggregation occurs such that [Formula: see text] where 〈.〉 indicates expected value. When systemic infection in the vertebrate host is the dominant transmission route R02=T, whereas when direct transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host is dominant then R0=T and the effect of co-aggregation on R0 is more pronounced. Simulations of B. burgdorferi and TBE virus transmission on theoretical tick-mouse contact networks revealed that aggregation and co-aggregation have a synergistic effect on R0 and T, that co-aggregation always increases R0 and T, and that aggregation only increases R0 and T when larvae and nymphs also co-aggregate. Co-aggregation has the greatest absolute effect on R0 and T when the mean larval burden of hosts is high, and the largest relative effect on R0 for pathogens sustained by co-feeding transmission, e.g. TBE virus in Europe, compared with those predominantly spread by systemic infection, e.g. B. burgdorferi. For both pathogens, though, co-aggregation increases the mean number of ticks infected per infectious tick, T, and so too the likelihood of pathogen persistence."

Additionally, anti-B. miyamotoi antibodies can cross-react with C6 antigen testing for B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, underscoring the need for improved serological assays that produce accurate diagnostic results. We performed an immunoproteomics analysis of B. miyamotoi proteins to identify novel serodiagnostic antigens. Sera from mice infected with B. miyamotoi by subcutaneous inoculation or tick bite were collected for immunoblotting against B. miyamotoi membrane-associated proteins separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). In total, 88 proteins in 40 2DE immunoreactive spots were identified via mass spectrometry. Multiple variable large proteins (Vlps) and a putative lipoprotein were among those identified and analyzed. Reactivity of anti-B. miyamotoi sera against recombinant Vlps and the putative lipoprotein confirmed their immunogenicity. Mouse anti-B. burgdorferi serum was cross-reactive to all recombinant Vlps, but not against the putative lipoprotein by IgG. Furthermore, antibodies against the recombinant putative lipoprotein were present in serum from a B. miyamotoi-infected human patient, but not a Lyme disease patient. Results presented here provide a comprehensive profile of B. miyamotoi antigens that induce the host immune response and identify a putative lipoprotein as a potentially specific antigen for B. miyamotoi serodetection."

Male patient, 63 years-of-age, admitted to hospital with skin rash presenting for 1 week and fever with cough and expectoration for 3 days before admission. We diagnosed that the patient was co-infected by B burgdorferi sl and SFGR using laboratory test results and the patient's clinical manifestations. The patient started therapy with oral minocycline, then levofloxacin by intravenous injection for SFGR. Meanwhile, he was treated with penicillin G sodium, cefoperazone sulbactam sodium and ceftriaxone by intravenous injection for B burgdorferi sl. After the patient was in stable condition, he was discharged from hospital. This case report highlights the possibility of co-infection by 2 tick-borne diseases in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The antibiotic therapy should be based on the detection of pathogenic bacteria, and the different susceptibilities of co-infecting bacteria should be considered."

		"abstract": "As tick-borne diseases continue to emerge across the United States, there is need for a better understanding of the tick and pathogen communities in the southern states and of habitat features that influence transmission risk. We surveyed questing and on-host ticks in pine-dominated forests with various fire management regimes in the Sam Houston National Forest, a popular recreation area near Houston, Texas. Four linear transects were established- two with a history of controlled burns, and two unburned. Systematic drag sampling yielded 112 ticks from two species, Ixodes scapularis (n=73) and Amblyomma americanum (n=39), with an additional 106 questing ticks collected opportunistically from drag cloth operators. There was a significant difference in systematically-collected questing tick density between unburned (15 and 18 ticks/1000 m2) and burned (2 and 4 ticks/1000 m2) transects. We captured 106 rodents and found 74 ticks on the rodents, predominantly Dermacentor variabilis. One unburned transect had significantly more ticks per mammal than any of the other three transects. DNA of Rickettsia species was detected in 146/292 on and off-host ticks, including the 'Rickettsial endosymbiont of I. scapularis' and Rickettsia amblyommatis, which are of uncertain pathogenicity to humans. Borrelia lonestari was detected in one A. americanum, while Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the agent of Lyme disease, was not detected in any tick samples. Neither Borrelia nor Rickettsia spp. were detected in any of the mammal ear biopsies (n=64) or blood samples (n=100) tested via PCR. This study documents a high prevalence in ticks of Rickettsia spp. thought to be endosymbionts, a low prevalence of relapsing fever group Borrelia in ticks, and a lack of detection of Lyme disease-group Borrelia in both ticks and mammals in an east Texas forested recreation area. Additionally, we observed low questing tick density in areas with a history of controlled burns. These results expand knowledge of tick-borne disease ecology in east Texas which can aid in directing future investigative, modeling, and management efforts."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes in eastern and central North America, and local densities of this tick can affect human disease risk. We sampled larvae and nymphs from sites in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, USA, using flag/drag devices and by collecting ticks from hosts, and measured environmental variables to evaluate the environmental factors that affect local distribution and abundance of I. scapularis. Our sites were all forested areas with known I. scapularis populations. Environmental variables included those associated with weather (e.g., temperature and relative humidity), vegetation characteristics (at canopy, shrub, and ground levels), and host abundance (small and medium-sized mammals and reptiles). The numbers of larvae on animals at a given site and season showed a logarithmic relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples, suggesting limitation in the numbers on host animals. The numbers of nymphs on animals showed no relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples. These results suggest that only a small proportion of larvae and nymphs found hosts because in neither stage did the numbers of host-seeking ticks decline with increased numbers on hosts. Canopy cover was predictive of larval and nymphal numbers in flag/drag samples, but not of numbers on hosts. Numbers of small and medium-sized mammal hosts the previous year were generally not predictive of the current year's tick numbers, except that mouse abundance predicted log numbers of nymphs on all hosts the following year. Some measures of larval abundance were predictive of nymphal numbers the following year. The mean number of larvae per mouse was well predicted by measures of overall larval abundance (based on flag/drag samples and samples from all hosts), and some environmental factors contributed significantly to the model. In contrast, the mean numbers of nymphs per mouse were not well predicted by environmental variables, only by overall nymphal abundance on hosts. Therefore, larvae respond differently than nymphs to environmental factors. Furthermore, flag/drag samples provide different information about nymphal numbers than do samples from hosts. Flag/drag samples can provide information about human risk of acquiring nymph-borne pathogens because they provide information on the densities of ticks that might encounter humans, but to understand the epizootiology of tick-borne agents both flag/drag and host infestation data are needed."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the occurrence of Lyme disease in the U.S. has now reached approximately 300,000 cases annually. Early stage Borrelia burgdorferi infections are generally treatable with oral antibiotics, but late stage disease is more difficult to treat and more likely to lead to post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Here we examine three unique 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/SAH) nucleosidases (MTNs or MTANs, EC 3.2.2.9) responsible for salvage of adenine and methionine in B. burgdorferi and explore their potential as antibiotic targets to treat Lyme disease. Recombinant Borrelia MTNs were expressed and purified from E. coli. The enzymes were extensively characterized for activity, specificity, and inhibition using a UV spectrophotometric assay. In vitro antibiotic activities of MTN inhibitors were assessed using a bioluminescent BacTiter-Glo™ assay. The three Borrelia MTNs showed unique activities against the native substrates MTA, SAH, and 5'-deoxyadenosine. Analysis of substrate analogs revealed that specific activity rapidly dropped as the length of the 5'-alkylthio substitution increased. Non-hydrolysable nucleoside transition state analogs demonstrated sub-nanomolar enzyme inhibition constants. Lastly, two late stage transition state analogs exerted in vitro IC50 values of 0.3-0.4 μg/mL against cultured B. burgdorferi cells. B. burgdorferi is unusual in that it expresses three distinct MTNs (cytoplasmic, membrane bound, and secreted) that are effectively inactivated by nucleoside analogs. The Borrelia MTNs appear to be promising targets for developing new antibiotics to treat Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) technology takes advantage of smartphone features to turn them into research tools, with the potential to reach a larger section of the population in a cost-effective manner, compared with traditional epidemiological methods. Although mHealth apps have been widely implemented in chronic diseases and psychology, their potential use in the research of vector-borne diseases has not yet been fully exploited. This study aimed to assess the usability and feasibility of The Tick App, the first tick research-focused app in the United States. The Tick App was designed as a survey tool to collect data on human behaviors and movements associated with tick exposure while engaging users in tick identification and reporting. It consists of an enrollment survey to identify general risk factors, daily surveys to collect data on human activities and tick encounters (Tick Diaries), a survey to enter the details of tick encounters coupled with tick identification services provided by the research team (Report a Tick), and educational material. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we evaluated the enrollment strategy (passive vs active), the user profile, location, longitudinal use of its features, and users' feedback. Between May and September 2018, 1468 adult users enrolled in the app. The Tick App users were equally represented across genders and evenly distributed across age groups. Most users owned a pet (65.94%, 962/1459; P<.001), did frequent outdoor activities (recreational or peridomestic; 75.24%, 1094/1454; P<.001 and 64.58%, 941/1457; P<.001, respectively), and lived in the Midwest (56.55%, 824/1457) and Northeast (33.0%, 481/1457) regions in the United States, more specifically in Wisconsin, southern New York, and New Jersey. Users lived more frequently in high-incidence counties for Lyme disease (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.8-7.2; P<.001) and in counties with cases recently increasing (IRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2; P=.03). Recurring users (49.25%, 723/1468) had a similar demographic profile to all users but participated in outdoor activities more frequently (80.5%, 575/714; P<.01). The number of Tick Diaries submitted per user (median 2, interquartile range [IQR] 1-11) was higher for older age groups (aged >55 years; IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.6; P<.001) and lower in the Northeast (IRR[NE] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7; P<.001), whereas the number of tick reports (median 1, IQR 1-2) increased with the frequency of outdoor activities (IRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8; P<.001). This assessment allowed us to identify what fraction of the population used The Tick App and how it was used during a pilot phase. This information will be used to improve future iterations of The Tick App and tailor potential tick prevention interventions to the users' characteristics."

TBRF shares symptoms with Lyme disease (LD) caused by related Lyme disease Borreliae (LDB). TBRF and LD are transmitted by ticks and occur in overlapping localities worldwide. Serological detection of antibodies used for laboratory confirmation of LD is not established for TBRF. A line immunoblot assay using recombinant proteins from different RFB species, termed TBRF IB, was developed and its diagnostic utility investigated. The TBRF IBs were able to differentiate between antibodies to RFB and LDB and had estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 70.5%, 99.5%, 97.3%, and 93.4%, respectively, based on results with reference sera from patients known to be positive and negative for TBRF. The use of TBRF IBs and analogous immunoblots for LD to test sera of patients from Australia, Ukraine, and the USA with LD symptoms revealed infection with TBRF alone, LD alone, and both TBRF and LD. Diagnosis by clinical criteria alone can, therefore, underestimate the incidence of TBRF. TBRF IBs will be useful for laboratory confirmation of TBRF and understanding its epidemiology worldwide."

		"abstract": "Zoonotic diseases represent a significant public health concern worldwide due to the emergence/re-emergence of vector-borne diseases in the last decade. Ticks are the most important vectors in the northern hemisphere and can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and spotted fever rickettsioses, among others. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop better and faster diagnostic tools that can detect zoonotic human pathogens in clinical samples. In this study, we present the results for a new kit tick-borne bacteria flow chip (TBFC), which allows the simultaneous screening of seven different bacterial pathogens in human samples using a DNA flow technology platform (hybriSpot system). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were calculated spiking bacterial DNA in human DNA samples, and the results were compared with an in-house single PCR-reverse line blot (RLB) routinely used for diagnosis at the National Center for Microbiology in Spain. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were almost identical to the PCR-RLBs used in diagnosis. In addition, samples from patients (n = 212) with a wide range of clinical signs/symptoms consistent with multisystem disorders suggestive of a tick-borne infection were tested using the TBFC, and the results were compared with those obtained by PCR-RLB. The concordance of both methods using patient samples was 97.2%. The TBFC kit is a rapid new and cost-efficient diagnostic molecular tool capable of detecting tick-borne pathogens in clinical samples."

		"abstract": "Exposure to blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis that transmit pathogens is thought to occur peri-domestically. However, the locations where people most frequently encounter infected ticks are not well characterized, leading to mixed messages from public health officials about where risk is highest. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on spatial risk factors for tick-borne disease and tick bites in eastern North America. We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95% CI 1.96 - 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95% CI 2.49 - 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95% CI 1.59 - 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health. The study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017079169 ."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infection common in Europe. In Finland, the LB seroprevalence in the healthy population was 3.9% in 2011. While the present-day seroprevalence of LB is well characterized in several European areas, there are no studies on the seroprevalence of LB before the description of the infection in the late 1970s. We used a subset of historical serum samples (n = 994) collected during the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Survey, a nationwide cross-sectional health survey of the 1960s and 1970s. All samples were screened with Borrelia burgdorferi whole-cell sonicate IgG ELISA. The seropositivity of the samples was further confirmed by the C6 peptide ELISA and recomBead IgG 2.0 bead immunoassay. The association of LB seropositivity with risk factors and with self-reported diseases and symptoms relating to disseminated LB were analysed by logistic regression. B. burgdorferi IgGs were detected in 199 of 994 analysed samples; hence, the overall seroprevalence was 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 17.6-22.6). The highest seroprevalence was observed in persons aged ≥50 years (165/696), in those currently not working (92/383), and in the regions of South and Central Finland (91/226 and 27/88, respectively). Further, perception of feeling unhealthy (129/197 versus 412/794) was higher among LB-seropositive individuals compared to LB-seronegative participants. LB seroprevalence was considerably higher in Finland in the late 1960s and early 1970s than in 2011. This result questions the perception of an unprecedentedly high LB seroprevalence in present-day Europe."

Previously identified B. burgdorferi proteins, lipid immunogens, and live mutants lead the design of canonical vaccines aimed at disrupting infection in the host. Discovery of the mechanism of action of the first vaccine catalyzed the development of new strategies to control Lyme disease that bypassed direct vaccination of the human host. Thus, novel prevention concepts center on proteins produced by B. burgdorferi during tick transit and on tick proteins that mediate feeding and pathogen transmission. A burgeoning area of research is tick immunity as it can unlock mechanistic pathways that could be targeted for disruption. Studies that shed light on the mammalian immune pathways engaged during tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection would further development of vaccination strategies against Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease results from infection of humans with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The first and most common clinical manifestation is the circular, inflamed skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans; later manifestations result from infections of other body sites. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease can be challenging in patients with erythema migrans because of the time delay in the development of specific diagnostic antibodies against Borrelia. Reliable blood biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with erythema migrans are needed. Here, we performed selected reaction monitoring, a targeted mass spectrometry-based approach, to measure selected proteins that (1) are known to be predominantly expressed in one organ (i.e., organ-specific blood proteins) and whose blood concentrations may change as a result of Lyme disease, or (2) are involved in acute immune responses. In a longitudinal cohort of 40 Lyme disease patients and 20 healthy controls, we identified 10 proteins with significantly altered serum levels in patients at the time of diagnosis, and we also developed a 10-protein panel identified through multivariate analysis. In an independent cohort of patients with erythema migrans, six of these proteins, APOA4, C9, CRP, CST6, PGLYRP2, and S100A9, were confirmed to show significantly altered serum levels in patients at time of presentation. Nine of the 10 proteins from the multivariate panel were also verified in the second cohort. These proteins, primarily innate immune response proteins or proteins specific to liver, skin, or white blood cells, may serve as candidate blood biomarkers requiring further validation to aid in the laboratory diagnosis of early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a common tick-borne disease in the northeastern and midwestern United States. School-aged children aged 5-15 years are at high risk for contracting Lyme disease. Many school campuses in the mid-Atlantic United States are in areas that are near, or border with, wooded habitat. We surveyed school administrators to determine the perception of risk of tick encounters and tick control methods implemented on school campuses in the mid-Atlantic. Responses from Pennsylvania and New Jersey districts indicate school district administrators had knowledge of Lyme disease and blacklegged ticks, but knowledge of other tick species and tick-borne diseases was limited. Overall, the results suggest that targeted communication of educational information regarding ticks and tick control to school districts could encourage increased participation in organized tick control or other preventative measures. Overall, respondents were aware of ticks and Lyme disease, but were not aware or had limited awareness of many other tick-borne diseases, and how tick bite risk could be reduced. Targeted communication of educational information regarding ticks and tick control to school districts could provide a framework for reducing tick-borne disease risk in mid-Atlantic school districts."

Studying the tropism of Borrelia in the host, how it is sequestered in different organs, and whether it is maintained in circulation and/or in the host's skin is important to understand pathogenicity, infectivity to vector ticks and reservoir competency.We evaluated tissue dissemination of Borrelia in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and great tits (Parus major), naturally and experimentally infected with Borrelia genospecies from enzootic foci. We collected both minimally invasive biological samples (feathers, skin biopsies and blood) and skin, joint, brain and visceral tissues from necropsied birds. Infectiousness of the host was evaluated through xenodiagnoses and infection rates in fed and moulted ticks. Skin biopsies were the most reliable method for assessing avian hosts' Borrelia infectiousness, which was supported by the agreement of infection status results obtained from the analysis of chin and lore skin samples from necropsied birds and of their xenodiagnostic ticks, including a significant correlation between the estimated concentration of Borrelia genome copies in the skin and the Borrelia infection rate in the xenodiagnostic ticks. This confirms a dermatropism of Borrelia garinii, B. valaisiana and B. turdi in its avian hosts. However, time elapsed from exposure to Borrelia and interaction between host species and Borrelia genospecies may affect the reliability of skin biopsies. The blood was not useful to assess infectiousness of birds, even during the period of expected maximum spirochetaemia. From the tissues sampled (foot joint, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, gut and brain), Borrelia was detected only in the gut, which could be related with infection mode, genospecies competition, genospecies-specific seasonality and/or excretion processes."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum are tick-borne infections transmitted by Ixodes scapularis in the eastern USA; both agents cause disease in dogs and people. To characterize changes in seroprevalence over time, Cochran Armitage trend tests were used to evaluate percent positive test results for antibodies to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. in approximately 20 million canine tests from 2010-2017 in 25 states and 905 counties in the eastern USA. A significant decreasing trend in seroprevalence to B. burgdorferi was evident in eight states along the mid-Atlantic coast from Virginia to New Hampshire, and in Wisconsin. In contrast, a continued increasing trend was evident in five northeastern and Midwestern states where Lyme borreliosis is endemic or emerging, as well as in three southern states where endemicity has not yet been widely established. Similarly, seroprevalence to Anaplasma spp. showed a significant, although smaller, decreasing trend in five states along the mid-Atlantic coast from Virginia to Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the Midwest; despite the fact that those trends were significant they were weak. However, a strong increasing trend was evident in Massachusetts and three states in northern New England as well as in Pennsylvania. As expected, seroprevalence continued to increase in regions where Lyme borreliosis and anaplasmosis are more newly endemic. However, the declining seroprevalence evident in other areas was not anticipated. Although the reasons for the decreasing trends are not clear, our finding may reflect shifting ecologic factors that have resulted in decreased infection risk or the combined positive influence of canine vaccination, tick control, and routine testing of dogs in regions where these infections have long been endemic. Analysis of trends in canine test results for tick-borne infections continues to be a valuable tool to understand relative geographical and temporal risk for these zoonotic agents."

We used national registers to identify all Danish residents diagnosed during 1986-2016 with LNB (n = 2067), created a gender- and age-matched comparison cohort from the general population (n = 20 670), and calculated risk estimates and hazard ratios. We observed no long-term increased risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron diseases, or epilepsy. However, within the first year, 8 (0.4%) of the LNB patients developed epilepsy, compared with 20 (0.1%) of the comparison cohort (difference, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, .02-.6%). In the LNB group, 11 (0.5%) patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome within the first year after LNB diagnosis, compared with 0 (0.0%) in the comparison cohort. After the first year, the risk of Guillain-Barré was not increased. LNB patients did not have increased long-term risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron diseases, epilepsy, or Guillain-Barré. Although the absolute risk is low, LNB patients might have an increased short-term risk of epilepsy and Guillain-Barré syndrome."

		"abstract": "Introduction: Despite advancements in diagnostic capabilities and the availability of effective antimicrobial agents, community-acquired infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are still associated with high mortality rates. Aim: To assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of community-acquired CNS infections treated in the West Pannonian region between 2010 and 2016. Method: Clinical data of 176 patients were retrospectively analysed in two age cohorts: 15 to 65 and more than 65 years of age. Results: Neuroinfections were found to be bacterial in 81, viral in 91, parasitic in 1 and mixed in 3 cases during the observation period. The most frequent bacterial pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%) and Borrelia burgdorferi (16%). The most frequent viral pathogens isolated were tick-borne encephalitis virus (37%), herpes simplex virus (10%) and enterovirus (7%). Aetiology was unknown in 40 percent of all cases. The average incidence rate was 9.8/100 000 person/year with a mortality rate of 12%. In the cohort of patients aged >65 years, significantly higher frequencies of immunocompromising factors, lower Glasgow Coma Scale values at admission and confusion were observed (p-values: 0.008, 0.017, and 0.050, respectively). Prognosis was negatively influenced by low Glasgow Coma Scale values at admission (OR = 1.6 CI95%: 1.3-1.9; p<0.001), old age (OR = 6.5 CI95%: 2.5-17.1; p<0.001) and immunodeficiency (OR = 3.1 CI95%: 1.2-8.1; p = 0.019). Conclusions:S. pneumoniae remains the most frequently observed causative bacterial pathogen associated with community-acquired CNS infections. Incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in our county is higher than the national average (2.3 versus 0.35/100 000 person/year). Orv Hetil. 2019; 160(40): 1574-1583."

		"abstract": "Multistrain microbial pathogens often induce strain-specific antibody responses in their vertebrate hosts. Mothers can transmit antibodies to their offspring, which can provide short-term, strain-specific protection against infection. Few experimental studies have investigated this phenomenon for multiple strains of zoonotic pathogens occurring in wildlife reservoir hosts. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii causes Lyme disease in Europe and consists of multiple strains that cycle between the tick vector (Ixodes ricinus) and vertebrate hosts, such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). We used a controlled experiment to show that female bank voles infected with B. afzelii via tick bite transmit protective antibodies to their offspring. To test the specificity of protection, the offspring were challenged using a natural tick bite challenge with either the maternal strain to which the mothers had been exposed or a different strain. The maternal antibodies protected the offspring against a homologous infectious challenge but not against a heterologous infectious challenge. The offspring from the uninfected control mothers were equally susceptible to both strains. Borrelia outer surface protein C (OspC) is an antigen that is known to induce strain-specific immunity. Maternal antibodies in the offspring reacted more strongly with homologous than with heterologous recombinant OspC, but other antigens may also mediate strain-specific immunity. Our study shows that maternal antibodies provide strain-specific protection against B. afzelii in an ecologically important rodent reservoir host. The transmission of maternal antibodies may have important consequences for the epidemiology of multistrain pathogens in nature.IMPORTANCE Many microbial pathogen populations consist of multiple strains that induce strain-specific antibody responses in their vertebrate hosts. Females can transmit these antibodies to their offspring, thereby providing them with short-term strain-specific protection against microbial pathogens. We investigated this phenomenon using multiple strains of the tick-borne microbial pathogen Borrelia afzelii and its natural rodent reservoir host, the bank vole, as a model system. We found that female bank voles infected with B. afzelii transmitted to their offspring maternal antibodies that provided highly efficient but strain-specific protection against a natural tick bite challenge. The transgenerational transfer of antibodies could be a mechanism that maintains the high strain diversity of this tick-borne pathogen in nature."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne infections-including tick-borne encephalitis viruses, represented in the United States by rare infections with Powassan and deer tick viruses, and more often Lyme disease-are of increasing importance to neurologists. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) causes all or part of a triad including meningitis, radiculoneuritis, and cranial neuritis. Rarely, parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement occur, with focal findings on examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LNB diagnosis requires plausible exposure, objective evidence of nervous system involvement, and, generally, positive two-tier serology. Central nervous system (CNS) LNB is almost always accompanied by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cells, protein), often with intrathecal antibody production, which is determined by concentration-adjusted comparison of serum and CSF antibody. Measuring CSF antibody in isolation and nucleic acid-based testing of CSF are not useful in LNB and should be avoided. LNB treatment is highly effective with a 2- to 3-week course of antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that LNB not involving the CNS parenchyma can be treated successfully with oral doxycycline."

To date there has been limited active tick surveillance in the region. To estimate both the distribution and density of Ixodes scapularis ticks in the city of Ottawa, and the infection rates of ticks with Borrelia burgdorferi (that causes Lyme disease) and other tick-borne pathogens. Between June and October 2017, tick surveillance was conducted by drag sampling at 23 sites in Ottawa municipal parks, recreational trails and forests. Blacklegged ticks were tested for B. burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum using quantitative polymerase chain reaction protocols. I. scapularis ticks were found in 16 of the 23 sites (70%). Recreational trails, conservation areas/forests and the provincial park within the city of Ottawa had significantly higher tick densities than municipal parks (p<0.01). Of the 194 adult and 26 nymphal I. scapularis tested, prevalence of infection was 29.5% for B. burgdorferi, 0.45% for B. miyamotoi and 0.91% for A. phagocytophilum. Almost 30% of I. scapularis ticks tested in suburban and rural areas of the city of Ottawa were infected with B. burgdorferi, known to cause Lyme disease. Other types of infection, known to cause anaplasmosis and tick-borne relapsing fever, were also detected, although were very rare. Conducting active tick surveillance at the local level may help to inform risk assessment and public health actions."

The number of cases reported in 2017 by PHU of residence, month of occurrence, age and sex was compared to the 5-year averages for the period 2012-2016. There were 959 probable and confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported in Ontario in 2017. This was three times higher than the 5-year (2012-2016) average of 313. The provincial incidence rate for 2017 was 6.7 cases per 100,000 population, although this varied markedly by PHU. The highest incidence rates were found in Leeds-Grenville and Lanark District (128.8 cases per 100,000), Kingston-Frontenac, Lennox and Addington (87.2 cases per 100,000), Hastings and Prince Edward Counties (28.6 cases per 100,000), Ottawa (18.1 cases per 100,000) and Eastern Ontario (13.5 cases per 100,000). Cases occurred mostly from June through September, were most common among males, and those aged 5-14 and 50-69 years. In 2017, Lyme disease incidence showed a marked increase in Ontario, especially in the eastern part of the province. If current weather and climate trends continue, blacklegged ticks carrying tick-borne pathogens, such as those causing Lyme disease, will continue to spread into suitable habitat. Monitoring the extent of this geographic spread will inform future clinical and public health actions to detect and mitigate the impact of Lyme disease in Ontario."

The serological study included 164 foresters and farmers with a history of tick bite. The molecular study included 540 patients, hospitalized because of various symptoms after tick bite. The control group consisted of 20 honorary blood donors. Anti-Coxiella burnetii antibodies titers were determined by Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Phase 1 IgG ELISA (DRG International Inc. USA). PCR was performed to detect DNA of C. burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in six foresters (7.3%). All foresters with the anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and anti-TBE (tick-borne encephalitis). Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in five farmers (6%). Four farmers with anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and two with anti-TBE. Among them one was co-infected with B. burgdorferi and TBEV. Correlations between anti-C. burnetii IgG and anti-B. burgdorferi IgG presence and between anti-C. burnetii IgG presence and symptoms of Lyme disease were observed. C. burnetii DNA was not detected in any of the 540 (0%) patients. C. burnetii is rarely transmitted by ticks, but we proved that it is present in the environment, so it may be a danger to humans. The most common co-occurrence after tick bite concerns C. burnetii and B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases have doubled in the last 12 years, and their geographic distribution has spread as well. The clinical spectrum of tick-borne diseases can range from asymptomatic to fatal infections, with a disproportionate incidence in children and the elderly. In the last few years, new agents have been discovered, and genetic changes have helped in the spread of pathogens and ticks. Polymicrobial infections, mostly in Ixodes scapularis, can complicate diagnostics and augment disease severity. Amblyomma americanum ticks have expanded their range, resulting in a dynamic and complex situation, possibly fueled by climate change. To document these changes, using molecular biology strategies for pathogen detection, an assessment of 12 microbes (9 pathogens and 3 symbionts) in three species of ticks was done in Suffolk County, New York. At least one agent was detected in 63% of I. scapularis ticksBorrelia burgdorferi was the most prevalent pathogen (57% in adults; 27% in nymphs), followed by Babesia microti (14% in adults; 15% in nymphs), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (14% in adults; 2% in nymphs), Borrelia miyamotoi (3% in adults), and Powassan virus (2% in adults). Polymicrobial infections were detected in 22% of I. scapularis ticks, with coinfections of B. burgdorferi and B. microti (9%) and of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum (7%). Three Ehrlichia species were detected in 4% of A. americanum ticks. The rickettsiae constituted the largest prokaryotic biomass of all the ticks tested and included Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia buchneri, and Rickettsia montanensis The high rates of polymicrobial infection in ticks present an opportunity to study the biological interrelationships of pathogens and their vectors.IMPORTANCE Tick-borne diseases have increased in prevalence in the United States and abroad. The reasons for these increases are multifactorial, but climate change is likely to be a major factor. One of the main features of the increase is the geographic expansion of tick vectors, notably Amblyomma americanum, which has brought new pathogens to new areas. The clinical spectrum of tick-borne diseases can range from asymptomatic to fatal infections, with a disproportionate incidence in children and the elderly. In addition, new pathogens that are cotransmitted by Ixodes scapularis have been discovered and have led to difficult diagnoses and to disease severity. Of these, Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, continues to be the most frequently transmitted pathogen. However, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi (another spirochete), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Powassan virus are frequent cotransmitted agents. Polymicrobial infection has important consequences for the diagnosis and management of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The density of questing ticks infected with tick-borne pathogens is an important parameter that determines tick-borne disease risk. An important factor determining this density is the availability of different wildlife species as hosts for ticks and their pathogens. Here, we investigated how wildlife communities contribute to tick-borne disease risk. The density of Ixodes ricinus nymphs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum among 19 forest sites were correlated to the encounter probability of different vertebrate hosts, determined by encounter rates as measured by (camera) trapping and mathematical modeling. We found that the density of any tick life stage was proportional to the encounter probability of ungulates. Moreover, the density of nymphs decreased with the encounter probability of hare, rabbit and red fox. The density of nymphs infected with the transovarially-transmitted B. miyamotoi increased with the density of questing nymphs and the encounter probability of bank vole. The density of nymphs infected with all other pathogens increased with the encounter probability of competent hosts: bank vole for Borrelia afzelii and N. mikurensis, ungulates for A. phagocytophilum and blackbird for Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana. The negative relationship we found was a decrease in the density of nymphs infected with B. garinii and B. valaisiana with the encounter probability of wood mouse. Only a few animal species drive the densities of infected nymphs in forested areas. There, foxes and leporids have negative effects on tick abundance, and consequently on the density of infected nymphs. The abundance of competent hosts generally drives the abundances of their tick-borne pathogen. A dilution effect was only observed for bird-associated Lyme spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Tickborne diseases (TBDs) such as Lyme disease (LD), babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever cause substantial morbidity and even mortality in the USA. Data indicate that Hispanic populations may be at greater risk for occupational exposure to ticks and disseminated LD; however, information on knowledge and practices of Hispanic populations regarding TBDs is limited. We surveyed 153 Hispanic and 153 non-Hispanic residents of Maryland and Virginia to assess awareness of TBDs, prevention practices and risk of tick encounters. Hispanic respondents were less likely than non-Hispanics to report familiarity with LD symptoms (21% vs. 53%, p < 0.001) and correctly identify ticks as vectors of LD (40% vs. 85%, p < 0.001). Although there was no significant difference in overall proportion of respondents who routinely take one or more preventive measures to prevent tick bites (59% vs. 61%, p = 0.65), Hispanics were more likely to report showering after coming indoors (36% vs. 25%, p = 0.04) but less likely to conduct daily tick checks compared with non-Hispanics (17% vs. 35%, p < 0.001). History of tick bite or finding a tick crawling on oneself or a household member in the past year did not significantly differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanics (19% vs. 24%, p = 0.26). Notably, after controlling for Hispanic/non-Hispanic ethnicity, primary language (English vs. Spanish) was a significant predictor of whether an individual had knowledge of LD symptoms, correctly identified ticks as vectors for LD and performed daily tick checks. These results provide guidance for future development of more targeted and effective TBD prevention education for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic communities."

		"abstract": "Land use and forest fragmentation are thought to be major drivers of Lyme disease incidence and its geographic distribution. We examined the association between landscape composition and configuration and Lyme disease in a population-based case control study in the Geisinger health system in Pennsylvania. Lyme disease cases (n = 9657) were identified using a combination of diagnosis codes, laboratory codes, and antibiotic orders from electronic health records (EHRs). Controls (5:1) were randomly selected and frequency matched on year, age, and sex. We measured six landscape variables based on prior literature, derived from the National Land Cover Database and MODIS satellite imagery: greenness (normalized difference vegetation index), percent forest, percent herbaceous, forest edge density, percent forest-herbaceous edge, and mean forest patch size. We assigned landscape variables within two spatial contexts (community and ½-mile [805 m] Euclidian residential buffer). In models stratified by community type, landscape variables were modeled as tertiles and flexible splines and associations were adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. In general, we observed positive associations between landscape metrics and Lyme disease, except for percent herbaceous, where associations differed by community type. For example, compared to the lowest tertile, individuals with highest tertile of greenness in residential buffers had higher odds of Lyme disease (odds ratio: 95% confidence interval [CI]) in townships (1.73: 1.55, 1.93), boroughs (1.70: 1.40, 2.07), and cities (3.71: 1.74, 7.92). Similarly, corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) for forest edge density were 1.34 (1.22, 1.47), 1.56 (1.33, 1.82), and 1.90 (1.13, 3.18). Associations were generally higher in residential buffers, compared to community, and in cities, compared to boroughs or townships. Our results reinforce the importance of peridomestic landscape in Lyme disease risk, particularly measures that reflect human interaction with tick habitat. Linkage of EHR data to public data on residential and community context may lead to new health system-based approaches for improving Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), characterized by recurring febrile episodes, is globally distributed and among the most common bacterial infections in some African countries. Despite the public health concern that this disease represents, little is known regarding the virulence determinants required by TBRF Borrelia during infection. Because the chromosomes of TBRF Borrelia show extensive colinearity with those of Lyme disease (LD) Borrelia, the exceptions represent unique genes encoding proteins that are potentially essential to the disparate enzootic cycles of these two groups of spirochetes. One such exception is a gene encoding an HtrA family protease, BtpA, that is present in TBRF Borrelia, but not in LD spirochetes. Previous work suggested that btpA orthologs may be important for resistance to stresses faced during mammalian infection. Herein, proteomic analyses of the TBRF spirochete, Borrelia turicatae, demonstrated that BtpA, as well as proteins encoded by adjacent genes in the B. turicatae genome, were produced in response to culture at mammalian body temperature, suggesting a role in mammalian infection. Further, transcriptional analyses revealed that btpA was expressed with the genes immediately upstream and downstream as part of an operon. To directly assess if btpA is involved in resistance to environmental stresses, btpA deletion mutants were generated. btpA mutants demonstrated no growth defect in response to heat shock, but were more sensitive to oxidative stress produced by t-butyl peroxide compared to wild-type B. turicatae. Finally, btpA mutants were fully infectious in a murine relapsing fever (RF) infection model. These results indicate that BtpA is either not required for mammalian infection, or that compensatory mechanisms exist in TBRF spirochetes to combat environmental stresses encountered during mammalian infection in the absence of BtpA."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Tick-borne diseases (T-BD) represent a potential health threat for outdoor workers in endemic areas, such as the Autonomous Province of Trento (APT). We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to assess T-BD knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices among APT farmers, specifically focusing on the use of protective habits and the uptake of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine.Methods: A convenience sample of 106 farmers (all males, mean age 47.3 ± 13.6 years) attending pesticide training courses (12/2016-03/2017) completed the anonymous survey. Binary regression analysis, calculations of multivariate odds ratios (mOR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and risk perceptions as predictors of preventive measures.Results: Though general understanding of T-BD was fairly low, the majority of the participants perceived TBE infection as a frequent (73.6%) and severe disease (61.3%). Overall, 43.3% of participants knew a TBE vaccine was available, and 24.5% had been vaccinated. Protective habits were reported by 53.8% of respondents, with self-checks for tick bites particularly low at 2.8% of participants. Better knowledge of T-BD and favorable attitudes toward vaccinations were associated with TBE immunization (mOR 4.708; 95%CI 1.273-17.409 and mOR 3.555; 95%CI 1.175-10.760, respectively), while previous history of tick bite and any interaction with T-BD significantly predicted adherence to protective measures (mOR 4.458; 95%CI 1.808-10.991, and mOR 9.433; 95%CI 1.127-78.973, respectively).Conclusions: Adherence to preventive measures (TBE vaccine) and protective habits was unsatisfactory in our sampled group, being a possible consequence of significant knowledge gaps. Public health communication on T-BD in farmers should, therefore, target understanding of health issues and appropriate preventive measures."

		"abstract": "As part of a TickNET collaboration we evaluated the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to tick-borne disease (TBD) prevention among persons living in endemic areas of Connecticut (CT) and Maryland (MD). Up-to-date information on the use of various prevention methods, as well as attitudes toward available and potential prevention options, is critical for effective promotion of recommended behaviors. During 2016-2017, printed invitations were mailed via the post office to 27,029 households requesting participation in an online survey regarding knowledge of TBD, risk perceptions, and prevention behaviors. Prevention behaviors included tick checks, showering/bathing, insect repellents, pet tick control, and chemical or natural pesticide use on residential properties. Associations of sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge and attitude variables with prevention behaviors were assessed in unadjusted analyses and multivariable models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Participants were also asked if they would be willing to get a Lyme disease (LD) vaccine, if one becomes available. Overall, 1883 (7%) persons completed the survey. Participants reported using preventive behaviors most of the time or always as follows: pet tick control (83%), tick checks (58%), showering/bathing (42%), insect repellent (31%), and chemical (23%) or natural (15%) pesticides on property. Self-rated knowledge of LD, perceived prevalence of LD, perceived severity of LD, and perceived likelihood of contracting LD or another TBD were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with performing a tick check [aOR 2.5, aOR 1.71, aOR 1.36, aOR 1.83, respectively]. Female gender and perceived prevalence of LD were significantly associated with applying insect repellent [aOR 1.56, aOR 1.64, respectively]. Perceived prevalence of LD was significantly associated with showering or bathing, insect repellents, and pet tick control [aOR 1.42, aOR 1.64, aOR 1.92, respectively]. Income > $100,000 was significantly associated with applying a chemical or natural pesticide to one's property [aOR 1.29, aOR 1.40, respectively]. A majority of respondents (84%) reported that they were very likely or somewhat likely to get a LD vaccine if one were available. Few behaviors (tick checks and pet tick control) were reported to be practiced by more than half of the respondents living in LD endemic areas. Perceived prevalence of LD was the only factor associated with performing most of the prevention behaviors (tick checks, showering/bathing, use of insect repellents, and pet tick control). Use of chemical or natural pesticides appears to be driven by income. Greater efforts are needed to encourage use of prevention behaviors in endemic areas, and this may be facilitated by increasing awareness of local prevalence."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species. Due to a variety of clinical manifestations, diagnosing LB can be challenging, and laboratory work-up is usually required in case of disseminated LB. However, the current standard of diagnostics is serology, which comes with several shortcomings. Antibody formation may be absent in the early phase of the disease, and once IgG-seroconversion has occurred, it can be difficult to distinguish between a past (cured or self-cleared) LB and an active infection. It has been postulated that novel cellular tests for LB may have both higher sensitivity earlier in the course of the disease, and may be able to discriminate between a past and active infection. VICTORY is a prospective two-gate case-control study. We strive to include 150 patients who meet the European case definitions for either localized or disseminated LB. In addition, we aim to include 225 healthy controls without current LB and 60 controls with potentially cross-reactive conditions. We will perform four different cellular tests in all of these participants, which will allow us to determine sensitivity and specificity. In LB patients, we will repeat cellular tests at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after start of antibiotic treatment to assess the usefulness as 'test-of-cure'. Furthermore, we will investigate the performance of the different cellular tests in a cohort of patients with persistent symptoms attributed to LB. This article describes the background and design of the VICTORY study protocol. The findings of our study will help to better appreciate the utility of cellular tests in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. NL7732 (Netherlands Trial Register, trialregister.nl)."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease of increasing global importance. There is scant information on Lyme disease patient demographics in England and Wales, and how they interact with the National Health Service (NHS). Our aims were to explore the demographic characteristics of Lyme disease patients within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW), and to describe patient pathways. Data from 1st January 1998 to 31st December 2015 was retrieved from the two administrative hospital datasets (HES and PEDW), based on patients coded with Lyme disease. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, home address and case management. Incidence rates were calculated, and demographics compared to the national population. Within HES and PEDW, 2361 patients were coded with Lyme disease. There was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in incidence from 0.08 cases/100,000 in 1998, to 0.53 cases/100,000 in 2015. There was a bimodal age distribution, patients were predominantly female, white and from areas of low deprivation. New cases peaked annually in August, with higher incidence rates in southern central and western England. Within hospital admission data (n = 2066), most cases were either referred from primary care (28.8%, n = 596) or admitted via accident and emergency (A&E) (29.5%, n = 610). This population entering secondary care through A&E suggest a poor understanding of the recommended care pathways for symptoms related to Lyme disease by the general population. These data can be used to inform future investigations into Lyme disease burden, and patient management within the NHS. They provide demographic information for clinicians to target public health messaging or interventions."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary Lyme disease vector in the eastern United States. Both immature stages of I. scapularis take blood meals from mice belonging to the genus Peromyscus. Mice are active during the night and spend the majority of diel periods in nests. Thus, immature I. scapularis have a greater opportunity to drop from Peromyscus hosts while in nests compared with the forest floor. Here, we collected 11 Peromyscus nests during a 3-mo period during which the immature I. scapularis are known to be active. We then examined nesting materials for the presence of I. scapularis. Immature I. scapularis were detected in 64% of Peromyscus nests examined. Additionally, 55% of the nests contained at least one Dermacentor variabilis Say larva. Eighty-seven percent of all larval ticks found within nests were blood-fed. Because Peromyscus spp. are highly competent reservoirs of numerous tick-borne pathogens, the ticks that detach in their nests may be important for the maintenance of tick-borne diseases. However, further studies are needed to determine the fate of the I. scapularis that detach in Peromyscus nests."

Laboratory diagnosis of LB is mainly based on the patients' medical history, clinical signs and symptoms in combination with detection of Borrelia-specific antibodies where indirect enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used technique. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivities and specificities) of serological tests that are currently in use for diagnosis of LB in clinical laboratories in Northern Europe, by use of a large serum panel. The panel consisted of 195 serum samples from well-characterized and classified patients under investigation for clinically suspected LB (n = 59) including patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, erythema migrans or other diseases (n = 112). A total of 201 serum samples from healthy blood donors were also included. The panel (396 serum samples altogether) was sent to 12 clinical laboratories (using five different ELISA methods) as blinded for group affiliation and the laboratories were asked to perform serological analysis according to their routine procedure. The results from the study demonstrated high diagnostic concordance between the laboratories using the same diagnostic assay and lower diagnostic concordance between laboratories using different diagnostic assays. For IgG, the results were in general rather homogenous and showed an average sensitivity of 88% (range 85-91%) compared to IgM which showed lower average sensitivity of 59% (range 50-67%) and more heterogeneous results between assays and laboratories."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the most common tick species parasitizing humans in Europe, and the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme disease in the continent. This tick species also harbors the endosymbiont Midichloria mitochondrii, and there is strong evidence that this bacterium is inoculated into the vertebrate host during the blood meal. A high proportion of tick bites remains unnoticed due to rarity of immediate symptoms, implying the risk of occult tick-borne infections in turn a potential risk factor for the onset of chronic-degenerative diseases. Since suitable tools to determine the previous exposure to I. ricinus bites are needed, this work investigated whether seropositivity toward a protein of M. mitochondrii (rFliD) could represent a marker for diagnosis of I. ricinus bite. We screened 274 sera collected from patients from several European countries, at different risk of tick bite, using an ELISA protocol. Our results show a clear trend indicating that positivity to rFliD is higher where the tick bite can be regarded as certain/almost certain, and lower where there is an uncertainty on the bite, with the highest positivity in Lyme patients (47.30%) and the lowest (2.00%) in negative controls. According to the obtained results, M. mitochondrii can be regarded as a useful source of antigens, with the potential to be used to assess the exposure to ticks harboring this bacterium. In prospect, additional antigens from M. mitochondrii and tick salivary glands should be investigated and incorporated in a multi-antigen test for tick bite diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) accounts for over 70% of tick-borne disease reported in the United States. The disease in humans is characterized by skin rash, arthritis, cardiac and neurological signs. Vaccination is the most efficient preventive measure that could be taken to reduce the incidence of the LD worldwide; however, at present no vaccine is available. In this study, evaluation of the Borrelia burgdorferi BB0172-derived peptide (PepB) in conjugated formulations was investigated as a vaccine candidate in murine model of LD. In brief, PepB was conjugated to the Cross-Reacting Material 197 (CRM197) and to Tetanus Toxoid heavy chain (TTHc) molecules, and subsequently used to immunize C3H/HeN mice. Following the challenge with 105 spirochetes/mouse via subcutaneous inoculation, TTHc:PepB construct showed protection in 66% of the immunized animals. Hence, to further evaluate the efficacy of TTHc:PepB, immunized mice were challenged with B. burgdorferi using the tick model of infection. The outcome of this experiment revealed that serum from TTHc:PepB immunized mice was borrelicidal. After tick infection, bacterial burden was significantly reduced (over 70%) in vaccinated animals when compared with the control groups regardless of whether the mice were infested 8 or 12-weeks post-priming. Therefore, we conclude that PepB conjugated antigens can serve as an alternative to prevent LD; nevertheless, further studies will be needed to dissect the mechanisms by which anti-PepB IgG antibodies are able to kill B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo to further advance in the development of formulations and delivery alternative to generate a safe anti-LD vaccine."

		"abstract": "In Poland, out of the 21 species of ticks described, two species have the greatest epidemiological significance: Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus. Their participation in the transmission of etiologic agents of vector diseases such as Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis and many others is widely known. Due to the often severe and sometimes fatal course of diseases transmitted by ticks, a great deal of emphasis is placed on prophylactic activities, minimizing the possibility of biting and transfering pathogens along with the arachnid saliva. In addition to means of personal protection, including appropriate clothing, protective vaccinations, avoiding tick habitats or body checking after returning from this type of places, one of the most important elements of anti-tick prevention is the use of effective repellents. The key role of using the repellent is to discourage the arthropod from attacking and to prevent it from taking food, as a result of which there is no phenomenon of transmission of pathogens from the hematophage to the host organism. The most commonly used substances with arthropod repellent properties are: N-N-diethylm-toluamide (DEET), 3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester (IR3535), icaridine, permethrin and essential oils. However, it should be remembered that no repellent ever protects 100% all the time after application - its use should be considered as one of many elements of personal protection in the prevention of tick bites."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) are the vector for pathogens that cause more cases of human disease than any other arthropod. Lyme disease is the most common, caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner) in the northeastern United States. Further knowledge of seasonal effects on survival is important for management and modeling of both blacklegged ticks and tick-borne diseases. The focus of our study was on the impact of environmental factors on overwintering success of nymphal blacklegged ticks. In a three-year field study conducted in Connecticut and Maine, we determined that ground-level conditions play an important role in unfed nymphal overwintering survival. Ticks in plots where leaf litter and snow accumulation were unmanipulated had significantly greater survival compared to those where leaf litter was removed (p = 0.045) and where both leaf litter and snow were removed (p = 0.008). Additionally, we determined that the key overwintering predictors for nymphal blacklegged tick survival were the mean and mean minimum temperatures within a year. The findings of this research can be utilized in both small- and large-scale management of blacklegged ticks to potentially reduce the risk and occurrence of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Although Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infection in the United States, diagnostic accuracy within community settings is not well characterized. A retrospective observational cohort study of patients referred to an academic center with a presumed diagnosis or concern for Lyme disease between 2000 and 2013 was performed to analyze diagnoses and treatments. Characteristics of those with Lyme disease and those misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease were compared. Of 1261 patients, 911 (72.2%) did not have Lyme disease, 184 (14.6%) had active or recent Lyme disease, 150 (11.9%) had a remote history of Lyme disease, and 16 (1.3%) were identified as having possible Lyme disease. Patients without current Lyme disease were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.45), to have had symptoms for >3 months (OR, 8.78; 95% CI, 5.87-13.1), to have higher symptom counts (OR per additional symptom, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), to have had more Lyme-related laboratory testing (OR per additional laboratory test, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32), and to have been diagnosed with what were regarded as coinfections (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14-8.57). Of the 911 patients without Lyme disease, 764 (83.9%) had received antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease or their coinfections. The percentage of patients established to have Lyme disease was lower than in earlier studies of referred populations. Among patients referred to an academic Infectious Diseases practice for Lyme disease, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment were common, both for Lyme disease and for coinfections."

However, the socio-demographics and geographic distribution of the population affected in England and Wales are poorly understood. Therefore, the proposed study was designed to describe the demographics and distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease from a national testing laboratory. An ecological study of routinely collected laboratory surveillance data. Public Health England's national Lyme disease testing laboratory. 3986 laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease between 2013 and 2016. In England and Wales, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed Lyme disease rose significantly over the study period from 1.62 cases per 100 000 in 2013 to 1.95 cases per 100 000 in 2016. There was a bimodal age distribution (with peaks at 6-10 and 61-65 years age bands) with a predominance of male patients. A significant clustering of areas with high Lyme disease incidence was located in southern England. An association was found between disease incidence and socioeconomic status, based on the patient's resident postcode, with more cases found in less deprived areas. Cases were disproportionately found in rural areas compared with the national population distribution. These results suggest that Lyme disease patients originate from areas with higher socioeconomic status and disproportionately in rural areas. Identification of the Lyme disease hotspots in southern England, alongside the socio-demographics described, will enable a targeted approach to public health interventions and messages."

To expand the knowledge base for this key species in life cycles of several pathogens, we assembled and scaffolded the P. leucopus genome. The resulting assembly was 2.45 Gb in total length, with 24 chromosome-length scaffolds harboring 97% of predicted genes. RNA sequencing following infection of P. leucopus with Borreliella burgdorferi, a Lyme disease agent, shows that, unlike blood, the skin is actively responding to the infection after several weeks. P. leucopus has a high level of segregating nucleotide variation, suggesting that natural resistance alleles to Crispr gene targeting constructs are likely segregating in wild populations. The reference genome will allow for experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanisms by which this widely distributed rodent serves as natural reservoir for several infectious diseases of public health importance, potentially enabling intervention strategies."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prominent tick-borne disease in the United States. Co-infections with the tick-transmitted pathogens Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto are becoming a serious health problem. B. burgdorferi is an extracellular spirochete that causes Lyme disease while B. microti is a protozoan that infects erythrocytes and causes babesiosis. Testing of donated blood for Babesia species is not currently mandatory due to unavailability of an FDA approved test. Transmission of this protozoan by blood transfusion often results in high morbidity and mortality in recipients. Infection of C3H/HeJ mice with B. burgdorferi and B. microti individually results in inflammatory Lyme disease and display of human babesiosis-like symptoms, respectively. Here we use this mouse model to provide a detailed investigation of the reciprocal influence of the two pathogens on each other during co-infection. We show that B. burgdorferi infection attenuates parasitemia in mice while B. microti subverts the splenic immune response, such that a marked decrease in splenic B and T cells, reduction in antibody levels and diminished functional humoral immunity, as determined by spirochete opsonophagocytosis, are observed in co-infected mice compared to only B. burgdorferi infected mice. Furthermore, immunosuppression by B. microti in co-infected mice showed an association with enhanced Lyme disease manifestations. This study demonstrates the effect of only simultaneous infection by B. burgdorferi and B. microti on each pathogen, immune response and on disease manifestations with respect to infection by the spirochete and the parasite. In our future studies, we will examine the overall effects of sequential infection by these pathogens on host immune responses and disease outcomes."

		"abstract": "There is a paucity of data on human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the western United States. This study reports prevalence of antibodies against three clinically important tick-borne pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Rickettsia spp.) among 249 people in five counties in northern California. Individuals from Humboldt County were recruited and answered a questionnaire to assess risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens. Samples from other counties were obtained from a blood bank and were anonymized. Seventeen (6.8%) samples were seropositive for antibodies against at least one pathogen: five for A. phagocytophilum, eight for B. burgdorferi, and four for Rickettsia spp. Women and people aged 26-35 had higher seroprevalence compared to other demographic groups. Santa Cruz County had no seropositive individuals, northern Central Valley counties had three seropositive individuals (all against A. phagocytophilum), and Humboldt County had 14 (all three pathogens), a significant, four-fold elevated risk of exposure. The Humboldt County questionnaire revealed that a bird feeder in the yard was statistically associated with exposure to ticks, and lifetime number of tick bites was associated with increasing age, time watching wildlife, and time hiking. Three-quarters of respondents were concerned about tick-associated disease, 81.0% reported experiencing tick bites, and 39.0% of those bitten reported a tick-borne disease symptom, including skin lesions (76.4%), muscle aches (49.1%), joint pain (25.5%), or fever (23.6%). Despite high levels of concern, many individuals who had been bitten by a tick were not tested for a tick-borne pathogen, including those with consistent symptoms. We highlight the need for further research and dissemination of information to residents and physicians in Northern California regarding tick-associated disease, so that appropriate medical attention can be rapidly sought and administered."

		"abstract": "Climate warming and other environmental changes have contributed to the expansion of the range of several tick species into higher latitudes in North America. As temperatures increase in Canada, the environment becomes more suitable for ticks and the season suitable for tick activity lengthens, so tick-borne diseases are likely to become more common in Canada. In addition to Lyme disease, four other tick-borne diseases (TBDs) have started to emerge and are likely to increase: Anaplasmosis; Babesiosis; Powassan virus; and Borrelia miyamotoi disease. Increased temperature increases the survival and activity period of ticks, increases the range of both reservoir and tick hosts (e.g. mice and deer) and increases the duration of the season when people may be exposed to ticks. Other ticks and TBDs may spread into Canada as the climate changes. The public health strategies to mitigate the impact of all TBDs include surveillance to detect current and emerging TBDs, and public health actions to prevent infections by modifying environmental and social-behavioral risk factors through increasing public awareness. Clinical care strategies include patient education, early detection, laboratory testing, and treatment."

		"abstract": "Global climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, is being particularly felt in Canada, with warming generally greater than in the rest of the world. Continued warming will be accompanied by changes in precipitation, which will vary across the country and seasons, and by increasing climate variability and extreme weather events. Climate change will likely drive the emergence of infectious diseases in Canada by northward spread from the United States and introduction from elsewhere in the world via air and sea transport. Diseases endemic to Canada are also likely to re-emerge. This special issue describes key infectious disease risks associated with climate change. These include emergence of tick-borne diseases in addition to Lyme disease, the possible introduction of exotic mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, more epidemics of Canada-endemic vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus, and increased incidence of foodborne illnesses. Risk is likely to be compounded by an aging population affected by chronic diseases, which results in greater sensitivity to infectious diseases. Identifying emerging disease risks is essential to assess our vulnerability, and a starting point to identify where public health effort is required to reduce the vulnerability and exposure of the Canadian population."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is caused by several Borrelia spp. (including Borrelia turicatae), which are primarily transmitted by Ornithodoros ticks. Relapsing fever group species are found worldwide, except for Antarctica. Approximately 500 human cases were reported between 1990 and 2011 in the United States (likely an underestimate), while cases in domestic and wild dogs were reported from Florida, Texas, and Washington. TBRF spirochetes are related to Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis. Dogs are routinely screened for B. burgdorferi, but it is unknown if infection with TBRF agents produces antibodies cross-reactive with B. burgdorferi assays. These data are critical for accurate surveillance of TBRF and Lyme borreliosis in dogs. In this study, B. burgdorferi-negative dogs were inoculated with B. turicatae, and seroconversion was confirmed by the rBipA (recombinant Borrelia immunogenic protein A) Western blot. Seropositive samples were tested with commercial and veterinary diagnostic laboratory B. burgdorferi-based tests. Borrelia turicatae-seroreactive samples cross-reacted with a whole-cell indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test and two multiantigen tests, but not with single-antigen tests using C6. Cross-reactivity with TBRF can confound epidemiology and surveillance efforts and confuse recommendations made by veterinarians for prevention and control. These findings demonstrate the need to critically evaluate results from B. burgdorferi diagnostic tests in the context of the assay type and the animal's geographical location and history of travel, as well as highlighting the need for commercially available specific diagnostic tests for TBRF spirochetes."

		"abstract": "While tick-borne zoonoses, such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, present an increasing global concern, knowledge of their vectors' distribution remains limited, especially for China. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive dataset of known tick species and their distributions in China, derived from peer-reviewed literature published between 1960 and 2017. We searched for journal articles, conference papers and degree thesis published in both English and Chinese, extracted geographic information associated with tick occurrence, and applied quality-control procedures to remove duplicates and ensure accuracy. The dataset contains 5731 records of geo-referenced occurrences for 123 tick species distributed over 1141 locations distinguished at four levels of scale i.e., provincial, prefectural, county, and township and finer. The most frequently reported tick species include Haemaphysalis longicornis, Dermacentor silvarum, Ixodes persulcatus, Haemaphysalis conicinna, Rhipicephalus microplus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. The geographical dataset provides an improved map of where ticks inhabit China and can be used for a variety of spatial analyses of ticks and the risk of zoonoses they transmit."

		"abstract": "Malaria and Lyme disease were the largest vector-borne epidemics in recent US history. Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease with intense transmission, had higher morbidity and mortality, whereas Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are more persistent in the environment. The responses to these two epidemics were markedly different. The anti-malaria campaign involved large-scale public works eradicating the disease within two decades. In contrast, Lyme disease control and prevention focused on the individual, advocating personal protection and backyard control, with the disease incidence steeply increasing since 1980s. Control of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases will require a paradigm shift emphasizing measures to reduce tick and host (deer) populations and a substantial R&D effort. These steps will require changing the political climate, perceptions and opinions to generate support among governmental levels and the general public. Such support is essential for providing a real solution to one of the most intractable contemporary public health problems."

		"abstract": "Debates over whether climate change could lead to the amplification of Lyme disease (LD) risk in the future have received much attention. Although recent large-scale disease mapping studies project an overall increase in Lyme disease risk as the climate warms, such conclusions are based on climate-driven models in which other drivers of change, such as land-use/cover and host population distribution, are less considered. The main objectives were to project the likely future ecological risk patterns of LD in Europe under different assumptions about future socioeconomic and climate conditions and to explore similarity and uncertainty in the projected risks. An integrative, spatially explicit modeling study of the ecological risk patterns of LD in Europe was conducted by applying recent advances in process-based modeling of tick-borne diseases, species distribution mapping, and scenarios of land-use/cover change. We drove the model with stakeholder-driven, integrated scenarios of plausible future socioeconomic and climate change [the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSPs) combined with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)]. The model projections suggest that future temperature increases may not always amplify LD risk: Low emissions scenarios (RCP2.6) combined with a sustainability socioeconomic scenario (SSP1) resulted in reduced LD risk. The greatest increase in risk was projected under intermediate (RCP4.5) rather than high-end (RCP8.5) climate change scenarios. Climate and land-use change were projected to have different roles in shaping the future regional dynamics of risk, with climate warming being likely to cause risk expansion in northern Europe and conversion of forest to agriculture being likely to limit risk in southern Europe. Projected regional differences in LD risk resulted from mixed effects of temperature, land use, and host distributions, suggesting region-specific and cross-sectoral foci for LD risk management policy. The integrated model provides an improved explanatory tool for the system mechanisms of LD pathogen transmission and how pathogen transmission could respond to combined socioeconomic and climate changes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4615."

Frequent presence in the habitats of ticks enhances the risk of tick bites and possible infection with Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. The aim of the study was to assess the risk of B. burgdorferi infection posed to hunters and other individuals exposed to activity-related contact with ticks. The study was carried out in the northern part of the Lublin Province (eastern Poland) and involved 150 individuals exposed to tick bites (110 hunters and 40 individuals exposed to activity-related contact with ticks). The analysis of sera for the presence of B. burgdorferi IgM and IgG antibodies was carried out. All 150 individuals were tested with the ELISA assay, and positive and borderline results of the assay were verified with the Western blot test. All study participants completed a questionnaire, which provided information about exposure to ticks, application of prophylactic measures, and awareness of Lyme borreliosis. The ELISA assay revealed a positive or borderline result in at least one of the classes of B. burgdorferi antibodies in 63.3% (95/150) of the individuals (IgM 14.0%, IgG 63.3%). Verification carried out with the Western blot test showed a positive or borderline result in at least one of the antibody classes in 38.0% (57/150) of the examined persons (IgM 2.7%, IgG 36.7%). Abdomen (56.0%) and legs (53.7%) were the most frequently bitten body regions. Tick bites on the abdomen were significantly more frequently declared by hunters. Inspection of the body after returning from natural areas was more popular prophylactic method than use of repellents. Inspection of the body was significantly more often used in the group of the hunters. The risk of B. burgdorferi infection among hunters and other individuals undertaking activities associated with exposure to tick bites in the study area is high."

This study examined patterns of infection with A. phagocytophilum in two tick vectors compared with the better studied TBEV and B. burgdorferi.Materials: Ticks were collected in three different ecosystems of the Western Ukraine during 2009-2014. Samples were examined for pathogen detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and logistic regression models were developed to assess the significance of different factors. Results: Among the three selected ecological systems of the Western region of Ukraine, 5130 ticks belonging to Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus were collected between 2009 and 2014. They were grouped into 366 pools and were tested by PCR for A. phagocytophilum. A subsample (1620 ticks, 162 pools) of the ticks was concurrently tested by PCR for A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi, and TBEV. Overall, there was no trend in the proportion of positive ticks across years (p > 0.05). However, the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was higher (27.4%) in I. ricinus than in D. reticulatus (15.9%) (OR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.52-4.94 (Lower, Upper 95% CI)). Infection was more common in forested habitats (OR = 1.89; 95% CI, 1.07-3.36) and during the later summer-early autumn (3.78; 95% CI, 1.79-8.06). B. burgdorferi was found in 29.3% and 31.9% of I. ricinus and D. reticulatus, respectively; and TBEV was found in 6.3% and 14.5% of I. ricinus and D. reticulatus. Coinfection of A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi occurred more often than chance and was more frequent than any other combination of pathogens (p = 0.031). Conclusions: Our study is the first to explore the potential relationship between the ecosystems, vectors, and the presence of Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis (HGA) and other tick-borne infections in Western Ukraine. Anaplasma demonstrated a greater prevalence in I. ricinus in the forested area in Western Ukraine. Altogether, HGA, LD, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) pathogens are actively circulating in these ecosystems and have the potential to coinfect vectors that might increase the risk of transmitting multiple pathogens to humans during host feeding by individual ticks."

		"abstract": "Epidemiological evidence for tick-borne infections, particularly those related to Lyme borreliosis, is heterogeneous. Lyme borreliosis is a tick-born zoonosis transmitted by ticks of the genus Ixodes ricinus. After tick bite, the risk of transmission of an infectious agent remains low, most often represented by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato; co-infections in Humans by several different infectious agents (bacterial, viral or parasitic) are possible but a priori rare. In addition, besides well-known tick-borne pathogens, new species or gender of micro-organisms are regularly described in ticks but their pathogenicity in human pathology is not described or not yet established. The clinical presentation of Lyme borreliosis is varied, with localized and disseminated forms occurring long ago after tick bite, making diagnosis sometimes difficult. The natural course of Lyme borreliosis is insufficiently known because of recommendations of antibiotherapy in case of illness; however, some historical studies seem reassuring with possible spontaneous healing and seemingly minor sequelae. The diagnosis of disseminated forms requires paraclinical examinations, in first place serology, whose sensitivity increases with time of evolution of borreliosis; this is all the more interesting as the disseminated forms are of more difficult clinical diagnosis. After antibiotherapy, the clinical course is good, the sequelae remain possible especially in case of late diagnosis or late disseminated form; however, their frequency remains unknown."

Over time, a typical Borreliosis skin reaction takes shape, i.e. the formation of an annular erythema that tends to expand centrifugally with erythematous edges whose diameter can reach up to 20 cm. The symptoms of Lyme disease are not only cutaneous but there may be a systemic involvement. Obviously, this disease can also affect pregnant women and for this reason this review aims to summarize the main ways of treatment to avoid worsening of the clinical condition in the mother and an eventual, albeit rare, involvement of the fetus."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis - the most common tick-borne disease in Europe and the United States. Spirochetes are transmitted from infected Ixodes ticks to the mammalian host when the ticks feed. In general, the transfer process of the borreliae is quite complicated, as the environments in the tick and the new mammalian host differs significantly. Therefore, Borrelia changes the expression profile of dozens of proteins, mainly outer surface proteins, to adapt to the new tasks and needs in the new organism. In the transfer process from the tick to the mammalian host, spirochetes that cause Lyme disease show the strongest upregulation of members of paralogous gene family 54 (PFam54). PFam54 members encode 10 proteins, and BBA69 is one of its members. Although several PFam54 members play an important role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, the exact function has been determined only for CspA, which binds complement regulator factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1); thus, CspA is essential to resist the vertebrate host's immune response. In the current study, we determined the crystal structure of BBA69 at a 2.25 Ǻ resolution. The BBA69 structure revealed a seven α-helical BbCRASP-1 fold previously found only in PFam54 member proteins. Among the PFam54 members, BBA69 shares the highest sequence identity (61%) and 3-D similarity with CspA. Although none of the PFam54 members besides CspA bind CFH and FHL-1, in the current study, we investigated the structural differences accounting for the divergence in the functions of these proteins. The results clearly indicated that the C-terminal α-helix is the main determinant of this functional divergence. The results provide better insight into the PFam54 proteins that play an important role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a common tick-borne infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). B. burgdorferi s.s. may utilize chemotaxis, the directional migration towards or away from a chemical stimulus, for transmission, acquisition, and infection. However, the specific signals recognized by the spirochete for these events have not been defined. In this study, we identify an Ixodes scapularis salivary gland protein, Salp12, that is a chemoattractant for the spirochete. We demonstrate that Salp12 is expressed in the I. scapularis salivary glands and midgut and expression is not impacted by B. burgdorferi s.s. infection. Knockdown of Salp12 in the salivary glands or passive immunization against Salp12 reduces acquisition of the spirochete by ticks but acquisition is not completely prevented. Knockdown does not impact transmission of B. burgdorferi s.s. This work suggests a new role for chemotaxis in acquisition of the spirochete and suggests that recognition of Salp12 contributes to this phenomenon."

		"abstract": "Current treatment guidelines for European Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) recommend cephalosporins, penicillin or doxycycline for 14-28 days but evidence for optimal treatment length is poor. Treatment lengths in clinical practice tend to exceed the recommendations. Most patients experience a rapid improvement of symptoms and neurological findings within days of treatment, but some report long-term complaints. The underlying mechanisms of remaining complaints are debated, and theories as ongoing chronic infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, dysregulated immune responses, genetic predisposition, coinfection with multiple tick-borne pathogens, structural changes in CNS and personal traits have been suggested. The main purpose of our trial is to address the hypothesis of improved outcome after long-term antibiotic treatment of LNB, by comparing efficacy of treatment with 2 and 6 weeks courses of doxycycline. The trial has a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded design. One hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with LNB according to European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)guidelines will be randomised to 6 or 2 weeks treatment with oral doxycycline. The patients will be followed for 12 months. The primary endpoint is improvement on a composite clinical score (CCS) from baseline to 6 months after inclusion. Secondary endpoints are improvements in the CCS 12 months after inclusion, fatigue scored on Fatigue Severity Scale, subjective symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scale, health-related quality of life scored on RAND 36-item short form health survey and safety as measured by side effects of the two treatment arms. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are collected from inclusion and throughout the follow-up and a biobank will be established. The study started including patients in November 2015 and will continue throughout December 2019. The study is approved by the Norwegian regional committees for medical and health research ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Data from the study will be published in peer-reviewed medical journals. 2015-001481-25."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is responsible for the transmission of a variety of pathogens in North America, including Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti. Songbirds have previously been described as agents of tick dispersal, and a combination of empirical data and modeling efforts have implicated songbirds in the range expansion of I. scapularis northward into Canada during spring bird migration. The role of fall bird migration has received comparatively less attention, particularly at a continental scale. The aim of the current research was to use a novel individual-based modeling approach (IBM) to investigate the role of southward migrating songbirds in the dispersal of I. scapularis within the continental United States. The IBM used in this research explicitly models dispersal by two extensively studied migrating songbird species, wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina and ovenbird Seiurus aurocapillus. Our IBM predicts the annual dispersal of more than four million ticks by H. mustelina and S. aurocapillus, notably into areas as far west as the Dakotas, and as far south as Central Alabama. Predicted dispersal locations include areas where the southern phenotype of I. scapularis dominates, suggestive of a possible mechanism for previously described unidirectional gene flow from north to south. In addition, the model demonstrates that three species-specific songbird traits - breeding range, migration timing, and propensity for tick attachment - each play a major role in the relative magnitude of tick dispersal by different songbird species. The pattern of I. scapularis dispersal predicted by this model suggests that migrating songbirds may have contributed to the range expansion of the tick historically, and may continue to do so presently and into the future, particularly as climate changes the geographic areas that are suitable for I. scapularis. Ultimately, widespread tick dispersal by migrating songbirds likely increases the human risk of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases in the United States."

		"abstract": "Ticks are vectors of several pathogens that can be transmitted to humans and their geographic ranges are expanding. The exposure of ticks to new hosts in a rapidly changing environment is likely to further increase the prevalence and diversity of tick-borne diseases. Although ticks are known to transmit bacteria and viruses, most studies of tick-borne disease have focused upon Lyme disease, which is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. Until recently, ticks were considered as the vectors of a few viruses that can infect humans and animals, such as Powassan, Tick-Borne Encephalitis and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses. Interestingly, however, several new studies undertaken to reveal the etiology of unknown human febrile illnesses, or to describe the virome of ticks collected in different countries, have uncovered a plethora of novel viruses in ticks. Here, we compared the virome compositions of ticks from different countries and our analysis indicates that the global tick virome is dominated by RNA viruses. Comparative phylogenetic analyses of tick viruses from these different countries reveals distinct geographical clustering of the new tick viruses. Some of these new tick RNA viruses (notably severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus and Heartland virus) were found to be associated with serious human diseases. Their relevance to public health remains unknown. It is plausible that most of these newly identified tick viruses are of endogenous origin or are restricted in their transmission potential, but the efforts to identify new tick viruses should continue. Indeed, future research aimed at defining the origin, the ecology and the spillover potential of this novel viral biodiversity will be critical to understand the relevance to public health."

How selenoproteins are activated upon tick-borne pathogen infection is yet to be defined. To examine the functional role of selenoprotein K in Borrelia burgdorferi infection within the tick host Ixodes scapularis, RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing was performed. Selenoprotein K is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein and a component of the ERAD complex involved in ER homeostasis. A qRT-PCR assay revealed the significant upregulation of selenogene K (selenoK) expression in B. burgdorferi-infected tick tissues. Silencing of the selenoK transcript significantly depleted B. burgdorferi copies within the infected tick tissues. Upon selenoK knockdown, another component of the ERAD complex, selenoprotein S (selenoS), was significantly upregulated, suggesting a compensatory mechanism to maintain ER homeostasis within the tick tissues. Knockdown of selenoK also upregulated ER stress-related unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway components, ATF6 and EIF2. The exact mechanisms that contribute to depletion of B. burgdorferi upon selenoK knockdown is yet to be determined, but this study suggests that selenoK may play a vital role in the survival of B. burgdorferi within the tick host."

		"abstract": "The serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on a two-tier strategy: a screening test using an immunoenzymatic technique (ELISA), followed if positive by a confirmatory test with a western blot technique for its better specificity. Lyme serology has poor sensitivity (30-40%) for erythema migrans and should not be performed. The seroconversion occurs after approximately 6 weeks, with IgG detection (sensitivity and specificity both>90%). Serological follow-up is not recommended as therapeutic success is defined by clinical criteria only. For neuroborreliosis, it is recommended to simultaneously perform ELISA tests in samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid to test for intrathecal synthesis of Lyme antibodies. Given the continuum between early localized and disseminated borreliosis, and the efficacy of doxycycline for the treatment of neuroborreliosis, doxycycline is preferred as the first-line regimen of erythema migrans (duration, 14 days; alternative: amoxicillin) and neuroborreliosis (duration, 14 days if early, 21 days if late; alternative: ceftriaxone). Treatment of articular manifestations of Lyme borreliosis is based on doxycycline, ceftriaxone, or amoxicillin for 28 days. Patients with persistent symptoms after appropriate treatment of Lyme borreliosis should not be prescribed repeated or prolonged antibacterial treatment. Some patients present with persistent and pleomorphic symptoms after documented or suspected Lyme borreliosis. Another condition is eventually diagnosed in 80% of them."

		"abstract": "The emergence and spread of Lyme disease and other infections associated with black-legged ticks is causing a public health crisis. No human vaccines are currently available, and both diagnosis and treatment are sometimes ineffectual, leading to advocacy for self-directed preventative measures. These recommendations are widely communicated to the public, but there is limited evidence for their efficacy. We undertook a systematic review and mixed-effects meta-regression analysis of factors purported to increase or decrease risk of black-legged tick bites and tick-borne disease. Published articles used in the study spanned the years 1984-2018. Variables associated with increased probability of tick-borne disease, with odds ratios significantly greater than 1, included deer abundance, high density of nymph-stage black-legged ticks, landscapes with interspersed herbaceous and forested habitat, low human population density, gardens, cat ownership, and race. Contrary to recommendations, use of landscape-related tick control measures, such as clearing brush, trimming branches, and having a dry barrier between lawn and woods, tended to increase risk. Pet ownership increased bite risk. Bite risk was highest for children aged 5 years or less, with a secondary peak in persons aged 50-70 years. Although some widely disseminated recommendations are supported by the research analyzed, others require further evaluation. Additional research is also needed to understand the mechanisms underlying significant relationships."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Borrelia) species, is the most common tick-borne infection in the northern hemisphere. LB diagnostics is based on clinical evaluation of the patient and on laboratory testing, where the main method is the detection of Borrelia specific antibodies in patient samples. There are, however, shortcomings in the current serology based LB diagnostics, especially its inability to differentiate ongoing infection from a previously treated one. Identification of specific biomarkers of diseases is a growing application of metabolomics. One of the main methods of metabolomics is nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In the present study, our aim was to analyze whether Borrelia growth in vitro and infection in vivo in mice causes specific metabolite differences, and whether NMR can be used to detect them. For this purpose, we performed NMR analyses of in vitro culture medium samples, and of serum and urine samples of Borrelia infected and control mice. The results show, that there were significant differences in the concentrations of several amino acids, energy metabolites and aromatic compounds between Borrelia culture and control media, and between infected and control mouse serum and urine samples. For example, the concentration of L-phenylalanine increases in the Borrelia growth medium and in serum of infected mice, whereas the concentrations of allantoin and trigonelline decrease in the urine of infected mice. Therefore, we conclude that Borrelia infection causes measurable metabolome differences in vitro and in Borrelia infected mouse serum and urine samples, and that these can be detected with NMR."

		"abstract": "There are more than 500,000 employees in Germany alone who are at risk of being bitten by a tick at their workplace and thus also at risk of being infected with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. or the tick-borne meningoencephalitis virus. So far, there are only a small number of studies on the risk of tick bites in Central Europe, in particular, for military personnel during relevant training activities. During a total of 36 months of training in 2008/2009 and from 2012 to 2014, the number of tick bites and any resulting diseases of 1156 recruits under comparable conditions of exposure and prevention were documented based on their medical records. The incidence of tick bites was calculated with each recruit's individual exposure time for field training. There were a total of 66 tick bites during an exposure time of 317,059 h of field training (0.21 tick bites per 1000 h of training). The risk of tick bites was found to have a seasonal dependency. In 6 out of the 66 cases in which someone was bitten, the patients consulted a physician for a follow-up examination, and in one of these cases the bite resulted in an infection requiring treatment. It turns out that there is a rather low but relevant risk of being exposed to tick bites for military personnel during their field training. Under the given study conditions, months with a high risk of tick bites can be distinguished from months with a low risk of tick bites, which is of vital importance, in particular, for guidance and prevention."

		"abstract": "Many vector-borne diseases are transmitted through complex pathogen-vector-host networks, which makes it challenging to identify the role of specific host groups in disease emergence. Lyme borreliosis in humans is now the most common vector-borne zoonosis in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease is caused by multiple genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria transmitted by ixodid (hard) ticks, and the major host groups transmit Borrelia genospecies with different pathogenicity, causing variable clinical symptoms in humans. The health impact of a given host group is a function of the number of ticks it infects as well as the pathogenicity of the genospecies it carries. Borrelia afzelii, with mainly small mammals as reservoirs, is the most common pathogen causing Lyme borreliosis, and it is often responsible for the largest proportion of infected host-seeking tick nymphs in Europe. The bird-borne Borrelia garinii, though less prevalent in nymphal ticks, is more likely to cause Lyme neuroborreliosis, but whether B. garinii causes disseminated disease more frequently has not been documented. Based on extensive data of annual disease incidence across Norway from 1995 to 2017, we show here that 69% of disseminated Lyme borreliosis cases were neuroborreliosis, which is three times higher than predicted from the infection prevalence of B. garinii in host-seeking ticks (21%). The population estimate of migratory birds, mainly of thrushes, explained part of the annual variation in cases of neuroborreliosis, with a one-year time lag. We highlight the important role of the genospecies' pathogenicity and the host associations for understanding the epidemiology of disseminated Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, initially described as Lyme arthritis, was reported before nucleic-acid based detection technologies were available. The most widely used diagnostic tests for Lyme disease are based on the serologic detection of antibodies produced against antigens derived from a single strain of Borrelia burgdorferi. The poor diagnostic accuracy of serological tests early in the infection process has been noted most recently in the 2018 Report to Congress issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Tick-Borne Disease Working Group. Clinical Lyme disease may be caused by a diversity of borreliae, including those classified as relapsing fever species, in the United States and in Europe. It is widely accepted that antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease is most successful during this critical early stage of infection. While genomic sequencing is recognized as an irrefutable direct detection method for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, development of a molecular diagnostic tool for all clinical forms of borreliosis is challenging because a \"core genome\" shared by all pathogenic borreliae has not yet been identified. After a diligent search of the GenBank database, we identified two highly conserved segments of DNA sequence among the borrelial 16S rRNA genes. We further developed a pair of Borrelia genus-specific PCR primers for amplification of a segment of borrelial 16S rRNA gene as a \"core genome\" to be used as the template for routine Sanger sequencing-based metagenomic direct detection test. This study presented examples of base-calling DNA sequencing electropherograms routinely generated in a clinical diagnostic laboratory on DNA extracts of human blood specimens and ticks collected from human skin bites and from the environment. Since some of the tick samples tested were collected in Ireland, borrelial species or strains not known to exist in the United States were also detected by analysis of this 16S rRNA \"core genome\". We recommend that hospital laboratories located in Lyme disease endemic areas begin to use a \"core genome\" sequencing test to routinely diagnose spirochetemia caused by various species of borreliae for timely management of patients at the early stage of infection."

		"abstract": "Morgellons disease (MD) is a dermopathy that is associated with tick-borne illness. It is characterized by spontaneously developing skin lesions containing embedded or projecting filaments, and patients may also experience symptoms resembling those of Lyme disease (LD) including musculoskeletal, neurological and cardiovascular manifestations. Various species of Borrelia and co-infecting pathogens have been detected in body fluids and tissue specimens from MD patients. We sought to investigate the coexistence of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) in skin specimens from MD subjects, and to characterize their association with mixed amyloid biofilm development. Testing for Bb and Hp was performed on dermatological specimens from 14 MD patients using tissue culture, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and confocal microscopy. Markers for amyloid and biofilm formation were investigated using histochemical and IHC staining. Bb and Hp were detected in dermatological tissue taken from MD lesions. Bb and Hp tended to co-localize in foci within the epithelial tissue. Skin sections exhibiting foci of co-infecting Bb and Hp contained amyloid markers including β-amyloid protein, thioflavin and phosphorylated tau. The biofilm marker alginate was also found in the sections. Mixed Bb and Hp biofilms containing β-amyloid and phosphorylated tau may play a role in the evolution of MD."

		"abstract": "Most tickborne disease studies in the United States are conducted in low-intensity residential development and forested areas, leaving much unknown about urban infection risks. To understand Lyme disease risk in New York, New York, USA, we conducted tick surveys in 24 parks throughout all 5 boroughs and assessed how park connectivity and landscape composition contribute to Ixodes scapularis tick nymphal densities and Borrelia burgdorferi infection. We used circuit theory models to determine how parks differentially maintain landscape connectivity for white-tailed deer, the reproductive host for I. scapularis ticks. We found forested parks with vegetated buffers and increased connectivity had higher nymph densities, and the degree of park connectivity strongly determined B. burgdorferi nymphal infection prevalence. Our study challenges the perspective that tickborne disease risk is restricted to suburban and natural settings and emphasizes the need to understand how green space design affects vector and host communities in areas of emerging urban tickborne disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is transmitted en France by the tick Ixodes ricinus, endemic in metropolitan France. In the absence of vaccine licensed for use in humans, primary prevention mostly relies on mechanical protection (clothes covering most parts of the body) that may be completed by chemical protection (repulsives). Secondary prevention relies on early detection of ticks after exposure, and mechanical extraction. There is currently no situation in France when prophylactic antibiotics would be recommended. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis in France, estimated through a network of general practitioners (réseau Sentinelles), and nationwide coding system for hospital stays, has not significantly changed between 2009 and 2017, with a mean incidence estimated at 53 cases/100,000 inhabitants/year, leading to 1.3 hospital admission/100,000 inhabitants/year. Other tick-borne diseases are much more seldom in France: tick-borne encephalitis (around 20 cases/year), spotted-fever rickettsiosis (primarily mediterranean spotted fever, around 10 cases/year), tularemia (50-100 cases/year, of which 20% are transmitted by ticks), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (<10 cases/year), and babesiosis (<5 cases/year). The main circumstances of diagnosis for Lyme borreliosis are cutaneous manifestations (primarily erythema migrans, much more rarely borrelial lymphocytoma and atrophic chronic acrodermatitis), neurological (<15% of cases, mostly meningoradiculitis and cranial nerve palsy, especially facial nerve) and rheumatologic (mostly knee monoarthritis, with recurrences). Cardiac and ophtalmologic manifestations are very rarely encountered."

		"abstract": "Hematophagous arthropods are responsible for the transmission of a variety of pathogens that cause disease in humans and animals. Ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex are vectors for some of the most frequently occurring human tick-borne diseases, particularly Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The search for vaccines against these diseases is ongoing. Efforts during the last few decades have primarily focused on understanding the biology of the transmitted viruses, bacteria and protozoans, with the goal of identifying targets for intervention. Successful vaccines have been developed against TBEV and Lyme borreliosis, although the latter is no longer available for humans. More recently, the focus of intervention has shifted back to where it was initially being studied which is the vector. State of the art technologies are being used for the identification of potential vaccine candidates for anti-tick vaccines that could be used either in humans or animals. The study of the interrelationship between ticks and the pathogens they transmit, including mechanisms of acquisition, persistence and transmission have come to the fore, as this knowledge may lead to the identification of critical elements of the pathogens' life-cycle that could be targeted by vaccines. Here, we review the status of our current knowledge on the triangular relationships between ticks, the pathogens they carry and the mammalian hosts, as well as methods that are being used to identify anti-tick vaccine candidates that can prevent the transmission of tick-borne pathogens."

Recent recognition as a human pathogen has intensified research into its ecology and pathogenic potential.AimsWe aimed to provide a timely critical integrative evaluation of our knowledge on B. miyamotoi, to assess its public health relevance and guide future research.MethodsThis narrative review used peer-reviewed literature in English from January 1994 to December 2018.ResultsBorrelia miyamotoi occurs in the world's northern hemisphere where it co-circulates with B. burgdorferi sensu lato, which causes Lyme disease. The two borreliae have overlapping vertebrate and tick hosts. While ticks serve as vectors for both species, they are also reservoirs for B. miyamotoi. Three B. miyamotoi genotypes are described, but further diversity is being recognised. The lack of sufficient cultivable isolates and vertebrate models compromise investigation of human infection and its consequences. Our understanding mainly originates from limited case series. In these, human infections mostly present as influenza-like illness, with relapsing fever in sporadic cases and neurological disease reported in immunocompromised patients. Unspecific clinical presentation, also occasionally resulting from Lyme- or other co-infections, complicates diagnosis, likely contributing to under-reporting. Diagnostics mainly employ PCR and serology. Borrelia miyamotoi infections are treated with antimicrobials according to regimes used for Lyme disease.ConclusionsWith co-infection of tick-borne pathogens being commonplace, diagnostic improvements remain important. Developing in vivo models might allow more insight into human pathogenesis. Continued ecological and human case studies are key to better epidemiological understanding, guiding intervention strategies."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne disease is the result of spillover of pathogens into the human population. Traditionally, literature has focused on characterization of tick-borne disease pathogens and ticks in their sylvatic cycles. A limited amount of research has focused on human-tick exposure in this system, especially in the Northeastern United States. Human-tick interactions are crucial to consider when assessing the risk of tick-borne disease since a tick bite is required for spillover to occur. Citizen scientists collected ticks from the Northeastern US through a free nationwide program. Submitted ticks were identified to species, stage, and sex. Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and hard-tick relapsing fever Borrelia. Seasonality of exposure and the citizen science activity during tick exposure was recorded by the citizen scientist. A negative binomial model was fit to predict county level CDC Lyme disease cases in 2016 using citizen science Ixodes scapularis submissions, state, and county population as predictor variables. A total of 3740 submissions, comprising 4261 ticks, were submitted from the Northeastern US and were reported to be parasitizing humans. Of the three species submitted, blacklegged ticks were the most prevalent followed by American dog ticks and lone star ticks. Submissions peaked in May with the majority of exposure occurring during every-day activities. The most common pathogen in blacklegged ticks was B. burgdorferi s.l. followed by hard-tick relapsing fever Borrelia. Negative binomial model performance was best in New England states followed by Middle Atlantic states. Citizen science provides a low-cost and effective methodology for describing the seasonality and characteristics of human-tick exposure. In the Northeastern US, everyday activities were identified as a major mechanism for tick exposure, supporting the role of peri-domestic exposure in tick-borne disease. Citizen science provides a method for broad pathogen and tick surveillance, which is highly related to human disease, allowing for inferences to be made about the epidemiology of tick-borne disease."

The study objective was to assess incidence and patient characteristics of facial palsy due to LNB. Hospital records were reviewed of adult patients with facial palsy visiting the departments of neurology and/or otorhinolaryngology of Gelre hospitals between June 2007 and December 2017. Gelre hospitals are located in an area endemic for Lyme borreliosis. Patients with LNB had pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production or pleocytosis with positive IgG serology. Patients with IFP had negative serology. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with LNB and patients with IFP. Five hundred and fifty-nine patients presented with facial palsy, 4.7% (26) had LNB and 39.4% (220) IFP. The incidence of facial palsy due to LNB was 0.9/100 000 inhabitants/year. Over 70% of patients with facial palsy due to LNB did not report a recent tick bite and/or erythema migrans (EM). Patients with facial palsy due to LNB presented more often in July to September (69.2% vs. 21.9%, P &lt; 0.001), and had more often headache (42.3% vs. 15.5%, P &lt; 0.01). To reduce the risk of underdiagnosing LNB in an endemic area, we recommend testing for LNB in patients with facial palsy in summer months especially when presenting with headache, irrespective of a recent tick bite and/or EM."

		"abstract": "The study of polymorphic immune genes in host populations is critical for understanding genetic variation in susceptibility to pathogens. Controlled infection experiments are necessary to separate variation in the probability of exposure from genetic variation in susceptibility to infection, but such experiments are rare for wild vertebrate reservoir hosts and their zoonotic pathogens. The bank vole (Myodes glareolus) is an important reservoir host of Borrelia afzelii, a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Bank vole populations are polymorphic for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), an innate immune receptor that recognizes bacterial lipoproteins. To test whether the TLR2 polymorphism influences variation in the susceptibility to infection with B. afzelii, we challenged pathogen-free, lab-born individuals of known TLR2 genotype with B. afzelii-infected ticks. We measured the spirochete load in tissues of the bank voles. The susceptibility to infection with B. afzelii following an infected tick bite was very high (95%) and did not differ between TLR2 genotypes. The TLR2 polymorphism also had no effect on the spirochete abundance in the tissues of the bank voles. Under the laboratory conditions of our study, we did not find that the TLR2 polymorphism in bank voles influenced variation in the susceptibility to B. afzelii infection."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are frequently seen in tick-inhabited areas. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness. However, patients with co-infections can present with nonspecific symptoms, which can make the diagnosis far more challenging. We present a case of triple infection with babesiosis, Lyme disease, and anaplasmosis treated with antibiotics and red blood cell (RBC) exchange (erythrocytapheresis). A 74-year-old, avid female gardener presented with one week of progressive dyspnea, cough with mucoid expectoration, and fatigue. On presentation, she was afebrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic. General examination was significant for altered mental status, dyspnea, pallor, and peripheral edema. Lung examination was remarkable for bibasilar crackles. Pertinent laboratory findings were significant for hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. A peripheral blood smear revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic parasites consistent with Babesia. The patient was started on azithromycin and atovaquone. Doxycycline was added empirically for Lyme disease, which was later confirmed by serology. In addition, Anaplasma titers were also positive. Further investigation revealed that the parasitic load was 9.04%, and RBC exchange (erythrocytapheresis) was performed for severe babesiosis. Repeat laboratory tests demonstrated an inadequate reduction in parasitic load (6.54%), requiring a second round of RBC exchange. Antimicrobials were changed to clindamycin, quinine, and doxycycline for a total of 14 days. There was an improvement in the patient's anemia and thrombocytopenia along with clinical improvement."

		"abstract": "Ticks and ear biopsies were collected from wild small rodents in 2011 and 2012 in the northern Apennines (Italy), up to 1650 m above sea level. Apodemus spp. (n = 83) and Myodes glareolus (n = 22) were infested by Ixodes ricinus (192 larvae and two nymphs), Dermacentor marginatus (179 larvae and 29 nymphs), and Ixodes trianguliceps (three larvae and two nymphs). We detected several Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genospecies (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. valaisiana) in I. ricinus and skin biopsies. The most common genospecies found in I. ricinus was B. valaisiana, while it was B. lusitaniae in tissues. Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae (Rickettsia monacensis, R. slovaca and R. raoultii) infected I. ricinus, D. marginatus and rodent tissues. Rickettsia slovaca was the Rickettsia species most frequently found in our samples. Coinfections by B. burgdorferi s.l. and SFG rickettsiae indicate an overlap of transmission cycles and potential risk for humans to be infected by multiple pathogens, resulting in more severe symptoms. The findings of B. lusitaniae and R. slovaca in bank voles, and of B. valaisiana in small rodents, open new questions about host-pathogen interactions. In addition, our results highlight the importance of small rodents as data sources for studying tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Data concerning combined molecular and serological prevalence of emerging canine tick-borne pathogens in Serbia are lacking. A large population of outdoor living dogs in Belgrade, Serbia's' capital, present an excellent population for epidemiology study. Blood samples were collected from 111 dogs, including 46 shelter, 31 free roaming, and 34 hunting dogs. Species-specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) was applied for the molecular detection of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia canis, Babesia canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli. A research based SNAP assay (SNAP® M-A, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook Maine, USA) that uses genus and species-specific peptides was used to asses Anaplasma spp., A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, Ehrlichia spp., E. canis, E. chaffeensis, E. ewingii and Borrelia burgdorferi antibody status. B. canis, B. gibsoni and B. vogeli antibody status was assessed with an indirect immunofluorescence test (MegaCor Diagnostic, Horbranz, Austria). Anaplasma spp. and Ehrlichia spp. DNA was not amplified. One quarter of the dogs were A. phagocytophilum, one dog was A. platys, one was E. ewingii and two dogs were B. burgdorferi seroreactive with the SNAP® M-A. Babesia canis or B. gibsoni DNA was amplified by PCR from 16.2% of dogs, whereas 67.6% were seroreactive to one or more Babesia spp. Babesia vogeli was not PCR amplified. We conclude that outdoor dogs in this territory are reservoirs for B. canis and B. gibsoni and are frequently co-exposed to combinations of Anaplasma and Babesia spp."

		"abstract": "Questing ticks were surveyed by dragging in forested habitats within the Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania for four consecutive summers (2015-2018). A high level of inter-annual variation was found in the density of blacklegged tick nymphs, Ixodes scapularis Say, with a high density of host-seeking nymphs (DON) in summer 2015 and 2017 and a relatively low DON in summer 2016 and 2018. Very few American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say) and Ixodes cookei Packard were collected. Lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum L.) and longhorned ticks (Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann) were not represented among the 6,398 ticks collected. For tick-borne pathogen surveillance, DNA samples from 1,721 I. scapularis nymphs were prepared from specimens collected in summers 2015-2017 and screened using qPCR, high resolution melting analysis, and DNA sequencing when necessary. The overall 3-yr nymphal infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi was 24.8%, Borrelia miyamotoi was 0.3%, Anaplasma phagocytophilum variant-ha was 0.8%, and Babesia microti was 2.8%. Prevalence of coinfection with B. burgdorferi and B. microti as well as B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum variant-ha were significantly higher than would be expected by independent infection. B. burgdorferi nymphal infection prevalence is similar to what other studies have found in the Hudson Valley region of New York, but levels of B. microti and A. phagocytophilum variant-ha nymphal infection prevalence are relatively lower. This study reinforces the urgent need for continued tick and pathogen surveillance in the Lehigh Valley region."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, reffered to as Lyme borreliosis, is a tick-borne zoonotic disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. Lyme arthritis, the most common, serious and harmful manifestation during the late stages of Lyme disease, is closely associated with the Borrelia burgdorferi basic membrane protein A (BmpA). Chemokines are also reported to have an important role in Lyme arthritis. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize and bind to pathogen-associated molecules which are structurally conserved among microbes, to activate transcriptional events, including cytokine production, inflammation, and tissue damage. We speculated that BmpA could induce a storm of proinflammatory chemokines via TLRs and downstream moleculars, and that TLR1, TLR2, TLR5, TLR6 and the adaptor protein, MyD88, may be involved in this process. We explored this hypothesis using the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, and recombinant BmpA (rBmpA). Cell surface TLR1 and TLR2 were neutralized using specific antibodies before stimulation with rBmpA and analysis of chemokine secretion using a chemokine chip. Further, the expressions level of the four TLRs and MyD88 were analyzed following stimulation with rBmpA. Stimulation with rBmpA resulted in elevated levels of seven cytokines. Further, TLR1 and TLR2 antibody treated cells exhibited an overall reduction in rBmpA-induced chemokine expression. TLR1, TLR2, and MyD88 expression levels (both mRNA and protein) increased after stimulation with rBmpA. Our data confirm that TLR1, TLR2, and MyD88 are involved in BmpA-induced proinflammatory chemokines, which may be closely involved in Lyme arthritis pathogenesis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, which humans acquire from an infected tick of the genus Ixodes (primarily Ixodes scapularis). While previous studies have provided useful insights into various aspects of Lyme disease, the tick's host preference in the presence of multiple hosts has not been considered in the existing models. In this study, we develop a transmission dynamics model that includes the interactions between the primary vectors involved: blacklegged ticks (I. scapularis), white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). Our model shows that the presence of multiple vectors may have a significant impact on the dynamics and spread of Lyme disease. Based on our model, we also calculate the basic reproduction number, R0 , a threshold value that predicts whether a disease exists or dies out. Subsequent extensions of the model consider seasonality of the tick's feeding period and mobility of deer between counties. Our results suggest that a longer tick peak feeding period results in a higher infection prevalence. Moreover, while the deer mobility may not be a primary factor for short-term emergence of Lyme disease epidemics, in the long-run it can significantly contribute to local infectiousness in neighboring counties, which eventually reach the endemic steady state."

The debilitating nature of LD is mainly attributed to the ability of B. burgdorferi to persist in patients for many years despite strong anti-Borrelia antibody responses. Antimicrobial treatment of persistent infection is challenging. Similar to infection of humans, B. burgdorferi establishes long-term infection in various experimental animal models except for New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, which clear the spirochete within 4 to 12 weeks. LD spirochetes have a highly evolved antigenic variation vls system, on the lp28-1 plasmid, where gene conversion results in surface expression of the antigenically variable VlsE protein. VlsE is required for B. burgdorferi to establish persistent infection by continually evading otherwise potent antibodies. Since the clearance of B. burgdorferi is mediated by humoral immunity in NZW rabbits, the previously reported results that LD spirochetes lose lp28-1 during rabbit infection could potentially explain the failure of B. burgdorferi to persist. However, the present study unequivocally disproves that previous finding by demonstrating that LD spirochetes retain the vls system. However, despite the vls system being fully functional, the spirochete fails to evade anti-Borrelia antibodies of NZW rabbits. In addition to being protective against homologous and heterologous challenges, the rabbit antibodies significantly ameliorate LD-induced arthritis in persistently infected mice. Overall, the current data indicate that NZW rabbits develop a protective antibody repertoire, whose specificities, once defined, will identify potential candidates for a much-anticipated LD vaccine."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are the two vector-borne diseases with the largest impact on human health. Based on data on the density of host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks and pathogen prevalence and using a variety of environmental data, we have created an acarological risk model for a region where both diseases are endemic (Czech Republic-South Bohemia and Germany-Lower Bavaria, Upper Palatinate). The data on tick density were acquired by flagging 50 sampling sites three times in a single season. Prevalence of the causative agents of LB and TBE was determined. Data on environmental variables (e.g., altitude, vegetation cover, NDVI, land surface temperature) were obtained from various sources and processed using geographical information systems. Generalized linear models were used to estimate tick density, probability of tick infection, and density of infected ticks for the whole area. A significantly higher incidence of human TBE cases was recorded in South Bohemia compared to Bavarian regions, which correlated with a lower tick density in Bavaria. However, the differences in pathogen prevalence rates were not significant. The model outputs were made available to the public in the form of risk maps, indicating the distribution of tick-borne disease risk in space."

However, current data regarding the role of wild animals in the ecology of tick-borne pathogens is insufficient and more investigations are required. In this study, we investigated tick-borne bacterial pathogens in wild boar, hare, and fox and their ticks in Turkey. A total of 102 tick pools comprised of 445 ticks and blood samples were analyzed for the presence of bacterial DNA by PCRs targeted rickettsial gltA and ompA genes, 5S-23S rDNA gene for Borrelia spp., and msp4 gene for Anaplasma spp. As a result of PCR and sequence analyses, three pathogenic spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, two SFG rickettsiae with unknown pathogenicity and one pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were detected in samples obtained from wild animals. Rickettsia slovaca was detected in ticks (13.7% of tick pools) collected from wild boars and blood of a wild boar. In addition, the presences of R. hoogstraalii (19.6% of tick pools), R. aeschlimannii (5.8% of tick pools), R. sibirica subsp. mongolitimonae (1.9% of tick pools) and Candidatus R. goldwasserii (0.9% of tick pools) were detected in ticks collected from wild animals. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in a tick pool collected from a wild boar. This is the first report on the presence of Candidatus R. goldwasserii in Turkey. Consequently, this study shows that pathogenic Rickettsia and Borrelia species are circulating in Turkish wildlife and these pathogens can pose a threat to human health. Also, it has been determined that the investigated wild animals play a role as maintenance host for vector ticks; therefore, these animals must also be considered in the ecology of the mentioned pathogens."

Between 2008-2015, 11,066 adult and 3,815 nymphal I. pacificus and five adult and 144 nymphal Ixodes spinpalpis, a commonly collected wildlife tick, were collected from 42 California counties. Borrelia burgdorferi sl was detected in 1.2% and 3.8% I. pacificus adults and nymphs, respectively. Results from this study indicate genetic diversity and geographic structure of B. burgdorferi sl in California I. pacificus ticks, by sequence comparison of the16S rRNA gene, with B. burgdorferi ss, the agent of Lyme disease, found only in I. pacificus collected from the north and central coastal and Sierra Nevada foothill regions; B. burgdorferi ss was not detected in ticks tested from southern California. In contrast, Borrelia bissettiae, a member of the B. burgdorferi sl complex, was detected in both I. pacificus and I. spinipalpis, in the coastal region of both northern and southern California, but was absent from ticks in the Sierra Nevada foothills. In a similar pattern to B. bissettiae, Borrelia americana (a member of the B. burgdorferi sl complex) was detected in a single adult I. pacificus from the north coast and two I. spinipalpis nymphs from south-coastal California. This study highlights that the geographic area of Lyme disease acarological risk in California is the north-central and Sierra Nevada foothill regions of the state with little to no risk in the southern regions of the state."

		"abstract": "Green spaces in the city are important for human wellbeing, but are also zones in which humans can become infected with zoonotic diseases. Therefore, there is a need to understand how infection risk is related to green space characteristics, wildlife communities and connectivity with rural areas hosting reservoir populations of hosts. Our hypothesis is that wildlife hosts in urban green spaces, and thereby the prevalence of questing ticks and their Lyme disease causing pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.), can be partly predicted based on green space characteristics as well as measures of connectivity to known source areas. We sampled ticks in twenty-two green spaces during Spring (2014 and 2016) and Autumn 2016, located along an urbanization gradient in Antwerp (Belgium). More than 18,000 m2 was sampled, with tick densities ranging from 0 to 386 individuals/100 m2. We estimated connectivity using the least-cost algorithm as either the cost distance to the nearest green space, or to a known population of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), known to be an important tick propagation host. Both connectivity measures turned out to be correlated, reflecting a gradient in green space isolation from the periphery to the urban center. In 87% of plots where ticks were trapped, at least one Borrelia-infected tick was found. The overall Borrelia-prevalence in nymphs was 17.8%, in adults 32.6%. Density of infected ticks decreased with urbanization and increased with connectivity. Nymphs in larger green spaces were more likely to be infected. While density and infection prevalence for adults increased with the amount of neighboring agricultural land, the larval density and nymphal infection prevalence decreased. Interestingly, the proportion of Borrelia genospecies associated with birds or mammals was comparable in rural and (sub)urban areas (bird/mammal: 0.38), suggesting that even in small green spaces Borrelia infections can persist in local host populations."

		"abstract": "Lyme's Disease (LD) is a severe, rapidly growing, broad spectrum chronic infection caused by the bacterium 'Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi', which can be easily transmitted through the bite of certain species of ticks. The prevalence of LD is swiftly mounting in the present scenario in many countries from species to species. Although Lyme's infection is now detectable via serologic examination of early and late Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), the management of persistent symptoms is still fraught with quora of doubt and debate. LD is a multisystem spirochete which results after the dissemination of B. burgdorferi from a dermal inoculation site after a tick bite. Lyme's infection can easily get transmitted to the central nervous system and develop various neurological symptoms due to inflammation and an autoimmune response from body may lead to life-threatening \"Lyme Borreliosis\". The neurological symptoms are well mixed in presentation, late and confusing to get differentiated easily from other diseases. The use of antibiotics in post Lyme infection with neurological complications is still a topic of debate. Babesiosisstates, and human ehrlichiosis' the two other diseases, are associated with the same ticks that spread the LD. However, the prevalence of diagnosed human cases is usually much lower than that of actual cases of LD due to misdiagnosis, late diagnosis or undiagnosis at y such lateral neuroinfection stage after the tick bite. The current review focuses on the molecular neuropathology and current advancements in LD. There are very few patents or discoveries made on borrelia infection, drawing attention towards more focused and targeted research for the cure."

Borrelia afzelii spirochetes are present in murine skin within 1 day of tick attachment. In contrast, spirochetes were not detectable in salivary glands at any stage of tick feeding. Further experiments demonstrated that tick saliva is not essential for B. afzelii infectivity, the most important requirement for successful host colonization being a change in expression of outer surface proteins that occurs in the tick gut during feeding. Spirochetes in vertebrate mode are then able to survive within the host even in the absence of tick saliva. Taken together, our data suggest that the tick gut is the decisive organ that determines the competence of I. ricinus to vector B. afzelii We discuss possible transmission mechanisms of B. afzelii spirochetes that should be further tested in order to design effective preventive and therapeutic strategies against Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Mice Against Ticks is a community-guided ecological engineering project that aims to prevent tick-borne disease by using CRISPR-based genome editing to heritably immunize the white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus) responsible for infecting many ticks in eastern North America. Introducing antibody-encoding resistance alleles into the local mouse population is anticipated to disrupt the disease transmission cycle for decades. Technology development is shaped by engagement with community members and visitors to the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, including decisions at project inception about which types of disease resistance to pursue. This engagement process has prompted the researchers to use only white-footed mouse DNA if possible, meaning the current project will not involve gene drive. Instead, engineered mice would be released in the spring when the natural population is low, a plan unlikely to increase total numbers above the normal maximum in autumn. Community members are continually asked to share their suggestions and concerns, a process that has already identified potential ecological consequences unanticipated by the research team that will likely affect implementation. As an early example of CRISPR-based ecological engineering, Mice Against Ticks aims to start small and simple by working with island communities whose mouse populations can be lastingly immunized without gene drive.

However, medical practitioners often question how these zoonotic pathogens are present in their locality. In this study, we provide the first report of an Amblyomma inornatum tick cofeeding with a blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, which parasitized a Veery, Catharus fuscescens-a neotropical songbird. Using the flagellin (flaB) gene of the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and the 18S rRNA gene of the Babesia piroplasm, a malaria-like microorganism, we detected Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Babesia odocoilei, respectively, in an I. scapularis nymph. After the molt, these ticks can bite humans. Furthermore, this is the first-ever documentation of B. odocoilei in a tick parasitizing a bird. Our findings substantiate the fact that migratory songbirds transport neotropical ticks long distances, and import them into Canada during northward spring migration. Health care practitioners need to be aware that migratory songbirds transport pathogen-laden ticks into Canada annually, and pose an unforeseen health risk to Canadians."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most frequent vector-borne disease in France. Since 2009, surveillance of LB is conducted by a sentinel network of general practitioners (GPs). This system, in conjunction with the national hospitalisation database was used to estimate the incidence and describe the characteristics of LB in France. To describe the estimated incidence and trends in GP consultations and hospital admissions for LB in France and identify risk groups and high-incidence regions. From 2011 to 2016, the mean yearly incidence rate of LB cases was 53 per 100,000 inhabitants (95% CI: 41-65) ranging from 41 in 2011 to 84 per 100 000 in 2016. A mean of 799 cases per year were hospitalised with LB associated diagnoses 2005-16. The hospitalisation incidence rate (HIR) ranged from 1.1 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2005 to 1.5 in 2011 with no statistically significant trend. We observed seasonality with a peak during the summer, important inter-regional variations and a bimodal age distribution in LB incidence and HIR with higher incidence between 5 and 9 year olds and those aged 60 years. Erythema migrans affected 633/667 (95%) of the patients at primary care level. Among hospitalised cases, the most common manifestation was neuroborreliosis 4,906/9,594 (51%). Public health strategies should focus on high-incidence age groups and regions during the months with the highest incidences and should emphasise prevention measures such as regular tick checks after exposure and prompt removal to avoid infection."

We used serologic testing to evaluate these patients for evidence of co-infection with any of the 4 other tickborne pathogens. Evidence of co-infection was found for B. microti only; 4-6 patients were co-infected with Babesia microti. Nearly 90% of the patients evaluated had no evidence of co-infection.

Although appropriate antibiotic treatment is effective for most cases, up to 20% of patients develop post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). There is an urgent need to improve clinical management of LD using precise understanding of disease and patient stratification. We applied machine-learning to electronic medical records to better characterize the heterogeneity of LD and developed predictive models for identifying medications that are associated with risks of subsequent comorbidities. For broad disease categories, we identified 3, 16, and 17 comorbidities within 2, 5, and 10 years of diagnosis, respectively. At a higher resolution of ICD-9 codes, we identified known associations with LD including chronic pain and cognitive disorders, as well as particular comorbidities on a timescale that matched PTLDS symptomology. We identified 7, 30, and 35 medications associated with risks of these comorbidities within 2, 5, and 10 years, respectively. For instance, the first-line antibiotic doxycycline exhibited a consistently protective association for typical symptoms of LD, including backache. Our approach and findings may suggest new hypotheses for more personalized treatments regimens for LD patients."

We also collected aggregate data from direct retrospective chart review, including laboratory testing for Lyme, other infections, and associated tick-borne coinfections. This helped us to determine the frequency of exposure to other infections/coinfections among a cohort of chronically ill Lyme patients, evaluate the efficacy of newer \"persister\" drug regimens like DDS, and determine how other infections and tick-borne coinfections may be contributing to the burden of chronic illness leading to resistant symptomatology. A total of 200 adult patients recruited from a specialized Lyme disease medical practice had been ill for at least 1 year. We regularly monitored laboratory values and participants' symptom severity, and the patients completed the online symptom questionnaire both before beginning treatment and after 6 months on DDS combination therapy (DDS CT). Paired-samples t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank nonparametric test were performed on each of eight major Lyme symptoms, both before DDS CT and after 6 months of therapy. DDS CT statistically improved the eight major Lyme symptoms. We found multiple species of intracellular bacteria including rickettsia, Bartonella, Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, Tularemia, and Brucella contributing to the burden of illness and a high prevalence of Babesia complicating management with probable geographic spread of Babesia WA1/duncani to the Northeast. Borrelia, Bartonella, and Mycoplasma species, as well as Babesia microti had variable manifestations and diverse seroreactivity, with evidence of persistence despite commonly prescribed courses of anti-infective therapies. Occasional reactivation of viral infections including human herpes virus 6 was also seen in immunocompromised individuals. DDS CT decreased eight major Lyme symptoms severity and improved treatment outcomes among patients with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS and associated coinfections."

Control and prevention of these diseases require a better understanding of vector distribution.AimOur aim was to create a model able to predict the distribution of Ixodes ricinus nymphs in southern Scandinavia and to assess how this relates to risk of human exposure.MethodsWe measured the presence of I. ricinus tick nymphs at 159 stratified random lowland forest and meadow sites in Denmark, Norway and Sweden by dragging 400 m transects from August to September 2016, representing a total distance of 63.6 km. Using climate and remote sensing environmental data and boosted regression tree modelling, we predicted the overall spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs in Scandinavia. To assess the potential public health impact, we combined the predicted tick distribution with human density maps to determine the proportion of people at risk.ResultsOur model predicted the spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 60%. Temperature was one of the main drivers in the model followed by vegetation cover. Nymphs were restricted to only 17.5% of the modelled area but, respectively, 73.5%, 67.1% and 78.8% of the human populations lived within 5 km of these areas in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.ConclusionThe model suggests that increasing temperatures in the future may expand tick distribution geographically in northern Europe, but this may only affect a small additional proportion of the human population."

		"abstract": "Significant global ecological changes continue to drive emergence of tick-borne zoonoses around the world. This poses an important threat to both human and animal health, and highlights the need for surveillance systems that are capable of monitoring these complex diseases effectively across different stages of the emergence process. Our objective was to develop an evidence-based framework for surveillance of emerging tick-borne zoonoses. We conducted a realist review to understand the available approaches and major challenges associated with surveillance of emerging tick-borne zoonoses. Lyme disease, with a specific focus on emergence in Canada, was used as a case study to provide real-world context, since the process of disease emergence is ongoing in this country. We synthesize the results to propose a novel framework for adaptive surveillance of emerging tick-borne zoonoses. Goals for each phase of disease emergence are highlighted and approaches are suggested. The framework emphasizes the needs for surveillance systems to be inclusive, standardized, comprehensive and sustainable. We build upon a growing body of infectious disease literature that is advocating for reform to surveillance systems. Although our framework has been developed for tick-borne zoonoses, it is flexible and has the potential to be applied to a variety of other vector-borne and zoonotic diseases."

We obtained the results of all Lyme disease serological tests ordered at U.S. Air Force healthcare facilities in the USA between January 2013 and December 2017. We conducted chart reviews to adjudicate positive IgM immunoblots (from two-tier and independent testing) as true positives or false positives using established criteria, and we assessed whether these cases were reported to the U.S. Department of Defense surveillance system. Of the 18 410 serum tests (17 058 immunoassays and 1352 immunoblots) performed on 15 928 unique individuals, 249/1352 (18.4%) IgM immunoblots were positive. After excluding repeat tests, insufficiently documented cases, and participants with a history of Lyme disease, 212 positive IgM immunoblot cases were assessed. A total of 113/212 (53.3%) were determined to be false positives. Antibiotics were prescribed for Lyme disease for 97/99 (98.0%) participants with a true-positive test and 91/113 (80.5%) participants with a false-positive test. The number of false-positive cases reported to the surveillance system was identical to the number of unreported true-positive cases (n = 44). Lyme disease serological tests were overused in a large healthcare system, and positive results were frequently misinterpreted, leading to misdiagnosis and widespread antibiotic misuse. Underreporting of true-positive cases was offset by overreporting of false-positive cases, suggesting that the discrepancy between the reported incidence and true incidence of Lyme disease may not be as significant as previously assumed."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are the most common tick-borne diseases in Germany. While for LB only non-specific prevention strategies exist, TBE can be additionally prevented by vaccination. It is unclear to which extent non-specific prevention strategies are applied by individuals living in non-endemic areas for TBE in Germany, and whether TBE vaccination status affects their implementation. Participants of the HaBIDS panel (Hygiene and Behavior Infectious Diseases Study) from four counties of Lower Saxony were invited to fill out a questionnaire on their TBE vaccination status, their LB diagnoses as well as their knowledge, attitudes, and practice related to prevention measures for tick-borne diseases. Based on self-reported data we estimated cumulative lifetime incidence (CUM) and incidence of LB as well as TBE vaccination coverage. One year later, participants received a supplementary questionnaire focusing on reasons for vaccination against TBE and compliance with the vaccination schedule. 1,573 (74.2% of those invited) panel members aged 18-69 years participated in this study. Of these, 22.8% reported to have ever been vaccinated against TBE. The estimated CUM of LB was 5.1% (95%-CI: 4.1%-6.4%), and the incidence was 1.09 per 1,000 person years (95%-CI: 0.87-1.36). 98% of participants knew that LB is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick, but about 50% didn't know that TBE vaccination does not protect against LB. Even though about 80% of study participants were convinced that recommended non-specific prevention strategies were indeed protective, a much lower proportion implemented them. TBE-vaccinated participants were better informed about tick-borne diseases compared to non-vaccinated participants, whereby being vaccinated did not negatively affect implementation of non-specific prevention strategies. Based on data from the supplementary questionnaire, traveling to endemic areas (75.3%) was the main reason for TBE vaccination; 33.0% of those vaccinated had a complete vaccination schedule with three doses. Our study in a TBE non-endemic area revealed deficits in knowledge about which pathogens are covered by TBE vaccination, and a lack in the implementation of non-specific prevention measures. TBE vaccination was not associated with a reduced uptake of non-specific prevention measures."

Ixodic tick-borne borreliosis in the territory of the Republic of Bashkortostan is characterized by mainly erythematous forms of a disease with a medium-weight current. At the same time some increase in quantity of platelets was noted that could be caused by irritation of a megakaryocytic sprout of bone marrow in the conditions of infectious process and have compensatory character whereas other indicators of CBC and hemostasis at this clinical form practically didn't change. Not numerous cases of the ixodic tick-borne borreliosis non-erythematous forms clinically proceeded more hard, with significantly more expressed toxicinflammatory syndrome. At the same time it was followed by significant shifts in biochemical parameters, indicators of CBC and hemostasis. The clinical laboratory features of erythematous and non-erythematous forms of ixodic tick-borne borreliosis revealed as a result of the conducted researches reflect character of a course of disease and can serve for assessment of severity, the forecast of the infection and justification of this treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is an important tick-borne disease which can cause a broad range of symptoms mainly affecting the skin, the nervous system and the joints. This study aims to estimate the incidence of the different clinical manifestations of LB in Belgium. The incidence of erythema migrans (EM) was estimated through the network of sentinel general practices at 97.6/100,000 inhabitants (uncertainty interval [UI] 82.0-113.0) for the period 2015-2017. This result was used to estimate the incidence of other LB manifestations based on their proportional distribution (ratios) to EM reported in the neighboring countries of Belgium. To estimate these ratios, we performed a systematic review of studies published between February 1, 2008 and January 31, 2018 and pooled the results using a random effects meta-analysis. Six studies were retained in the systematic review, and the meta-analysis estimated the occurrence ratios for Lyme neuroborreliosis/EM, Lyme arthritis/EM and other manifestations/EM at 0.024 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.016-0.037), 0.022 (95% CI 0.020-0.024) and 0.014 (95% CI 0.012-0.016) respectively. Applying these ratios to the EM incidence in Belgium resulted in an incidence estimation of 2.4/100,000 inhabitants (95% UI 1.5-3.7) for Lyme neuroborreliosis, 2.1/100,000 (95% UI 1.7-2.6) for Lyme arthritis and 1.4/100,000 (95% UI 1.1-1.7) for other less frequent manifestations. Some of these LB manifestations, other than EM, are more severe, hence these estimates are essential to assess the health burden and economic cost of LB which would be highly relevant for patients, healthcare providers and policymakers. As both over- and underestimation of different clinical LB manifestations remain possible due to characteristics of the primary surveillance systems and the disease itself, future studies to validate these estimates would be of great value."

High-degree atrioventricular block is the most common presentation of LC, and usually resolves with antibiotic therapy. A systematic approach to the diagnosis of LC in patients with high-degree atrioventricular block will facilitate the identification of this usually transient condition, thus preventing unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers in otherwise healthy young individuals."

		"abstract": "As human cases of tick-borne disease continue to increase, there is a heightened imperative to collect data on human-tick encounters to inform disease prevention. Passive tick surveillance programs that encourage members of the public to submit ticks they have encountered can provide a relatively low-cost means of collecting such data. We report the results of 11 years of tick submissions (2006-2016) collected in Monmouth County, New Jersey, an Atlantic coastal county long endemic for Lyme disease. A total of 8,608 ticks acquired in 22 U.S. states were submitted, 89.7% of which were acquired in Monmouth County, from 52 of the County's 53 municipalities. Seasonal submission rates reflected known phenology of common human-biting ticks, but annual submissions of both Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis increased significantly over time while numbers of Ixodes scapularis remained static. By 2016, A. americanum had expanded northward in the county and now accounted for nearly half (48.1%) of submissions, far outpacing encounters with I. scapularis (28.2% of submissions). Across all tick species and stages the greatest number of ticks were removed from children (ages 0-9, 40.8%) and older adults (ages 50+, 23.8%) and these age groups were also more likely to submit partially or fully engorged ticks, suggesting increased risk of tick-borne disease transmission to these vulnerable age groups. Significantly more people (43.2%) reported acquiring ticks at their place of residence than in a park or natural area (17.9%). This pattern was more pronounced for residents over 60 years of age (72.7% acquired at home). Education that stresses frequent tick checks should target older age groups engaged in activity around the home. Our results strongly suggest that encounter rates with ticks other than I. scapularis are substantial and increasing and that their role in causing human illness should be carefully investigated."

		"abstract": "There are 17 human-biting ticks known in Australia. The bites of Ixodes holocyclus, Ornithodoros capensis, and Ornithodoros gurneyi can cause paralysis, inflammation, and severe local and systemic reactions in humans, respectively. Six ticks, including Amblyomma triguttatum, Bothriocroton hydrosauri, Haemaphysalis novaeguineae, Ixodes cornuatus, Ixodes holocyclus, and Ixodes tasmani may transmit Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia australis, Rickettsia honei, or Rickettsia honei subsp. marmionii. These bacterial pathogens cause Q fever, Queensland tick typhus (QTT), Flinders Island spotted fever (FISF), and Australian spotted fever (ASF). It is also believed that babesiosis can be transmitted by ticks to humans in Australia. In addition, Argas robertsi, Haemaphysalis bancrofti, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes hirsti, Rhipicephalus australis, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks may play active roles in transmission of other pathogens that already exist or could potentially be introduced into Australia. These pathogens include Anaplasma spp., Bartonella spp., Burkholderia spp., Francisella spp., Dera Ghazi Khan virus (DGKV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Lake Clarendon virus (LCV), Saumarez Reef virus (SREV), Upolu virus (UPOV), or Vinegar Hill virus (VINHV). It is important to regularly update clinicians' knowledge about tick-borne infections because these bacteria and arboviruses are pathogens of humans that may cause fatal illness. An increase in the incidence of tick-borne infections of human may be observed in the future due to changes in demography, climate change, and increase in travel and shipments and even migratory patterns of birds or other animals. Moreover, the geographical conditions of Australia are favorable for many exotic ticks, which may become endemic to Australia given an opportunity. There are some human pathogens, such as Rickettsia conorii and Rickettsia rickettsii that are not currently present in Australia, but can be transmitted by some human-biting ticks found in Australia, such as Rhipicephalus sanguineus, if they enter and establish in this country. Despite these threats, our knowledge of Australian ticks and tick-borne diseases is in its infancy."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases (TBD), caused by borrelial, rickettsial and babesial pathogens, are common across the United States and can cause severe clinical disease in susceptible hosts, such as domestic dogs. However, there are limited TBD molecular epidemiological reports for dogs in Texas, and none for the non-Lyme borrelial pathogen responsible for causing tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). Therefore, data to support the prevalence of TBRF in the canine population is inadequate. This study aimed to characterize the molecular prevalence of 11 causative agents responsible for three TBD groups within domestic dogs with an emphasis on pathogen distribution within Texas ecoregions. A total representative number of 1,171 whole-blood samples were collected opportunistically from two Texas veterinary diagnostic laboratories. A layerplex real-time PCR assay was utilized to screen the dog samples for all 11 pathogens simultaneously. The overall molecular infection prevalence of disease was 0.68% borrelial, 1.8% rickettsial and 0.43% babesial pathogens, for a TBD total of 2.73% across Texas. Higher molecular prevalence was observed when analysed by ecoregion distinction, including 5.78% rickettsial infections by Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys in the Rolling Plains ecoregion, and an average of 1.1% Borrelia turicatae and 1.0% Babesia gibsoni across detected ecoregions. To our knowledge, our findings indicate the first molecular detection of A. platys in Texas, and the first report of coinfections with E. canis and A. platys in dogs of Texas. The zoonotic concerns associated with TBDs, in conjunction with dogs' implication as an effective sentinel for human disease, highlight the importance of characterizing and monitoring regions associated with active infections in dogs. Surveillance data obtained from this study may aid public health agencies in updating maps depicting high-risk areas of disease and developing preventative measures for the affected areas."

		"abstract": "Ticks are a major group of arthropod vectors, characterized by the diversity of pathogens they transmit, by their impact on human and animal health, and by their socioeconomic implication especially in countries of the Southern Hemisphere. In Europe, Ixodes is the most important tick due to its wide distribution in the ecosystems and the variety of transmitted pathogens, in particular Borrelia (responsible for Lyme borreliosis), but also the tick-borne encephalitis virus. Their increased presence in the environment since the beginning of the 20th century is undeniable, because of major modifications in the biodiversity caused by humans. Increasing the awareness of health professionals and the general population is required to achieve better control of these infections. Thus, \"a better understanding of these tick-borne diseases for a better control\" is a simple but effective approach, considering their ubiquity in the environment and their particular mode of pathogen transmission (long-lasting blood meal for hard ticks and delayed transmission for bacteria and parasites). Finally, these ectoparasites are problematic due to the potential allergic reactions and other damages caused by their saliva, in humans and animals."

Using field enclosures and a 'common garden' experimental design at two field sites, we directly tested this hypothesis by observing above-litter questing of laboratory-raised nymphal I. scapularis whose parents were collected from 15 locations (= origins) across the species' range. Relative to southern nymphs from origins considered to be of low acarologic risk, northern nymphs from high-risk origins were eight times as likely to quest on or above the surface of the leaf litter. This regional variation in vector behavior (specifically, the propensity of southern nymphs to remain under leaf litter) was highly correlated with Lyme borreliosis incidence in nymphs' counties of origin. We conclude that nymphal host-seeking behavior is a key factor contributing to the low incidence of Lyme borreliosis in southern states. Expansion of northern I. scapularis populations could lead to increased incidence in southern states of Lyme borreliosis and other diseases vectored by this tick, if the 'northern' host-seeking behavior of immigrant nymphs is retained. Systematic surveillance for I. scapularis nymphs questing above the leaf litter in southern states will help predict future geographic change in I. scapularis-borne disease risk."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne pathogens are emerging concerns in multiple regions of Canada. Determining regional prevalence of canine vector-borne pathogens and documenting change will improve clinician awareness, enable targeted prevention, enhance diagnosis and ideally reduce the risk of disease. Study objectives were to: (i) estimate the prevalence of positive canine vector-borne test results from samples submitted in Canada; (ii) assess change in prevalence over time, from baseline (2008) to 2015; and (iii) estimate the prevalence of pathogen co-infections. This repeat cross-sectional study evaluated 753,468 test results for D. immitis antigen and B. burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis/ewingii/muris serology, and 753,208 test results for Anaplasma phagocytophilum/platys serology using the SNAP® 4Dx®Test and SNAP 4Dx® Plus Test. Based on all submitted samples from Canada (2008-2015), the period seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp. and D. immitis antigen were 2.0%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. Over the 7 years (2008 compared to 2015) we observed a significant increase in seroprevalence for B. burgdorferi (144.4%) and Ehrlichia spp. (150%). Co-infections (positive for two or more pathogens on a single 4 pathogen test kit) were estimated at 5.4% (1162/21,612) of total positive tests. The temporal rise and geographical differences in prevalence detected for these pathogens (notably B. burgdorferi) are consistent with anecdotal information on canine illness related to tick-borne pathogen exposure in multiple regions of Canada, particularly canine Lyme disease."

To determine the significance of CXCL13 in established central nervous system (CNS) infections other than LNB by matching cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CXCL13 elevations with severity of the disease course. We investigated 26 patients with bacterial (n = 10) and viral (n = 16; tick-borne encephalitis, n = 6; varicella zoster infection, n = 10) neuroinfections of whom CSF CXCL13 levels were available twice, from lumbar punctures (LP) performed at admission and follow-up. As outcome classification, we dichotomized disease courses into \"uncomplicated\" (meningitis, monoradiculitis) and \"complicated\" (signs of CNS parenchymal involvement such as encephalitis, myelitis, abscesses, or vasculitis). CXCL13 elevations above 250 pg/ml were classified as highly elevated. Eight of 26 patients (31%) with both bacterial (n = 4) and viral (n = 4) neuroinfections had a complicated disease course. All of them but only 3/18 patients (17%) with an uncomplicated disease course had CSF CXCL13 elevations > 250 pg/ml at the follow-up LP (p < 0.001). At admission, 4/8 patients (50%) with a complicated disease course and 3/18 patients (17%) with an uncomplicated disease course showed CXCL13 elevations > 250 pg/ml. All four patients with a complicated disease course but only one with an uncomplicated disease course had sustained CXCL13 elevations at follow-up. Patient groups did not differ with regard to age, time since symptom onset, LP intervals, type of infections, and anti-pathogen treatments. Our study revealed pronounced CXCL13 elevations in CSF of patients with severe disease courses of bacterial and viral neuroinfections. This observation indicates a role of CXCL13 in the CNS immune defense and points at an additional diagnostic value as biomarker for unresolved immune processes leading to or associated with complications."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prominent tick-borne disease with 300,000 cases estimated by CDC every year while ~2,000 cases of babesiosis occur per year in the United States. Simultaneous infection with Babesia microti and Borrelia burgdorferi are now the most common tick-transmitted coinfections in the U.S.A., and they are a serious health problem because coinfected patients show more intense and persisting disease symptoms. B. burgdorferi is an extracellular spirochete responsible for systemic Lyme disease while B. microti is a protozoan that infects erythrocytes and causes babesiosis. Immune status and spleen health are important for resolution of babesiosis, which is more severe and even fatal in the elderly and splenectomized patients. Therefore, we investigated the effect of each pathogen on host immune response and consequently on severity of disease manifestations in both young, and 30 weeks old C3H mice. At the acute stage of infection, Th1 polarization in young mice spleen was associated with increased IFN-γ and TNF-α producing T cells and a high Tregs/Th17 ratio. Together, these changes could help in the resolution of both infections in young mice and also prevent fatality by B. microti infection as observed with WA-1 strain of Babesia. In older mature mice, Th2 polarization at acute phase of B. burgdorferi infection could play a more effective role in preventing Lyme disease symptoms. As a result, enhanced B. burgdorferi survival and increased tissue colonization results in severe Lyme arthritis only in young coinfected mice. At 3 weeks post-infection, diminished pathogen-specific antibody production in coinfected young, but not older mice, as compared to mice infected with each pathogen individually may also contribute to increased inflammation observed due to B. burgdorferi infection, thus causing persistent Lyme disease observed in coinfected mice and reported in patients. Thus, higher combined proinflammatory response to B. burgdorferi due to Th1 and Th17 cells likely reduced B. microti parasitemia significantly only in young mice later in infection, while the presence of B. microti reduced humoral immunity later in infection and enhanced tissue colonization by Lyme spirochetes in these mice even at the acute stage, thereby increasing inflammatory arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are two vector-borne diseases transmitted by ticks. Both diseases are endemic and have been reported in all regions of the Czech Republic including urban agglomerations, but in varying proportions. Because of the natural conditions in the border areas, the risk of infection is also high for travelers from the neighboring countries such as Austria, Germany, Poland, and Slovakia. To gain more information on the epidemiology of LB and TBE in the last decade, we analyzed national surveillance data from 2007 to 2016. Incidence of LB in the Czech Republic was 37.3/100,000 population and year (27.6 - 46.1/100,000). Incidence of TBE incidence was 5.7/100,000 (3.4-8.2/100,000) and declined although the trend was not significant (p = 0.155). Difference between the incidences of LB and TBE was increasing in time. Overall male-to-female ratio was 0.84 and 1.51 for LB and TBE, respectively. The age-specific incidences of both infections have a typical two-peak shape, with the first peak in the age group 5-9 years for LB and 15-19 years for TBE. The second peak for both LB and TBE is in the age group 55-64 years. TBE poses a considerable risk to children < 15 years. Among 39,074 cases of LB, the most common clinical manifestations were erythema migrants 62.1% and Lyme neuroborreliosis 25.1%. All 5969 TBE cases manifested itself by affecting nervous system, namely meningo-encephalitis 47.9%, meningoencephalomyelitis 21.8% and meningitis 19.8%. The data evidence the high chance risk of infection with LB and TBE in the Czech Republic. The incidence of both infections shows a bimodal distribution during the year. LB cases are five to six times as frequent as TBE cases. Over the last years, the incidence of LB has remained roughly stable while TBE has shown a downward trend. The present study is unique in allowing the comparison of the incidence rates of LB and TBE over time and space."

The identification of the species and their developmental form was based on morphological characteristics. PCR with B5S-Bor and 23S-Bor primers resulted in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA amplification among six ticks (4.4%). The detailed analysis based on the DNA sequencing showed the presence of DNA of Borrelia afzelii in four samples; the remaining two represented Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, although their genospecies were not determined. The research confirmed the dominance of Borrelia afzelii genospecies in the ticks from Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake similar research in ticks from other regions of Ukraine.

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America and Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii in Europe and Asia, respectively. The infection affects multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, and the nervous system. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is the most dangerous manifestation of Lyme disease, occurring in 10-15% of infected individuals. During the course of the infection, bacteria migrate through the host tissues altering the coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways and the immune response, reaching the central nervous system (CNS) within 2 weeks after the bite of an infected tick. The early treatment with oral antimicrobials is effective in the majority of patients with LNB. Nevertheless, persistent forms of LNB are relatively common, despite targeted antibiotic therapy. It has been observed that the antibiotic resistance and the reoccurrence of Lyme disease are associated with biofilm-like aggregates in B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, both in vitro and in vivo, allowing Borrelia spp. to resist to adverse environmental conditions. Indeed, the increased tolerance to antibiotics described in the persisting forms of Borrelia spp., is strongly reminiscent of biofilm growing bacteria, suggesting a possible role of biofilm aggregates in the development of the different manifestations of Lyme disease including LNB."

		"abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) acts as a molecular rheostat for the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway of the tick Ixodes scapularis How XIAP activates the IMD pathway in response to microbial infection remains ill defined. Here, we identified the XIAP enzymatic substrate p47 as a positive regulator of the I. scapularis IMD network. XIAP polyubiquitylates p47 in a lysine 63-dependent manner and interacts with the p47 ubiquitin-like (UBX) module. p47 also binds to Kenny (IKKγ/NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)- κB kinase complex. Replacement of the amino acid lysine to arginine within the p47 linker region completely abrogated molecular interactions with Kenny. Furthermore, mitigation of p47 transcription levels through RNA interference in I. scapularis limited Kenny accumulation, reduced phosphorylation of IKKβ (IRD5), and impaired cleavage of the NF-κB molecule Relish. Accordingly, disruption of p47 expression increased microbial colonization by the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and the rickettsial agent Anaplasma phagocytophilum Collectively, we highlight the importance of ticks for the elucidation of paradigms in arthropod immunology. Manipulating immune signaling cascades within I. scapularis may lead to innovative approaches to reducing the burden of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in North America. A 23-year-old female presented to our emergency department with a chief complaint of sudden dyspnea and chest pain. An electrocardiogram revealed a third degree heart block. She was a resident of the Northeast region of Mexico and referred a recent travel to an endemic area for Borrelia burgdorferi in the center of Mexico in the past weeks. Lyme carditis was diagnosed after enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi was reported positive and corroborated by a confirmatory immunoblot analysis. Persistent AV block was the only manifestation in our patient, a presentation scarcely reported in literature."
