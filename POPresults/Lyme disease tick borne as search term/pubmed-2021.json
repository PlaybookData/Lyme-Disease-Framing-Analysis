		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the most common hard tick species in Europe and an important vector of pathogens of human and animal health concerns. The rise of high-throughput sequencing has facilitated the identification of many tick-borne pathogens and, more globally, of various microbiota members depending on the scale of concern. In this study, we aimed to assess the bacterial diversity of individual I. ricinus questing nymphs collected in France using high-throughput 16S gene metabarcoding. From 180 dragging-collected nymphs, we identified more than 700 bacterial genera, of which about 20 are abundantly represented (>1% of total reads). Together with 136 other genera assigned, they constitute a core internal microbiota in this study. We also identified 20 individuals carrying Borreliella. The most abundant species is B. afzelii, known to be one of the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in Europe. Co-detection of up to four Borreliella genospecies within the same individual has also been retrieved. The detection and co-detection rate of Borreliella in I. ricinus nymphs is high and raises the question of interactions between these bacteria and the communities constituting the internal microbiota."

		"abstract": "Ticks (Arachnida: Acari) are common in Oklahoma and may transmit tick-borne diseases (TBDs) to people. Due to the difficulty in reducing tick populations, awareness of tick bite prevention, proper tick removal, and knowledge of when to seek medical treatment are critical. However, outreach and extension programs are hampered by a lack of knowledge of what community members know about ticks. To address this limitation, we surveyed college students enrolled in three non-major Entomology courses at Oklahoma State University in 2018. Of the 483 students invited to take a survey, 224 (46.4%) students took both surveys. Pre-survey responses indicated lower levels of knowledge of tick biology compared to post-survey responses. For both pre- and post-survey respondents, \"ticks can jump\" and \"ticks reside up in trees\" received the fewest correct responses. A majority of survey respondents considered Lyme disease to be the predominant TBD in Oklahoma, although it is not established in Oklahoma. Supplemental education overcame these knowledge gaps, with the exception of knowledge of Lyme disease which was still considered to be the predominant TBD in the post-survey. Our results can be used to develop assessment tools to improve extension programs and enhance protection from TBDs."

The Mediterranean rim is generally described as unsuitable for the European vector, Ixodes ricinus. We conducted an epidemiological study to assess whether I. ricinus was present and study its infection status for tick-borne bacteria. Ticks originating from southeastern France were obtained from flagging sampling and removed from animals and tick-bitten patients. Species level identification used morphological keys and MALDI-TOF MS. Quantitative PCR and sequencing assays were used to detect and identify tick-associated bacteria (Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii) in each specimen. A total of 1232 ticks were collected in several localities. Among these, 863 were identified as I. ricinus (70%). Bacterial screening allowed identification of Lyme group Borrelia among I. ricinus ticks originating from various regional areas. Other emerging tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia miyamotoi and Rickettsia species were also detected. The Alpes-Maritimes region, part of the French Riviera, harbours I. ricinus ticks infected with Lyme group Borrelia and several other tick-borne bacterial agents. Clinicians and outdoor activity participants should be aware of the local Lyme borreliosis transmission risk."

According to ECDC, Poland should be considered as an endemic area. The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin 'Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018' . In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne infectious disease that may confer an increased risk of mental disorders, but previous studies have been hampered by methodological limitations, including small sample sizes. The authors used a nationwide retrospective cohort study design to examine rates of mental disorders following Lyme borreliosis. Using Denmark's National Patient Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register, and including all persons living in Denmark from 1994 through 2016 (N=6,945,837), the authors assessed the risk of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors among all individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts (N=12,156). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression analyses. Individuals with Lyme borreliosis had higher rates of any mental disorder (IRR=1.28, 95% CI=1.20, 1.37), of affective disorders (IRR=1.42, 95% CI=1.27, 1.59), of suicide attempts (IRR=2.01, 95% CI=1.58, 2.55), and of death by suicide (IRR=1.75, 95% CI=1.18, 2.58) compared with those without Lyme borreliosis. The 6-month interval after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of any mental disorder (IRR=1.96, 95% CI=1.53, 2.52), and the first 3 years after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of suicide (IRR=2.41, 95% CI=1.25, 4.62). Having more than one episode of Lyme borreliosis was associated with increased incidence rate ratios for mental disorders, affective disorders, and suicide attempts, but not for death by suicide. Individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in the hospital setting had an increased risk of mental disorders, affective disorders, suicide attempts, and suicide. Although the absolute population risk is low, clinicians should be aware of potential psychiatric sequelae of this global disease."

In both locations, Ixodes species ticks transmit the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato bacteria species responsible for causing the infection. The diversity of Borrelia species that cause human infection is greater in Europe; the 2 B. burgdorferi s.l. species collectively responsible for most infections in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii, are not found in the United States, where most infections are caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Strain differences seem to explain some of the variation in the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, which are both minor and substantive, between the United States and Europe. Future studies should attempt to delineate the specific virulence factors of the different species of B. burgdorferi s.l. responsible for these variations in clinical features."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti has gained a foothold in Canada as tick vectors become established in broader geographic areas. B. microti infection is associated with mild or no symptoms in healthy individuals but is transfusion-transmissible and can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. This is the first estimate of clinically significant transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) risk in Canada. The proportion of B. microti-antibody (AB)/nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-positive whole blood donations was estimated at 5.5% of the proportion of the general population with reported Lyme Disease (also tick-borne) based on US data. Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number and proportion of infectious red cell units for three scenarios: base, localized incidence (risk in Manitoba only), and donor study informed (prevalence from donor data). The model simulated 1,029,800 donations repeated 100,000 times for each. In the base scenario 0.5 (0.01, 1.75), B. microti-NAT-positive donations would be expected per year, with 0.08 (0, 0.38) recipients suffering clinically significant TTB (1 every 12.5 years). In the localized incidence scenario, there were 0.21(0, 0.7) B. microti-NAT-positive donations, with 0.04 (0, 0.14) recipient infections (about 1 every 25 years). In the donor study informed scenario, there were 4.6 (0.3, 15.8) B. microti-NAT-positive donations expected, and 0.81 (0.05, 3.14) clinically significant TTB cases per year. The likelihood of clinically relevant TTB is low. Testing would have very little utility in Canada at this time. Ongoing pathogen surveillance in tick vectors is important as B. microti prevalence appears to be slowly increasing in Canada."

In this study, we collected ticks from 39 districts of Istanbul (Turkey) between May and October, from 2013 to 2017, and identified them under stereo-microscope. In addition, we investigated the pathogens that the ticks carry (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia sp. and Babesia sp.) by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We collected a total of 875 ticks from the ground and from various animals and kept them at 4 °C until experiments. We identified 248 Rhipicephalus bursa (28.3% of the total), 205 (23.4%) Rhipicephalus annulatus, 197 (22.5%) Haemaphysalis concinna, 149 (17.0%) Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 24 (2.7%) Hyalomma marginatum, 21 (2.4%) Ixodes ricinus, 13 (1.5%) Rhipicephalus kohlsi, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma anatolicum, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma aegyptium, 5 (0.6%) Dermacentor niveus and 3 (0.3%) Ixodes hexagonus.

Multiplex PCR indicated that 80 (24.4%) ticks were infected with Rickettsia sp., 5 (1.5%) with B. burgdorferi and 1 (0.3%) with Babesia sp. Our study indicated that Rickettsia is more common in ticks collected around Istanbul."

Infection is primarily transmitted through Ixodes ticks, and alternatively by blood transfusions from asymptomatic donors. The aim of the study was detection of Babesia seroprevalence in different groups of population with the usage of experimental B. divergens whole-cell slide antigen and commercial B. microti immunofluorescence assay substrate slide. Indirect immunofluorescence assay trial was performed by testing of 145 blood samples of different origins: healthy individuals (60 - blood donors), risk groups (30 - HIV-infected individuals, 30 - Lyme disease patients) and false-positive IFA controls (10 - seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients, 15 - patients with toxoplasmosis). The study revealed Babesia antibodies to B. divergens (6.9%) and B. microti (3.4%) that were detected with higher (p <0.05) frequency in HIV-infected individuals (26.7%) and in Lyme disease patients (16.7%) than at blood donors (1.7%). Diagnostically significant IgG titres were detected at 23.3% HIV-infected individuals, 13.3% Lyme disease patients and by 1.7% of blood donors and patients with seropositive latent toxoplasmosis. Specific IgM were detected at 20.0% HIV-infected individuals and 13.3% Lyme disease patients. 57.1% of diagnostically significant titres in HIV-infected and Lyme disease patients were represented by IgG and IgM. Immunofluorescence assay has a limited use in babesiosis: in acute form with negative microscopy or PCR; in chronic, asymptomatic and subclinical form with low level of parasitemia; and in retrospective and epidemiological studies of the population immune structure. Clinicians need to have increased awareness of babesiosis, and further studies are needed to clarify the optimal management of this infection in risk groups (including HIV-infected patients and blood donors)."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is endemic to parts of the Americas, Europe and Asia. However, only a handful of sporadic cases have been reported from India. In this study, we systematically evaluated the clinical and epidemiological features of Lyme disease in North India. All samples were tested by using the standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTA). Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for demonstrating Borrelia burgdorferi specific intrathecal IgG antibody synthesis (AI). In addition, a commercial tick-borne bacterial flow chip (TBFC) system and a real-time PCR were also used to detect Borrelia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in patients who were positive by STTA. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed in 18 (7.14%) of the 252 clinically suspected cases by STTA. Neurological involvement was reported in 14 (77.78%) patients, whereas joint and heart involvement was reported in five (27.78%) and three (16.67%) patients, respectively. Lymphocytic pleocytosis (median 37.5 cells/mm3; range 12-175 cells/mm3) in the CSF was seen in 11 of 14 Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) patients. Intrathecal production of Borrelia specific IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 9 (64.28%, n = 14) patients, a highly specific finding for neuroborreliosis. Two patients (11.11%) were also found to be co-infected with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The results of this study show clinical and laboratory evidence of endemic Lyme disease in North India and thus, highlight the importance for travel medicine practitioners and physicians to evaluate for Lyme disease in patients with compatible symptoms and a history of travel to tick risk areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks (n = 1953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene (flaB) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia-positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Recent scholarship supports the use of tick bite encounters as a proxy for human disease risk. Extending entomological monitoring, this study was designed to provide geographically salient information on self-reported tick bite encounters by survey respondents who concomitantly reported a Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis in a state perceived as non-endemic to tick-borne illness. Focusing on Texas, a mixed-methods approach was used to compare data on tick bite encounters from self-reported LD patients with county-level confirmed cases of LD from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as serological canine reports. A greater proportion of respondents reported not recalling a tick bite in the study population, but a binomial test indicated that this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis compared neighboring county-level data and ecological regions. Using multi-layer thematic mapping, our findings indicated that tick bite reports accurately overlapped with the geographic patterns of those patients previously known to be CDC-positive for serological LD and with canine-positive tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis, as well as within neighboring counties and ecological regions. LD patient-reported tick bite encounters, corrected for population density, also accurately aligned with official CDC county hot-spots. Given the large number of counties in Texas, these findings are notable. Overall, the study demonstrates that direct, clinically diagnosed patient reports with county-level tick bite encounter data offer important public health surveillance measures, particularly as it pertains to difficult-to-diagnose diseases where testing protocols may not be well established. Further integration of geo-ecological and socio-demographic factors with existing national epidemiological data, as well as increasingly accessible self-report methods such as online surveys, will contribute to the contextual information needed to organize and implement a coordinated public health response to LD."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms."

		"abstract": "The microbiome of blood-sucking arthropods can shape their competence to acquire and maintain infections with vector-borne pathogens. We used a controlled study to investigate the interactions between Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme disease in Europe, and the bacterial microbiome of Ixodes ricinus, its primary tick vector. We applied a surface sterilization treatment to I. ricinus eggs to produce dysbiosed tick larvae that had a much lower bacterial abundance and a changed bacterial microbiome compared to the control larvae. Dysbiosed and control larvae were fed on B. afzelii-infected mice and uninfected control mice and the engorged larvae were left to molt into nymphs, which were tested for B. afzelii infection and their bacterial microbiome by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Surprisingly, larval dysbiosis had no effect on the vector competence of I. ricinus for B. afzelii, as the nymphal infection prevalence and the nymphal spirochete load were the same between the dysbiosed group and the control group. The strong effect of egg surface sterilization on the tick bacterial microbiome largely disappeared once the larvae molted into nymphs. The most important determinant of the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs was the B. afzelii infection status of the mouse on which the nymphs had fed as larvae. Nymphs that had taken their larval blood meal from an infected mouse had a less abundant but more diverse bacterial microbiome compared to control nymphs. Our study demonstrates that vector-borne infections in the vertebrate host shape the microbiome of the arthropod vector. IMPORTANCE Many blood-sucking arthropods transmit pathogens that cause infectious disease. For example, Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit the bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme disease in humans. Ticks also have a microbiome, which can influence their ability to acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens like B. afzelii. We sterilized I. ricinus eggs with bleach, and the tick larvae that hatched from these eggs had a dramatically reduced and changed bacterial microbiome compared to control larvae. These larvae were fed on B. afzelii-infected mice and the resultant nymphs were tested for B. afzelii and their bacterial microbiome. We found that our manipulation of the bacterial microbiome had no effect on the ability of the tick larvae to acquire and maintain populations of B. afzelii. In contrast, we found that B. afzelii infection had dramatic effects on the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs. Our study demonstrates that infections in the vertebrate host can shape the tick microbiome."

		"abstract": "Deer management (e.g., reduction) has been proposed as a tool to reduce the acarological risk of Lyme disease. There have been few opportunities to investigate Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto dynamics in the absence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in midwestern North America. A pair of islands in Lake Michigan presented a unique opportunity to study the role of alternative hosts for the adult stage of the blacklegged tick for maintaining a tick population as a deer herd exists on North Manitou Island but not on South Manitou Island, where coyotes (Canis latrans) and hares (Lepus americanus) are the dominant medium mammals. Additionally, we were able to investigate the maintenance of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in small mammal communities on both islands, which were dominated by eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). From 2011 to 2015, we surveyed both islands for blacklegged ticks by drag cloth sampling, bird mist netting, and small and medium-sized mammal trapping. We assayed questing ticks, on-host ticks, and mammal biopsies for the Lyme disease pathogen, B. burgdorferi. We detected all three life stages of the blacklegged tick on both islands. Of the medium mammals sampled, no snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus, 0/23) were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, but 2/2 coyotes (Canis latrans) sampled on South Manitou Island in 2014 were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, suggesting that coyotes played a role in maintaining the tick population in the absence of deer. We also detected I. scapularis ticks on passerine birds from both islands, providing support that birds contribute to maintaining as well as introducing blacklegged ticks and B. burgdorferi to the islands. We observed higher questing adult and nymphal tick densities, and higher B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in small mammals and in adult ticks on the island with deer as compared to the deer-free island. On the islands, we also found that 25% more chipmunks were tick-infested than mice, fed more larvae and nymphs relative to their proportional abundance compared to mice, and thus may play a larger role compared to mice in the maintenance of B. burgdorferi. Our investigation demonstrated that alternative hosts could maintain a local population of blacklegged ticks and an enzootic cycle of the Lyme disease bacterium in the absence of white-tailed deer. Thus, alternative adult blacklegged tick hosts should be considered when investigating deer-targeted management tools for reducing tick-borne disease risk, especially when the alternative host community may be abundant and diverse."

In 2014, CDC examined questions from a prospective nationwide survey of U.S. Hispanic adults conducted via the Offerwise QueOpinas panel regarding ticks and LD. From October to November, a total of 2,649 surveys were released and 1,006 completed surveys returned. Overall, 44% of respondents reported routinely practising at least one form of personal protection against tick bites, and wearing repellent was the most commonly reported method (29%). Approximately 6% of respondents reported a tick bite for either themselves or someone in their household during the previous 12 months. An individual or household diagnosis of LD in the previous year was reported by 2% of respondents, with the highest proportion of diagnoses reported by respondents from high LD incidence states. The annual incidence of healthcare provider-diagnosed LD in the survey population was higher than national surveillance estimates for reported LD among U.S. Hispanic persons during 2000-2013. As annual incidence of LD continues to increase, it is important to ensure equitable access to information about LD, including disease transmission, manifestations, and prevention recommendations. Results from this survey can help inform public health outreach focused on effective tick bite prevention methods and early recognition of LD."

		"abstract": "In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape."

Subunit and bacterin vaccines are available for the prevention of LD in dogs. LD bacterin vaccines, which are comprised of cell lysates of two strains of B. burgdorferi, contain over 1000 different proteins and cellular constituents. In contrast, subunit vaccines are defined in composition and consist of either outer surface protein (Osp)A or OspA and an OspC chimeritope. In this study, we comparatively assessed antibody responses to OspA and OspC induced by vaccination with all canine bacterin and subunit LD vaccines that are commercially available in North America. Dogs were administered a two-dose series of the vaccine to which they were assigned (3 weeks apart): Subunit-AC, Subunit-A, Bacterin-1, and Bacterin-2. Antibody titers to OspA and OspC were determined by ELISA and the ability of each vaccine to elicit antibodies that recognize diverse OspC proteins (referred to as OspC types) assessed by immunoblot. While all of the vaccines elicited similar OspA antibody responses, only Subunit-AC triggered a robust and broadly cross-reactive antibody response to divergent OspC proteins. The data presented within provide new information regarding vaccination-induced antibody responses to key tick and mammalian phase antigens by both subunit and bacterin LD canine vaccine formulations."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) have complex life cycles involving tick vectors and vertebrate hosts. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the zoonotic circulation of TBPs. In this study, we used a One Health approach to study the possible circulation of TBPs in ticks, animals and humans within a rural household in the foothills of the Fruška Gora mountain, northern Serbia. The presence of TBP DNA was assessed using microfluidic PCR (25 bacterial species, 7 parasite species, 5 bacterial genera, 3 parasite genera) in animal, human and tick samples and the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) RNA was screened for using RT-qPCR on tick samples. In addition, Lyme borreliosis serology was assessed in patients sera. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ixodes ricinus ticks were identified on dogs and Haemaphysalis punctata was identified on house walls. Rickettsia helvetica was the most common pathogen detected in pooled R. sanguineus and I. ricinus tick samples, followed by Hepatozoon canis. None of the H. punctata tick samples tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia monacensis were the most frequent pathogens detected in dogs, followed by Rickettsia felis, whereas Anaplasma bovis was the only pathogen found in one of the goats tested. None of the human blood samples collected from family members tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Although microfluidic PCR did not detect Borrelia sp. in any of the tested tick or blood samples, a family member with a history of Lyme disease was seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). We conclude that, despite the presence of TBPs in tick and vertebrate reservoirs, there is no evidence of infection with TBPs across various components of the epidemiological chain in a rural Fruška Gora household."

		"abstract": "Assessing the risk of tick-borne disease in areas with high visitor numbers is important from a public health perspective. Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m2) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m2) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised."

To date, B. mayonii has been isolated from two vertebrate host species in Minnesota: field-caught white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque; Rodentia: Cricetidae) and American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben). Here, we describe the first detection of B. mayonii in field-caught eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus L. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)) from northern Wisconsin. During our study, we captured 530 unique small mammals and found an infection prevalence of 23.50% in field-caught eastern chipmunks (4/17) and 1.19% in Peromyscus spp. (5/420). Mean larval and nymphal burdens were determined for captured Blarina brevicauda (0, 0), Glaucomys volans (0.29, 0.14), Myodes gapperi (0.27, 0), Napaeozapus insignis (0, 0.25), Peromyscus spp. (1.88, 0.11), T. striatus (1.06, 0.65), and Sorex cinereus (0.09, 0). The high B. mayonii infection prevalence in eastern chipmunks suggests that the species may be an important reservoir for B. mayonii in the Upper Midwest."

		"abstract": "Transmission of the causative agents of numerous infectious diseases might be potentially conducted by various routes if this is supported by the genetics of the pathogen. Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host-pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans' habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

Information regarding tick infestations and pathogens transmitted by ticks is important for the identification and prevention of disease. This study was a large-scale investigation of ticks collected from dogs and their associated environments in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It included detecting six prevalent tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma spp., A. platys, Borrelia spp., Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis, and E. chaffeensis). A total of 2293 ticks (1110 pools) were collected. Haemaphysalis longicornis (98.60%) was the most frequently collected tick species, followed by Ixodes nipponensis (0.96%) and H. flava (0.44%). Anaplasma spp. (24/1110 tick pools; 2.16%) and Borrelia spp. (4/1110 tick pools; 0.36%) were detected. The phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA genes revealed that the Anaplasma spp. detected in this study were closely associated with A. phagocytophilum reported in humans and rodents in the ROK. Borrelia spp. showed phylogenetic relationships with B. theileri and B. miyamotoi in ticks and humans in Mali and Russia. These results demonstrate the importance of tick-borne disease surveillance and control in dogs in the ROK."

Host blood protein digestion, essential for tick development and reproduction, occurs in tick midgut digestive cells driven by cathepsin proteases. Little is known about the regulation of the digestive proteolytic machinery of I. ricinus. Here we characterize a novel cystatin-type protease inhibitor, mialostatin, from the I. ricinus midgut. Blood feeding rapidly induced mialostatin expression in the gut, which continued after tick detachment. Recombinant mialostatin inhibited a number of I. ricinus digestive cysteine cathepsins, with the greatest potency observed against cathepsin L isoforms, with which it co-localized in midgut digestive cells. The crystal structure of mialostatin was determined at 1.55 Å to explain its unique inhibitory specificity. Finally, mialostatin effectively blocked in vitro proteolysis of blood proteins by midgut cysteine cathepsins. Mialostatin is likely to be involved in the regulation of gut-associated proteolytic pathways, making midgut cystatins promising targets for tick control strategies."

Lyme borreliosis is the most frequent zoonosis in Germany.Most cases show dermatological manifestations, like erythema migrans, followed by infections of the nervous system. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if Lyme neuroborreliosis is suspected. Cell-based assays (like LTT or ELISPOT) should not be used when investigating Lyme disease.A recent randomized controlled trial showed a similar effect of doxycycline compared to betalactam-antibiotics regarding neurological symptoms in Lyme neuroborreliosis. This corroborates current German guideline recommendations.The prognosis of Lyme disease after antibiotic treatment is usually favorable. Frequency of fatigue, depression, impairments in quality of life and cognitive impairment are similar in patients after treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis when compared to the general population."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens other than Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato - the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis - are common in Ixodes ricinus ticks. How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study 'Ticking on Pandora's Box' has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases - individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease - and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis. This article describes the background and design of the study protocol of 'Ticking on Pandora's Box'. With our study we hope to provide insight into the prevalence, clinical presentation and disease burden of the tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis, babesiosis, B. miyamotoi disease, neoehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and tick-borne encephalitis and to assist in test development as well as provide recommendations for national guidelines.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi) can cause a variety of clinical manifestations including Lyme neuroborreliosis. Following the tick-borne transmission, B. burgdorferi initially evade immune responses, later symptomatic infection is associated with occurrence of specific antibody responses. We hypothesized that B. burgdorferi induce immune hyporesponsiveness or immune suppression and aimed to investigate patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis ability to respond to immune stimulation. An observational cohort study investigating the stimulated immune response by standardized whole blood assay (TruCulture®) in adult patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis included at time of diagnosis from 01.09.2018-31.07.2020. Reference intervals were based on a 5-95% range of cytokine concentrations from healthy individuals (n = 32). Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis and references were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Heatmaps of cytokine responses were generated using the webtool Clustvis. In total, 22 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (19 definite, 3 probable) were included. In the unstimulated samples, the concentrations of cytokines in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis were comparable with references, except interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-1β and IL-8, which were all significantly below the references. Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis had similar concentrations of most cytokines in all stimulations compared with references. IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-17A were lower than references in multiple stimulations. In this exploratory cohort study, we found lower or similar concentrations of circulating cytokines in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis at time of diagnosis compared with references. The stimulated cytokine release in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis was in general slightly lower than in the references. Specific patterns of low IL-12 and IFN-γ indicated low Th1-response and low concentrations of IL-17A did not support a strong Th17 response. Our results suggest that patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis elicit a slightly suppressed or impaired immune response for the investigated stimulations, however, whether the response normalizes remains unanswered."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are a growing problem in many parts of the world, and their surveillance and control touch on challenging issues in medical entomology, agricultural health, veterinary medicine, and biosecurity. Spatial approaches can be used to synthesize the data generated by integrative One Health surveillance systems, and help stakeholders, managers, and medical geographers understand the current and future distribution of risk. Here, we performed a systematic review of over 8,000 studies and identified a total of 303 scientific publications that map tick-borne diseases using data on vectors, pathogens, and hosts (including wildlife, livestock, and human cases). We find that the field is growing rapidly, with the major Ixodes-borne diseases (Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in particular) giving way to monitoring efforts that encompass a broader range of threats. We find a tremendous diversity of methods used to map tick-borne disease, but also find major gaps: data on the enzootic cycle of tick-borne pathogens is severely underutilized, and mapping efforts are mostly limited to Europe and North America. We suggest that future work can readily apply available methods to track the distributions of tick-borne diseases in Africa and Asia, following a One Health approach that combines medical and veterinary surveillance for maximum impact."

		"abstract": "The most commonly reported vector-borne and tick-borne disease (TBD) in the United States is Lyme disease. Individuals with Lyme disease may present with a wide array of symptoms with resultant musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiac manifestations that may cause them to seek physical therapist services. The symptoms may develop insidiously and with a variable presentation among individuals. Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose patients early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that patients may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to patients for whom referral is recommended."

		"abstract": "Ticks and the pathogens they transmit, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths, constitute a growing burden for human and animal health worldwide. The ability of some animal species to acquire resistance to blood-feeding by ticks after a single or repeated infestation is known as acquired tick resistance (ATR). This resistance has been associated to tick-specific IgE response, the generation of skin-resident memory CD4+ T cells, basophil recruitment, histamine release, and epidermal hyperplasia. ATR has also been associated with protection to tick-borne tularemia through allergic klendusity, a disease-escaping ability produced by the development of hypersensitivity to an allergen. In addition to pathogen transmission, tick infestation in humans is associated with the α-Gal syndrome (AGS), a type of allergy characterized by an IgE response against the carbohydrate Galα1-3Gal (α-Gal). This glycan is present in tick salivary proteins and on the surface of tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agents of Lyme disease and granulocytic anaplasmosis. Most α-Gal-sensitized individuals develop IgE specific against this glycan, but only a small fraction develop the AGS. This review summarizes our current understanding of ATR and its impact on the continuum α-Gal sensitization, allergy, and the AGS. We propose that the α-Gal-specific IgE response in humans is an evolutionary adaptation associated with ATR and allergic klendusity with the trade-off of developing AGS."

		"abstract": "SUMMARYThe Borrelia spp. are tick-borne pathogenic spirochetes that include the agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. As part of their life cycle, the spirochetes traffic between the tick vector and the vertebrate host, which requires significant physiological changes and remodeling of their outer membranes and proteome. This crucial proteome resculpting is carried out by a diverse set of proteases, adaptor proteins, and related chaperones. Despite its small genome, Borrelia burgdorferi has dedicated a large percentage of its genome to proteolysis, including a full complement of ATP-dependent proteases. Energy-driven proteolysis appears to be an important physiological feature of this dual-life-cycle bacterium. The proteolytic arsenal of Borrelia is strategically deployed for disposal of proteins no longer required as they move from one stage to another or are transferred from one host to another. Likewise, the Borrelia spp. are systemic organisms that need to break down and move through host tissues and barriers, and so their unique proteolytic resources, both endogenous and borrowed, make movement more feasible. Both the Lyme disease and relapsing fever Borrelia spp. bind plasminogen as well as numerous components of the mammalian plasminogen-activating system. This recruitment capacity endows the spirochetes with a borrowed proteolytic competency that can lead to increased invasiveness."

While advances in sequencing technologies have accelerated a descriptive understanding of the tick microbiome, molecular and mechanistic insights into the tick microbiome are only beginning to emerge. Progress is stymied by technical difficulties in manipulating the microbiome and by biological variables related to the life cycle of Ixodid ticks. This review highlights these challenges and examines avenues to understand the significance of the tick microbiome in tick biology."

Nervous system involvement is known as Lyme neuroborreliosis; it only occurs in disseminated Lyme disease and is manifested by the classic triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis. Timeline is a significant factor when staging Lyme manifestations. However, certain cases do not follow the typical presentation timelines described in most literature. We report a case of a 66-year-old male who presented with progressively worsening generalized body aches, severe fatigue, and new-onset urine retention for two weeks. Physical examination revealed severe pain with neck flexion and lying supine and diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed a positive Lyme immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody with lymphocytic pleocytosis on lumbar puncture. He was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone for early disseminated Lyme disease. His radicular pain responded well to therapy, and he regained full bladder function. Bannwarth syndrome (BWS) is a term applied to the constellation of painful radiculoneuritis characterized as severe, burning, often dermatomal pain. In most cases, BWS affects the limbs, with only a few reported cases of sacral radiculitis causing neurogenic urinary dysfunction. Early recognition of this rare presentation associated with Lyme disease and treatment with antibiotics can prevent disease progression and detrimental neurological sequelae."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes of the family Borreliaceae are, with one exception, tick-borne pathogens of a variety of vertebrates. The family at present comprises two genera: Borrelia (Swellengrebel), which includes the agents of relapsing fever, avian spirochetosis, and bovine borreliosis, and Borreliella (Gupta et al.), which includes the agents of Lyme disease and was formerly known as 'Borrelia burgdorferi sensulato complex'. The two genera are distinguished not only by their disease associations but also biological features in the tick vector, including tissue location in unfed ticks and transovarial transmission. Borrelia species transmitted by argasid (soft) ticks tend to have more exclusive relationships with their tick vectors than do other Borrelia species and all Borreliella species that have ixodid (hard) ticks as vectors. The division of genera is supported by phylogenomic evidence from whole genomes and by several specific molecular markers. These distinguishing phylogenetic criteria also applied to three new species or isolates of Borrelia that were discovered in ixodid ticks of reptiles, a monotreme, and birds. Although the deep branching of the family from other spirochetes has been a challenge for inferences about evolution of the family, the discovery of related microorganisms in the gut microbiota of other arachnids suggests an ancestral origin for the family as symbionts of ticks and other arachnids."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases in California include Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi), infections with Borrelia miyamotoi, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum). We surveyed multiple sites and habitats (woodland, grassland, and coastal chaparral) in California to describe spatial patterns of tick-borne pathogen prevalence in western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). We found that several species of Borrelia-B. burgdorferi, Borrelia americana, and Borrelia bissettiae-were observed in habitats, such as coastal chaparral, that do not harbor obvious reservoir host candidates. Describing tick-borne pathogen prevalence is strongly influenced by the scale of surveillance: aggregating data from individual sites to match jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., county or state) can lower the reported infection prevalence. Considering multiple pathogen species in the same habitat allows a more cohesive interpretation of local pathogen occurrence. IMPORTANCE Understanding the local host ecology and prevalence of zoonotic diseases is vital for public health. Using tick-borne diseases in California, we show that there is often a bias to our understanding and that studies tend to focus on particular habitats, e.g., Lyme disease in oak woodlands. Other habitats may harbor a surprising diversity of tick-borne pathogens but have been neglected, e.g., coastal chaparral. Explaining pathogen prevalence requires descriptions of data on a local scale; otherwise, aggregating the data can misrepresent the local dynamics of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "A 70-year-old man presented to the emergency department with fevers, ankle edema and nausea following a presumed insect bite on his ankle 1 month prior. On examination, he was febrile and had left leg pain with passive range of motion. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and elevated aminotransaminases. Due to his recent travel to the Northeastern United States, he was suspected of having a possible tick-borne illness. Serologies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, and the patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. He was treated with doxycyline, atovaquone and azithromycin, leading to resolution of symptoms. While co-infection with Lyme disease is common, infection with three tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever (RF), caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, is a globally distributed, vector-borne disease with high prevalence in developing countries. To date, signaling pathways required for infection and virulence of RF Borrelia spirochetes are unknown. Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), synthesized by diadenylate cyclases (DACs), is a second messenger predominantly found in Gram-positive organisms that is linked to virulence and essential physiological processes. Although Borrelia is Gram-negative, it encodes one DAC (CdaA), and its importance remains undefined. To investigate the contribution of c-di-AMP signaling in the RF bacterium Borrelia turicatae, a cdaA mutant was generated. The mutant was significantly attenuated during murine infection, and genetic complementation reversed this phenotype. Because c-di-AMP is essential for viability in many bacteria, whole-genome sequencing was performed on cdaA mutants, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified potential suppressor mutations. Additionally, conditional mutation of cdaA confirmed that CdaA is important for normal growth and physiology. Interestingly, mutation of cdaA did not affect expression of homologs of virulence regulators whose levels are impacted by c-di-AMP signaling in the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi Finally, the cdaA mutant had a significant growth defect when grown with salts, at decreased osmolarity, and without pyruvate. While the salt treatment phenotype was not reversed by genetic complementation, possibly due to suppressor mutations, growth defects at decreased osmolarity and in media lacking pyruvate could be attributed directly to cdaA inactivation. Overall, these results indicate CdaA is critical for B. turicatae pathogenesis and link c-di-AMP to osmoregulation and central metabolism in RF spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. Though human infection is mostly transmitted in a limited geography, the range has expanded in recent years. One notable area of recent expansion is in the mountainous region of southwestern Virginia. The ecological factors that facilitate or constrain the range of human Lyme disease in this region remain uncertain. To evaluate this further, we obtained ecological data, including remotely sensed data on forest structure and vegetation, weather data, and elevation. These data were aggregated within the census block groups of a 9,153 km2 area around the cities of Blacksburg and Roanoke, VA, an area with heterogeneous Lyme disease transmission. In this geographic area, 755 individuals were reported to have Lyme disease in the 10 yr from 2006 to 2015, and these cases were aggregated by block group. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to evaluate which environmental variables influenced the abundance of Lyme disease cases. Higher elevation and higher vegetation density had the greatest effect size on the abundance of Lyme disease. Measures of forest edge, forest integrity, temperature, and humidity were not associated with Lyme disease cases. Future southward expansion of Lyme disease into the southeastern states may be most likely in ecologically similar mountainous areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease that is widespread throughout the northern hemisphere. Ixodes ricinus is present throughout metropolitan France, except for the Mediterranean region. The debate revolves around whether or not a chronic form of Lyme disease exists. This controversy is not limited to France but has been reported worldwide. In France, in 2019, 24 scientific societies representing the medical disciplines most involved in Lyme disease, including the Société Française de Rhumatologie (French Rheumatology Society [SFR]) and the Société de Pathologie Infectieuse de la Langue Française (French Infectious Disease Society-SPILF), published recommendations on the management of Lyme borreliosis following a submission to the Director General of Health. These recommendations conflict with those of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), a multi-specialties independent group of physician, on a key point: whether to add a new nosological entity labeled as \"persistent polymorphous signs and symptoms (or syndrome) possibly due to tick bite.\" The creation of this new syndrome risks should increase anchoring bias, leading to the attribution of all symptoms to a possible tick bite, without considering differential diagnoses. Lyme disease has been extensively studied. Erythema migrans is the primary clinical manifestation. In the presence of nonmetabolic, nonseptic monoarthritis involving the knee or radiculitis of a lower limb during the summer, Lyme disease should be suspected. Serologic testing for Lyme disease is reliable in the case of late forms such as chronic arthritis, while the detection of Borrelia DNA in synovial fluid by PCR is inconsistent. Sometimes, the serology can be misleading in early forms such as radiculitis. Treatment is based on doxycycline for 14 days in early forms (radiculitis), or 28 days in late forms (arthritis). Arthritis can persist or recur after antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of a diffuse polyalgia syndrome (fibromyalgia) following Lyme disease does not seem to differ much from that in the general population. It is not improved by prolonged antibiotic therapy, which is therefore not recommended."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), is a life-threatening disease with clinical symptoms ranging from non-specific to severe inflammation of the central nervous system. Despite TBE is a notifiable disease in Serbia since 2004, there is no active TBE surveillance program for the serologic or molecular screening of TBEV infection in humans in the country. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the TBEV exposure among tick-infested individuals in Serbia during the year 2020. A total of 113 individuals exposed to tick bites were recruited for the study and screened for anti-TBEV antibodies using a commercial indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) test. Blood samples from 50 healthy donors not exposed to tick bites were included as a control group. Most of the enrolled patients reported infestations with one tick, being I. ricinus the most frequent tick found in the participants. The TBEV seroprevalence was higher (13.27%, 15 total 113) in tick-infested individuals than in healthy donors (4%, 2 total 50), although the difference was not significant. Notably, male individuals exposed to tick bites showed five times higher relative risk (RR) of being TBEV-seropositive than healthy donors of the same gender (RR= 5.1, CI = 1.6-19; p = 0.007). None of the seropositive individuals developed clinical manifestations of TBE, but the first clinical-stage of Lyme borreliosis (i.e., erythema migrans) was detected in seven of them. Potential TBEV foci were identified in rural areas, mostly in proximity or within the Fruška Gora mountain. We conclude that the Serbian population is at high risk of TBEV exposure. Further epidemiological studies should focus on potential TBEV foci identified in this study. The implementation of active surveillance for TBEV might contribute to evaluating the potential negative impact of TBE in Serbia."

From our search, we were able to find evidence of eight tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, Babesiosis, Lyme disease, Bourbon virus disease, Colorado tick fever disease, Tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever) affecting the bone. Pathological bone effects most commonly associated with tick-borne infections were disruption of bone marrow function and bone loss. Most research to date on the effects of tick-borne pathogen infections on bone has been quite preliminary. Further investigation of this topic is warranted."

However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later \"febrile patients\") based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in Serbia and other European countries. Rabies is a fatal zoonosis distributed worldwide and is caused by the rabies virus. Professionals at risk of rabies-including veterinarians, hunters, communal service workers, and forestry workers-overlap with some professions at a higher risk of exposure to tick bites and tick-borne pathogen infections. We hypothesized that individuals identified by the public health system as at risk of rabies virus infection, and consequently vaccinated against rabies virus, also share a higher likelihood of Borrelia exposure. To test our hypothesis, a case-control study was carried out during 2019 in Serbia to determine the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies in two case groups (individuals at risk and vaccinated against rabies virus) and a control group (individuals without risk of rabies). Individuals vaccinated against rabies following either \"pre-exposure protocol\" (PrEP, n = 58) or \"post-exposure protocol\" (PEP, n = 42) were considered as rabies risk groups and healthy blood donors (n = 30) as the control group. The results showed higher Borrelia seroprevalence in PrEP (17.2%; 10/58) and PEP (19.0%; 8/42) groups compared with the control group (6.67%; 2/30). Furthermore, odds ratio (OR) analysis showed that risk of rabies (in either the PrEP (OR = 2.91) or PEP (OR = 3.29) groups) is associated with increased odds of being seropositive to Borrelia. However, the difference in Borrelia seroprevalence between groups was not statistically significant (Chi-square (χ²) test p > 0.05). The shared odds of LB and rabies exposure found in this study suggest that, in countries where both diseases occur, the common citizen can be at risk of both diseases when in a risky habitat. These findings are important to guide physicians in targeting high-risk groups, and diagnose LB, and to guide decision-makers in targeting control and prevention measures for both infections in risk areas."

		"abstract": "In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country. The conclusion of this review is extending the requirement of greater efforts in research and government management for the diagnosis and treatment and as well as prevention of these diseases so that tick-borne disease burden should be minimizing in India."

		"abstract": "In recent years, the number of recorded cases of Borrelia burgdorferi infections causing Lyme borreliosis has been on a steady rise in Poland. A wide spectrum of disorders in the peripheral and central nervous system is observed in the course of such infections. Symptoms which are not clear-cut are reported by approx. 10-25% of all people infected with B. burgdorferi. They may concern both the somatic and mental spheres, which in turn significantly impedes the daily functioning of the patients. The main purpose of the research was to compare the mental health status of people with neuroborreliosis with that of healthy people. An answer was also obtained to the question of whether people with neuroborreliosis experience difficulties in functioning in the following areas: family, social, professional and educational. The study included 60 people: 30 people with the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis and 30 healthy people aged 18-47. The mean age in the study group was 28.6 years. As a research tool, the General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) by Goldberg was used along with a socio-demographic questionnaire. The subjects diagnosed with neuroborreliosis obtained higher results in GHQ-28, both on individual scales: Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety, Insomnia, Social Dysfunction, Severe Depression, as well as the overall result, which is an indicator of the mental health status. As much as 70% of the patients experienced difficulties in functioning in the social area, 66% in the professional area, and 60% in the educational area. No impact of the disease on functioning in the family area has been demonstrated. The results of the study indicate some significant differences in the mental health status of people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis and that of healthy people. The patients obtained significantly higher results in GHQ-28 than the healthy subjects, which proves the poor mental health of the former. It was also confirmed that people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis experience difficulties in functioning in the social, professional and educational areas. Therefore, it becomes crucial to deepen research into mental health in tick-borne diseases, including neuroborreliosis, and to adapt and implement appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.

		"abstract": "Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

		"abstract": "A tick infestation is one of the most common arthropod-related skin diseases in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Ticks also act as an infectious disease vector for humans. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a highly mortal central nervous system infection caused by TBE virus (TBEV), has sporadically occurred there recently. However, there have been no epidemiological data on the current surveillance of human tick bites and the prevalence of TBEV in human-feeding ticks. This study was performed to clarify those indeterminate issues. One hundred and fifty-three ixodid ticks feeding on humans were collected from 150 outpatients in Hokkaido during the season of April to August 2018. None of the cases showed any infectious symptoms. These ticks were morphologically identified to species, and a cytopathic assay on baby hamster kidney cells was carried out to detect TBEV from each tick. The tick collection consisted of 108 Ixodes persulcatus (one nymph and 107 adult females), 44 female Ixodes ovatus, and one female Haemaphysalis japonica. No tick extracts showed positive results of the cytopathic assay, suggesting the non-existence of TBEV in the present specimens. However, the survey to detect TBEV from human-feeding ticks is still important to monitor the occurrence of TBE, because human tick bites by I. ovatus, a possible vector of TBEV, are increasing even in the northern and eastern areas of Hokkaido."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Over a 15-year period (2004-2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2 years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Tick saliva is a rich source of pharmacologically and immunologically active molecules. These salivary components are indispensable for successful blood feeding on vertebrate hosts and are believed to facilitate the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Here we present the functional and structural characterization of Iripin-3, a protein expressed in the salivary glands of the tick Ixodes ricinus, a European vector of tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. Belonging to the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors, Iripin-3 strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of serine proteases kallikrein and matriptase. In an in vitro setup, Iripin-3 was capable of modulating the adaptive immune response as evidenced by reduced survival of mouse splenocytes, impaired proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, suppression of the T helper type 1 immune response, and induction of regulatory T cell differentiation. Apart from altering acquired immunity, Iripin-3 also inhibited the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition to its functional characterization, we present the crystal structure of cleaved Iripin-3 at 1.95 Å resolution. Iripin-3 proved to be a pluripotent salivary serpin with immunomodulatory and anti-hemostatic properties that could facilitate tick feeding via the suppression of host anti-tick defenses. Physiological relevance of Iripin-3 activities observed in vitro needs to be supported by appropriate in vivo experiments."

The objective of this report was to perform preliminary serological survey of hospitalized population for LB. Methods: Sera were collected from 203 patients of a hospital located in Western Ukraine. Most patients showed clinical signs that were compatible with LB such as arthritis (n = 29), neurological signs (n = 35), and erythema migrans (EM)-like lesions (n = 60) or unrelated to LB (n = 79). The specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot for anti-Borrelia antibodies. Results: LB was confirmed in 8.6%, 34.5%, and 50% of the patients, who exhibited neurological signs, arthritis, or EM-like lesions, respectively. Anti-Borrelia antibodies were also detected in 6.3% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Conclusions: This study provides the first preliminary data on the seroprevalence of LB in Ukraine. Future studies are warranted to investigate more subsets of the Ukrainian population for this emerging tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "Ticks are obligate hematophagous parasites and are important vectors of a wide variety of pathogens. These pathogens include spirochetes in the genus Borrelia that cause Lyme disease, rickettsial pathogens, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, among others. Due to their prolonged feeding period of up to two weeks, hard ticks must counteract vertebrate host defense reactions in order to survive and reproduce. To overcome host defense mechanisms, ticks have evolved a large number of pharmacologically active molecules that are secreted in their saliva, which inhibits or modulates host immune defenses and wound healing responses upon injection into the bite site. These bioactive molecules in tick saliva can create a privileged environment in the host's skin that tick-borne pathogens take advantage of. In fact, evidence is accumulating that tick-transmitted pathogens manipulate tick saliva composition to enhance their own survival, transmission, and evasion of host defenses. We review what is known about specific and functionally characterized tick saliva molecules in the context of tick infection with the genus Borrelia, the intracellular pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Additionally, we review studies analyzing sialome-level responses to pathogen challenge."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD. As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins (n=645) than uninfected ticks (n=376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H2O2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H2O2, and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H2O2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD."

		"abstract": "Pathogen species often consist of genetically distinct strains, which can establish mixed infections or coinfections in the host. In coinfections, interactions between pathogen strains can have important consequences for their transmission success. We used the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which is the most common cause of Lyme disease in Europe, as a model multi-strain pathogen to investigate the relationship between coinfection, competition between strains, and strain-specific transmission success. Mus musculus mice were infected with one or two strains of B. afzelii, strain transmission success was measured by feeding ticks on mice, and the distribution of each strain in six different mouse organs and the ticks was measured using qPCR. Coinfection and competition reduced the tissue infection prevalence of both strains and changed their bacterial abundance in some tissues. Coinfection and competition also reduced the transmission success of the B. afzelii strains from the infected hosts to feeding ticks. The ability of the B. afzelii strains to establish infection in the host tissues was strongly correlated with their transmission success to the tick vector. Our study demonstrates that coinfection and competition between pathogen strains inside the host tissues can have major consequences for their transmission success."

The presence of Theileria equi genetic material was detected in 37 out of 512 examined horses (7.2%), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 9 (1.8%). The DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi was found in 11 out of 204 examined horses (5.4%).

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is predominantly caused by Borrelia afzelii and transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Although Borrelia behavior throughout tick development is quite well documented, specific molecular interactions between Borrelia and the tick have not been satisfactorily examined. Here, we present the first transcriptomic study focused on the expression of tick midgut genes regulated by Borrelia. By using massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE), we searched for tick transcripts expressed differentially in the midgut of unfed, 24h-fed, and fully fed I. ricinus nymphs infected with B. afzelii. In total, we identified 553 upregulated and 530 downregulated tick genes and demonstrated that B. afzelii interacts intensively with the tick. Technical and biological validations confirmed the accuracy of the transcriptome. The expression of five validated tick genes was silenced by RNA interference. Silencing of the uncharacterized protein (GXP_Contig_30818) delayed the infection progress and decreased infection prevalence in the target mice tissues. Silencing of other genes did not significantly affect tick feeding nor the transmission of B. afzelii, suggesting a possible role of these genes rather in Borrelia acquisition or persistence in ticks. Identification of genes and proteins exploited by Borrelia during transmission and establishment in a tick could help the development of novel preventive strategies for Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Throughout its enzootic cycle, the Lyme disease spirochete Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi, senses and responds to changes in its environment using a small repertoire of transcription factors that coordinate the expression of genes required for infection of Ixodes ticks and various mammalian hosts. Among these transcription factors, the DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in B. burgdorferi during periods of nutrient limitation and is required for mammalian infectivity. In many pathogenic bacteria, the gene regulatory activity of DksA, along with the alarmone guanosine penta- and tetra-phosphate ((p)ppGpp), coordinate the stringent response to various environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of DksA in regulating the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase and its role in the regulation of RpoS-dependent gene expression required for B. burgdorferi infectivity. Using in vitro transcription assays, we observed recombinant DksA inhibits RpoD-dependent transcription by B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase independent of ppGpp. Additionally, we determined the pH-inducible expression of RpoS-dependent genes relies on DksA, but this relationship is independent of (p)ppGpp produced by Relbbu. Subsequent transcriptomic and western blot assays indicate DksA regulates the expression of BBD18, a protein previously implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS. Moreover, we observed DksA was required for infection of mice following intraperitoneal inoculation or for transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Together, these data suggest DksA plays a central role in coordinating transcriptional responses in B. burgdorferi required for infectivity through DksA's interactions with RNA polymerase and post-transcriptional control of RpoS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus, the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens."

A total of 105 field surveys were done from 2016 to 2018 in 41 sites, from north to south, in the prefecture. All 4806 ticks collected were identified and classified by species, sex, and developmental stage. Twelve species were recorded: Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis hystricis, Haemaphysalis japonica, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Ixodes ovatus, Ixodes nipponensis, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes monospinosus, Ixodes columnae, and Ixodes turdus. The major tick species in Niigata prefecture were H. flava, H. longicornis, and I. ovatus and they comprised 93.4% of all samples. These three species have one generation per year. Climatic and anthropogenic factors may be involved in the substantial change of the endemic species composition from a previous tick survey (1959) in the Niigata prefecture. These factors include increasing temperatures, introduction of new hosts such as the wild boar, highway construction, and a rural exodus facilitating animal migration and reproduction. Tick hosts suitable for the transmission of Japanese spotted fever, Lyme borreliosis, and SFTS occur in Niigata prefecture. Heightened awareness of these three tick-borne diseases is needed for preparation and disease prevention."

		"abstract": "In children, tick-borne encephalitis and neuroborreliosis are common infections affecting the central nervous system. As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

A total number of 162 sheep met the inclusion criteria, allocated in four groups based on the presence or absence of IgG and/or IgM; sheep found negative for IgM and IgG (Group A), positive for IgM (Group B), positive for both IgM and IgG (Group C) and positive for IgG (Group D). Anemia, thrombocytopenia and normal or decreased leukocyte count, mainly due to lymphopenia were the main hematological features observed in seropositive sheep. The presence of these features raises the suspicion of Borrelia infection in tick infested sheep. The seropositivity of 23.58% in sheep raises concerns of Borrelia circulation, especially in rural areas and potential risk of transmission to humans."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that occurs in stages, multiple organs and tissue with highly variable clinical presentation. Most commonly, it presents with seventh cranial nerve palsy, often mimicking stroke and atypical rash (erythema migrans). Atypical presentations include abdominal pain, ileus/pseudo-obstruction and constipation thought to be due to autonomic dysfunction. Other less common presentations include Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormones (SIADH). Lyme disease should be a differential when a patient presents from Lyme endemic areas with abdominal pain, constipation and SIADH in the setting of other causes of gastrointestinal and renal symptoms ruled out. Here we present a case of multisystem involvement in a single patient with Lyme Disease along with neuroborreliosis (neurological manifestation of Lyme disease)."

		"abstract": "In the United States, exposure to human-biting ixodid ticks can occur while spending time on residential properties or in neighborhood green spaces as well as during recreational or occupational activities on public lands. Human-biting tick species collectively transmit >15 species of pathogenic microorganisms and the national burden of tick-borne diseases is increasing. The prospect of a new Lyme disease vaccine for use in humans provides hope for substantial reduction in the >450,000 estimated annual cases of Lyme disease but this breakthrough would not reduce cases of other tick-borne diseases, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsiosis, and Powassan encephalitis. One intriguing question is to what extent a new Lyme disease vaccine would impact the use of personal protection measures acting broadly against tick-bites. The main tick vector for Lyme disease spirochetes in the eastern United States, Ixodes scapularis, also transmits causative agents of anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan encephalitis; and this tick species co-occurs with other human-biting vectors such as Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis. It therefore is important that a new Lyme disease vaccine does not result in reduced use of tick-bite prevention measures, such as tick repellents, permethrin-treated clothing, and frequent tick checks. Another key issue is the continuing problem with tick exposure on residential properties, which represents a heavily used outdoor environment the residents cannot reasonably avoid and where they tend to spend large amounts of time outside. As it may not be realistic to keep up daily vigilance with personal protective measures against tick-bites on residential properties during many months of every year, homeowners may also consider the option to suppress host-seeking ticks by means of deer fencing, landscaping, vegetation management, and use of products to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks infesting rodents. When considering the full range of options for actions that can be taken to suppress host-seeking ticks on residential properties, it is clear that individual homeowners face a difficult and bewildering task in deciding what to do based on very general guidance from public health agencies (developed without the benefit of a strong evidence base) and often without ready access to local public health professionals experienced in tick control. This situation is not satisfactory but cannot be corrected without first addressing knowledge gaps regarding the impact of peridomestic tick control measures on host-seeking ticks, human tick-bites, and tick-borne diseases. In parallel with this effort, there also is a need to increase the local public health workforce with knowledge of and experience with tick control to provide better access for homeowners to sound and objective advice regarding tick control on their properties based on key characteristics of the landscaping, habitat composition, and use patterns by wild animal tick hosts as well as the residents."

		"abstract": "Although tick-borne diseases account for a large number of health care visits in the United States, clinical practices for tick bite and Lyme disease treatment and prevention are not well understood. The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli's DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

		"abstract": "Canadians face an emerging threat of Lyme disease due to the northward expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. We evaluated the degree of I. scapularis population establishment and Borrelia burgdorferi occurrence in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 2017-2019 using active surveillance at 28 sites. We used a field indicator tool developed by Clow et al. to determine the risk of I. scapularis establishment for each tick cohort at each site using the results of drag sampling. Based on results obtained with the field indicator tool, we assigned each site an ecological classification describing the pattern of tick colonization over two successive cohorts (cohort 1 was comprised of ticks collected in fall 2017 and spring 2018, and cohort 2 was collected in fall 2018 and spring 2019). Total annual site-specific I. scapularis density ranged from 0 to 16.3 ticks per person-hour. Sites with the highest density were located within the Greenbelt zone, in the suburban/rural areas in the western portion of the city of Ottawa, and along the Ottawa River; the lowest densities occurred at sites in the suburban/urban core. B. burgdorferi infection rates exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern. Of the 23 sites for which data for two tick cohorts were available, 11 sites were classified as \"high-stable\", 4 were classified as \"emerging\", 2 were classified as \"low-stable\", and 6 were classified as \"non-zero\". B. burgdorferi-infected ticks were found at all high-stable sites, and at one emerging site. These findings suggest that high-stable sites pose a risk of Lyme disease exposure to the community as they have reproducing tick populations with consistent levels of B. burgdorferi infection. Continued surveillance for I. scapularis, B. burgdorferi, and range expansion of other tick species and emerging tick-borne pathogens is important to identify areas posing a high risk for human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the face of ongoing climate change and urban expansion."

		"abstract": "The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.IMPORTANCE Blood-feeding arthropod microbiomes often play important roles in disease transmission, yet the factors that structure tick microbial communities in the Neotropics are unknown. Utilizing ticks collected from live animals in neotropical forest fragments, this study teases apart the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tick-associated factors on tick microbial composition as well as which specific microbes contribute to differences across tick species, tick life stages, the mammals they fed on, and the locations from where they were sampled. Furthermore, this study provides revelations of how notable tick-associated bacterial genera are interacting with other tick-associated microbes as well as the forest animals they encounter."

When the disease affects the central nervous system, it is referred to as neuroborreliosis. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is most often caused by Borrelia garinii. Although it is known that in the host Lyme borreliae spread from the tick bite site to distant tissues via the blood vasculature, the adherence of Lyme borreliae to human brain microvascular endothelial cells has not been studied before. Decorin binding proteins are adhesins expressed on Lyme borreliae. They mediate the adhesion of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan, and the lysine residues located in the binding site of decorin binding proteins are important to the binding activity. In this study, we show that lysine residues located in the canonical binding site can also be found in decorin binding proteins of Borrelia garinii, and that these lysines contribute to biglycan and decorin binding. Most importantly, we show that the lysine residues are crucial for the binding of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan expressing human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which in turn suggests that they are involved in the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis."

Here we present results of a study on tick-borne pathogens detected from tick vectors and rodent reservoirs from an ongoing 5-yr tick suppression study in the Lyme disease-endemic state of Maryland, where human-biting tick species, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes), are abundant. During the 2017 tick season, we collected 207 questing ticks and 602 ticks recovered from 327 mice (Peromyscus spp. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)), together with blood and ear tissue from the mice, at seven suburban parks in Howard County. Ticks were selectively tested for the presence of the causative agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [s.l.]), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), babesiosis (Babesia microti), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 'Panola Mountain' Ehrlichia) and spotted fever group rickettsiosis (Rickettsia spp.). Peromyscus ear tissue and blood samples were tested for Bo. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s), A. phagocytophilum, Ba. microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi. We found 13.6% (15/110) of questing I. scapularis nymphs to be Bo. burgdorferi s.l. positive and 1.8% (2/110) were A. phagocytophilum positive among all sites. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was found in 71.1% (54/76) of I. scapularis nymphs removed from mice and 58.8% (194/330) of captured mice. Results from study on tick abundance and pathogen infection status in questing ticks, rodent reservoirs, and ticks feeding on Peromyscus spp. will aid efficacy evaluation of the integrated tick management measures being implemented."

		"abstract": "In the clinical setting, it is not common practice to consider a vector bite, such as from a tick or flea, to be a contributing factor to chronic digestive symptoms. This article investigates associations we have observed among symptomatic patients and positive blood tests for vector-borne illness (VBI). Patients who visited an urban gastroenterology clinic over a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 270 patients presenting with a constellation of digestive symptoms - and who had no apparent digestive pathology and reported no prior diagnosis or treatments for VBI - were analyzed. Before the initial visit, all patients completed a review of systems medical history form, which comprised 19 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and 73 non-GI-related symptoms and conditions. Patients were tested for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by lactulose breath test. VBI (babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis) was established using 1 or more of several blood tests. Odds ratio (OR) analysis determined associations between exposure to VBI, SIBO, and presenting symptoms/conditions. Two age groups (≤35 years and ≥36 years) were studied using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratum-based test. A higher OR (2.03, 95% CI: 1.5-3.6) was found between patients with ≥3 digestive symptoms and positive blood tests for ≥1 VBI. Five of the 19 GI symptoms were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: food intolerance, indigestion, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and heartburn. A similar association in patients with ≥3 non-GI symptoms (OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.3-6.4) was observed. Five of the 73 non-GI symptoms/conditions were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: chest pain, shortness of breath, extremity or joint pain, anxiety, and night sweats. Having ≥3 of any digestive or nondigestive symptoms generated significant relative risk of being VBI-positive. Presence of SIBO alone did not identify significant relative risk for a VBI, and age was not a confounder. Findings revealed an association between positive blood tests for vector-borne illness and chronically symptomatic patients regardless of whether symptoms were digestive or nondigestive. The manifestation of 3 or more gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms should raise suspicion for a VBI."

A region immediately downstream of the 16S rRNA gene, which included the gene encoding SdhC, was sequenced. For the A. phagocytophilum strains from patients no sequence differences were detected in this region. In contrast, significantly fewer ticks had a sequence encoding SdhC that was identical to that of the human strains (11/16 vs. 16/16, p = 0.04). This variation is consistent with the premise that not all A. phagocytophilum strains present in nature are able to cause clinical illness in humans. A strain referred to as A. phagocytophilumVariant-1 that is regarded as non-pathogenic for humans was previously described using a different typing method. Data from the current study suggest that both typing methods are identifying the same non-pathogenic strains."

The age, sex, and geographic composition of the enrolled population during 2010-2018 remained proportionally stable, despite fluctuations in the number of enrollees. Annual incidence of Lyme disease diagnoses per 100,000 enrollees ranged from 49 to 88, ≈6-8 times higher than that observed for cases reported through notifiable disease surveillance. Age and sex distributions among Lyme disease diagnoses in MarketScan were similar to those of cases reported through surveillance, but proportionally more diagnoses occurred outside of peak summer months, among female enrollees, and outside high-incidence states. Misdiagnoses, particularly in low-incidence states, may account for some of the observed epidemiologic differences. Commercial claims provide a stable data source to monitor trends in Lyme disease diagnoses, but certain important characteristics warrant further investigation."

The environmental and human components of Lyme disease risk in open habitats remain unknown. We quantified the environmental hazard and risk factors for human tick bite exposure among treeless islands with low and high Lyme disease incidence in the Western Isles. We found a higher prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks on high-incidence than on low-incidence islands (6.4% vs. 0.7%); we also found that residents of high-incidence islands reported increased tick bite exposure. Most tick bites (72.7%) occurred <1 km from the home, including many in home gardens. Residents of high Lyme disease incidence islands reported increasing problems with ticks; many suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. We highlight the benefits of an integrated approach in understanding the factors that contribute to Lyme disease emergence."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochete that causes Lyme Borreliosis (LB), which is a zoonotic tick-borne disease of humans and domestic animals. Hard ticks are obligate haematophagous ectoparasites that serve as vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi. Studies on the presence of Lyme borreliosis in Egyptian animals and associated ticks are scarce. This study was conducted to detect B. burgdorferi in different tick vectors and animal hosts. Three hundred animals (dogs=100, cattle=100, and camels=100) were inspected for tick infestation. Blood samples from 160 tick-infested animals and their associated ticks (n=1025) were collected and examined for the infection with B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The identified tick species were characterized molecularly by PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 region. The overall tick infestation rate among examined animals was 78.33% (235/300). The rate of infestation was significantly higher in camels (90%), followed by cattle (76%) and dogs (69%); (P = 0.001). Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, and both Hyalomma dromedarii and Amblyomma variegatum, were morphologically identified from infested dogs, cattle, and camels; respectively. Molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region confirmed the morphological identification, as well as displayed high similarities of R. sanguineus, H. dromedarii, and A. Variegatu with ticks identified in Egypt and various continents worldwide. Just one dog (1.67%) and its associated tick pool of R. sanguineus were positive for B. burgdorferi infection. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for B. burgdorferi in dog and R. sanguineus tick pool showed a 100% homology. Analyzed data revealed a relatively low rate of B. burgdorferi infection, but a significantly high prevalence of tick infestation among domesticated animals in Egypt, which possesses a potential animal and public health risk. Additionally, molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region was a reliable tool to discriminate species of ticks and confirmed the morphological identification."

To date, in the US, LD diagnostics is primarily based on validated two-tiered serological testing, which overall exhibits low sensitivity among other drawbacks. In the present study, a potential of Raman spectroscopy (RS) to detect Bb infection in mice has been explored. For that, C3H mice were infected with wild-type Bb strains, 297, B31, or B31-derived mutant, ∆vlsE. Blood samples taken prior to and post Bb infection were subjected to RS. The data demonstrated that RS did not directly detect Bb spirochetes in blood, but rather sensed biochemical changes associated with Bb infection. Despite Bb infection-associated blood changes detectable by RS were very limited, the partial least square discriminant analysis showed that the average true positive rates were 86% for 297 and 89% for B31 and ∆vlsE."

		"abstract": "The ecology of vector-borne diseases in a region can be attributed to vector-host interactions. In the United States, tick-borne pathogens are the cause of the highest number of reported vector-borne diseases. In the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, have increased in incidence, with tick-host-pathogen interactions considered a contributing factor to this increase. Ticks become infected with pathogens after taking a blood meal from a systemically infected host or through a localized infection while co-feeding on a host with other infected ticks. The host not only plays a role in pathogen acquisition by the tick, but can also facilitate dispersal of the tick locally within a region or over greater distances into new geographical ranges outside of their historical distributional range. In this study conducted in southeastern Virginia (USA), we examined the interaction between both resident and migratory bird species and Ixodes ticks, the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) the main causative agent of Lyme disease on the East coast of the United States. Over a two-year period (2012-2014), 1879 passerine birds were surveyed, with 255 Ixodes ticks tested for the presence of Borrelia spp. Eighty passerine birds (4.3 %) representing 17 bird species were parasitized by at least one Ixodes tick, but only three bird species were parasitized by Ixodes ticks that tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. Twenty Ixodes ticks (7.8 %) tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. with nearly all collected from resident bird species including the Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) and brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum). Given that millions of birds pass through southeastern Virginia during migration, even with the low number of Ixodes ticks parasitizing passerine birds and the low prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.s. found within Ixodes ticks collected, the sheer volume of passerine birds suggests they may play a role in the maintenance and dispersal of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Virginia."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector of several tick-borne pathogens, including those causing Lyme disease and babesiosis, in the eastern United States and active collection methods for this species include dragging or wild animal sampling. Nest boxes targeting mice may be an alternative strategy for the surveillance and collection of immature I. scapularis feeding on these hosts and would be much safer for animals compared to small mammal trapping. We constructed double-walled insulated nest boxes (DWINs) with collection tubes mounted below the nesting chamber and deployed eleven in southern Wisconsin from June until September of 2020. The DWINs were occupied by Peromyscus spp. and birds (wren species, Troglodytidae family). We collected 192 ticks from collection tubes, all of which were identified as either I. scapularis (95%) or Dermacentor variabilis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (5%). Only 12% (21/182) and 20% (2/10) of I. scapularis and D. variabilis were blood-fed, respectively. The high proportion of unfed ticks found in collection tubes may be due to grooming by hosts inside the nest boxes. Alternatively, immature ticks may have climbed trees and entered the DWIN seeking a host. Results suggest that nest boxes could be a tool for finding ticks in areas of low density or at the leading edge of invasion, when small mammal trapping or drag sampling is not feasible."

Animals do not only maintain tick cycles but can either be clinically affected by the same tick-borne pathogens as humans and/or play a role as reservoirs or sentinel pathogen hosts. However, the relevance of different tick-borne diseases (TBDs) may vary in human vs. veterinary medicine, which is consequently reflected by the availability of human vs. veterinary diagnostic tests. Yet, as TBDs gain importance in both fields and rare zoonotic pathogens, such as Babesia spp., are increasingly identified as causes of human disease, a One Health approach regarding development of new diagnostic tools may lead to synergistic benefits. This review gives an overview on zoonotic protozoan, bacterial and viral tick-borne pathogens worldwide, discusses commonly used diagnostic techniques for TBDs, and compares commercial availability of diagnostic tests for humans vs. domestic animals, using Germany as an example, with the aim of highlighting existing gaps and opportunities for collaboration in a One Health framework."

Ticks spend most of their lives in the external environment away from the host and are thus expected to be affected by changes in climate. Most empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate or predict range shifts or increases in ticks and tick-borne diseases, but there can be a lot of heterogeneity in such predictions. Tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. Modeling studies can help tease apart and understand the roles of different drivers of change. Predictive models can also be invaluable in projecting changes according to different climate change scenarios. However, validating these models remains challenging, and estimating uncertainty in predictions is essential. Another focus for future research should be assessing the resilience of ticks and tick-borne pathogens to climate change."

		"abstract": "Dogs in the US are commonly infected with vector-borne pathogens, including heartworm and tick-borne disease agents. The geographic distribution of both arthropod vectors and the pathogens they transmit continues to expand. To describe the current geographic distribution and prevalence of antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. in dogs, we summarized over 144 million test results from 2013 to 2019, inclusive, by county, state, and region. Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas. Annual reports of human cases of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis were associated with percent positive canine results by state for the three tick-borne disease agents (R2 = 0.812, 0.521, and 0.546, respectively). Within endemic areas, percent positive test results for all three tick-borne agents demonstrated evidence of geographic expansion. Large scale analysis of results from screening dogs in practice for evidence of vector-borne infections, including those with zoonotic importance, continues to be a valuable strategy for understanding geographic trends in infection risk over time."

		"abstract": "In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space."

This study was performed retrospectively on CSF and serum samples collected from children evaluated for LNB (n = 233) and controls with other specific neurological disorders (n = 59) in a Swedish Lyme endemic area. For anti-Borrelia antibody index, the IDEIA Lyme Neuroborreliosis kit (Oxoid) was used. Two in-house real-time PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA gene were evaluated (TaqMan® and LUX™). Among patients classified as LNB cases (n = 102), five children (5%) were Borrelia PCR-positive in CSF with the TaqMan® assay. In the Non-LNB group (n = 131), one patient was Borrelia PCR positive with the TaqMan® assay. Among controls (n = 59), all CSF samples were PCR negative. When amplifying and sequencing ospA, we found B. garinii (n = 2), B. afzelii (n = 2), B. bavariensis (n = 1), and one untypable (n = 1). With the LUX™ technology, all CSF samples were PCR negative. The TaqMan® assay could detect only few cases (n = 6) of B. burgdorferi s.l. in CSF among children with LNB and the sensitivity was very low (5%). However, using larger CSF volumes and centrifugation of samples, the PCR technique could still be useful as a complementary diagnostic method when evaluating LNB. Furthermore, detection of spirochete DNA in clinical matrices, including CSF, is the method of choice for studying epidemiological aspects of LNB, a tick-borne emerging disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the leading tick-borne illness in the United States. However, due to, in part, to the significant number of proteins of unknown function encoded across the complex fragmented genome, the molecular mechanisms of B. burgdorferi infection remain largely undefined. Previous work identified the virulence determinant gene, bbk13, which is critical for B. burgdorferi's ability to establish a productive disseminated infection. BBK13 is an immunogenic, non-surface exposed protein of unknown function predicted to harbor an N-terminal transmembrane domain and annotated as a member of the SIMPL domain protein superfamily (PF04402). In eukaryotes, SIMPL domain proteins have been shown to contribute to NF-kappa-B signaling but have no known functions in prokaryotes. Herein we investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of BBK13 toward elucidation of its function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed secondary and tertiary structural homology between BBK13 and two other prokaryotic SIMPL domain proteins for which the crystal structures have been solved, Brucella abortus BP26 and Campylobacter jejuni cjSLP. Furthermore, comparable to BP26, recombinant BBK13 self-assembled into multimeric complexes in vitro and endogenous BBK13 was found in large oligomeric complexes in the spirochete membrane. Together these data suggest that the oligomeric structure of BBK13 may be important for the molecular function of this critical infection protein."

		"abstract": "Over the past three decades, citizens of Maine in the northeastern United States have experienced increasing blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) abundance and rising incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overabundance has been considered one cause of the high incidence of tick-borne diseases on offshore islands of New England. Most of Maine's 15 offshore, unbridged island communities have a history of concern about ticks, Lyme disease, and white-tailed deer overabundance, but have been challenged to keep deer numbers down through hunting or culls. This history has led to perennial, often divisive community debates about whether and how to reduce the size of their deer herds. In 2016 we conducted a convenience sample survey of year-round and summer residents of Maine's offshore islands to quantify the level of concern about Lyme disease, and assess the motivations and level of support for deer herd reduction. Among respondents, 84 % agreed Lyme disease was a problem on their island and 61 % supported deer herd reduction. Agreement that Lyme disease was a problem was associated with having acquired tick-borne disease as well as with tick bites without disease. Respondents ranked deer overabundance as a top cause of tick abundance and tick-borne disease and supported deer herd reduction as an approach to reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Other problems associated with deer overabundance (vehicle collisions, damage to landscaping, and damage to forests) also motivated support for deer reduction. Approval of doe permits, an expanded archery season, and sharpshooting as reduction methods was greater than an expanded firearms season. Respondents felt responsibility for tick control fell to the town for the most part, and recognized that multiple factors have contributed to the tick problem in Maine, not just deer."

		"abstract": "Many species have experienced dramatic changes in both geographic range and population sizes in recent history. Increases in the geographic range or population size of disease vectors have public health relevance as these increases often precipitate the emergence of infectious diseases in human populations. Accurately identifying environmental factors affecting the biogeographic patterns of vector species is a long-standing analytical challenge, stemming from a paucity of data capturing periods of rapid changes in vector demographics. We systematically investigated the occurrence and abundance of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks at 532 sampling locations throughout New York State (NY), USA, between 2008 and 2018, a time frame that encompasses the emergence of diseases vectored by these ticks. Analyses of these field-collected data demonstrated a range expansion into northern and western NY during the last decade. Nymphal abundances increased in newly colonised areas, while remaining stable in areas with long-standing populations over the last decade. These trends in the geographic range and abundance of nymphs correspond to both the geographic expansion of human Lyme disease cases and increases in incidence rates. Analytic models fitted to these data incorporating time, space, and environmental factors, accurately identified drivers of the observed changes in nymphal occurrence and abundance. These models accounted for the spatial and temporal variation in the occurrence and abundance of nymphs and can accurately predict nymphal population patterns in future years. Forecasting disease risk at fine spatial scales prior to the transmission season can influence both public health mitigation strategies and individual behaviours, potentially impacting tick-borne disease risk and subsequently human disease incidence."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, can acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) responsible for diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [ANPH]), babesiosis (Babesia microti [BABE]), Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [BBSL]), and the relatively novel relapsing fever-like illness, Borrelia miyamotoi (BMIY) disease in the northeastern United States. Coinfections with these pathogens are becoming increasingly more common in I. scapularis and their hosts, likely attributed to their shared enzootic cycles. Urban habitats are favorable to host species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and these ungulates are known to be important to I. scapularis for reproduction and dispersal in North America. To understand the relationship between TBPs, white-tailed deer, and I. scapularis, we sampled eight sites across central Maryland collecting I. scapularis using standard tick dragging/flagging methods and retrieved others from deer carcasses. Pathogenic TBP species in each tick were determined using qPCR. In total, 903 adult ticks (deer: n = 573; questing: n = 330) revealed landscape-level prevalence of ANPH (27.8%), BABE (1.3%), BBSL (14.6%), and BMIY (0.8%) as singular infections overall. However, secondary coinfections of ANPH and BBSL were highest (9.9%) in ticks feeding from deer while associations of BBSL and BABE (4.2%) were highest in questing ticks. Results from this study provide evidence suggesting that adult I. scapularis acquire pathogenic species through phenologically associated host use, and thus, subsequent infections found in adults may provide insights into coinfection relationships."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a tick-borne, zoonosis of adults and children caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The ailment, widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, continues to increase globally due to multiple environmental factors, coupled with increased incursion of humans into habitats that harbor the spirochete. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex. In North America, B. burgdorferi causes nearly all infections; in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii are most associated with human disease. The spirochete's unusual fragmented genome encodes a plethora of differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins that play a seminal role in the bacterium's ability to sustain itself within its enzootic cycle and cause disease when transmitted to its incidental human host. Tissue damage and symptomatology (i.e., clinical manifestations) result from the inflammatory response elicited by the bacterium and its constituents. The deposition of spirochetes into human dermal tissue generates a local inflammatory response that manifests as erythema migrans (EM), the hallmark skin lesion. If treated appropriately and early, the prognosis is excellent. However, in untreated patients, the disease may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly involving the central nervous system, joints, or heart. A small percentage (~10%) of patients may go on to develop a poorly defined fibromyalgia-like illness, post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) unresponsive to prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Below we integrate current knowledge regarding the ecologic, epidemiologic, microbiologic, and immunologic facets of Lyme disease into a conceptual framework that sheds light on the disorder that healthcare providers encounter."

To improve our understanding of the general U.S. population's experiences with tick exposure and use of personal prevention methods, we used data from ConsumerStyles, a web-based, nationally representative questionnaire on health-related topics. Questions addressed tick bites and LD diagnosis in the last year, use of personal prevention methods to prevent tick bites, and willingness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine. Of 10,551 participants surveyed over three years, 12.3 % reported a tick bite for themselves or a household member in the last year, including 15.4 % of participants in high LD incidence (LDI) states, 16.3 % in states neighboring high LDI states, and 9.4 % in low LDI states. Participants in high LDI states and neighboring states were most likely to use personal prevention methods, though 46.6 % of participants in high LDI states and 53.9 % in neighboring states reported not using any method. Participants in low LDI states, adults ≥ 75 years of age, those with higher incomes, and those living in urban housing tended to be less likely to practice personal prevention methods. Likeliness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine was high in high LDI (64.5 %), neighboring (52.5 %), and low LDI (49.7 %) states. Targeted educational efforts are needed to ensure those in high LDI and neighboring states, particularly older adults, are aware of their risk of LD and recommended personal prevention methods."

We analyzed retrospective surveillance data for Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus/rickettsial diseases, and tularemia diagnosed in Indiana from 2009 to 2016. We used chi-square cross tabulation to test gender, age group, and county classification (rural, rural-mixed, urban) differences in tickborne disease. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc Conover test to identify differences in summated tickborne disease by county classification. Finally, we used retrospective space-time permutation models in SaTScan to test the hypothesis of complete spatiotemporal randomness of tickborne disease. We found more Lyme disease diagnoses among Indiana residents 44 years of age or younger compared with those over 44 years. Conversely, more ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia were reported in Indiana residents aged over 44 years of age. An analysis of summated tickborne disease by county showed significantly higher diagnosis reported in urban counties, compared with rural and rural-mixed counties. Finally, 2 significant clusters of summated tickborne disease were observed in south-central Indiana in 2014 and in western Indiana from 2010 to 2011. The detection of tickborne disease clusters, coupled with the finding that significant differences exist in the diagnosis of tickborne diseases between urban, rural, and rural-mixed counties in Indiana, suggests a need for continued surveillance of the counties observed within these clusters."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement 'I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves 'outdoorsy', results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

		"abstract": "To provide better care for patients suspected of having a tick-transmitted infection, the Clinic for Tick-borne Diseases at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark was established. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate diagnostic outcome and to characterize demographics and clinical presentations of patients referred between the 1st of September 2017 to 31st of August 2019. A diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, symptoms, serology and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The patients were classified as definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis manifestations was initiated in accordance with the national guidelines. Patients not fulfilling the criteria of Lyme borreliosis were further investigated and discussed with an interdisciplinary team consisting of specialists from relevant specialties, according to individual clinical presentation and symptoms. Clinical information and demographics were registered and managed in a database. A total of 215 patients were included in the study period. Median age was 51 years (range 17-83 years), and 56 % were female. Definite Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 45 patients, of which 20 patients had erythema migrans, 14 patients had definite Lyme neuroborreliosis, six had acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, four had multiple erythema migrans and one had Lyme carditis. Furthermore, 12 patients were classified as possible Lyme borreliosis and 12 patients as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. A total of 146 patients (68 %) did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of Lyme borreliosis. Half of these patients (73 patients, 34 %) were diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis including inflammatory diseases, cancer diseases and two patients with a tick-associated disease other than Lyme borreliosis. A total of 73 patients (34 %) were discharged without sign of somatic disease. Lyme borreliosis patients had a shorter duration of symptoms prior to the first hospital encounter compared to patients discharged without a specific diagnosis (p<0.001). When comparing symptoms at presentation, patients discharged without a specific diagnosis suffered more often from general fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, 66 % of all referred patients were given a specific diagnosis after ended outpatient course. A total of 32 % was diagnosed with either definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome; 34 % was diagnosed with a non-tick-associated diagnosis. Our findings underscore the complexity in diagnosing Lyme borreliosis and the importance of ruling out other diseases through careful examination."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that transmit a variety of pathogens to host animals and humans, causing severe infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. In a certain combination of animal and tick species, tick infestation elicits acquired immunity against ticks in the host, which can reduce the ability of ticks to feed on blood and to transmit pathogens in the following tick infestations. Therefore, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of acquired tick resistance (ATR) can advance the development of anti-tick vaccines to prevent tick infestation and tick-borne diseases. Basophils are a minor population of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream and are rarely observed in peripheral tissues under steady-state conditions. Basophils have been reported to accumulate at tick-feeding sites during re-infestation in cattle, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. Selective ablation of basophils resulted in a loss of ATR in guinea pigs and mice, illuminating the essential role of basophils in the manifestation of ATR. In this review, we discuss the recent advance in the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying basophil recruitment to the tick-feeding site and basophil-mediated ATR."

Between April and October 2017, a total of 504 questing Ixodid ticks (77% Ixodes ricinus and 23% Dermacentor reticulatus) were collected from six regions and city of Minsk, in Belarus. All ticks were analyzed by RT-PCR amplification for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Anaplasma phagocytophillum, Ehrlihia muris, and Borrelia miyamotoi. B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp. were the most commonly detected tick-borne pathogens, with prevalence rates of 31.08% and 33.7%, respectively. A. phagocytophillum was found in 104 (20.63%), and 107 (21.2%) ticks were positive for E. muris. TBEV was detected in 83 (16.47%). Circulation of Borrelia miyamotoi spirochete in I. ricinus ticks in Brest, Gomel, and Minsk region was detected for the first time. Our data provide a basis for further studies to determine the distribution and abundance of different tick species in Belarus and therefore a capacity to predict where cases of important tick-borne diseases may occur."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with hotspots in the Northeast and Midwest. Integrated vector control for mosquito-borne disease prevention is often organized at the community level, but tick control is primarily coordinated at the household and individual level. Management of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say), the vector of the causative agent of Lyme disease in the Midwest and eastern United States in peridomestic environments may be critical as many tick encounters are reported to occur in the yard. Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness of a widely available and low-cost pesticide that targets common lawn pests and is labeled for use against ticks. In June 2019, we evaluated a granular form of gamma-cyhalothrin in a placebo-controlled residential backyard study (n = 90) in two communities in Wisconsin. The product applied by the research team reduced nymphal blacklegged ticks in plots established in the lawn part of the ecotone by 97% one week after application at both communities and by 89-97% three to four weeks postapplication. The proportion of homes with at least one nymphal tick postapplication was significantly lower at acaricide-treated homes and ranged from 4.2 to 29.2% compared with placebo homes where at least one nymphal tick was found at 50-81.5% of homes. These results support the efficacy of a low-cost do-it-yourself strategy for homeowners seeking to reduce blacklegged ticks in the yard."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales."

The genomes of relapsing fever borreliae and Lyme disease borreliae consist of multiple linear and circular plasmids in addition to the chromosome. Previous work with B. burgdorferi sensu lato found diminished infectivity upon continuous in vitro culture passage that was attributable to plasmid loss. The effect of long-term culture passage on B. miyamotoi is not known. We generated a series of plasmid-specific primer sets and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect the 14 known plasmids of B. miyamotoi North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. We assessed the plasmid content of B. miyamotoi LB-2001 over 64 culture passages spanning 15 months and determined that strain LB-2001 retained all plasmids upon prolonged in vitro cultivation and remained infectious in mice. We also found that strain LB-2001 lacks plasmid lp20-1 which is present in strain CT13-2396. These results suggest that B. miyamotoi remains genetically stable when cultured and passaged in vitro."

		"abstract": "The distribution and prevalence of zoonotic pathogens infecting ixodid ticks in Western Europe have been extensively examined. However, data on ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine are scarce. The objective of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in engorged and questing ixodid ticks collected from five administrative regions (oblasts) of Ukraine, namely Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Ternopil, and Vinnytsia. The ticks were collected from both wild and domestic animals and from vegetation. Of 524 ixodid ticks collected, 3, 99, and 422 ticks were identified as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes ricinus, and Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. DNA samples individually extracted from 168 questing and 354 engorged adult ticks were subjected to pathogen-specific PCR analyses. The mean prevalence in I. ricinus and D. reticulatus were, respectively: 10 % (10/97) and 3 % (12/422) for A. phagocytophilum; 69 % (67/97) and 52 % (220/422) for members of the Anaplasmataceae family; 25 % (24/97) and 28 % (117/422) for Rickettsia spp.; 3 % (3/97) and 1 % (6/422) for Babesia spp.; and 9 % (9/97) and 5 % (20/422) for Bartonella spp. Overall, between the five cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of any of the pathogens for the respective ticks (p > 0.05). The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in the questing and engorged I. ricinus varied from 0 to 27 % and 14-44%, respectively, with no statistical significance identified between the five cities (p > 0.05). In addition to reporting the updated data for Kyiv and Ternopil, this study is the first to provide the prevalences of the tick-borne pathogens for Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Vinnytsia. This investigation is also the first to detect Neoehrlichia mikurensis in ixodid ticks from Ukraine. These new data will be useful for medical and veterinary practitioners as well as public health officials when diagnosing infections and when implementing measures to combat tick-borne diseases in Ukraine."

This study aimed to assess the incidence, clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of serologically confirmed paediatric LD in the Republic of Ireland over a 5-year period. A retrospective review of records from accredited laboratories performing Borrelia burgdorferi serological testing was undertaken. Proformas were distributed to clinicians of children and adolescents with positive Lyme serology. Data were requested regarding clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. Updated NICE guidelines were used to classify clinical cases. Serology testing for B. burgdorferi was performed on 2908 samples. Sixty-three (2.2%) children were two-tier positive, generating a crude annual incidence rate of 1.15/100,000. Proformas were returned for 55 (87%) and 47 met clinical and laboratory criteria for LD. Twenty-seven (57%) presented with non-focal symptoms (erythema migrans and/or influenza-like symptoms), and 20 (43%) with focal symptoms (cranial nerve involvement, 11; CNS involvement, 8; arthritis, 1). Median age at presentation was 8.2 (2.5-17.9) years. Seventeen (36%) acquired LD overseas. Twenty-five (83%) of the remaining 30 children acquired infection in the West/Northwest of Ireland. Full resolution of symptoms was reported in 97% of those with available data. Serologically confirmed LD in children is relatively rare in the Republic of Ireland. Ninety-eight percent of children tested were seronegative. Of the seropositive cases, 40% could have been diagnosed based on clinical findings alone. Neurological presentations (40%) were common. Full resolution of symptoms occurred in almost all (97%) where data were available."

		"abstract": "The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an acellular membrane that covers the gut epithelium in arthropods and physically separates it from the lumen. The structure is thought to play an important role in tick biology. The PM is also known to impact the persistence of tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi, although limited information is available about its molecular constituents or their biological significance. Herein, we characterise a novel PM-associated gut protein in Ixodes scapularis ticks, annotated as Peritrophic Membrane Chitin Binding Protein (PM_CBP), for its role in the integrity and function of the matrix. The PM_CBP displays homology to the chitin deacetylase metalloenzyme, shows upregulation during tick feeding, and is localized at the luminal surface of the gut epithelium. The structural integrity of the PM was impaired both by the knock down of PM_CBP expression via RNA interference and by treatment with anti-PM_CBP antibodies, as revealed by its electron microscopic appearance. Additionally, the duration of tick engorgement on mice and the passage of experimentally-inoculated fluorescent dextran molecules across the PM are affected by the knock down of PM_CBP expression. The transfer of anti-PM_CBP antibodies into the tick gut impacted the overall composition of the resident microbiome, and also influenced B. burgdorferi acquisition in ticks and its transmission to mice. Taken together, these data highlight the biological significance of the Ixodes PM and suggest that the targeting of its molecular constituents may contribute to the development of novel interventions against tick-borne infections."

		"abstract": "Studies of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Europe focus on pathogens with principal medical importance (e.g. Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis), but we have limited epidemiological information on the neglected pathogens, such as the members of the genera Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Babesia and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis. Here, we integrated an extensive field sampling, laboratory analysis and GIS models to provide first publicly available information on pathogen diversity, prevalence and infection risk for four overlooked zoonotic TBDs in the Czech Republic. In addition, we assessed the effect of landscape variables on the abundance of questing ticks at different spatial scales and examined whether pathogen prevalence increased with tick density. Our data from 13,340 ticks collected in 142 municipalities showed that A. phagocytophilum (MIR = 3.5%) and Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (MIR = 4.0%) pose geographically uneven risks with localized hotspots, while Rickettsia (MIR = 4.9%) and Babesia (MIR = 1.1%) had relatively homogeneous spatial distribution. Landscape variables had significant effect on tick abundance up to the scale of 1 km around the sampling sites. Questing ticks responded positively to landscape diversity and configuration, especially to forest patch density that strongly correlates with the amount of woodland-grassland ecotones. For all four pathogens, we found higher prevalence in places with higher densities of ticks, confirming the hypothesis that tick abundance amplifies the risk of TB infection. Our findings highlight the importance of landscape parameters for tick vectors, likely due to their effect on small vertebrates as reservoir hosts. Future studies should explicitly investigate the combined effect of landscape parameters and the composition and population dynamics of hosts on the host-vector-pathogen system."

Understanding tick population dynamics and predicting risk of tick-borne disease insurgence helps to design preventive actions against the disease spread. Using a compartmental model describing the pathogen transmission among ticks and hosts, we study the influence of host-targeted tick control strategies with chemical insecticides on tick population and disease transmission dynamics. Our analysis shows that in areas with rapid-growing population of ticks, host-targeted controls using chemical insecticides may enhance disease persistence and even turn a disease-free area to a disease endemic area. Therefore, the complex dynamics of pathogen spread among ticks and hosts should be carefully examined when designing tick control strategies."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases is dramatically increasing across the United States. While the rapid rise in Lyme disease is clear, the causes of it are not. Modeling Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary Lyme disease vector in the eastern United States, presents an opportunity to disentangle the drivers of increasing Lyme disease, including climate, land cover, and host populations. We improved upon a recently developed compartment model of ordinary differential equations that simulates I. scapularis growth, abundance, and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) by adding land cover effects on host populations, refining the representation of growth stages, and evaluating output against observed data. We then applied this model to analyze the sensitivity of simulated I. scapularis dynamics across temperature and land cover in the northeastern United States. Specifically, we ran an ensemble of 232 simulations with temperature from Hanover, New Hampshire and Storrs, Connecticut, and land cover from Hanover and Cardigan in New Hampshire, and Windsor and Danielson in Connecticut. Consistent with observations, simulations of I. scapularis abundance are sensitive to temperature, with the warmer Storrs climate significantly increasing the number of questing I. scapularis at all growth stages. While there is some variation in modeled populations of I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi among land cover distributions, our analysis of I. scapularis response to land cover is limited by a lack of observations describing host populations, the proportion of hosts competent to serve as B. burgdorferi reservoirs, and I. scapularis abundance."

An investigation of 164 adult ticks collected from 88 dogs and 41 cats between March and July 2018 revealed that this region was dominated by three tick species, Ixodes ovatus (n = 95, 57.9%), Ixodes nipponensis (n = 37, 22.6%) and Haemaphysalis flava (n = 10, 6.1%). To evaluate their pathogenic potential, we went on to test each tick for spotted fever group rickettsiae, Lyme disease borreliae, relapsing fever borreliae, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (formerly SFTS virus). Our results identified two I. ovatus ticks infected with Borrelia miyamotoi, which causes emerging relapsing fever; several I. nipponensis ticks infected with Rickettsia monacensis, which cause rickettsiosis; and several Ixodes persulcatus ticks infected with Rickettsia helvetica, which can also cause rickettsiosis. These results suggest that dogs and cats, and veterinary professionals and pet owners, in the Yamagata prefecture have some risk of exposure to several TBDs. This means that there should be continuous monitoring and reporting of TBDs, even those known to be uncommon in Japan, in both companion animals and humans to ensure the health and safety of both humans and animals in Japan."

		"abstract": "Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States. Development of tick control tools have focused primarily on the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Application of acaricides or entomopathogenic fungal agents to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks on rodents can suppress I. scapularis abundance in residential landscapes, but evidence is lacking for impact on human tick bites or tick-borne disease. Similar studies remain limited for the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Other knowledge gaps include how well homeowners and pest control companies perform in the broadcast application of tick-killing products, relative to high efficacy reported in research studies, and the tick-killing potential of natural product formulations exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration. Area-wide control based on preventing ticks from feeding on their main reproductive host, the white-tailed deer, can suppress populations of both I. scapularis and A. americanum. Some studies also suggest an impact on Lyme disease cases, but this needs to be further validated in larger-scale intervention studies. The effectiveness, scale, cost, and implementation of various tick management strategies are important considerations in efforts to reduce human tick encounters and tick-borne disease. Additional barriers include weak incentives for industry and academia to develop, test, and register new tick and pathogen control technologies, including vaccines targeting humans, tick reproductive hosts, or wildlife pathogen reservoirs. Solutions will need to be 'two-pronged': improving the tick and pathogen control toolbox and strengthening the public health workforce engaging in tick control at local and state levels."
