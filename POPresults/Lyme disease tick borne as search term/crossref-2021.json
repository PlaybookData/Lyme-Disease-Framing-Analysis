However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later “febrile patients”) based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

The disease was first identified as a problem in sheep and goats in Kenya in 1910. The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus and family Bunyaviridae. An equally pathogenic variant of NSDV is Ganjam virus, which is found in India and Sri Lanka. Both viruses are closely related to the human pathogen Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a fever transmitted through infected tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. Other members of the genus include Dugbe virus, Hazara virus, and Kupe virus, isolated from cattle ticks in East Africa. The virus is spread by hard (Ixodid) ticks and appears to be dependent on the tick vector for dissemination, with no direct transmission between animals. The transmission of tick-borne viruses (TBV) occurs primarily during tick feeding and is a complex process, known to be promoted by tick saliva constituents."

Rodents that provide essential blood-meals for subadult ticks and serve as natural reservoirs for many known tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis, might be quite abundant in green areas within urban settlements. In that way, the improvement of green infrastructures within cities possess not only to better human well-being but might also increase the risk of being bitten by a tick and having a tick-borne disease. This study aimed to provide a first insight into ticks and tick-borne pathogen presence and prevalence in popular recreational green areas in Tallinn, Estonia. METHODS Ticks were collected by flagging in May-June, 2018. Tick species identification was performed on morphological criteria. Tick-borne pathogens detection was performed by pathogen-specific PCR and qPCR reactions. RESULTS 855"

		"abstract": "Recent scholarship supports the use of tick bite encounters as a proxy for human disease risk. Extending entomological monitoring, this study was designed to provide geographically salient information on self-reported tick bite encounters by survey respondents who concomitantly reported a Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis in a state perceived as non-endemic to tick-borne illness. Focusing on Texas, a mixed-methods approach was used to compare data on tick bite encounters from self-reported LD patients with county-level confirmed cases of LD from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as serological canine reports. A greater proportion of respondents reported not recalling a tick bite in the study population, but a binomial test indicated that this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis compared neighboring county-level data and ecological regions. Using multi-layer thematic mapping, our findings indicated that tick bite reports accurately overlapped with the geographic patterns of those patients previously known to be CDC-positive for serological LD and with canine-positive tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis, as well as within neighboring counties and ecological regions. LD patient-reported tick bite encounters, corrected for population density, also accurately aligned with official CDC county hot-spots. Given the large number of counties in Texas, these findings are notable. Overall, the study demonstrates that direct, clinically diagnosed patient reports with county-level tick bite encounter data offer important public health surveillance measures, particularly as it pertains to difficult-to-diagnose diseases where testing protocols may not be well established. Further integration of geo-ecological and socio-demographic factors with existing national epidemiological data, as well as increasingly accessible self-report methods such as online surveys, will contribute to the contextual information needed to organize and implement a coordinated public health response to LD."

As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV) group contains at least 12 members where five of them are important pathogens of humans inducing diseases with varying severity (from mild fever forms to acute encephalitis). The taxonomy structure of TBFV is not fully clarified at present. In particular, there is a number of paraphyletic issues of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and louping-ill virus (LIV). In this study, we aimed to apply different bioinformatic approaches to analyze all available complete genome amino acid sequences to delineate TBFV members at the species level. Results showed that the European subtype of TBEV (TBEV-E) is a distinct species unit. LIV, in turn, should be separated into two species. Additional analysis of the diversity of TBEV and LIV antigenic determinants also demonstrate that TBEV-E and LIV are significantly different from other TBEV subtypes. The analysis of available literature provided data on other virus phenotypic particularities that supported our hypothesis. So, within the TBEV+LIV paraphyletic group, we offer to assign four species to get a more accurate understanding of the TBFV interspecies structure according to the modern monophyletic conception."

Eight percent of adult tick batches collected were infected (Ixodes ricinus) by the TBEV. Tick collection occurred in a forest near Strasbourg, the main city in the region. Nymphs were more rarely infected (1.6% of the collected lots).1 These data were confirmed in 2011 in Alsace in Guebwiller’s Valley, a middle altitude forest, with identification of western (European) subtype TBEV (TBEV-EU). The infection rate still remains low: TBEV was detected only in the I. ricinus nymphs (2.48%) that were collected during May; however, not in those collected during the other spring or summer months. In a more recent study, Bestehorn et al., collected ticks (953 male, 856 female adult ticks and 2,255 nymphs) in endemic foci in the upper Rhine region in France and Germany between 2016, 2017 and 2018 by flagging2. The minimal infection rate (MIR) of the collected ticks in the Foret de la Robertsau (France) was estimated to 0,11% (1 nymph/944 ticks). The isolated and sequenced TBEV strain from Foret de la Robertsau (F) is related to circulating TBEV isolates from eastern Bavaria and the Czech Republic. In the French department Alsace, there are today at least two independent TBEV strains circulating: the historical Alsace strain isolated in 1971 and the newly identified strain from Foret de la Robertsau. Other wooded regions (Ardennes) were explored for TBEV in ticks, but without evidence of virus infection."

Bornholm is situated east of mainland Denmark, south of Sweden (Figure 3) and has a different fauna and flora from the rest of Denmark. Bornholm has about 45,000 inhabitants, but about 500,000 tourists visit the island every year. Freundt carried out a serosurvey during 1958–19621 and found TBE antibodies in 1.4% of blood donors and 30% of woodworkers on Bornholm but no antibodies in subjects living in mainland Denmark. In 1963, Freundt found that 8 of 12 patients admitted to the hospital with acute meningoencephalitis of unknown etiology during 1951–1960 had antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV).2 In 2000, TBE was rediscovered on Bornholm, where a retrospective study covering the period 1994–2002 (7 years) identified 14 TBE cases; 2 cases were tourists and 12 were inhabitants of Bornholm, giving an incidence of 3.81 per 100,000 inhabitants.3 At least 5 patients (37.7%) got permanent sequelae. In addition, 32 forest workers on Bornholm were tested in 2000, and 20% had IgG antibodies but never symptoms. This is similar to the finding of Freundt in 1960. It was concluded that the data did not provide evidence of an increase in incidence of TBE. Ticks (Ixodes ricinus) from Bornholm were investigated for TBEV in 2000 and 2% were found to be infected.4 Since 2001 an average of 2.5 (range 1–8) TBE cases per year have been reported in Bornholm (Figure 1)."

Cerebrospinal fluid and neuro-imaging may give some evidence of TBE, but ultimately cannot confirm the diagnosis. Thus, proving the diagnosis “TBE” necessarily requires confirmation of TBEV-infection by detection of the virus or by demonstration of specific antibodies from serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. During the phase of clinic symptoms from the CNS, the TBEV can only rarely be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Most routinely used serological tests for diagnosing TBE (ELISA, HI, IFA) show cross reactions resulting from either infection with other flaviviruses or with other flavivirus vaccines."

Laboratory evaluation may show elevated blood inflammatory indices, but cerebrospinal fluid analysis and anti-TBEV serology are needed for establishing the diagnosis. There is no specific treatment for TBE; supportive care needs to be provided based on the individual clinical course. The mortality in pediatric TBE is very low, but severe courses have been reported in a fraction of the children. Long-term somatic residua exist, but are uncommon (2%) in childhood TBE. Yet, long-term symptoms and neurodevelopmental/cognitive deficits are seen in 10–40% of infected children. Protective immunity can be elicited in children by TBE vaccines as of 1 year of age."

Pathogenesis of TBE is not well understood, but both direct viral effects and immune-mediated tissue damage of the central nervous system may contribute to the natural course of TBE. The effect of TBEV on the innate immune system has mainly been studied in vitro and in mouse models. Characterization of human immune responses to TBEV is primarily conducted in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, due to the inaccessibility of brain tissue for sample collection. Natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are activated during the second (meningo-encephalitic) phase of TBE. The potential involvement of other cell types has not been examined to date. Immune cells from peripheral blood, in particular neutrophils, T cells, B cells and NK cells, infiltrate into the cerebrospinal fluid of TBE patients."

		"abstract": "Worldwide there are 6 different TBE vaccines – two from Western Europe, three from Russia and one from China. The two western European vaccines and one of the Russian vaccines have an adult and a pediatric formulation. The products names are FSME IMMUN and FSME-IMMUN Junior; Encepur adults and Encepur children, Klesch-E-Vac, EnceVir and EnceVir Neo, Dry lyophilized TBE Moscow and Sen Tai Bao. All TBE vaccines except the one from China have similar but not identical immunization schedules with primary immunization (>3 doses) and regular booster vaccinations. For FSME-IMMUN, Encepur and EnceVir rapid immunization schedules are also licensed. The Chinese vaccine is given with 2 primary doses 2 weeks apart followed by annual boosters. All vaccines induce significant immune responses. In the absence of a formal correlate of protection, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is used as a surrogate marker for protection. Recent clinical studies show long-term seropersistence of TBE antibodies after the first booster vaccination (dose 4) with the two European vaccines. An effectiveness of approximately 99% (years 2000–2006) and 98.7% (years 2000-2011) was calculated for regularly vaccinated persons in Austria, a country with established high vaccination uptake. Whereas in Western Europe post-exposure prophylaxis with immunoglobulins was discontinued in the late 1990s, in the highly endemic regions of Russia it continues to be common practice. Both – FSME-IMMUN and Encepur are well tolerated with a well-established safety profile. TBE-Moscow and EnceVir appear to be somewhat more reactogenic."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) exists in natural foci, which are areas where TBEV is circulating among its vectors (ticks of different species and genera) and reservoir hosts (usually rodents and small mammals). Based on phylogenetic studies, four TBEV subtypes (Far-Eastern, Siberian, European, Baikalian) and two putative subtypes (Himalayan and “178-79” group) are known. Within each subtype, some genetic lineages are described. The European subtype (TBEV-EU) (formerly known also as the “Western subtype”) of TBEV is prevalent in Europe, but it was also isolated in Western and Eastern Siberia in Russia and South Korea. The Far-Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE) was preferably found in the territory of the far-eastern part of Eurasia, but some strains were isolated in other regions of Eurasia. The Siberian (TBEV-SIB) subtype is the most common and has been found in almost all TBEV habitat areas. The Baikalian subtype is prevalent around Lake Baikal and was isolated several times from ticks and rodents. In addition to the four TBEV subtypes, one single isolate of TBEV (178-79) and two genetic sequences (Himalayan) supposed to be new TBEV subtypes were described in Eastern Siberia and China. The data on TBEV seroprevalence in humans and animals can serve as an indication for the presence or absence of TBEV in studied area."

		"abstract": "Ticks exist on all continents and carry more zoonotic pathogens than any other type of vector. Ticks spend most of their lives in the external environment away from the host and are thus expected to be affected by changes in climate. Most empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate or predict range shifts or increases in ticks and tick-borne diseases, but there can be a lot of heterogeneity in such predictions. Tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. Modeling studies can help tease apart and understand the roles of different drivers of change. Predictive models can also be invaluable in projecting changes according to different climate change scenarios. However, validating these models remains challenging, and estimating uncertainty in predictions is essential. Another focus for future research should be assessing the resilience of ticks and tick-borne pathogens to climate change."

To assess this issue, we retrospectively screened ticks collected from dogs in 2008. Of these collected ticks, we randomly selected 75 (47 females and 28 males) Dermacentor reticulatus, 44 (21 females, 7 males, and 16 nymphs) Haemaphysalis concinna, and 55 (52 females and 3 males) ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. Subsequently, these ticks were individually screened for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using the reverse line blot hybridization assay. In our current study, we detected DNA from the following microbes in D. reticulatus: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmanii, Borrelia valaisiana, and R. raoultii, all of which were R. raoultii strain Jongejan. In H. concinna, we found DNA of a Babesia sp., Rickettsia helvetica, and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli. Lastly, I. ricinus was positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii/Borrelia bavariensis, B. lusitaniae, B. spielmanii, B. valaisiana, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica, Rickettsia monacensis, and Theileria (Babesia) microti DNA. The detection of DNA of the Babesia sp. and an organism closely related to Theileria capreoli, both found in H. concinna ticks, is novel for Austria."

The publication of raw material is a necessary step for wide-area meta-analyses and study design, data collection and reporting require harmonization. This is an opinion paper, not a consensus position, and is open to debate. This work reflects our view about how data should be communicated in mainstream journals. We indicate rules that should be observed in recording weather data, to avoid serendipitous correlations between the density of ticks and climate variables and recommend the inclusion of raw data in reports. We stress the need for standardized methods to collect ticks that cannot be obtained by standard flagging. The reporting of infection rates of pathogens in ticks should avoid conclusions based on pure molecular findings in feeding ticks. Studies demonstrating the vectorial capacity of ticks should not be supported only by molecular surveys of feeding ticks. Vacuous conclusions about vectorial or reservoir status based solely on the finding of genomic material of a pathogen should be discouraged. We stress that phylogenetic studies based on random selection of sequences from GenBank are unsuitable. We firmly support the development of a dedicated server of curated sequences of ticks and pathogens as a standard for future studies."

Despite the growing burden of tick-borne diseases, research on ticks has lagged behind other arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes. This is largely because of challenges in applying functional genomics and genetic tools to the idiosyncrasies unique to tick biology, particularly techniques for stable genetic transformations. CRISPR-Cas9 is transforming non-model organism research; however, successful germline editing has yet to be accomplished in ticks. Here, we review the ancillary methods needed for transgenic tick development and the use of CRISPR/Cas9, the most promising gene-editing approach, for tick genetic transformation."

		"abstract": "The tropical and sub-tropical climate in Africa favours multiplication and maintenance of tick vectors and transmission of various pathogens to cattle. Key challenges including acaricide resistance, policy issues, transboundary animal movements, and inadequate veterinary services compromise effective control of tick-borne diseases (TBDs). This chapter discusses important host, pathogen, climatic, and management factors that impact the control of TBDs among cattle in Africa, and which affect the productivity and overall contribution to economic development. The economic losses in cattle production attributed to tick infestation and TBDs in Africa are also reviewed. The use of a sustainable integrated control approach, including vaccination, strategic tick control, surveillance for acaricide resistance, and multi-stakeholder involvement is also evaluated."

		"abstract": "Objectives: The goal of this study was to evaluate timeliness of Tick-borne Encephalitis vaccination uptake among adults in Switzerland. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, we collected vaccination records from randomly selected adults 18-79 throughout Switzerland. Of 4,626 participants, data from individuals receiving at least 1 TBE vaccination (n=1875) were evaluated. We determined year and age of first vaccination and vaccine compliance, evaluating dose timeliness. Participants were considered “on time” if they received doses according to the recommended schedule ± a 15% tolerance period. Results: 45% of participants received their first TBE vaccination between 2006 and 2009. 25% were first vaccinated aged 50+ (mean age 37). More than 95% of individuals receiving the first dose also received the second; ∼85% of those receiving the second dose received the third. For individuals completing the primary series, 30% received 3 doses of Encepur, 58% received 3 doses of FSME-Immun, and 12% received a combination. According to conventional schedules, 88% and 79% of individuals received their second and third doses “on time”, respectively. 20% of individuals receiving Encepur received their third dose “too early”. Of individuals completing primary vaccination, 19% were overdue for a booster. Among the 31% of subjects receiving a booster, mean time to first booster was 7.1 years. Conclusions: We estimate that a quarter of adults in Switzerland were first vaccinated for TBE aged 50+. Approximately 80% of participants receiving at least one vaccine dose completed the primary series. We further estimate that 66% of individuals completing the primary series adhered to an “ideal” TBE vaccination schedule."

Identified risk areas are Tulcea district, Transylvania, at the base of the Carpathian Mountains and the Transylvanian Alps.2,3 TBE has been a notifiable disease since 1996. Surveillance of TBE is not done at the country level, only regionally in some counties (northern/central/western part, close to Hungary). The passive surveillance system was implemented in 2008. However, there is no regular screening and the relative risk of contracting this disease is unknown. In 1999, an outbreak of TBE in humans was recorded with a total of at least 38 human cases.4 The probable cause of the outbreak was goat milk and raw goat milk products. Subsequent studies to detect TBEV in ticks in the affected regions resulted in a non -specified number of TBEV isolates, which were described as belonging to the European subtype of TBEV. A publication of the neighboring Republic of Moldova described the existence of the Far-eastern subtype of TBEV just at the border to Romania.5"

Between 2006 and 2015, the laboratory of the Netherlands Centre of Infectious Disease Control (Clb), 1 of the 2 laboratories that performed TBEV diagnostics in the Netherlands at the time, received an average of 20 (range 12–27) requests for TBE diagnostics per year. In the same period, TBE was diagnosed in 7 Dutch patients. All of these cases were considered to be travel-related. Indeed, 6 out of 7 patients reported that they had recently travelled to TBEV-endemic countries such as Austria (4), Germany (1), and Sweden (1)."

This number may be considered as ‘low’ – not only as an individual risk but also from a public health perspective. If an individual does contract TBE, however, the disease may deeply change her/his life due to the need for acute hospital care and due to potentially severe and long-term sequelae. In 1–2% (-20%) of cases, TBE may even result in death. No specific treatments exist for TBE. The severity of the disease and high frequency of long-term sequelae result in high public awareness and concerns about tick bites in endemic areas. Public health officials in TBE-endemic areas need to address these concerns; moreover, they need to address the concerns of travelers at risk. The principal public health measures aim at reducing TBE cases by reduction of exposure and preventive vaccination. Recommendation/reimbursement of TBE vaccination still is under discussion from side of healthcare payer perspective as well as from the individuals perspective considering long term sequelae."

Tick bite can transfer the virus and lead to a febrile infection, Tick-borne encephalitis, of varying severity. There is no specific therapeutic treatment and control in endemic areas is by vaccination. The basis of the different pathologies shown following TBEV infection, from mild to fatal, is not clear although the virus genotype clearly has a role. Mapping the basis of their differential effects would allow focus on the stages of the replication cycle responsible, which might guide the development of therapeutic interventions or the creation of purposefully attenuated strains as candidate vaccines."

Although B. miyamotoi is genetically and ecologically distinct from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, both microorganisms are transmitted by the same Ixodes tick species. B. miyamotoi was detected in I. persulcatus ticks in 1994 in Japan. A phylogenetic analysis based on selected sequences of B. miyamotoi genome revealed genetic differences between isolates from Asia, North America, and Europe, which are clearly separated into three genotypes. Symptomatic human cases of Borrelia miyamotoi disease (BMD) were first reported in 2011 in Russia and then in North America, Europe, and Asia. The most common clinical manifestation of BMD is fever with flu-like symptoms. Several differences in rare symptoms (thrombocytopenia, monocytosis, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, or symptoms related to the central nervous system) have been noted among cases caused by Asian, European, and American types of B. miyamotoi. BMD should be considered in the diagnosis of patients after tick bites, particularly with meningoencephalitis, without anti-Borrelia antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid. This review describes the biology, ecology, and potential of B. miyamotoi as a tick-borne pathogen of public health concern, with particular emphasis on Europe."

From our search, we were able to find evidence of eight tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, Babesiosis, Lyme disease, Bourbon virus disease, Colorado tick fever disease, Tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever) affecting the bone. Pathological bone effects most commonly associated with tick-borne infections were disruption of bone marrow function and bone loss. Most research to date on the effects of tick-borne pathogen infections on bone has been quite preliminary. Further investigation of this topic is warranted."

As a country with a temperate and subtropical climate, Turkey has topography, climate, and pasture resources, and these resources are suitable for animal breeding and parasite–host–vector relationships throughout the country. This geography restricts the regulations on animal movements in the southeastern and eastern Anatolia because of the close contact with the neighboring states. The livestock resources in Turkey are regulated by strong foundations. Almost 30% of the agriculture-based gross domestic product is provided by the livestock industry. Parasitic diseases arising from ticks are endemic in Turkey, and they have a significant impact on the economy and animal health, particularly for ruminants. The main and economically-important tick-borne diseases (TBDs) suffered by animals include theileriosis, babesiosis, hepatozoonosis, and cytauxzoonosis caused by protozoa, and anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis caused by rickettsiae. The most common hemoprotozoan and rickettsial agents are Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Babesia bigemina, Babesia caballi, Babesia ovis, Cytauxzoon felis, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis, Theileria annulata and Theileria equi. These diseases are basically controlled through treatment and measures for tick control. Vaccination can be performed for only tropical theileriosis caused in Turkey. We reviewed the studies published in domestic and international journals to gather epidemiological data regarding the major TBDs suffered by animals in Turkey."

It is diagnosed in the forested belts of Northern Eurasia ranging from the UK, eastern France, The Netherlands and Norway down to Italy through central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Kazakhstan, and China to Japan. About 10,000 cases of TBE are reported annually, likely a significant underestimate as serological testing is more sporadic than complete and, in some countries, (like Japan) not even available. The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have put TBE on their list of notifiable diseases. Their case definition requires clinical symptoms of CNS infection plus virological or serological confirmation of the infection, usually by detection of specific immunoglobulins IgG and IgM. Vaccination against TBE is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines. the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Surveillance of TBE and the TBEV is incomplete. Reported incidences do not reflect actual risk since this fluctuates annually as a result of changes in exposure, vaccine uptake, intensity of case finding and reporting, climate factors, reservoir animals and ticks – just to mention the most relevant factors. For largely unknown reasons (including human behavior, improved diagnostics, or climate change) TBEV appears to be spreading north, east, west, even south and to higher altitudes to areas that were previously believed to be free of the virus."

Immature particles are transported through the cellular exocytic pathway and conformational changes induced by acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network allow the proteolytic cleavage of prM by furin, a cellular protease, resulting in the release of mature and infectious TBE-virions. The E protein controls cell entry by mediating attachment to as yet ill-defined receptors as well as by low-pH-triggered fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane after uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Because of its key functions in cell entry, the E protein is the primary target of virus neutralizing antibodies, which inhibit these functions by different mechanisms. Although all flavivirus E proteins have a similar overall structure, divergence at the amino acid sequence level is up to 60 percent (e.g. between TBE and dengue viruses), and therefore cross-neutralization as well as (some degree of) cross-protection are limited to relatively closely related flaviviruses, such as those constituting the tick-borne encephalitis serocomplex."

The complexity of natural transmission cycles is inadequately explored and poorly understood."

		"abstract": "TBEV is the most medically important member of the tick-borne serocomplex group within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Three antigenic subtypes of TBEV correspond to the 3 recognized genotypes: European (TBEV-EU), also known as Western, Far Eastern (TBEV-FE), and Siberian (TBEV-SIB). An additional 2 genotypes have been identified in the Irkutsk region of Russia, currently named TBE virus Baikalian subtype (TBEV-BKL) and TBE virus Himalayan subtype (Himalayan and “178-79” group; TBEV-HIM). TBEV virions are small enveloped spherical particles about 50 nm in diameter. The TBEV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule. The genome encodes one open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by untranslated (non-coding) regions (UTRs). The 5′-UTR end has a methylated nucleotide cap for canonical cellular translation. The 3′-UTR is not polyadenylated and is characterized by extensive length and sequence heterogeneity. The ORF encodes one large polyprotein, which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 3 structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). TBEV replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell in close association with virus-induced intracellular membrane structures. Virus assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The immature virions are transported to the Golgi complex, and mature virions pass through the host secretory pathway and are finally released from the host cell by fusion of the transport vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane."

To cause infection, TBEV needs to cross three different barriers; the physical, the innate and adaptive and the blood-brain barrier. The trigger of innate immune and adaptive immune responses, by TBEV is necessary to clear the infection. TBEV employs strategies to evade the innate immune response. Tools to study TBEV pathogenicity such as mouse knock-out models and reverse genetics are also discussed."

Spatial approaches can be used to synthesize the data generated by integrative One Health surveillance systems, and help stakeholders, managers, and medical geographers understand the current and future distribution of risk. Here, we performed a systematic review of over 8,000 studies and identified a total of 303 scientific publications that map tick-borne diseases using data on vectors, pathogens, and hosts (including wildlife, livestock, and human cases). We find that the field is growing rapidly, with the major Ixodes-borne diseases (Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in particular) giving way to monitoring efforts that encompass a broader range of threats. We find a tremendous diversity of methods used to map tick-borne disease, but also find major gaps: data on the enzootic cycle of tick-borne pathogens is severely underutilized, and mapping efforts are mostly limited to Europe and North America. We suggest that future work can readily apply available methods to track the distributions of tick-borne diseases in Africa and Asia, following a One Health approach that combines medical and veterinary surveillance for maximum impact."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The most commonly reported vector-borne and tick-borne disease (TBD) in the United States is Lyme disease. Individuals with Lyme disease may present with a wide array of symptoms with resultant musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiac manifestations that may cause them to seek physical therapist services. The symptoms may develop insidiously and with a variable presentation among individuals. Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose patients early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that patients may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to patients for whom referral is recommended."

Babesia parasites are present around the world, affecting several mammals including humans, pets and livestock, hence its medical and veterinary relevance. Babesia spp. detection in its invertebrate host is a main point in understanding the biology of the parasite to acquire more knowledge on the host–Babesia–vector interactions, as increasing knowledge of the Babesia lifecycle and babesiosis epidemiology can help prevent babesiosis outbreaks in susceptible mammals. The aim of the present review is to highlight the newest findings in this field, based on a bibliographic compilation of research studies recently carried out for the detection of the main Babesia species found in tick vectors affecting mammalian hosts, including the different tick stages such as adult ticks, larvae, nymphs and eggs, as well as the detection method implemented: microscopic tools for parasite identification and molecular tools for parasite DNA detection by conventional PCR, nested-PCR, PCR-RFLP, PCR-RLB hybridization, real time-PCR, LAMP and RAP assays. Although molecular identification of Babesia parasites has been achieved in several tick species and tissue samples, it is still necessary to carry out transmission experiments through biological models to confirm the vectorial capacity of various tick species."

Dogs infected with Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis, and Hepatozoon canis are commonly found in Thailand; Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick is the most common vector of diseases. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of common TBPs in dogs and their ticks in Thailand using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing methods. Materials and Methods: Forty-four blood samples were positively diagnosed with TBPs infection by microscopy. Samples were from animal hospitals in Maha Sarakham, Amnat Charoen, Nakhon Ratchasima, and Bangkok, Thailand, during January-June 2020. Five to six ticks were also taken from infected dogs, and then, both blood and tick were analyzed using PCR and DNA sequencing. Results: PCR results showed that R. sanguineus was the only tick species detected in this study. The appearance of single infection with E. canis was the most common infection found in dogs and ticks (64% and 82%, respectively). Correlation of pathogen infection in hosts and their vector was performed by similarity detection of pathogens between blood and tick samples based on PCR analysis in 29 samples (66%) but there was no significant differentiation. Conclusion: E. canis appears as the most common canine tick-borne pathogen in Thailand, which was detected in both healthy and sick dogs as well as in R. sanguineus. The findings show the relationships among host dogs, pathogens, and ticks. Veterinarians should be proactive in educating pet owners about the risks associated with ticks and their important pathogens and plan effective control strategies."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), is a life-threatening disease with clinical symptoms ranging from non-specific to severe inflammation of the central nervous system. Despite TBE is a notifiable disease in Serbia since 2004, there is no active TBE surveillance program for the serologic or molecular screening of TBEV infection in humans in the country. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the TBEV exposure among tick-infested individuals in Serbia during the year 2020. A total of 113 individuals exposed to tick bites were recruited for the study and screened for anti-TBEV antibodies using a commercial indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) test. Blood samples from 50 healthy donors not exposed to tick bites were included as a control group. Most of the enrolled patients reported infestations with one tick, being I. ricinus the most frequent tick found in the participants. The TBEV seroprevalence was higher (13.27%, 15 total 113) in tick-infested individuals than in healthy donors (4%, 2 total 50), although the difference was not significant. Notably, male individuals exposed to tick bites showed five times higher relative risk (RR) of being TBEV-seropositive than healthy donors of the same gender (RR= 5.1, CI = 1.6–19; p = 0.007). None of the seropositive individuals developed clinical manifestations of TBE, but the first clinical-stage of Lyme borreliosis (i.e., erythema migrans) was detected in seven of them. Potential TBEV foci were identified in rural areas, mostly in proximity or within the Fruška Gora mountain. We conclude that the Serbian population is at high risk of TBEV exposure. Further epidemiological studies should focus on potential TBEV foci identified in this study. The implementation of active surveillance for TBEV might contribute to evaluating the potential negative impact of TBE in Serbia."

В статье представлен уникальный по продолжительности наблюдения случай хронического клещевого энцефалита (ХКЭ) (47 лет от начала заболевания и свыше 30 лет после вакцинотерапии). Показано, что замедленное развитие тяжелой неврологической симптоматики, прогрессирование болезни происходят на фоне дисиммуноглобулинемии. Штамм, выделенный от пациентки, обладал высокой нейровирулентностью для белых мышей, был высоконейроинвазивным, показал принадлежность к сибирскому подтипу вируса клещевого энцефалита. По мере прогрессирования ХКЭ развивался полиштаммовый иммунный ответ и напряженный иммунитет с высокой авидностью антител (через 30-32 года после вакцинотерапии). В неврологическом статусе – характерные постэнцефалитические изменения с элементами кортикальной моторной эпилепсии. Существенного когнитивного дефекта не было выявлено."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is a vector-borne infection associated with a variety of potentially serious complications and sequelae. Vaccination against TBE is strongly recommended for people living in endemic areas. There are two TBE vaccination schemes – standard and rapid – which differ in the onset of protection. With vaccination in a rapid schedule, protection starts as early as 4 weeks after the first dose and is therefore especially recommended for non-immune individuals travelling to endemic areas. Both schemes work reliably in immunocompetent individuals, but only little is known about how TBE vaccination works in people with HIV infection. Our aim was to assess the immunogenicity and safety of the rapid scheme of TBE vaccination in HIV-1 infected individuals. Concentrations of TBE-specific IgG > 126 VIEU/ml were considered protective. The seroprotection rate was 35.7% on day 28 and 39.3% on day 60. There were no differences between responders and non-responders in baseline and nadir CD4 + T lymphocytes. No serious adverse events were observed after vaccination. The immunogenicity of the TBE vaccination was unsatisfactory in our study and early protection was only achieved in a small proportion of vaccinees. Therefore, TBE vaccination with the rapid scheme cannot be recommended for HIV-1 infected individuals."

		"abstract": "This study was carried out in north-eastern Poland during two hunting seasons between 2018 and 2020. Ticks (Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus) were removed from wild cervids and boars and examined for the presence of Borrelia spirochetes and Rickettsiales members: Rickettsia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. The present study contributes to the knowledge of even-toed ungulates, which are an important reservoir of the above-mentioned pathogens and a potential source of infections for humans through ticks as vectors. Almost 40% of the collected ticks (191 out of 484) were infected with the following pathogens: 3.3% with Borrelia spp., 19.2% with A. phagocytophilum and 26.9% with Rickettsia spp. Only the ticks collected from cervids carried Borrelia. Typing of the species DNA confirmed the presence of B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. lusitaniae and B. miyamotoi. An analysis of Rickettsia spp. sequences using the GenBank data revealed the presence of R. helvetica, R. raoultii and R. monacensis. Monoinfections (79.1%) dominated over co-infections (20.9%). Among co-infections, the most frequent was A. phagocytophilum/Rickettsia spp. (70%), however co-infections, including B. afzelii/A. phagocytophilum, B. afzelii/Rickettsia spp., B. miyamotoi/A. phagocytophilum and B. afzelii/B. garinii/B. lusitaniae, were also noted. Significant differences were observed in the affinity of some pathogens to their vectors. Thus, Borrelia spp. and A. phagocytophilum were more frequently detected in I. ricinus (5.3% and 23.1%) than in D. reticulatus (1.2% and 15.3%). Infection frequency with Rickettsia spp. was similar (approximately 25–29%) in both tick species. The prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. in ticks removed from cervids was 19.8% and 27.1%, and in ticks from wild boars it was 13.3% and 24.4%, respectively."

The present study aimed to detect tick-borne pathogens of the genera Anaplasma, Rickettsia and Francisella in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from the natural environment, i.e., recreational areas and pastures used for livestock grazing. A total of 1619 specimens of I. ricinus were collected, including ticks of all life stages (adults, nymphs and larvae). The study was performed using the PCR technique. Diagnostic gene fragments msp2 for Anaplasma, gltA for Rickettsia and tul4 for Francisella were amplified. No Francisella spp. DNA was detected in I. ricinus. DNA of A. phagocytophilum was detected in 0.54% of ticks and Rickettsia spp. in 3.69%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that only one species of Rickettsia, R. helvetica, was present in the studied tick population. The present results are a part of a large-scale analysis aimed at monitoring the level of tick infestation in Northwest Poland."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases (TBDs) indulge in severe economic losses in the livestock industry by adversely affecting the small ruminant breeding in tropical and subtropical zone countries, including Turkey. Turkey encompasses a wide land area representing diverse climatic conditions. The present study explored the presence and distribution of Babesia ovis, Theileria ovis, Theileria lestoquardi, Anaplasma ovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and the co-occurrence status of these pathogens. A total of 299 sheep blood samples were collected from fifteen provinces located in six different geographical regions in Turkey. PCR analyses were executed using species-specific primers based on Babesia ovis BoSSU rRNA, Theileria ovis ToSSU rRNA, Theileria lestoquardi 18S rRNA, Anaplasma ovis Major Surface Protein (AoMSP4), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum 16S rRNA genes. Overall, 219 (73.24%) sheep were found to be infected with at least one of the following protozoan and rickettsial pathogens; B. ovis, A. ovis,T. ovis, and A. phagocytophilum. Theileria lestoquardi was not detected in any blood sample. The global prevalence of B. ovis, A. ovis, T. ovis, and A. phagocytophilum was estimated to be 2.68%, 16.05%, 41.47%, and 57.19%, respectively. Besides this, dual (24.41%), triple (9.03%), and quadruple (0.67%) co-infections were detected in the study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed significant nucleotide sequence identities between the sequences obtained in this study and the sequences registered in the GenBank. This study provides relevant data regarding the predominance of ovine tick-borne protozoan and rickettsial agents in Turkey. A high molecular prevalence of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) was identified in the study. This situation indicates that TBPs should be screened continuously, and necessary control measures should be taken to prevent diseases caused by tick-borne protozoan and rickettsial agents."

It might take several clinical courses such as: meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis. The aim this study was to compare the YKL-40 concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with different clinical presentations of TBE and patients with excluded meningitis (control group). Methods The concentration of YKL-40 in CSF was determined using Fujirebio tests (Ghent, Belgium) in 32 patients with TBE: group I—patients with meningoencephalitis (n = 16); group II—patients with meningitis (n = 16). The control group (CG) consisted of 17 patients in whom inflammatory process in central nervous system was excluded. Results The concentration of YKL-40 was significantly higher in encephalitis group than in CG after 7 days from the last dose of treatment. The concentration in patients with neuroinflammation had significantly different concentration of YKL-40 compared to patients with no neuroinflammation control groups. ROC curve analysis indicates that: CSF YKL-40 concentration at cut off 783.87 differentiated TBE patients from CG with 100% specificity and 70% sensitivity and CSF YKL-40 concentration at cut off 980.11 differentiated meningitis from meningoencephalitis with 87.5% specificity and 62.5% sensitivity. Conclusions YKL-40 takes part in TBE pathogenesis, its concentration is the highest at the early stage of Central Nervous System involvement and decreases in the convalescent period. As YKL-40 is significantly higher in meningitis than in meningoencephalitis, it might be used as biomarker in differentiation of these clinical forms of TBE."

		"abstract": "According to the requirements of the “Rules for industrial safety of cranes”, anti-theft devices must ensure that cranes under the influence of wind force stop at any point on the track, including at the junction of rails connected by side strips. Various types of anti-theft crane devices recommended for use have a number of disadvantages. Thus, the supply  of anti-theft crane devices made in the form of lever grips interacting with the rail head with mechanisms for disengaging  and converging grippers with electromechanical, electromagnetic, hydraulic or pneumatic drives complicates their design. There are also known anti-theft crane devices, in which the stopping of cranes on a rail track is carried out by a locking eccentric interacting with the surface of the rail head. The reliability of such devices is insufficient, since, due to the constant force of the spring, the adhesion force of the eccentric to the rail does not depend on the changing wind force. The paper proposes the basics of calculating the anti-theft crane device, representing the kinematic connection of two mechanisms – eccentric and thick-borne, which allows to solve a number of the above problems."

The family Argasidae (soft ticks) comprises five genera and with about 193 species. Among all the argasid ticks, only four Argas and two Ornithodoros species are competent to transmit diseases. This chapter describes the various ticks of the argasidae family, diseases they transmit, and strategies for their control. A description of the two important genera, Ornithodorus and Argas, that belong to the family argasidae are provided. Emphasis is on the mammalian hosts affected, tick species involved, morphological features (with relevant pictorials), geographic distribution, life cycle, and economic importance. A detailed description of the two most important diseases transmitted by argasidae ticks namely African swine fever (ASF) and avian spirochaetosis is given. Emphasis is laid on the historical background, epidemiology, clinical signs, and strategies for their control."

For this, a total of 223 animals originating from north, central, and southeast Romania, including horses from stud farms (n = 118) and working horses (n = 105), were tested using a commercial rapid ELISA-based test. Overall, 10.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.7–15.1%) of the tested horses were seropositive for antibodies (Ab) against Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Additionally, 18.8% (95% CI: 13.9–24.6%) and 0.5% (95% CI: 0.01–2.5%) of horses were seropositive for Ab against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Ehrlichia spp., respectively. Among the tested horses, 3.1% were seroreactive to two or three pathogens. These findings show the natural exposure of Romanian horses to zoonotic tick-borne pathogens and emphasize the need for further studies to better understand the epidemiology of equine tick-borne diseases in Romania."

Blood samples were taken from the ear vein and smears were prepared, stained and examined in the laboratory for babesia parasite. A total of 687 (19.87%) samples were positive out of which 433(63.02%) were cattle,55(8.01%)sheep,177(25.76%)goat, 13 (1.89%) camel , 5(0.72%) horses, one(0.15%) donkey, one(0.15%)deer , and 2(0.30%) dogs . Compared to other years, the positive cases of babesosis were higher, 337 (49.05%) during 2017. In cattle, during the study period there was fluctuation amongst different seasons comparing between different years. However, comparing between seasons, generally the prevalence of babesia was significantly higher during summer (p˂0.05) and autumn (p˂0.01).In sheep, comparing between different years there was fluctuation amongst different seasons. However, comparing between seasons, generally the prevalence of babesia was significantly higher during autumn (p˂0.05). In goats, between years there were fluctuations for babesia prevalence in different seasons, while comparing between seasons, winter had significantly (p˂0.05) higher values. It is concluded that, babesiosis is one of the serious health problems in North Bahri that may negatively affect animals’ production mainly cattle and goats. This study also revealed that, babesia showed seasonal fluctuations in its occurrence. Restrict tick control strategies should be implemented by the veterinary authorities . A seroprevalence study should be performed for genetic characterization of babesia in the area. Moreover, studies to investigate drug resistance and epidemiological studies should be conducted amongst animal labors and owners."

		"abstract": "Deer represent a major vertebrate host for all feeding stages of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus in the United Kingdom (UK), and could play a role in the persistence of tick-borne pathogens. However, there have been few studies reporting the presence of Babesia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in deer in the UK, and those that detected Babesia were unable to confirm the species. To address this, we have investigated blood samples from red deer (Cervus elaphus) for the presence of tick-borne pathogens. Total DNA was extracted from haemolysed blood that was removed from clotted blood sampled from culled, captive red deer. Babesia spp. were detected with a pan-piroplasm PCR that amplifies a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene. Species were identified based on identity with published sequences. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected with a probe-based PCR targeting the msp2 gene. In addition, residual serum samples from a subset of animals were tested for the presence of anti-flavivirus antibodies. Of 105 red deer samples tested from three locations in the United Kingdom, 5 were positive for piroplasm and 5 were positive for A. phagocytophilum. Co-infection with both pathogens was detected in two samples from one location. No evidence for antibodies against West Nile virus were detected. However, 12% of sera tested were positive for tick-borne encephalitis virus antibodies."

Greater understanding of tick, host, and pathogen interactions will contribute to development of novel tick control and disease prevention strategies. Tick-borne pathogens adapt in multiple ways to very different tick and vertebrate host environments and defenses. Ticks effectively pharmacomodulate by its saliva host innate and adaptive immune defenses. In this review, we examine the idea that successful synergy between tick and tick-borne pathogen results in host immune tolerance that facilitates successful tick infection and feeding, creates a favorable site for pathogen introduction, modulates cutaneous and systemic immune defenses to establish infection, and contributes to successful long-term infection. Tick, host, and pathogen elements examined here include interaction of tick innate immunity and microbiome with tick-borne pathogens; tick modulation of host cutaneous defenses prior to pathogen transmission; how tick and pathogen target vertebrate host defenses that lead to different modes of interaction and host infection status (reservoir, incompetent, resistant, clinically ill); tick saliva bioactive molecules as important factors in determining those pathogens for which the tick is a competent vector; and, the need for translational studies to advance this field of study. Gaps in our understanding of these relationships are identified, that if successfully addressed, can advance the development of strategies to successfully disrupt both tick feeding and pathogen transmission."

This strict intracellular pathogen is a member of the family Anaplasmataceae and has been unculturable until recently. The only available genetic data on this new pathogen are six partially sequenced housekeeping genes. The aim of this study was to advance the knowledge regarding ‘N. mikurensis’ genomic relatedness with other Anaplasmataceae members, intra-species genotypic variability and potential virulence factors explaining its tropism for vascular endothelium. Here, we present the de novo whole-genome sequences of three ‘N. mikurensis’ strains derived from Swedish patients diagnosed with neoehrlichiosis. The genomes were obtained by extraction of DNA from patient plasma, library preparation using 10× Chromium technology, and sequencing by Illumina Hiseq-4500. ‘N. mikurensis’ was found to have the next smallest genome of the Anaplasmataceae family (1.1 Mbp with 27% GC contents) consisting of 845 protein-coding genes, every third of which with unknown function. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that ‘N. mikurensis’ was more closely related to Ehrlichia chaffeensis than to Ehrlichia ruminantium, the opposite of what 16SrRNA sequence-based phylogenetic analyses determined. The genetic variability of the three whole-genome-sequenced ‘N. mikurensis’ strains was extremely low, between 0.14 and 0.22‰, a variation that was associated with geographic origin. No protein-coding genes exclusively shared by N. mikurensis and E. ruminantium were identified to explain their common tropism for vascular endothelium."

This report describes a 16-year-old Warmblood gelding presenting with sudden onset of lethargy, ataxia, and muscle fasciculations on the nostrils, the lips, and the eye lids as the most important clinical findings. The horse further had a mild facial nerve paralysis with drooping of the right upper and lower lip. Diagnosis was based on paired serum samples using TBEV-ELISAs revealing high serum IgM in the first sample with normal IgM in the second sample and an increase in serum IgG and neutralizing antibodies, indicating acute and recent infection. TBEV was confirmed by a virus-neutralization test, revealing a fivefold increase in antibodies 32 days after of the onset of clinical signs. Although the specific PCR on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was negative, TBEV-specific IgG and IgM were identified in the CSF of the horse. Treatment consisted of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative treatment and the horse recovered with a mild drooping of the right nostril as the only remaining clinical sign. TBEV infection is a potential differential diagnosis of neurological disease in horses living in endemic areas and this is the first report to describe the diagnostic criteria in a horse as recommended in humans with suspected TBEV infection."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Timber harvest may impact tick-borne disease by affecting small mammal and tick community structures. We assessed tick and small mammal populations in older second-growth redwood (Sequoia sempervirens (D. Don) Endl) habitat at two harvested sites in Santa Cruz County, California, where local risk of tick-borne disease is high and determined the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in ticks. After single-tree removal harvest in 2014, there was a modest reduction in canopy, primarily toward the end of the study. Harvested sites showed strong reductions in California mouse (Peromyscus californicus, (Gambel)) captures 2-yr after harvest, resolving such that treatments and controls were comparable by the end of the study. Following harvest, treated sites experienced a transient decreased tick infestation while control plots experienced an increase. Ixodes angustus (Neumann) infestation probability on harvested plots decreased immediately after harvest, increasing with time but remaining lower than control plots, whereas I. pacificus (Cooley and Kohls) prevalence was higher shortly after the harvest on harvested plots, and continued to increase. Mean abundance of ticks on vegetation increased on control plots. We detected Borrelia burgdorferi ((Johnson et al.) Baranton) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum ((Foggie 1949) Dumler) in 3.8 and 3.1% of ticks on rodents, but no differences were associated with harvest. Impacts of forest harvest on tick-borne disease depend on removal practice and intensity, whether or not hosts are habitat specialists, and whether or not ticks are host specialists."

Herein, next generation sequencing (NGS)-based metagenomic approach was used to investigate the cause of illness in a subset of horses recruited for a tick-borne disease surveillance study during 2017–2019. Blood samples collected from 10 horses with suspected tick-borne infection and five apparently healthy horses were subjected to metagenomic analysis. Total genomic DNA extracted from the blood samples were enriched for microbial DNA and subjected to shotgun next generation sequencing using Nextera DNA Flex library preparation kit and V2 chemistry sequencing kit on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform. Overall, 0.4–0.6 million reads per sample were analyzed using Kraken metagenomic sequence classification program. The taxonomic classification of the reads indicated that bacterial genomes were overrepresented (0.5 to 1%) among the total microbial reads. Most of the bacterial reads (~91%) belonged to phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Tenericutes in both groups. Importantly, 10–42.5% of Alphaproteobacterial reads in 5 of 10 animals with suspected tick-borne infection were identified as"

		"abstract": "In recent years, an increase in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease (LD)) has been noted in the world, which causes the need for constant epidemic and clinical alertness. The causative agent of LD is Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, transmitting agents are Ixodes ricinus mites. Migratory erythema appears at the site of mite suction, which is a marker of cutaneous manifestation of LD — an early localized (І) stage of the disease. In the presence of migratory erythema, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is not difficult, but in the absence of the information about tick inoculation, the diagnosis is difficult. Timely detection and treatment of LD is important to prevent chronic disease, its progression with multiorgan lesions and complications, one of which is Borrelious lymphocytoma which refers to pathognomonic cutaneous manifestations of LD as a sign of dissemination (II or III) stage.Borreliosis lymphocytoma is diagnosed by positive serological tests — detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. The localization of borreliosis lymphocytoma — ear lobes, areolas of the nipples of the mammary glands, axillary cavities, occiput, scrotum, rear feet — is of decisive importance for the diagnosis. Treatment of both migratory erythema and borreliosis lymphocytoma consists of antibiotics. A rare case of borreliosis lymphocytoma is described in a patient with the disease duration of more than 15 years with the localization of the pathological process on the skin of the left ear in the area of the lobe and around it. The treatment plan was drawn up in two directions: the first included antibiotics and a synthetic drug that inhibited the activity of T lymphocytes without affecting B lymphocytes; the second one included pathogenetic drugs that increase the production of antibodies, reduce the manifestations of secondary immunodeficiency and have an anti-inflammatory effect. The pictures of the patient in dynamics are presented as she recovers. After the therapy, the patient achieved clinical recovery."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease, caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus. According to ECDC, Poland should be considered as an endemic area. The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin ‘Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018’ . RESULTS. In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

Lyme arthritis is now less frequently seen than at the time of its discovery. However, it still occurs, and it is important to recognize this, the differential diagnoses, and how laboratory tests can be useful and their limitations. The most frequently used diagnostic tests are antibody based. However, antibody testing still suffers from many drawbacks and is only an indirect measure of exposure. In contrast, evolving direct diagnostic methods can indicate active infection."

		"abstract": "In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of"

(3) Results: Representational areas are regulated by participant age and whether or not they had contracted a mosquito-borne disease.

Here, we investigated the innate immune profile induced in vitro by the antigen component of the vaccines, inactivated TBEV (I-TBEV), to gain insights into the mechanism of action of the TBE vaccine as compared to the live virus. To this end, we exposed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to inactivated and live TBEV and assessed cellular responses by RNA sequencing. Both inactivated and live TBEV significantly induced an interferon-dominated gene signature and an increased RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) expression. Using pathway-specific inhibitors, we assessed the involvement of pattern recognition receptors in the sensing of inactivated or live TBEV. Only RLR pathway inhibition significantly suppressed the downstream cascade induced by I-TBEV, while responses to the replicating virus were impacted by the inhibition of RIG-I-like, as well as Toll-like, receptors. Our results show that inactivated and live TBEV predominantly engaged an interferon response in our in vitro PBMC platform, and indicate RLRs as the main pattern recognition receptors involved in I-TBEV sensing."

		"abstract": "The Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes different disease symptoms varying from asymptomatic infection to severe encephalitis and meningitis suggesting a crucial role of the human host immune system in determining the fate of the infection. There is a need to understand the mechanisms underpinning TBEV-host interactions leading to protective immunity. To this aim, we studied the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to the whole formaldehyde inactivated TBEV (I-TBEV), the drug substance of Encepur, one of the five commercially available vaccine. Immunophenotyping, transcriptome and cytokine profiling of PBMC revealed that I-TBEV generates differentiation of a sub-population of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) that is specialized in type I interferon (IFN) production. In contrast, likely due to the presence of aluminum hydroxide, Encepur vaccine was a poor pDC stimulus. We demonstrated I-TBEV-induced type I IFN together with Interleukin 6 and BAFF to be critical for B cell differentiation to plasmablasts as measured by immunophenotyping and immunoglobulin production. Robust type I IFN secretion was induced by pDC with the concerted action of both viral E glycoprotein and RNA mirroring previous data on dual stimulation of pDC by both"

The shelf life of immunoglobulin isolated from human immune blood plasma can be increased by freeze-drying an antibody solution stabilized with L-proline and glycine at a concentration of 12.5 g/L each and adjusting the pH value to 5.0± 0.5. The proposed method was used to obtain 3 batches of a reference sample with a shelf life from 30 to 48 months. During this time, the tested samples retained constant potency, fragmentation, absobance (400 nm) and dissolution time, which allows predicting its further stability during storage. The proposed method can also be helpful for obtaining stable antibody lyophilisates for use as standards in the analysis of the specific activity of human immunoglobulins against tick-borne encephalitis. reference standard, human tick-borne encephalitis immunoglobulin, L-proline, glycine, lyophilization, specific activity, production technology The work was carried out in accordance with the state assignment \"Improvement of Quality Control Methods for Human Immunoglobulins\"."

It is one of the major constraints to the expansion of livestock rearing and livestock-based industries in Africa. It also constrains mixed farming, human health, and livelihood in tropical Africa. The tsetse fly is the major vector of the disease. Acute disease is characterized by marked depression, intermittent fever, anorexia, anemia, blood-tinged diarrhea, and adenopathy, sometimes petechiae on mucosa, abortion, and death if not treated. Diagnosis is made by observing trypanosome parasites by direct microscopic examination of blood, lymph nodes, edema fluid, or tissues. Treatment is by chemotherapy and chemoprophylaxis. Control is achieved through vector control treatment using available molecules and use of a few available trypanotolerant breeds of animals."

Also, the TBEV-antibody levels for the mean-herd serum showed good comparability with TBEV antibody levels from bulk tank milk, thus indicating good predictability of seroprevalence when analysing bulk tank milk from a herd. Conclusion: Serological examination of bulk tank milk from dairy cattle herds may be a useful sentinel surveillance method to identify geographical presence of TBEV. In contrast to individual sampling this method allows a large number of animals to be monitored. TBEV seropositive herds were mainly found in coastal areas of southern Sweden similar to human TBE cases. However, some antibody-reactive herds were found outside known TBE areas at the time of the study."

Patients with the monophasic course were significantly (p ≤ 0.002) older (57 vs. 50 years), more often vaccinated against TBE (7.4% vs. 0.9%), more often had comorbidities (52% vs. 37%), and were more often treated in the intensive care unit (12.4% vs. 5.2%). Multivariate logistic regression found strong association between the monophasic TBE course and previous TBE vaccination (OR = 18.45), presence of underlying illness (OR = 1.85), duration of neurologic involvement before cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination (OR = 1.39), and patients’ age (OR = 1.02). Furthermore, patients with monophasic TBE had higher CSF levels of immune mediators associated with innate and adaptive (Th1 and B-cell) immune responses, and they had more pronounced disruption of the blood–brain barrier. However, the long-term outcome 2–7 years after TBE was comparable. In summary, the monophasic course is a frequent and distinct presentation of TBE that is associated with more difficult disease course and higher levels of inflammatory mediators in CSF than the biphasic course; however, the long-term outcome is similar."

		"abstract": "Livestock farming plays an important role in supporting the livelihood of resource-poor subsistence farmers in Bhutan. However, ticks and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are one of the major constraints to livestock farming due to their negative effect on health and production. To date, no study has been conducted in Bhutan to assess farmers’ knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) about ticks and TBDs in cattle, although such information is essential in ensuring the development and adoption of effective prevention and control measures. Therefore, a KAP survey was conducted among 246 cattle owners in the Samkhar sub-district of eastern Bhutan in June 2019, using a structured questionnaire. Based on our scoring criteria, 52% [95%CI: 45.5–58.4] had adequate knowledge about ticks as potential vectors of diseases. Logistic regression analysis showed that the individuals who practiced a stall-feeding system of cattle rearing were 2.8 times [OR = 2.8 (95%CI: 1.66–4.78)] more likely to have adequate knowledge than others. Sixty-eight percent [95%CI: 62.5–74.4] had a favorable attitude toward tick prevention and control programs. Men were 1.95 times [OR = 1.95 (95%CI: 1.09–3.55)] more likely to have a favorable attitude than women, and the individuals who practiced a stall-feeding system were 2.59 times [OR = 2.59 95%CI: 1.45–4.78)] more likely to have a favorable attitude than others, after adjusting for the effect of other variables in the model. Overall, only 38% [95%CI 32.5–45] of the respondents reported tick infestation as one of the most important animal health problems, but 100% reported using acaricides to control ticks in cattle. Despite a high level of acaricide usage, the level of knowledge was low among the farmers interviewed. Findings from this study underline the importance of considering identified knowledge gaps and initiating education efforts to improve the adoption of effective tick prevention and control measures among farmers."

Therefore, a comprehensive cross-sectional stratified serosurvey and PCR analysis of selected horses (n = 301) were performed in TBEV endemic localities in Lithuania. Attached and moving ticks (n = 241) have been collected from aforementioned hosts to evaluate natural infectivity of TBEV vectors (Ixodes spp.) in the recreational environments surrounding equestrian centers. All samples were screened for TBEV IgG and positive samples were confirmed by virus neutralization test (VNT). 113 (37.5%) horses from all counties of Lithuania tested positive for TBEV IgG, revealing age and sex indifferent results of equine seroprevalence that were significantly dependent on pedigree: horses of mixed breed were more susceptible to infection possibly due to their management practices. TBEV prevalence in equine species corresponded to TBEV-confirmed human cases in the precedent year. As much as 3.9% of horses were viraemic with TBEV-RNA with subsequent confirmation of TBEV European subtype. 4/38 of tested tick pools were positive for TBEV-RNA (Minimal infectious rate 1.2%). Several unknown microfoci were revealed during the study indicating areas of extreme risk close to popular human entertainment sites. The study provides important evidence in favor of horses’ usage as sentinel species, as equines could provide more detailed epidemiological mapping of TBEV, as well as more efficient collection of ticks for surveillance studies."

It can lead to inter alia, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), or even death and, unfortunately, treatment is only symptomatic. Therefore, the aim of the present study was assessment of the concentrations of free light chains (FLC) kappa (κ) and lambda (λ in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with TBE. Methods: A total of 58 cerebrospinal fluid and serum sample pairs were analyzed. Samples were collected from patients with TBE before and after treatment. FLC were measured using the turbidimetric method. The values of κIgG-index, λIgG-index, κFLC-index and λFLC-index were calculated using relevant formulas. Results: Pre-treatment serum λFLC concentrations were higher in comparison to post-treatment levels. Moreover, it was observed that CSF λFLC, TBEV IgM, TBEV IgG, and serum TBEV IgG, as well as the values of λFLC-index, κFLC-index, and λIgG-index were elevated after treatment. In the total study group, the concentrations of CSF κFLC and λFLC, and values of four indexes: κFLC-index, λFLC-index, κIgG-index, and λIgG-index correlated with each other and with CSF TBEV IgM and IgG antibodies. The CSF level of TBEV IgG was also associated with serum IgG TBEV and CSF IgM TBEV antibodies. Additionally, serum κFLC correlated with serum and CSF λFLC. Conclusion: This is the first study that demonstrates statistically significant differences in serum and CSF λFLC, as well as in the calculated values of three algorithms: λIgG-index, κFLC-index, and λIgG-index prior to and following treatment of TBE. Our findings may indicate that these differences reflect the intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins and increased permeability of BBB in patients with TBE. Moreover, it could provide the basis for developing new therapeutic strategies."

Lately, the spread of known tick-borne pathogens has been expanding, and novel ones have been identified as (re)emerging health threats. Updating the current knowledge on tick-borne pathogens in areas where humans and animals can be easily exposed to ticks represents a starting point for epidemiological studies and public awareness. A PCR screening for tick-borne pathogens was carried out in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in a peri-urban recreational park in Ticino Valley, Italy. The presence of Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi senso latu complex, Anaplasma spp. and Babesia spp. was evaluated in a total of 415 I. ricinus specimens. Rickettsia spp. (R monacensis and R. helvetica) were detected in 22.96% of the samples, while B. burgdorferi s.l. complex (B. afzelii and B. lusitaniae) were present in 10.94%. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (1.99%) and Babesia venatorum (0.73%) were reported in the area of study for the first time. This study confirmed the presence of endemic tick-borne pathogens and highlighted the presence of emerging pathogens that should be monitored especially in relation to fragile patients, the difficult diagnosis of tick-borne associated diseases and possible interactions with other tick-borne pathogens."

Here we performed a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen and identified G-protein-coupled receptor glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP2R) as a receptor for TBEV to infect nerve cells. Knockdown or knockout of GLP2R reduced TBEV infection of different nerve cells; trans supply of GLP2R restored viral infection. GLP2R directly binds to viral envelope domain III through its extracellular loop 1 (ECL1). TBEV infection can be blocked by the ECL1 peptide, a functional ligand to GLP2R, or GLP2R antibodies. GLP2R-deficient mice were generated to validate the role of GLP2R in TBEV infection and pathogenesis. Wild-type mice succumbed to TBEV infection and developed >107 TCID50 (median tissue culture infectious dose) virus per gram of brain tissue. In contrast, all GLP2R-deficient mice survived TBEV infection without detectable infectious virus in brain. Altogether, our results support GLP2R as a receptor for TBEV to infect nerve cells."

We reviewed the occurrence of tick species and the pathogens they transmit from the MENA on published papers from 1901–2020. We found taxonomic records of 55 tick species infesting livestock representing the following eight genera: Ornithodoros, Otobius, Amblyomma, Dermacentor, Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Ixodes, and Rhipicephalus. In addition, 15 pathogens were recorded causing diseases of significance, with Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, theileriosis, babesiosis and anaplasmosis being widely distributed diseases in the region. In recent decades, there has been increasing trends in disease occurrence and movement associated with global movement of humans and global trade of animals. We suggest that disease control and prevention could be achieved effectively through good integration between public health, veterinary medicine and animal management, and ecological approaches. We recommend further research in the areas of tick ecology and tick born-disease transmission. Furthermore, we suggest evaluation and improvement of disease control policies in the region."

To facilitate detection in NGS, the sequence-independent, single-primer-amplification (SISPA) is an effective tool for enriching virus sequences. We performed a preliminary assessment of SISPA-nanopore sequencing as a potential approach for screening tick-borne viruses in six specimens with detectable Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) sequences. A comparison of unbiased NGS and SISPA followed by nanopore sequencing was carried out in 4 specimens with single and pooled ticks. The approach was further used for genome sequencing in culture-grown viruses. Overall, total/virus-specific read counts were significantly elevated in cell culture supernatants in comparison to single or pooled ticks. Virus genomes could be successfully characterized by SISPA with identities over 99%. Genome coverage varied according to the segment and total read count. Base calling errors were mainly observed in tick specimens and more frequent in lower viral loads. Culture-grown viruses were phylogenetically-related to previously-reported local viruses. In conclusion, the SISPA + nanopore sequencing was successful in generating data comparable to NGS and will provide an effective tool for broad-range virus detection in ticks."

In general, they are considered to more resistant to diseases compared to crossbred cattle. However, a recent problem of tick-borne diseases in the water buffaloes by the field veterinarians and farmers causing production losses was observed. The study was conducted to explore the spectrum of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) infections in buffaloes and analyze the associated risk factors. Methods: Acute-phase response, cytokine and oxidative stress in infected buffaloes with TBDs were evaluated and compared with the negative buffaloes (control) to elucidate their role in pathogenesis and outcome of infection. The study was undertaken in 107 tick-infested water buffaloes. The conventional Giemsa stained blood smear (GSBS) based confirmation and classification of infection of haemo-parasites were made. The statistical model was used to understand their relevance with TBDs. Conclusion: Tick-borne disease in water buffaloes must be looked upon seriously to maintain good productivity. The buffaloes are often accompanied by low and un-yielding clinical symptoms due to associated co-infections of haemo-parasites. Our study showed that the buffaloes had a high prevalence (47.66%) of haemo-parasites transmitted by the ticks associated with co-infections and a low level of parasitemia. Most buffaloes responded symptomatically with the different modalities administered. Production parameter was not restored post 15 days of treatment. Oxidative stress is one of the important mechanisms of production losses in infected buffaloes."

		"abstract": "Currently the only effective measure against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is vaccination. Despite the high efficacy of approved vaccines against TBE, rare cases of vaccine failures are well documented. Both host- and virus-related factors can account for such failures. In this work, we studied the influence of mouse strain and sex and the effects of cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression on the efficacy of an inactivated TBE vaccine. We also investigated how an increased proportion of non-infectious particles in the challenge TBE virus would affect the protectivity of the vaccine. The vaccine efficacy was assessed by mortality, morbidity, levels of viral RNA in the brain of surviving mice, and neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers against the vaccine strain and the challenge virus. Two-dose vaccination protected most animals against TBE symptoms and death, and protectivity depended on strain and sex of mice. Immunosuppression decreased the vaccine efficacy in a dose-dependent manner and changed the vaccine-induced NAb spectrum. The vaccination protected mice against TBE virus neuroinvasion and persistence. However, viral RNA was detected in the brain of some asymptomatic animals at 21 and 42 dpi. Challenge with TBE virus enriched with non-infectious particles led to lower NAb titers in vaccinated mice after the challenge but did not affect the protective efficacy."

Morphologically, ticks are classified into two families known as Ixodidae (hard ticks) and Argasidae (soft ticks). In this chapter, the authors provide a description of the soft and hard ticks. Emphasis is laid on the genera morphology, species, mammalian hosts, and distribution and the diseases transmitted by the ticks species. Various methods for controlling ticks and tick-borne diseases using chemicals are described. A broad range of chemical acaricides used for the control of ticks on livestock are described. Conventional methods and unconventional methods for applying acaricides to protect livestock against ticks are described. Alternative methods for tick control are described. Only the most important hard and soft ticks and associated diseases are discussed within the limits of this review."

Thus, it is important to understand the disease in terms causative agent, vectors, hosts, and distribution. Babesia is the causative agent of the disease and has a life cycle both in the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. The major bovine species are B. bovis, B. bigemina, found in the tropics and sub tropics while B. divergens and B. major are found in the temperate regions. Bovine babesiosis is transmitted by the one-host cattle ticks, formerly in the genus Boophilus and now Rhipicephalus. In endemic areas are tick management, immunization, and anti-babesia drugs or by a combination. Chemotherapy is important for controlling the disease either to treat field cases or to control artificially induced infections. Conventional drugs for treating bovine babesiosis are Imidocarb dipropionate and Diminazene aceturate. Ticks are controlled by application of acaricides, but tick resistance and environmental pollution are drawbacks."

		"abstract": "Canine ehrlichiosis is an infection of canids causing a clinical disease in domestic dogs and asymptomatic infections in wild canids. Currently, the disease assumes a cosmopolitan distribution. This chapter summarises published information on the disease from across Africa. Some studies were able to demonstrate experimental infections in these canids. Different diagnostic methods, cell culture, direct microscopy, serology, hematology, and molecular methods were employed in different studies for detection of ehrlichiosis. Treatment of the disease mainly involved use of oxytetracycline, doxycycline, imidocarb disproportionate, and levamisole. In severe cases, management has involved administration of supportive therapy such as blood transfusion. Generally, though available, the information on different aspects of the disease in the Africa is scant and fragmented. There is still a need to generate more information on the epidemiology, diagnosis, clinical aspects, and treatment of the disease."

This trait is observed in many West African breeds of cattle that survive in areas of tsetse fly challenge where the humped zebu cannot. Small ruminants and wildlife also exhibit increased resistance to infection with trypanosomes. Trypanotolerance is viewed as a more sustainable and environmentally friendly approach to control of trypanosomiasis given the limitations of the present methods of control and lack of vaccine. Little work has been conducted with East African cattle breeds. The Kenyan Orma Boran (OB) has been studied since 1983 to enhance its conservation and utilization in East African region. Nucleus breeding herd of superior genotypes was multiplied in Galana Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) and disseminated to trypanosomosis endemic areas of Kenya. On evaluation, performance of the crosses was comparable to that of other Borans. Challenges of adoption in pastoral area are presented."

		"abstract": "Bovine anaplasmosis is one of the most important tick borne diseases of ruminants worldwide causing significant economic losses in the livestock industries due to the high morbidity and mortality in susceptible cattle herds. Bovine anaplasmosis, caused by Anaplasma marginale, is an infectious but non-contagious disease. The mode of transmission of bovine anaplasmosis includes mechanical (blood contaminated fomites (needles, ear tagging, dehorning and castration equipment), biological (tick bites) and transplacental (mother to fetus). Bovine Anaplasmosis occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. Cattle of all ages are susceptible to infection with A. marginale, but the severity of disease increases with age. The common clinical sign of bovine anaplsmosis includes; fever, anorexia, rapid loss of body condition, severe decrease in milk production, pale and icteric mucous membranes, increased heart and respiratory rates, muscle weakness and depression. Diagnosis of bovine anaplasmosis can be made by demonstration of A. marginale on stained blood smears from clinically infected animals during the acute phase of the disease, but it is not reliable for detecting infection in pre-symptomatic or carrier animals. Instead, serological demonstration of antibodies and confirmation of antigen with molecular detection tools are used for diagnosis. Anaplasmosis can be treated by administration of oxytetracyclines, however oxytetracyclines do not clear the parasite from carrier animals. Control measures for bovine anaplasmosis vary with geographical location and include maintenance of Anaplasma free herds, vector control, administration of antibiotics and vaccination. Intensive acaridae application to control ticks has a number of limitations, therefore, immunization together with strategic tick control is recommended for exotic and crossbred cattle. Further studies on epidemiology of bovine anaplasmosis is needed"

In Kenya it is the most important tick-borne disease and a major constraint in cattle productivity. This is due to the high morbidity and mortality it causes in susceptible herds, the cost of control of the vector ticks, and the cost of treatment of clinical cases. Animals that recover from the disease also suffer from reduced productivity which can be long term. The limited distribution of the tick and the disease to only East, Central and Southern Africa also means that the market for therapeutic drugs and acaricides is small. Therefore, drug companies are not keen on funding research and development of new drug and acaricide molecules when resistance occurs."

This chapter covers the classification, morphology, basic biology, and the eco-distribution of tsetse flies. The role of tsetse flies in disease epidemiology has also been reviewed. The elementary biology of these vectors is quite well known and elucidated. However, with advances in molecular and other biological techniques, new insights related to tsetse biology have been obtained.

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is associated with a range of disease severity. The reasons for this heterogeneity are not clear. Levels of serum IgG antibodies to TBE virus (TBEV) were determined in 691 adult patients during the meningoencephalitic phase of TBE and correlated with detailed clinical and laboratory parameters during acute illness and with the presence of post-encephalitic syndrome (PES) 2–7 years after TBE. Specific IgG antibody levels ranged from below cut-off value (in 32/691 patients, 4.6%), to 896 U/mL (median = 37.3 U/mL). Patients with meningoencephalomyelitis were more often seronegative (24.3%; 9/37) than those with meningoencephalitis (4.7%; 20/428) or meningitis (1.3%; 3/226). Moreover, patients with antibody levels below cut-off had longer hospitalization (13 versus 8 days); more often required intensive care unit treatment (22% versus 8%) and artificial ventilation (71% versus 21%); and had a higher fatality rate (3/32; 9.4% versus 1/659; 0.2%) than seropositive patients. These results were confirmed when antibody levels, rather than cut-off values, were correlated with clinical parameters including the likelihood to develop PES. Low serum IgG antibody responses against TBEV at the onset of neurologic involvement are associated with a more difficult clinical course and unfavorable long-term outcome of TBE, providing a diagnostic and clinical challenge for physicians."

We sur-veyed the diversity of ticks and TBPs associated with camels and co-grazing sheep at 12 sites in Marsabit County, northern Kenya. We screened blood and ticks (858 pools) collected from 296 camels and 77 sheep for bacterial and protozoan TBPs by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of PCR products. Hyalomma (75.7%), Amblyomma (17.6%) and Rhipicephalus (6.7%) spp. ticks were morphologically identified and confirmed by molecular analyses. We detected TBP DNA in 80.1% of blood samples from 296 healthy camels. “Candidatus Anaplasma camelii”, “Candidatus Ehrlichia regneryi” and Coxiella burnetii were detected in both camels and associ-ated ticks, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia aeschlimannii and Coxiella endo-symbionts were detected in camel ticks. We also detected Ehrlichia ruminantium, responsible for heartwater disease in ruminants, in Amblyomma ticks infesting camels and sheep and in sheep blood, indicating its endemicity in Marsabit. Our findings also suggest that camels and/or the ticks infesting them are reservoirs of zoonotic Q fever (C. burnetii), ehrlichiosis (E. chaffeensis), and rickettsiosis (R. africae), which pose a public health threat to pastoralist communities."

In this forum article, we highlight roles that wildlife hosts play in the maintenance and transmission of zoonotic, companion animal, livestock, and wildlife tick-borne pathogens. We begin by illustrating how wildlife contribute directly and indirectly to the increase and geographic expansion of ticks and their associated pathogens. Wildlife provide blood meals for tick growth and reproduction; serve as pathogen reservoirs; and can disperse ticks and pathogens—either through natural movement (e.g., avian migration) or through human-facilitated movement (e.g., wildlife translocations and trade). We then discuss opportunities to manage tick-borne disease through actions directed at wildlife hosts. To conclude, we highlight key gaps in our understanding of the ecology of tick–host interactions, emphasizing that wildlife host communities are themselves a very dynamic component of tick–pathogen–host systems and therefore complicate management of tick-borne diseases, and should be taken into account when considering host-targeted approaches. Effective management of wildlife to reduce tick-borne disease risk further requires consideration of the ‘human dimensions’ of wildlife management. This includes understanding the public’s diverse views and values about wildlife and wildlife impacts—including the perceived role of wildlife in fostering tick-borne diseases. Public health agencies should capitalize on the expertise of wildlife agencies when developing strategies to reduce tick-borne disease risks."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is the most prevalent arbovirus, with a tentative estimate of 10,000 to 10,500 infections occurring in Europe and Asia every year. Endemic in Northeast China, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is emerging as a major threat to public health, local economies and tourism. The complicated array of host physiological changes has hampered elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease. Methodology/Principle findings: System-level characterization of the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult TBEV patients and a healthy control group was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. By tracking metabolic and lipid changes during disease progression, crucial physiological changes that coincided with disease stages could be identified. Twenty-eight metabolites were significantly altered in the sera of TBE patients in our metabolomic analysis, and 14 lipids were significantly altered in our lipidomics study. Among these metabolites, alpha-linolenic acid, azelaic acid, D-glutamine, glucose-1-phosphate, L-glutamic acid, and mannose-6-phosphate were altered compared to the control group, and PC(38:7), PC(28:3;1), TAG(52:6), etc. were altered based on lipidomics. Major perturbed metabolic pathways included amino acid metabolism, lipid and oxidative stress metabolism (lipoprotein biosynthesis, arachidonic acid biosynthesis, leukotriene biosynthesis and sphingolipid metabolism), phospholipid metabolism and triglyceride metabolism. These metabolites were significantly perturbed during disease progression, implying their latent utility as prognostic markers. Conclusions/Significance: TBEV infection causes distinct temporal changes in the serum metabolome and lipidome, and many metabolites are potentially involved in the acute inflammatory response and immune regulation. Our global analysis revealed anti- and pro-inflammatory processes in the host and changes to the entire metabolic profile. Relationships between metabolites and pathologies were established. This study provides important insight into the pathology of TBE, including its pathology, and lays the foundation for further research into putative markers of TBE disease."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been a notifiable disease in Germany since 2001. Its causative agent, the TBE virus (TBEV), is the most important arbovirus in Europe and Northern Asia. The illness, caused by the European Subtype usually displays flu-like symptoms, but can result in sequelae and, in 2 % of all cases, in death. Over the last few decades, the virus has spread into new habitats, such as higher altitudes in the Alpine region. For this study, it was hypothesized that the environmental challenges that the virus might be exposed to at such altitudes could lead to the selection of viral strains with a higher resilience to such environmental factors. To determine whether strains identified at higher altitudes possessed different genetic traits compared to viruses from lower altitudes, an analysis of viral genomes from higher Alpine altitudes (> 500 m above sea level) (n = 5) and lower altitudes (< 500 m above sea level) (n = 4) was performed. No common phylogenetic ancestry or shared amino acid substitutions could be identified that differentiated the alpine from the lowland viral strains. These findings support the idea of many individual introductions of TBEV into the alpine region and the establishment of foci due to non-viral specific factors such as favorable conditions for vector species and host animals due to climate change."

		"abstract": "Flaviviruses circulate worldwide and cause a number of medically relevant human diseases, such as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). Serology plays an important role in the diagnosis of flavivirus infections, but can be impeded by antigenic cross-reactivities among flaviviruses. Therefore, serological diagnosis of a recent infection can be insufficiently specific, especially in areas where flaviviruses co-circulate and/or vaccination coverage against certain flaviviruses is high. In this study, we developed a new IgM assay format, which is well suited for the specific diagnosis of TBE, Zika and dengue virus infections. In the case of TBE and Zika, the IgM response proved to be highly specific for the infecting virus. In contrast, primary dengue virus infections induced substantial amounts of cross-reactive IgM antibodies, which is most likely explained by structural peculiarities of dengue virus particles. Despite the presence of cross-reactive IgM, the standardized nature and the quantitative read-out of the assay even allowed the serotype-specific diagnosis of recent dengue virus infections in most instances."

The case was linked to alimentary infection by raw milk from a goat farm in the region of Tübingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, where no previous TBE cases in the area had been reported before. The TBE focus was confirmed by isolation of the TBE virus from ticks and Serological confirmation of past infection in one of the five flock goats. Additional investigations by the local public health office identified 27 consumers of goat milk at the putative period of exposure. For 20/27 exposed persons, anamnestic information was gained by the local public health office. Twelve/fourteen exposed and non-vaccinated people developed clinical illness and were confirmed as TBE cases by Serology. Five/six vaccinated and exposed people did not develop the disease. The one exposed and vaccinated person had their last TBE vaccination booster more than 15 years ago, and therefore a booster was more than 10 years overdue. None of the regularly vaccinated and exposed persons developed clinical overt TBE infection. We report the first known TBE outbreak, during which, protection by TBE vaccination against alimentary TBE infection was demonstrated."

Blood sample were collected randomly from a total of 216 cattle slaughtered at abattoir in both dry and wet season at Wurukum abattoir, Wadata abattoir, Modern Market Abattoir, Cattle Market Abattoir North Bank, Cattle Market North Bank and University of Agriculture cattle farm, Makurdi and analyzed using Microscopic method by thin blood film. Horn method was used to determine the age of the examined cattle and the collected data was analyzed using T-test, p values at ≤ was considered statistically significant. The result showed that the rate of infection was seen to increase progressively in cattle of age 6–7 through age 10–11 with the highest prevalence recorded in age 10–11 in dry season and the lowest percentage of infection recorded in age 2–3 and cattle of age 0–1 showed the highest (27(75.00 %)) rate of infection while age 6–7 showed the lowest rate of infection in wet season. But the difference was not statistically significant (p ˂ 0.05). Male cattle recorded a non statistically significant (p ˂ 0.05) higher (53.13 %) occurrence of infection while female recorded a lower occurrence of 50.0 %. The result of mixed infection revealed the occurrence of Bebesia, Anaplasmamaginal, Anaplasma central and Theileria. 100 % of mixed infection of Bebesia&Anaplasmamaginal and Anaplasma central and Anaplasmamaginaloccurred in West African Dwarf cattle and Sokoto gudali respectively. There was no occurrence of mixed infection of Theileria and Anaplasma central across all the examined species of cattle. White Fulani recorded mixed infection of Anaplasma central&Anaplasmamaginal, Bebesia&Anaplasma central and Bebesia&Anaplasmamaginal of 4(30.8 %), 4(30.8 %) and 5(38.5 %) percent respectively.Muturu species did not record any occurrence of mixed infection of tick borne haemoparasite.The result of the study shows that mixed infection of tick-borne haemoparasite infection are very high and common among cattle hence, preferences should be given to inspection of older male cattle and optimal management of all ruminant animals against ticks and tick-borne related infection."

Here we present results of a study on tick-borne pathogens detected from tick vectors and rodent reservoirs from an ongoing 5-yr tick suppression study in the Lyme disease-endemic state of Maryland, where human-biting tick species, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes), are abundant. During the 2017 tick season, we collected 207 questing ticks and 602 ticks recovered from 327 mice (Peromyscus spp. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)), together with blood and ear tissue from the mice, at seven suburban parks in Howard County. Ticks were selectively tested for the presence of the causative agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [s.l.]), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), babesiosis (Babesia microti), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and ‘Panola Mountain’ Ehrlichia) and spotted fever group rickettsiosis (Rickettsia spp.). Peromyscus ear tissue and blood samples were tested for Bo. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s), A. phagocytophilum, Ba. microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi. We found 13.6% (15/110) of questing I. scapularis nymphs to be Bo. burgdorferi s.l. positive and 1.8% (2/110) were A. phagocytophilum positive among all sites. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was found in 71.1% (54/76) of I. scapularis nymphs removed from mice and 58.8% (194/330) of captured mice. Results from study on tick abundance and pathogen infection status in questing ticks, rodent reservoirs, and ticks feeding on Peromyscus spp. will aid efficacy evaluation of the integrated tick management measures being implemented."

Despite the wide distribution of tick-borne pathogens in Sudan, the information on the tick–pathogen relationship needs to be updated, particularly using modern molecular techniques. This cross-sectional study, conducted between September and November 2019, used morphology, PCR, and sequencing to confirm the identity of adult cattle ticks (male and female; n = 536) from Khartoum State (n = 417) and East Darfur State (n = 119). Moreover, the presence of Theileria annulata, Babesia bigemina, B. bovis, Anaplasma marginale, and Ehrlichia ruminantium was detected and confirmed in each tick using species-specific PCR or nested PCR and sequencing. The most economically important tick genera, Rhipicephalus, Hyalomma, and Amblyomma, were prevalent in the study area, and 13 different tick species were identified. The most prevalent tick species were Rhipicephalusevertsi evertsi (34.3%) and Hyalomma anatolicum (57.3%) in Khartoum State, and Rhipicephalus annulatus (27%), Rhipicephalus decoloratus (25%), and Hyalomma rufipes (29%) in East Darfur State. We detected all five pathogens in both states. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the presence of E. ruminantium, its vector Amblyomma variegatum, and B. bovis in Khartoum State. Further, this is the first report on most tick and pathogen species identified in East Darfur State. Our findings indicate the migration of some tick and pathogen species beyond their distribution areas in the country, and this consideration is necessary to develop future control strategies."

		"abstract": "Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne flavivirus circulating in North America and the Russian Far East that can cause severe neuroinvasive diseases, including encephalitis, meningitis, and meningoencephalitis. The reported neuroinvasive case fatality is about 10%, and approximately 50% of the survivors from the neuroinfection exhibit long-lasting or permanent neurological sequelae. Currently, treatment of POWV infection is supportive, and no FDA-approved vaccines or specific therapeutics are available. A novel Powassan vaccine candidate was created using virus-like particle technology (POW-VLP) and assembled with the viral structural proteins pre-Membrane (prM) and Envelope (E). Western blot immunoassay demonstrated high antigenicity of POW-VLP structural proteins. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the POW-VLP exhibited icosahedral morphology typical of flaviviruses. A dose-escalation study in a murine model was performed to test immunogenicity and safety. Serum antibody was tested by ELISA, demonstrating that POW-VLP afforded 100% seroconversion to the E protein. Reporter viral-particle neutralization assay demonstrated high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of immunized mice. Hybridomas expressing monoclonal antibodies were produced following POW-VLP immunization. The POW-VLP vaccine candidate created in this study provides a strategy for inducing protective antibodies against Powassan neuroinvasive infection."

		"abstract": "Ticks are ubiquitous ectoparasites, feeding on representatives of all classes of terrestrial vertebrates and transmitting numerous pathogens of high human and veterinary medical importance. Exotic animals kept in zoological gardens, ranches, wildlife parks or farms may play an important role in the ecology of ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs), as they may serve as hosts for local tick species. Moreover, they can develop diseases of varying severity after being infected by TBPs, and theoretically, can thus serve as reservoirs, thereby further propagating TBPs in local ecosystems. The definite role of these animals in the tick–host-pathogen network remains poorly investigated. This review provides a summary of the information currently available regarding ticks and TBPs in connection to captive local and exotic wildlife, with an emphasis on zoo-housed species."

Effective inactivated purified whole-virus vaccines are in widespread use in TBE-endemic countries. Nevertheless, vaccination breakthroughs (VBTs) with manifest clinical disease do occur, and their specific serodiagnosis was shown to be facilitated by the detection of antibodies to a non-structural protein (NS1) that is produced during virus replication. However, recent data have shown that NS1 is also present in the current inactivated vaccines, with the potential of inducing corresponding antibodies and obscuring a proper interpretation of NS1-antibody assays for diagnosing VBTs. In our study, we quantified anti-virion and anti-NS1 antibody responses after vaccination as well as after natural infection in TBE patients, both without and with a history of previous TBE vaccination (VBTs). We did not find significant levels of NS1-specific antibodies in serum samples from 48 vaccinees with a completed vaccination schedule. In contrast, all TBE patients mounted an anti-NS1 antibody response, irrespective of whether they were vaccinated or not. Neither the dynamics nor the extent of NS1-antibody formation differed significantly between the two cohorts, arguing against substantial NS1-specific priming and an anamnestic NS1-antibody response in VBTs."

The zoo environment offers a great variety of different animal species living in proximity and in contact with small wild animals and vectors (e.g., ticks and mosquitos). In this context, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Usutu virus (USUV), and West Nile virus (WNV) causing vector-borne diseases are emerging pathogens that raise concern. The aim of the study was to detect antibodies to selected flaviviruses in various animal species in the Ljubljana Zoo, Slovenia. In total, 874 sera from 96 animal species were tested for antibodies to TBEV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA); positive samples were confirmed by a virus neutralization test (VNT) using TBEV, WNV, and USUV antigens. Antibodies to TBEV were detected by ELISA in 3.9% (34/874) of zoo animals, with 4% (30/753) in mammals and 5% (4/86) in birds; the sera of reptiles ("

Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, the main vector of several CTBPs, is the most common tick species found on dogs in Thailand. The present study identified CTBPs in dogs and ticks infested dogs. Samples (360 dog blood samples and 85 individual ticks) were collected from stray dogs residing in 37 temples from 24 districts in Bangkok and screened for CTBPs using molecular techniques. The most common CTBP found infecting dogs in this study was Ehrlichia canis (38.3%) followed by Mycoplasma haemocanis (34.2%), Hepatozoon canis (19.7%), Babesia vogeli (18.1%), and Anaplasma platys (13.9%), respectively. Furthermore, A. platys (22.4%) was the most common CTBP in ticks followed by M. haemocanis (18.8%), B. vogeli (9.4%), H. canis (5.9%), and E. canis (2.4%), respectively. The detection of CTBPs from the present study highlights the potential risk of infections that may occur in stray dogs and their ticks residing in Bangkok temples. These findings underline the importance of performing active surveys to understand the complexity of distributions of CTBPs in dogs and their ticks in Thailand."

The current study determined the perception and practices of livestock farmers regarding tick infestation. A total of 112 livestock farms were surveyed in Punjab, Pakistan, among which animals from 42 (37.5%) farms were infested with ticks. Only 28.6% (n = 32) of the dairy farmers were consulting veterinarians for ticks control, while 86.7% (n = 97) of the respondents did not consider biosecurity measures in the control of tick transmission. Most of the respondents, 71.4% (n = 80), did not consider manual tick removal from their animals (i.e., by hand, followed by physically crushing) as a risky practice for spreading zoonotic diseases. Improper disposal of bottles of acaricides in the farm drainage was also observed, putting the environment and aquatic life at risk. These wrong practices may contribute to high disease burdens and economic losses, increasing the possibility of transmission of zoonotic TBDs and pollution of the environment. Therefore, an integrated One Health approach is required for the control of TBDs through environmentally friendly approaches."

We created a questionnaire to evaluate how people perceive the health risk posed by ticks in an area recently invaded by these arthropods, in the western Italian Alps. Moreover, through a collaborative effort with park rangers and physicians, we investigated which tick species bite humans and their infection with pathogens (Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and spotted-fever group Rickettsiae). Apart from two Dermacentor marginatus bites, we identified Ixodes ricinus (n = 124) as the main species responsible for tick bites. The investigated pathogens infected 25.4% of tested I. ricinus. The evaluation of the engorgement rate of biting I. ricinus revealed that they had been likely feeding on humans for 24 h or more, suggesting a high probability of pathogen transmission. Indeed, the questionnaires revealed that people infrequently adopt preventive measures, such as inspecting the body for ticks, although most respondents claimed that ticks are a threat to human health. Having suffered from previous tick bites was positively associated with the adoption of personal protection measures. Given the increasing incidence of tick-borne diseases in the region, the public should be better informed about the possibility of being bitten by infected ticks in order to mitigate the risk."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis is a natural-focal infection damaging central nervous system, caused by the similarly-named virus transmitted by several species of ixodic ticks. Natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) are widely spread in the forest and forest-steppe landscape zones of the temperate climate belt in the vast territory of Eurasia from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. New TBE-endemic territories have been recently identified in Japan, the Netherlands, and in the UK – in 2019. The increasing risk of infection due to the development of tourism and visits to natural foci of TBE became a public health issue of international concern. The aim of the study is to identify modern features of TBE incidence dynamics in the Russian Federation, the state of laboratory diagnostics and prevention and to predict the incidence for 2021. The paper shows that there is a persistent downward trend in TBE-cases in Russia, which is observed through the past few years. The characteristic feature of the epidemic season-2020 was a significant reduction in the incidence of TBE: 989 cases were registered in 33 constituent entities of the Russian Federation (morbidity rate – 0.67 per 100 000 of the population). The sharp decrease of TBE cases in 2020 as compared to 2019 against the background of a decrease in vaccination can be explained, along with natural factors, by the introduction of restrictive measures during the COVID-19 epidemic. The paper also reflects the dynamics of morbidity, seeking the medical services because of tick bites, the infection rate of the carrier, the scope of vaccination, seroprophylaxis, acaricide treatments. The coverage of express-diagnostic tests of ticks for markers of associated pathogens and its availability for the population are presented. It is recognized that the epidemiological situation on TBE in the Russian Federation remains unfavorable. It demands constant attention on the part of healthcare organizations and Federal Service for Surveillance in the Sphere of Consumers Rights Protection and Human Welfare, as well as management decision making aimed at further decrement in TBE incidence through the improvement of prevention measures, specifically in the entities that are characterized by high TBE incidence. The situation requires monitoring of natural foci of infection, enhancement of prophylaxis and treatment of TBE. The paper provides the forecast of TBE incidence for 2021 and values of the 95 % confidence range of the indicator fluctuation, taking into account the presence or absence of trends in its changes in the territory of federal districts and constituent entities of the Russian Federation in 2011–2020."

The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of non-invasive blood sampling with medicinal leeches for arbovirus epidemiological investigations in various animal species from one zoo collection. Medicinal leeches were manually applied on 35 animals of 11 species. Control blood samples were obtained by venipuncture of the jugular vein. Antibodies to tick-borne encephalitic virus (TBEV) were detected by using the immunoenzymatic method or an immunofluorescent assay (IFAT), depending on the animal species. One of the 35 animals (2.9%) was seropositive (Ovis aries), whereas the rest of the samples were seronegative in both methods of sampling (non-invasive by leeches vs. invasive by venipuncture). Blood sampling using medicinal leeches showed promising results. It is likely a good alternative to other more complex and invasive methods, and it can provide significant advancement in blood sampling for preventive medicine and epidemiological studies in zoo animals."

To fill this gap, a high-affinity chimeric anti-TBEV antibody ch14D5 has previously been constructed, and high protective activity in a murine TBEV model has been shown for this antibody. However, the mechanism of action of this antibody and the recognized epitope have not been known yet. In this study, it is shown by X-ray crystallography that this antibody recognizes a unique epitope on the lateral ridge of the D3 domain of glycoprotein E, which is readily accessible for binding. The orientation of this antibody relative to the virion surface makes bivalent binding possible, which facilitates the cross-linking of glycoprotein E molecules and thus blocking of surface rearrangements required for infection. Since the antibody tightly binds to this protein even at pH ∼ 5.0, it locks the virion in an acidic environment inside the late endosomes or phagosomes and, therefore, effectively blocks the fusion of the viral and endosomal/phagosomal membranes. We believe that this is why the ch14D5 antibody does not induce an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Spirochetes of the family Borreliaceae are, with one exception, tick-borne pathogens of a variety of vertebrates. The family at present comprises two genera: Borrelia (Swellengrebel), which includes the agents of relapsing fever, avian spirochetosis, and bovine borreliosis, and Borreliella (Gupta et al.), which includes the agents of Lyme disease and was formerly known as ‘Borrelia burgdorferi sensulato complex’. The two genera are distinguished not only by their disease associations but also biological features in the tick vector, including tissue location in unfed ticks and transovarial transmission. Borrelia species transmitted by argasid (soft) ticks tend to have more exclusive relationships with their tick vectors than do other Borrelia species and all Borreliella species that have ixodid (hard) ticks as vectors. The division of genera is supported by phylogenomic evidence from whole genomes and by several specific molecular markers. These distinguishing phylogenetic criteria also applied to three new species or isolates of Borrelia that were discovered in ixodid ticks of reptiles, a monotreme, and birds. Although the deep branching of the family from other spirochetes has been a challenge for inferences about evolution of the family, the discovery of related microorganisms in the gut microbiota of other arachnids suggests an ancestral origin for the family as symbionts of ticks and other arachnids."

Here, we characterize and map the spatio-temporal variability of environments suitable for I. scapularis using Earth observation (EO) data. A simple algorithm for I. scapularis occurrence (cumulative degree-days and forest: CSDF) was developed by combining cumulative annual surface degree-days above 0 °C and forest cover. To map the environmental risk of I. scapularis (risk of I. scapularis: RIS) in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015, CSDF was adjusted using data from an I. scapularis population model. CSDF was validated using cumulative annual degree days >0 °C (CADD) from meteorological stations, and CSDF was strongly associated with CADD (n = 52, R2 > 0.86, p < 0.001). Data on field surveillance for I. scapularis ticks (2008 to 2018) were used to validate the risk maps. The presence of I. scapularis ticks was significantly associated with CSDF, and at a limit of 2800, sensitivity approached 100%. RIS increased over the study period, with the highest values in 2012 and the lowest in 2000. The RIS was on average higher in Ontario and Quebec compared to other provinces, and it was higher in the southern parts of the provinces. The proportion of the populated areas with a positive RIS increased on average in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015. Predicted I. scapularis occurrence identifies areas with a more probable risk of tick bites, Lyme disease, and other I. scapularis-borne diseases, which can help guide targeted surveillance, prevention, and control interventions."

One of the causes of SSNHL could be the progressive inflammatory state caused by an infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of SSNHL caused by various factors, most importantly those potentially related to Lyme disease. Material and Methods: The study includes a group of 86 patients between the ages of 20 and 70 who were hospitalized due to SSNHL between 2017 and 2018. All of these patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological examination, including audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Results: In this group of 86 patients, nine patients presented with positive antibodies toward Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. This group was treated with antibiotics and experienced partial or complete regression of their deafness. This may suggest a relationship between SSNHL and Lyme disease. Conclusion: Infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi may contribute to the development of inflammatory and angiopathic lesions, which are a possible cause of SSNHL. The longer the duration of the infection, the greater the likelihood of permanent and irreversible changes in the vessels of the cochlea or auditory nerve. Therefore, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi should be performed during the diagnosis of SSNHL as a possible cause of this illness."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

		"abstract": "Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of vertigo symptoms and potential labyrinth damage in patients with diagnosed Lyme disease (LD). LD can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve, leading to hearing loss and vertigo/dizziness. Material and Methods: The study included a group of 38 patients between the ages of 20 and 77, who were hospitalized due to vertigo/dizziness between 2018 and 2019. All of the patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological and neurological examination, including video electronystagmography (VENG), in addition to audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of LD. Results: In 20 patients (53%), the Romberg trial was positive (p < 0.001). The degree of vestibular dysfunction as shown by the VENG test was associated with the rate of hearing loss as confirmed by the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test (p = 0.011), and it mainly concerned high-frequency sounds (p = 0.014). Conclusion: Vertigo can be a symptom of LD. It is often associated with labyrinth and hearing-organ damage, which can imply that the inner ear or nerve VIII is dysfunctional in the course of this disease. Antibiotic therapy is effective in reducing otoneurological symptoms."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, which is primarily caused by infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States or other Borrelia species internationally, presents an ongoing challenge for diagnostics. Serological testing is the primary means of diagnosis but testing approaches differ widely, with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, there is currently no reliable test to determine disease resolution following treatment. A distinct challenge in Lyme disease diagnostics is the variable patterns of human immune response to a plurality of antigens presented by Borrelia spp. during the infection. Thus, multiplexed testing approaches that capture these patterns and detect serological response against multiple antigens may be the key to prompt, accurate Lyme disease diagnosis. In this review, current state-of-the-art multiplexed diagnostic approaches are presented and compared with respect to their diagnostic accuracy and their potential for monitoring response to treatment."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease is the most frequent tick-borne infectious disease in Europe. It often presents with a wide variety of symptoms. For this reason, affection of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) caused by Lyme disease (LD) can be misdiagnosed as a common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The purpose of this case report of a 25-year old woman presenting to the Departments of Orthodontics and Maxillofacial Surgery with extensive symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder is to illustrate the delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease, which was only made after extensive therapy of the temporomandibular joint. The specialist literature only reports a few cases of patients suffering from Lyme disease with TMJ manifestations. This case report and the relevant literature review aim to emphasize the importance of accurate request of medical history and differential diagnosis of acute TMJ arthritis and arthralgia. Early interdisciplinary diagnosis of Lyme disease and early antibiotic therapy are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary, sometimes invasive, therapies."

The causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, is capable of establishing a persistent infection within the host. This is despite the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. B. burgdorferi utilizes several immune evasion tactics ranging from the regulation of surface proteins, tick saliva, antimicrobial peptide resistance, and the disabling of the germinal center. This review aims to cover the various methods by which B. burgdorferi evades detection and destruction by the host immune response, examining both the innate and adaptive responses. By understanding the methods employed by B. burgdorferi to evade the host immune response, we gain a deeper knowledge of B. burgdorferi pathogenesis and Lyme disease, and gain insight into how to create novel, effective treatments."

Main outcome measures: Time from Lyme disease diagnosis to consultation for any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis and for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Results: Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 py between 2000 and 2018, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018. In total 929 events of any types of fatigue were observed, i.e. an incidence rate of 307.90 per 10,000 py in the Lyme cohort (282 events) and 165.60 in the comparator cohort (647 events). Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season with highest adjusted HRs in autumn [3.14 (95%CI: 1.92 to 5.13)] and winter [2.23 (1.21 to 4.11)]. Incidence rates of ME/CFS were 11.16 per 10,000 py in Lyme patients (12 events) and 1.20 in comparators (5 events), corresponding to an adjusted HR of 16.95 (5.17 to 55.60). Effect on any types of fatigue and ME/CFS was attenuated 6 months after diagnosis but still clearly visible. Conclusions: UK primary care records provided strong evidence that Lyme disease was associated with acute and chronic fatigue. Albeit weaker, these effects persisted beyond 6 months, suggesting that patients and healthcare providers should remain alert to fatigue symptoms months to years following Lyme disease diagnosis.

		"abstract": "Transmission of the causative agents of numerous infectious diseases might be potentially conducted by various routes if this is supported by the genetics of the pathogen. Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host–pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans’ habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is characterized by a bimodal age distribution and male predominance. We examined trends in reported cases during a 25-year period to describe changes in the populations most affected by Lyme disease in the United States. We examined demographic characteristics of people with confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 1992-2016 through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. We grouped cases into 5-year periods (1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016). We calculated the average annual incidence by age and sex and used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to describe changes in Lyme disease incidence by age and sex over time. We converted patient age at time of illness into patient birth year to ascertain disease patterns according to birth cohorts. The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States doubled from 1992-1996 to 2012-2016 (IRR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.70-1.78) and increased disproportionately among males; IRRs were 39%-89% higher among males than among females for most age groups. During the study period, children aged 5-9 years were most frequently and consistently affected. In contrast, the average age of adults with Lyme disease increased over time; of all adults, people born during 1950-1964 were the most affected by Lyme disease. Our findings suggest that age-related behaviors and susceptibilities may drive infections among children, and the shifting peak among adults likely reflects a probability proportional to the relative size of the baby boom population. These findings can inform targeted and efficient public health education and intervention efforts."

We collected data from an experimental group of 252 Lyme disease patients and a control group of 267 healthy individuals. The quality of life and sleep, attention and memory performance were assessed in both groups. Additionally, we investigated depressive symptoms in patients with Lyme disease to examine whether the duration of the disease had an influence on the severity of symptoms shown. Furthermore, various data on the diagnostics and treatment carried out in the patient group were recorded. On average, patients visited almost eight physicians to obtain a diagnosis, and eight years passed between the tick bite and diagnosis (SD ± 7.8); less than half of the sample (46%) received their diagnosis within the first five years after the development of symptoms. It became clear that Lyme disease is often diagnosed very late. It appears that people suffering from Lyme disease have significantly lower quality of life and sleep and show cognitive impairments when it comes to attention and memory. This study shows that 3.1% of Lyme patients were satisfied with their lives and that 37% scored in the lower third of the quality-of-life scale. It was also shown that Lyme patients tend to have depressive symptoms."

The literature describes a small number of cases of Lyme carditis with arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. Material and methods We reviewed the case of a 14-year-old girl. LC was diagnosed on the basis of history of disease, physical examination, laboratory examination data (positive anti-borrelia IgM in ELISA with confirmation in immunoblot. The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). 2 instrumental methods: (ECG,Echo-cor) were used. Results We described a case of Lyme borreliosis in a 14-year-old girl, accompanied by sinus bradyarrhythmia and pericardial fluid -(hydropericardium) (passed after a course of antibacterial therapy). Analysis of this case indicates early detection and adequate treatment of Lyme carditis in young people with minimal deviations of the cardiogram. A case of Lyme carditis , in a child was confirmed.Echocardiography of the heart (at the time of admission to the hospital andat the time of discharge from the hospital was made. Conclusions 1. Lyme carditis should be suspected in patients with a history of Lyme disease and minimal Electrocardiographic abnormalities , such as sinus bradycardia. 2. For differential diagnosis of Lyme carditis, it is necessary to make ( carry out two-stage serological investigation of blood, especially using antibody screening tests by ELISA with subsequent confirmation by the Western blot assay."

Three etiological agents of human Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia bavariensis, and Borrelia garinii) predominantly utilize two distinct tick species as vectors in Asia (Ixodes persulcatus) and Europe (Ixodes ricinus) but how and in which order they colonized each continent remains unknown. Here, by reconstructing the evolutionary history of 142 Eurasian isolates, we show that all three Borrelia genospecies evolved from an Asian origin, suggesting that successful expansion into Europe resulted through invading a novel vector. The pattern of gene flow between continents is different between genospecies and most likely conditioned by reservoir host association and their dispersal. Our results highlight that Eurasian Lyme borreliosis agents are all capable of geographic expansion through vector shifts, but potentially differ in their capacity as emergent pathogens."

		"abstract": "Abstract: There is considerable evidence that some Borrelial (Lyme spirochetal) proteins share significant antigenic properties with several thyroid-related proteins (e.g. TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase) and can induce thyroid autoimmunity, sometimes associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and perhaps also a “destructive thyroiditis” such as “silent” thyroiditis or “Hashitoxicosis.” As an acute illness, Lyme disease may also constitute a “non-thyroidal illness” capable of perturbing thyroid function tests without causing thyroid dysfunction. We report a 22-year old woman admitted with an acute paranoid schizophrenia, thyroid function tests consistent with autoimmunity, transient thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, lid-lag, brisk DTR’s) and a greatly reduced radioiodine uptake. The thyroid was not palpably enlarged, nodular or tender. On screening assay, reactivity was demonstrated to 4 of 13 Borrelial proteins. Anti-Lyme IgM but not IgG, antibodies, were positive. This was consistent with recent Lyme disease infection. Serum TSH (NL: 0.358-3.74 mcU/ml), Free T4 (NL: 0.76-1.46 ng/dl), and Free T3 (NL: 2.18-3.98 pg/ml) were, respectively: Day1: 0.087 mcU/ml (suppressed), 1.52 ng/dl (slightly elevated), 2.07 pg/ml (slightly reduced); Day2: 0.148 (suppressed), 1.18 (normal), no FT3; Day4: 0.827 (normal), no FT4 or FT3; Day5: 1.66 (normal), 0.89 (normal), 1.77 (low). Anti-Tg and Anti-Peroxidase antibodies were both moderately elevated. Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins were not elevated. The radioactive iodine uptake on Day4 was 2.8% (NL: 15-30% at 24 hr). Thyroid ultrasonogram was normal. An attractive explanation is that Lyme disease triggered a “destructive thyroiditis,” perhaps but not necessarily mediated by thyroid autoimmunity. This would account for the brief interval of thyrotoxicosis accompanied by a very low radioiodine uptake. Alternatively, Lyme disease, as an acute process, would expectedly be capable of eliciting the thyroid function abnormalities of “non-thyroidal illnesses” in general, as would acute psychosis, well-known to often resemble Graves’ disease at admission."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a growing public health problem in Qu&eacute;bec. Its emergence over the last decade is caused by environmental and anthropological factors that favour the survival of Ixodes scapularis, the vector of Lyme disease transmission. The objective of this study was to estimate the speed and direction of Lyme disease emergence in Qu&eacute;bec and to identify spatiotemporal risk patterns. A surface trend analysis was conducted to estimate the speed and direction of its emergence based upon the first detected case of Lyme disease in each municipality in Qu&eacute;bec since 2004. A cluster analysis was also conducted to identify at-risk regions across space and time. These analyses were reproduced for the date of disease onset and date of notification for each case of Lyme disease. It was estimated that Lyme disease is spreading northward in Qu&eacute;bec at a speed varying between 18 and 32 km/year according to the date of notification and the date of disease onset, respectively. A high rate of disease risk was found in seven clusters identified in the south-west of Qu&eacute;bec in the sociosanitary regions of Mont&eacute;r&eacute;gie and Estrie. The results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of Lyme disease in Qu&eacute;bec, which can be used for proactive, targeted interventions by public and clinical health authorities."

Methods: the objects of the study were patients with tick-borne encephalitis in whom the frequencies of micronucleated lymphocytes were detected. All examined patients were subdivided into two groups: TBE patients non-infected with OF, and TBE patients infected with OF. Multiplex PCR was used to analyze the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes. Results: patients with TBE, infected with OF, had a significantly lower increase in the level of cytogenetic disorders than patients with TBE without OF infection; at the same time, the restoration of the cytogenetic norm in this group was not reached, and there was no association between the frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes and different variants of the glutathione-S-transferase enzyme genes. Conclusion: the frequency of cytogenetic changes in TBE patients infected with OF are significantly less than one in patients with TBE without OF infection. Polymorphism in the genes of the enzyme glutathione-S-transferase does not have significant effect on the cytogenetic disorders in patients with TBE with OF infection."

Here, we present clinical and laboratory characteristics of a large international cohort of patients with confirmed TBE using a uniform clinical protocol. Patients were recruited in eight centers from six European countries between 2010 and 2017. A detailed description of clinical signs and symptoms was recorded. The obtained information enabled a reliable classification in 553 of 555 patients: 207 (37.3%) had meningitis, 273 (49.2%) meningoencephalitis, 15 (2.7%) meningomyelitis, and 58 (10.5%) meningoencephalomyelitis; 41 (7.4%) patients had a peripheral paresis of extremities, 13 (2.3%) a central paresis of extremities, and 25 (4.5%) had single or multiple cranial nerve palsies. Five (0.9%) patients died during acute illness. Outcome at discharge was recorded in 298 patients. Of 176 (59.1%) patients with incomplete recovery, 80 (27%) displayed persisting symptoms or signs without recovery expectation. This study provides further evidence that TBE is a severe disease with a large proportion of patients with incomplete recovery. We suggest monitoring TBE in endemic European countries using a uniform protocol to record the full clinical spectrum of the disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick–vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick–host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US."

The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Lyme disease infection among forestry workers in National Park Offices in South Korea. We enrolled National Park Office forestry workers (NPOFWs) who had worked for ≥1 year. Participants completed questionnaires that addressed various subjects including work types and work hygiene-related factors. Collected serum samples were tested using immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Borrelia antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors of seroprevalence. Of 1,410 NPOFWs, 655 (46.5%) participated in this study, and an overall seroprevalence of Lyme disease antibodies was 8.1%. Analysis showed that always eating meals in woodland (odds ratio (OR), 5.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08–12.52) and raising dogs outside homes (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57–6.75) were significantly associated with Lyme disease infection. This seroprevalence study indicates that Lyme disease is an important disease among NPOFWs in South Korea. These identified modifiable risk factors should be considered while designing preventive strategies for reducing Lyme disease infection among NPOFWs."

We sought to examine whether plasma GDF-15 was related to incident CKD and kidney function decline using a large prospective cohort study. Methods 4,318 participants of the Malmö Diet and Cancer Study-Cardiovascular Cohort were examined in 1991–1994 and followed prospectively until 2013 for incidence of CKD, as detected from national registers. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was available for all participants at baseline, and was re-measured in a subgroup of 2,744 subjects after 16.6 ± 1.49 years. Incidence of CKD was examined in relation to GDF-15 using Cox regression analysis. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of GDF-15 with eGFR change and eGFR-based CKD. Models were carefully corrected for potential confounders including baseline eGFR, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, and competing risk from death. Results 165 patients developed CKD after 19.2 ± 4.04 years of follow-up. The adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) for CKD in 4th versus 1st quartile of GDF-15 was 2.37 (1.33, 4.24) ("

Fusarium graminearum is an important pathogen causing Fusarium head blight worldwide and has also been reported to cause crown rot of wheat. The comparative ability of F. pseudograminearum, F. culmorum, F. graminearum and B. sorokiniana to cause crown rot and common root rot across a range of winter cereal species requires investigation. In glasshouse trials, we inoculated one cultivar each of barley, bread wheat, durum wheat, oat and triticale with two strains of each of the four pathogens. At 21 days after inoculation, the sub-crown internode and leaf sheaths of each plant were visually rated for brown discoloration. Shoot length and dry weight of inoculated plants were compared with those of non-inoculated controls. Barley and bread wheat had the highest disease severity ratings on leaf sheaths and sub-crown internode (64.7–99.6%), whereas oat had the lowest disease severity ratings across all pathogens (&lt;5%). The shoot length of all cultivars was significantly reduced (by 12.2–55%, P &lt; 0.05) when exposed to F. pseudograminearum. This study provides a comparison of pathogenicity of crown rot and common root rot pathogens and demonstrates significant variation in visual discoloration and host response across a range of winter cereals."

The risks and consequences triggered by vector-borne diseases (VBD) for public health in Macedonia are just starting to emerge in public awareness. This is clearly shown by recent events such as spread of hemorrhagic fevers in Europe. The term “public health” in the scope of this chapter suggests re-conceptualization of public health by adapting the risk governance framework developed by the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) for this purpose. The IRGC approach is distinguished from more classical risk governance approaches, inter alia, by an explicit inclusion of a systematic concern assessment. However, unfortunately, not all countries are adapted on this innovative public health model. This chapter shows results of a risk management study based on interview in depth with the officials regard public health risk, in frame of one health concept in the Republic of Macedonia."

It was found that more than 80% of TBI cases were registered in the southern districts of the Tomsk region (TR). From 61.7% to 97.7% of TBI infections occurred in the territories where the infected persons lived, in the spring-summer period when visiting forest biotopes, garden plots and summer cottages, in the adjoining territories. Every year, pathogens of natural focal diseases, often mixed forms of various pathogens, are recorded in ticks collected from vegetation. The need to develop tactics for preventive measures in the territory of TR in relation to TBI is discussed.

An ELISA measuring anti- Conclusions/Significance: This study validated for the first time human immunoassays that quantify humoral immune responses as potential markers of exposure to blackfly bites. These assays have the potential to facilitate understanding patterns of exposure as well as evaluating the impact of vector control on biting rates. Future studies need to investigate seasonal fluctuations of these antibody responses, potential cross-reactions with other bloodsucking arthropods, and thoroughly identify the most immunogenic proteins."

		"abstract": "Although anti-TBE vaccines are highly effective, vaccine breakthrough (VBT) cases have been reported. With increasing evidence for immune system involvement in TBE pathogenesis, we characterized the immune mediators reflecting innate and adaptive T and B cell responses in neurological and convalescent phase in VBT TBE patients. At the beginning of the neurological phase, VBT patients have significantly higher serum levels of several innate and adaptive inflammatory cytokines compared to healthy donors, reflecting a global inflammatory state. The majority of cytokines, particularly those associated with innate and Th1 responses, are highly concentrated in CSF and positively correlate with intrathecal immune cell counts, demonstrating the localization of Th1 and proinflammatory responses in CNS, the site of disease in TBE. Interestingly, compared to unvaccinated TBE patients, VBT TBE patients have significantly higher CSF levels of VEGF-A and IFN-β and higher systemic levels of neutrophil chemoattractants IL-8/CXCL8 and GROα/CXCL1 on admission. Moreover, serum levels of IL-8/CXCL8 and GROα/CXCL1 remain elevated for two months after the onset of neurological symptoms, indicating a prolonged systemic immune activation in VBT patients. These findings provide the first insights into the type of immune responses and their dynamics during TBE in VBT patients. An observed systemic upregulation of neutrophil derived inflammation in acute and convalescent phase of TBE together with highly expressed VEGF-A could contribute to BBB disruption that facilitates the entry of immune cells and supports the intrathecal localization of Th1 responses observed in VBT patients."

In this study, we aimed to detect tick-borne pathogens through investigating prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms in camel blood based on a metagenomic approach and then to characterize potentially pathogenic organisms using traditional molecular techniques. We showed that the bacteria circulating in the blood of camels is dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. At the genus level, Sediminibacterium, Hydrotalea, Bradyrhizobium and Anaplasma were the most abundant taxa. Eukaryotic profile was dominated by Fungi, Charophyta and Apicomplexa. At the genus level, Theileria was detected in 10 out of 18 samples, while Sarcocystis, Hoplorhynchus and Stylocephalus were detected in one sample each. Our metagenomic approach was successful in the detection of several pathogens or potential pathogens including Anaplasma sp., Theileria ovis, Th. separata, Th. annulate, Th. mutans-like and uncharacterized Theileria sp. For further characterization, we provided the partial sequences of citrate synthase (gltA) and heat-shock protein (groEL) genes of Candidatus Anaplasma camelii. We also detected Trypanosoma evansi type A using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region. This combined metagenomic and traditional approach will contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of pathogens including tick-borne bacteria and protozoa in animals."

Information regarding tick infestations and pathogens transmitted by ticks is important for the identification and prevention of disease. This study was a large-scale investigation of ticks collected from dogs and their associated environments in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It included detecting six prevalent tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma spp., A. platys, Borrelia spp., Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis, and E. chaffeensis). A total of 2293 ticks (1110 pools) were collected. Haemaphysalis longicornis (98.60%) was the most frequently collected tick species, followed by Ixodes nipponensis (0.96%) and H. flava (0.44%). Anaplasma spp. (24/1110 tick pools; 2.16%) and Borrelia spp. (4/1110 tick pools; 0.36%) were detected. The phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA genes revealed that the Anaplasma spp. detected in this study were closely associated with A. phagocytophilum reported in humans and rodents in the ROK. Borrelia spp. showed phylogenetic relationships with B. theileri and B. miyamotoi in ticks and humans in Mali and Russia. These results demonstrate the importance of tick-borne disease surveillance and control in dogs in the ROK."

Here, we developed a panel of neutralizing anti-POWV mAbs recognizing six distinct antigenic sites. The most potent of these mAbs bind sites within domain II or III of the envelope (E) protein and inhibit postattachment viral entry steps. A subset of these mAbs cross-react with other flaviviruses. Both POWV type–specific and cross-reactive neutralizing mAbs confer protection in mice against POWV infection when given as prophylaxis or postexposure therapy. Several cross-reactive mAbs mapping to either domain II or III also protect in vivo against heterologous tick-transmitted flaviviruses including Langat and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Our experiments define structural and functional correlates of antibody protection against POWV infection and identify epitopes targeted by broadly neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential against multiple tick-borne flaviviruses."

Materials and Methods:: Thirty-four patients with a transverse maxillary deficiency were divided into two groups; the first group (16 patients, average age 14.9 years) was treated with the MSE appliance, and the second group (18 patients, average age 13.8 years) was treated with the BAME appliance. Cone-beam computed tomography scans were taken at pre-treatment (T1) and immediately post-expansion (T2) to measure the changes in midpalatal suture opening, total expansion (TE), alveolar bone bending, dental tipping (DT), and buccal bone thickness. Data were analyzed using paired Results:: Midpalatal suture separation was found in 100% of the patients in both groups. The TE at the first molar was 5.9 mm in the MSE group and 4.7 mm in the BAME group. The skeletal contributions were 56% and 83% of TE for the MSE and BAME groups, respectively. Significantly less dental buccal tipping and buccal bone loss were found with the BAME group. The midpalatal suture in both groups exhibited a parallel opening pattern in the axial plane. Conclusion:: The use of BAME appliance resulted in greater skeletal effects, less dental tipping, and less buccal bone reduction compared to MSE appliance (immediately after maxillary expansion)."

		"abstract": "Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) is both seed-borne and aphid transmitted and can cause economic losses in pea (Pisum sativum L.) production by reducing yield through decreased seed weight and number. The P1 pathotype is especially virulent, affecting this important vegetable crop across the United States and internationally in regions of West Asia, North Africa, Europe, and Australia. Previously, two Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) genotyping markers (eIF4E resistant 1 and 2) were developed and validated on P. sativum accessions identifying two PSbMV pathotype P1 resistance alleles in the eukaryotic translation initiation factor gene, eIF4E. The current study utilized these novel markers to rapidly evaluate 318 genetic resource accessions maintained as part of the USDA National Plant Germplasm System’s Pea Single Plant Collection (PSPC). The evaluations also included 58 commercial and other plant introduction (PI) lines that were assessed for the two eIF4E resistance alleles. All genotyping results were validated in greenhouse assays by confirmation of observable disease symptoms following inoculations and by ELISA. The eIF4E resistant 1 and 2 alleles were found in 18 accessions from the PSPC, 5 commercial lines, and 14 other PI accessions. A single PSPC accession showed resistance to PSbMV pathotype P1 that is believed to be a novel source of resistance based on sequencing analysis of eIF4E. Sources of resistance were identified in the PSPC and in commercial cultivars that can be introgressed into breeding lines using traditional techniques to reduce time and cost required to generate germplasm with superior disease-resistant traits."

		"abstract": "Soil-borne Rhizoctonia, Microdochium and Fusarium species are major causal agents of seedling and stem-base diseases in wheat and currently seed treatments are considered the most effective solution for their control. Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis groups (AGs) 2-1 and 5, R. cerealis, Microdochium and Fusarium spp. were used in series of field experiments to determine their capability to cause soil-borne and stem-base disease and to quantify their comparative losses in establishment and yield of wheat. The effectiveness and the response to seed treatment formulated of 10 g sedaxane and 5 g fludioxonil 100 kg-1 against these soil-borne pathogens were also determined. Our results showed that damping off caused by soil-borne R. cerealis was associated with significant reductions in emergence and establishment resulting in stunted growth and low plant numbers. The pathogen also caused sharp eyespot associated with reductions in ear partitioning index. R. solani AG 2-1 or AG 5 were weakly pathogenic and failed to cause significant damping off, root rot or stem-base disease in wheat. Fusarium graminearum and F. culmorum applied as soil-borne inoculum failed to cause severe disease. Microdochium spp. caused brown foot rot disease and soil-borne M. nivale reduced wheat emergence. Application of sedaxane and fludioxonil increased plant emergence and reduced damping off, early stem-base disease and brown foot rot thus providing protection against multiple soil-borne pathogens. R. cerealis reduced thousand grain weight by 3.6% whilst seed treatment of fludioxonil and sedaxane against soil-borne R. cerealis or M. nivale resulted in 4% yield increase."

Materials and Methods: This study included 40 subjects with transverse maxillary deficiency who received TB RME or BB RME. Cone-beam computed tomography images (CBCT) were taken before treatment (T0), and after a 6-month retention period (T1). Three-dimensional surface models of the spheno-occipital synchondrosis and basilar part of the occipital bone were generated. The CBCTs taken at T0 and T1 were registered at the anterior cranial fossa via voxel-based superimposition. Quantitative evaluation of Basion displacement was performed with linear measurements and Euclidean distances. The volume of the synchndrosis was also calculated for each time point as well as the Nasion-Sella-Basion angle (N-S-Ba°). All data were statistically analyzed to perform inter-timing and intergroup comparisons. Results: In both groups, there was a small increment of the volume of the synchondrosis and of N-S-Ba° (P &lt; .05). Basion showed a posterosuperior pattern of displacement. However, no significant differences (P &gt; .05) were found between the two groups. Conclusions: Although TB and BB RME seemed to have some effects on the spheno-occipital synchondrosis, differences were very small and clinically negligible."

Traditional data-driven forecasting tools have limited use in circumstances featuring low-probability crises for which trend data is unreliable and non-predictive. Commercial and security sectors have been quick to adopt various forms of wargames to address this gap and provide intelligent insights on possible outcomes in the short, mid and long term future. The lack of commitment and action against vector-borne diseases by governments and local authorities requires a new approach that presents risk in terms of potential actions, possible outcomes and resulting consequences."

Its main hosts are cowpea and passionfruit, and along with East Asian Passiflora virus and passionfruit woodiness virus it induces passionfruit woodiness in passionfruit. CABMV occurs worldwide but is a particularly major and widespread disease of cowpea in Africa. The nature and severity of the symptoms induced by CABMV are extremely variable, and vary with host cultivars, virus strain and the time of infection. Symptoms can include various mosaics, mottling, interveinal chlorosis and vein-banding. Complete loss of cowpea crops has been reported from Nigeria, and CABMV is one of the main limiting factors to passionfruit yield in South America and Africa.</p>"

Meat is the normal source of this vitamin, as well as other types of vitamins. Meat affords a range of significant vitamins and minerals that the human body needs, many of which are more bioavailable and easily absorbed than the nutrients found in plant sources. The nutrients in meat support the immune system, participate in the formation of muscle tissue, red blood cells (RBCs), and hormones, and warranty accurate functioning of the nervous system. These nutrients also affect the human senses of smell and taste, benefit our thyroids, and support antioxidant production. The main sources of pathogens in meat and meat products are; the animal itself; human handlers; equipment’s in contact, environmental sources, and water used in the preparation. Meat Borne Diseases, since ancient times, played a central role in public health. This chapter is divided into nine parts, part one to part eight deals with the most important pathogens that have been associated with meat borne diseases (MBDs), these include, Meat Borne Prionic Diseases; Viral Diseases; Bacterial Diseases; Protozoal Diseases; Parasitic Diseases; Fungal Diseases; Mycotoxins; Rickettsial Diseases; while the nine-part deal with the methods of meat preservation and storage."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms and loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. Inflammation and cell death are recognized aspects of PD suggesting that strategies to monitor and modify these processes may improve the management of the disease. Inflammasomes are pro-inflammatory intracellular pattern recognition complexes that couple these processes. The NLRP3 inflammasome responds to sterile triggers to initiate pro-inflammatory processes characterized by maturation of inflammatory cytokines, cytoplasmic membrane pore formation, vesicular shedding, and if unresolved, pyroptotic cell death. Histologic analysis of tissues from PD patients and individuals with nigral cell loss but no diagnosis of PD identified elevated expression of inflammasome-related proteins and activation-related “speck” formation in degenerating mesencephalic tissues compared with controls. Based on previous reports of circulating inflammasome proteins in patients suffering from heritable syndromes caused by hyper-activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, we evaluated PD patient plasma for evidence of inflammasome activity. Multiple circulating inflammasome proteins were detected almost exclusively in extracellular vesicles indicative of ongoing inflammasome activation and pyroptosis. Analysis of plasma obtained from a multi-center cohort identified elevated plasma-borne NLRP3 associated with PD status. Our findings are consistent with others indicating inflammasome activity in neurodegenerative disorders. Findings suggest mesencephalic inflammasome protein expression as a histopathologic marker of early-stage nigral degeneration and suggest plasma-borne inflammasome-related proteins as a potentially useful class of biomarkers for patient stratification and the detection and monitoring of inflammation in PD."

		"abstract": "Objectives: To identify underlying subgroups with distinct symptom profiles, and to characterise and compare these subgroups across a range of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors, within a heterogeneous group of patients with well-defined post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). Design: A clinical case series of patents. Setting: Participants were recruited from a single-site, Lyme disease referral clinic patient population and were evaluated by physical exam, clinical laboratory testing and standardised questionnaires. Participants: Two hundred and twelve participants met study criteria for PTLD, with medical record-confirmed prior Lyme disease as well as current symptoms and functional impact. Results: Exploratory factor analysis classified 30 self-reported symptoms into 6 factors: ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Ocular Disequilibrium’, ‘Infection-Type’, ‘Mood-Related’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Neurologic’. A final latent profile analysis was conducted using ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Mood-Related’ factor-based scores, which produced three emergent symptom profiles, and participants were classified into corresponding subgroups with 59.0%, 18.9% and 22.2% of the sample, respectively. Compared with the other two groups, subgroup 1 had similarly low levels across all factors relative to the sample as a whole, and reported lower rates of disability (1.6% vs 10.0%, 12.8%; q=0.126, 0.035) and higher self-efficacy (median: 7.5 vs 6.0, 5.3; q=0.068,<0.001). Subgroup 2 had the highest ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ factor-based scores (q≤0.001). Subgroup 3 was characterised overall by higher symptom factor-based scores, and reported higher depression (q≤0.001). Conclusions: This analysis identified six symptom factors and three potentially clinically relevant subgroups among patients with well-characterised PTLD. We found that these subgroups were differentiated not only by symptom phenotype, but also by a range of other factors. This may serve as an initial step towards engaging with the symptom heterogeneity that has long been observed among patients with this condition."

Although Bb is also found in the blood of LD patients, far less is known about how neutrophils respond to Bb in the presence of blood. In this study, we employed microfluidic tools to probe the interaction between human neutrophils and Bb and measured the activation of human neutrophils in blood samples from patients. We found that neutrophils migrate vigorously toward Bb in the presence of serum, and this process was complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage or blocking complement receptors decreased neutrophil’s ability to interact with Bb. We also found that spiking Bb directly into the blood from healthy donors induced spontaneous neutrophil motility. This response to Bb was also complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage decreased spontaneous neutrophil motility in Bb-spiked blood. Moreover, we found that neutrophils in blood samples from acute LD patients displayed spontaneous motility patterns similar to those observed in Bb-spiked samples. Neutrophil motility was more robust in blood samples from LD patients than that measured in healthy and ill controls, validating the utility of the microfluidic assay for the study of neutrophil-Bb interactions in the presence of blood."

Transmitted through ticks and carried mainly by mammals and birds, the Lyme disease (LD) bacterium is a well-suited model to study such tropism. LD bacteria species vary in host ranges through mechanisms eluding characterization. By feeding ticks infected with different LD bacteria species, utilizing feeding chambers and live mice and quail, we found species-level differences of bacterial transmission. These differences localize on the tick blood meal, and complement, a defense in vertebrate blood, and a bacterial polymorphic protein, CspA, which inactivates complement by binding to a host complement inhibitor, FH. CspA selectively confers bacterial transmission to vertebrates that produce FH capable of allele-specific recognition. Phylogenetic analyses revealed convergent evolution as the driver of such findings, which likely emerged during the last glacial maximum. Our results identify LD bacterial determinants of host tropism, defining an evolutionary mechanism that shapes host-microparasite associations."

		"abstract": "Introduction/Objective: Expectancies about symptom improvement or deterioration are reliable predictors of symptom progression and treatment outcomes (symptom resolution or symptomatic improvement) in many (non-)pharmacological studies and treatments. This study examined predictors of symptom improvement after antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, hypothesizing particularly pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement to be predictive. Methods: A predictive study was performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment individual characteristics, including expectancies, and physical and mental health–related quality of life (HRQoL) from the PLEASE-trial comparing randomized 12-weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. At end-of-treatment (14 weeks after trial start) and follow-up (52 weeks), complete data of 231 and 170 (of initial 280) patients with persistent symptoms temporally related to a history of erythema migrans or otherwise confirmed symptomatic Lyme disease, or accompanied by Results: In addition to pre-treatment HRQoL, pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement were consistently associated with stronger physical and mental HRQoL improvements at both end-of-treatment and follow-up (95% CI range: .09;.54, Conclusions: The present study shows that, next to pre-treatment functioning, patients’ pre-treatment and post-treatment expectancies regarding improvement of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease relate to a more beneficial symptom course. Expectancies of patients may be relevant to explain and potentially improve patient outcomes (e.g., by optimized communication about treatment success).

		"abstract": "States that claim responsibility for citizens’ healthcare try to deal with knowledge uncertainties while preserving a duty of care. Production of clinical guidelines in disputed medical conditions or where uncertainty is high, is difficult. Patient groups may advocate non-credentialed evidence, contribute to debates and form alliances with established policy actors. In this context, Lyme disease, especially highly contested ‘chronic’ Lyme disease is a good case with which to examine how official governance institutions are managing diagnostic uncertainty and evidence for tests. The healthcare state has been provoked to develop extensive policy for Lyme disease. In the UK, national Health Technology Assessment agency, NICE, began a consultation process in 2016. NICE and other policy actors are moving towards more participatory modes of decision-making. The article analyses NICE’s recently published guidelines and consultation documents; patient groups’ contributions; observations of consultations and of evidence review processes; and recent Department of Health systematic reviews, including patient group participation. We draw on concepts of participatory governance, patient group activism and guideline involvement. We find an increased level of participation by patient groups in recent policy and evidence review processes, and hence legitimation of them as ‘stakeholders’, alongside a strengthened state position on pre-existing diagnostic and testing standards."

Many have argued that a health frame increases engagement, as do visual methodologies including online and interactive platforms, yet to date there has been limited research on audience responses to health messaging using visual interventions. This study explores public attitudes regarding communication tools focused on climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease through six focus groups (n = 61) in rural and urban southern Manitoba, Canada. The results add to the growing evidence of the efficacy of visual and storytelling methods in climate communications and argues for a continuum of mediums: moving from video, text, to maps. Findings underscore the importance of tailoring both communication messages and mediums to increase uptake of adaptive health and environmental behaviours, for some audiences bridging health and climate change while for others strategically decoupling them."

		"abstract": "Background: Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods: A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results: Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions: This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

Based on the unique morphology and high motility of spirochetes, we hypothesized that their surface adhesive molecules might be suitably adapted to aid in their dissemination strategies. Designing a system that mimics natural environmental signals, which many spirochetes face during their infectious cycle, we observed that a subset of their surface proteins, particularly Decorin binding protein (Dbp) A/B, can strongly enhance the motility of spirochetes in the extracellular matrix of the host. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we disentangled the mechanistic details of DbpA/B and decorin/laminin interactions. Our results show that spirochetes are able to leverage a wide variety of adhesion strategies through force-tuning transient molecular binding to extracellular matrix components, which concertedly enhance spirochetal dissemination through the host."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Although tick-borne diseases account for a large number of health care visits in the United States, clinical practices for tick bite and Lyme disease treatment and prevention are not well understood. The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. Methods: In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli’s DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. Results: A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Conclusions: Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common transmissible disease of tick-borne origin. This disease is a significant medical challenge due to the damage to many organs and systems and the tendency to chronicity and long-term disability in the future. Currently, there is an upward trend in the incidence of Lyme disease in Sumy Oblast. Thus, in Ukraine in 2015 the incidence was 7.96 per 100,000 population, and in 2019 it increased to 10.62. The average level of indicators was exceeded in Kyiv Oblast (29.0), Cherkasy Oblast (25.4), Vinnytsia Oblast (23.09), Sumy (25.89) Oblast, and Kyiv (2.54). The peak of tick activity in Ukraine is registered in May and has increased by 4.23 times. The maximum number of patients falls within the working population and causes significant state financial damage. The increase in the number of cases indicates a spread of Lyme disease in Sumy Oblast. In order to prevent the spread, it is necessary to study all possible causes of this disease and find ways to eliminate them. This was the ground for the creation of a unified anonymous questionnaire, which covers the main issues regarding this disease from the standpoint of different population groups. A unified anonymous \"Questionnaire for Lyme disease patients\" contains 16 multiple choice questions and an option for comments. The first group of questions concerned gender, age, and social data of respondents (the largest part of patients fell within the working population – 42.86%). The next group of questions clarified the epidemiological features of this pathology (circumstances, date, time, location, body part bitten). Most often tick bites occurred during walks in the urban forests (42.86% of cases). Most respondents reported that tick bites had happened in June and July (39.29%). Other questions were designed to determine patients' awareness about Lyme borreliosis prevention. The next group of questions was aimed at clarifying the clinical features of the disease (lower extremities were the most frequent site of a tick bite) (46.43%), with erythema dominating among the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (91.07%). According to the anonymous questionnaire, we analyzed and evaluated awareness of diagnosis, clinical signs, and measures of Lyme disease prevention in the patients who were receiving treatment at Municipal Non-Commercial Enterprise of Sumy Regional Council \"Medical Clinical Center of Infectious Diseases and Dermatology Named After Z. Krasovytskyi\" and SSU University Clinic."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms."

Increasing temperature is suspected to affect tick biting rates and pathogen developmental rates, thereby potentially increasing risk for disease incidence. Tick distributions respond to climate change, but how their geographic ranges will shift in future decades and how those shifts may translate into changes in disease incidence remain unclear. In this study, we have assembled correlative ecological niche models for eight tick species of medical or veterinary importance in North America (Ixodes scapularis, I. pacificus, I. cookei, Dermacentor variabilis, D. andersoni, Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus), assessing the distributional potential of each under both present and future climatic conditions. Our goal was to assess whether and how species’ distributions will likely shift in coming decades in response to climate change. We interpret these patterns in terms of likely implications for tick-associated diseases in North America."

Recent tick invasions and range expansion in the United States has been attributed to climate and land use change, an increase in global travel, and importations of exotic animals. A 10 year surveillance study was conducted on Block Island, Rhode Island from 2010–2020 including sampling ticks from small mammal and avian hosts. We report the discovery and establishment of the red sheep tick for the first time in the western hemisphere and in the United States. This invasive species was first collected in 2010 on Block Island, was collected continuously throughout the study, and was collected from an avian host. We document the first report of the invasive Asian longhorned tick in the state of Rhode Island, first observed at our sites in 2018. Finally, we present data on the range expansion and establishment of two native tick species, the lone star tick and the rabbit tick on Block Island. This study emphasized the importance of long-term surveillance to detect changes in tick host communities, including invasive and expanding native vectors of potential significance to humans and wildlife."

Of the rodents captured, 95 (63%) had neither species of tick, 6 (4%) had both tick species, 25 (16%) had I. scapularis only, and 26 (17%) had D. variabilis only. A coefficient of association (C7 = −0.08) was calculated, which suggested there was competition between the two species of ectoparasites, but this value was not significant, indicating that there was a neutral relationship between the tick species on P. leucopus. The co-occurrence of both tick species on their host at the same time suggested that the two tick species can occupy the same host and use the same resources without competing."

Passive tick surveillance gained traction as an effective way to collect epidemiologic data, and in particular, photograph-based tick surveillance can complement in-hand tick specimen identification to amass distribution data and related encounter demographics. We compared the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code of tick photos submitted to a free public identification service (TickSpotters) from 2014 to 2019 to published nationwide county reports for three tick species of medical concern: Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae), Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Ixodida: Ixodidae), and Amblyomma americanum Linneaus (Ixodida: Ixodidae). We tallied the number of TickSpotters submissions for each tick species according to “Reported” or “Established” criteria per county, and found that TickSpotters submissions represented more than half of the reported counties of documented occurrence, and potentially identified hundreds of new counties with the occurrence of these species. We detected the largest number of new county reports of I. scapularis presence in Michigan, North Carolina, and Texas. Tick image submissions revealed potentially nine new counties of occurrence for I. pacificus, and we documented the largest increase in new county reports of A. americanum in Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. These findings demonstrate the utility of crowdsourced photograph-based tick surveillance as a complement to other tick surveillance strategies in documenting tick distributions on a nationwide scale, its potential for identifying new foci, and its ability to highlight at-risk localities that might benefit from tick-bite prevention education."

		"abstract": "Tick infestation is the most reported parasitological problem in cattle in Bhutan. In May and June 2019, we collected ticks from 240 cattle in two districts of Eastern Bhutan. Tick presence, diversity, and infestation prevalence were examined by morphological identification of 3600 live adult ticks. The relationships between cattle, geographic factors, and infestation prevalence were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Habitat suitability for the tick species identified was determined using MaxEnt. Four genera and six species of ticks were found. These were Rhipicephalus microplus (Canestrini) (70.2% (95% confidence interval (CI): 68.7–71.7)), Rhipicephalus haemaphysaloides Supino (18.8% (95% CI: 17.5–20.1)), Haemaphysalis bispinosa Neumann (8.2% (95% CI: 7.3–9.1)), Haemaphysalis spinigera Neumann (2.5% (95% CI: 2–3)), Amblyomma testudinarium Koch (0.19% (95% CI: 0.07–0.4)), and a single unidentified Ixodes sp. Logistic regression indicated that the variables associated with infestation were: longitude and cattle age for R. microplus; latitude for R. haemaphysaloides; and altitude and cattle breed for H. bispinosa and H. spinigera. MaxEnt models showed land cover to be an important predictor for the occurrence of all tick species examined. These findings provide information that can be used to initiate and plan enhanced tick surveillance and subsequent prevention and control programs for ticks and tick-borne diseases in cattle in Bhutan."

In this literature review, we synthesize the available research on the relationship between vegetation and tick abundance for four tick species in the northeastern United States that are of potential medical importance to humans. The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) (Say; Acari: Ixodidae) is found to be positively associated with closed canopy forests and dense vegetation thickets, and negatively associated with open canopy environments, such as grasslands or old agricultural fields. The American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis) (Say; Acari: Ixodidae) has little habitat overlap with I. scapularis, with abundance highest in grasses and open-canopy fields. The lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) (Linnaeus; Acari: Ixodidae) is a habitat generalist without consistent associations with particular types of vegetation. The habitat associations of the recently introduced Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis) (Neumann; Acari: Ixodidae) in the northeastern United States, and in other regions where it has invaded, are still unknown, although based on studies in its native range, it is likely to be found in grasslands and open-canopy habitats."

The interactions between ticks and the pathogens they carry are largely undefined. However, the genus Anaplasma, a group of tick-borne bacteria, has been instrumental in uncovering novel paradigms in tick biology. The emergence of sophisticated technologies and the convergence of entomology with microbiology, immunology, metabolism and systems biology has brought tick–Anaplasma interactions to the forefront of vector biology with broader implications for the infectious disease community. Here, we discuss the use of Anaplasma as an instrument for the elucidation of novel principles in arthropod-microbe interactions. We offer an outlook of the primary areas of study, outstanding questions and future research directions."

Here, we examined tick populations to understand the geographical and temporal distribution of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) vectors in 2020. From April to November, 63,376 ticks were collected from traps to monitor tick populations, with a trap index of 41.3. Tick incidence varied from April to October, with population peaks observed for nymphs in May, adults in July, and larvae in September. The predominant tick species were Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis spp., H. flava, Ixodes spp., Amblyomma testudinarium, and Ixodes nipponensis. Approximately 50% of the collected ticks were pooled into 2973 groups to detect the rate of SFTSV infection in ticks. The minimum infection rate (MIR) of SFTSV was 0.2%, and Andong had the highest MIR for SFTSV (4.0%). The B3 genotype was the most prevalent (52.2%) followed by B2 (28.6%), B5 (15.9%), B4 (1.6%), and B6 (1.6%). We identified widely distributed tick species and a high degree of diversity in SFTSV strains in ticks from different geographical regions. The results may provide a basis for future epidemiological studies and risk assessments for tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Ground settlement and associated deformation of existing infrastructure is a major risk in urban development projects. Project owners have a responsibility to document and manage settlement records before, during and after construction works. Traditionally, land surveying (e.g. leveling and total station) techniques have been the state-of-practice to provide settlement monitoring data. However, in big infrastructure projects, conventional geodetic data acquisition is a major cost driver. Modern space-borne radar interferometry (InSAR) provides the opportunity to drastically increase the number of monitored locations, while at the same time reducing expenses for traditional geodetic survey work. Furthermore, the method allows for highly effective monitoring during all phases of a project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The application of InSAR technology is demonstrated for three large development projects near Oslo, the capital of Norway. Showcase examples include a new highway development project and two railway line upgrade projects. In two of the cases, InSAR monitoring was performed by exploiting very high resolution TerraSAR-X data (ca. 1.5 x 1.5 m spatial ground resolution), and in one case, using high resolution Radarsat-2 data (ca. 7 x 7 m spatial ground resolution). A combined area of 127 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; was monitored for all three projects, yielding a total of roughly 800,000 measurement points on the ground. Achieved measurement point density based on the TerraSAR-X data was around 37,000 points per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while density based on the Radarsat-2 data resulted in approximately 6,000 points per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in built-up areas. Both data resolutions offer millimetric deformation precision, with surfaces of buildings and infrastructure providing the best signal reflection and phase coherence, resulting in high-quality results. In all cases, the interferometric time series analyses were communicated to the end users through a web-based map portal, enabling simple visual interpretation of the results, as well as integration with the settlement records of the project.&lt;/p&gt;"

Early recognition and prompt management with tick removal helps in complete recovery. If untreated, ascending paralysis can lead to respiratory failure and death in 10% of the cases. Tick paralysis is usually considered as a differential in all cases of acute ataxia and generalized weakness in children and adults but seldom in neonates due to its rarity and differences in clinical presentation in the newborn period. In neonates, tick paralysis may present only as generalized weakness and lethargy with poor feeding. Even though tick paralysis is common in children &lt;10 years of age, it has never been reported in a neonate. We report a case of tick bite paralysis in a baby who presented in the neonatal period, and identification of the tick and its removal that helped in rapid recovery."

		"abstract": "Background: The South Downs National Park (SDNP) is the UK’s most visited National Park, and a foci of tick-borne Lyme disease. A range of human pathogens have been detected in UK ticks and related hosts, and the first presumed autochthonous cases of tick-borne encephalitis and babesiosis were recorded in 2019–20. SDNP’s key objectives include conserving wildlife and encouraging enjoyment of the countryside, so interventions are needed that reduce hazard without negatively affecting ecosystem health. To be successful these require knowledge of site hazards, and we aimed to provide this to enable action. Methods: British Deer Society volunteers submitted ticks removed from deer. Key potential intervention sites were selected and ticks collected by drag-sampling six 50 m Results: 87 Conclusions: Mapping shows tick hazard is broadly distributed across SDNP."

Given the scarcity of studies on ticks in Algeria, associations of species were mentioned in only one document and were not well detailed in another. This paper is a synoptic review of seven tick species associations related to host biotic factors in Algeria. The aim is to better understand the behaviour and biology of ticks to propose a new control method based on the association index. A total of 53 infested cattle were detected and 1,214 ticks were manually collected and identified based on their morphology during the summer of 2019 (June to August). Seven tick species were identified:"

This suggests that liquidity providers “overreact” to order imbalance (OIB) by initially altering quotes so much that a negative autocorrelation is seen in mid-price returns. We investigate under which circumstances this behavior is most common. Specifically, it seems the tick size augments “OIB-reversal”. However, if the tick size is binding for much of the trading day, it has the opposite effect of censoring such reversals. In addition, if market liquidity is high, the reversal becomes more frequent."

Here, we show that a mutation in the Babesia microti mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) that confers resistance to the antibabesial drug ELQ-502 decreases parasite fitness in the arthropod vector. Interestingly, whereas the mutant allele does not affect B. microti fitness during the mammalian blood phase of the parasite life cycle and is genetically stable as parasite burden increases, ELQ-502–resistant mutant parasites developing in the tick vector are genetically unstable with a high rate of the wild-type allele emerging during the nymphal stage. Furthermore, we show that B. microti parasites with this mutation are transmitted from the tick to the host, raising the possibility that the frequency of Cytb resistance mutations may be decreased by passage through the tick vector, but could persist in the environment if present when ticks feed."

Exotic species such as Aedes albopictus (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) are becoming established. Recently occurring endemic mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in Canada including West-Nile virus (WNV) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) are having significant public health impacts. Here we explore the use of DNA metabarcoding to identify mosquitoes from CDC light-trap collections from two locations in eastern Canada. Two primer pairs (BF2-BR2 and F230) were used to amplify regions of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (CO1) gene. High throughput sequencing was conducted using an Illumina MiSeq platform and GenBank-based species identification was applied using a QIIME 1.9 bioinformatics pipeline. From a site in southeastern Ontario, Canada, 26 CDC light trap collections of 72 to &gt;300 individual mosquitoes were used to explore the capacity of DNA metabarcoding to identify and quantify captured mosquitoes. The DNA metabarcoding method identified 33 species overall while 24 species were identified by key. Using replicates from each trap, the dried biomass needed to identify the majority of species was determined to be 76 mg (equivalent to approximately 72 mosquitoes), and at least two replicates from the dried biomass would be needed to reliably detect the majority of species in collections of 144–215 mosquitoes and three replicates would be advised for collections with &gt;215 mosquitoes. This study supports the use of DNA metabarcoding as a mosquito surveillance tool in Canada which can help identify the emergence of new mosquito-borne disease potential threats."

		"abstract": "Background: Mosquito control interventions are widely used to reduce mosquito-borne diseases. It is unclear what combination of interventions are most effective in reducing human disease. A novel intervention study for Buruli ulcer targeting mosquito vectors was proposed for a Buruli ulcer-endemic area of Victoria, Australia. The local community expressed a preference for avoiding widespread residual spraying of pyrethroids. To inform the design of a future cluster randomised control study (cRCT) for Buruli ulcer prevention in Victoria, we conducted a systematic literature review. Aims: The aim was to describe cRCT designs which investigated interventions other than non-targeted insecticide for reducing mosquito-borne disease transmission, and comment on the strengths and weaknesses of these study designs. Methods: Five medical research databases were searched for eligible literature from the earliest available sources up to 5 July 2019 (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, EBM Reviews, CAB Direct). Reference lists of identified studies were hand searched. Eligible studies were cRCTs using targeted chemical or biological mosquito control interventions, or mosquito breeding source reduction, with the occurrence of mosquito-borne disease as an outcome. Results: Eight eligible cRCTs, conducted between 1994–2013 were identified in a variety of settings in the Americas and Asia. Interventions to reduce dengue transmission were mass adult trapping and source reduction. Interventions to reduce malaria transmission were largescale larvicide administration and (topical and spatial) repellent use. Three studies showed the intervention was associated with statistically significant reductions in the disease of interest and entomological indicators. High community engagement with the intervention were common to all three. In two studies, large buffer zones reduced contamination between study arms. Heterogeneity was reduced through increasing study cluster numbers, cluster matching and randomisation. Conclusion: High community engagement is vital for a cRCT reducing mosquito-borne disease with a mosquito control intervention. These findings support a mosquito breeding source reduction intervention for"

First of all, the existence of the equilibrium of the system, under different cases of two delays, is discussed through analyzing the corresponding characteristic equation of the linear system. Some conditions that the system undergoes Hopf bifurcation at the endemic equilibrium are obtained. Furthermore, by employing the normal form method and the center manifold theorem for delay differential equations, some explicit formulas used to describe the properties of bifurcating periodic solutions are derived. Finally, the numerical examples and simulations are presented to verify our theoretical conclusions. Meanwhile, the influences of the degree of partial protection for recovered people acquired by a primary infection on the endemic equilibrium and the critical values of the two delays are analyzed."

		"abstract": "Monitoring local mosquito populations for insecticide resistance is critical for effective vector-borne disease control. However, widely used phenotypic assays, which are designed to monitor the emergence and spread of insecticide resistance (technical resistance), do not translate well to the efficacy of vector control products to suppress mosquito numbers in the field (practical resistance). This is because standard testing conditions such as environmental conditions, exposure dose, and type of substrate differ dramatically from those experienced by mosquitoes under field conditions. In addition, field mosquitoes have considerably different physiological characteristics such as age and blood-feeding status. Beyond this, indirect impacts of insecticide resistance and/or exposure on mosquito longevity, pathogen development, host-seeking behavior, and blood-feeding success impact disease transmission. Given the limited number of active ingredients currently available and the observed discordance between resistance and disease transmission, we conclude that additional testing guidelines are needed to determine practical resistance—the efficacy of vector control tools under relevant local conditions— in order to obtain programmatic impact."

With the lack of new chemical classes of insecticides to control mosquito populations, the development of novel synergists may improve the performance of available insecticides. We screened a set of 20 plant essential oils alone and in combination with natural pyrethrins against Aedes aegypti (Orlando) female adult mosquitoes to assess their ability to synergize this natural insecticide. A co-toxicity factor analysis was used to identify whether plant oils modulated the toxicity of natural pyrethrins antagonistically, additively, or synergistically. Both knockdown at 1 h and mortality at 24 h were monitored. A majority of oils increased the toxicity of natural pyrethrins, either via an additive or synergistic profile. Many oils produced synergism at 2 µg/insect, whereas others were synergistic only at the higher dose of 10 µg/insect. Amyris, cardamom, cedarwood, and nutmeg East Indies (E.I.) oils were the most active oils for increasing the mortality of natural pyrethrins at 24 h with co-toxicity factors greater than 50 at either or both doses. A number of oils also synergized the 1 h knockdown of natural pyrethrins. Of these, fir needle oil and cypress oils were the most successful at improving the speed-of-action of natural pyrethrins at both doses, with co-toxicity factors of 130 and 62, respectively. To further assess the co-toxicity factor method, we applied selected plant essential oils with variable doses of natural pyrethrins to calculate synergism ratios. Only the oils that produced synergistic co-toxicity factors produced statistically significant synergism ratios. This analysis demonstrated that the degree of co-toxicity factor correlated well with the degree of synergism ratio observed (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.94 at 2 µg/insect; r = 0.64 at 10 µg/insect) and that the co-toxicity factor is a useful tool in screening for synergistic activity."

Three clubroot-resistant commercial winter oilseed rape (OSR) cultivars and a susceptible ‘Cultivar mix’ were evaluated for disease severity index (DSI) and yield performance in field soils, selected for varying abundance of natural inoculum of Plasmodiophora brassicae. Seven field trials were carried out during 2017–2019 in winter OSR crops, and comparative bioassays were performed in a growth chamber. Substantial variation in clubroot infection between years was observed in the field trials. For Cultivar mix, a negative correlation (y = −252.3ln(x) + 58,897.6) was found between inoculum density and seed yield in five trials, whereas no correlation was found for the resistant cultivars. In bioassays, Cultivar mix exhibited a significantly high correlation between DSIb and number of gene copies g−1 soil (R2 = 0.72). For resistant cvs., Mentor and Alister, correlation was R2 = 0.45 and 0.58, respectively, indicating that resistance was under pressure. In field trials, DSIf of the resistant cultivars was lower (<27). The recommendation is thus to use clubroot-resistant cultivars of OSR as part of Integrated Pest Management in situations where abundance of P. brassicae DNA exceeds 1300 gene copies g−1 soil."

Thus, it is not surprising that these two orders account for many of the reservoirs of the zoonotic RNA viruses discovered to date. The spillover of these viruses from wildlife to human do not typically result in pandemics but rather geographically confined outbreaks of human infection and disease. While limited geographically, these viruses cause thousands of cases of human disease each year. In this review, we focus on three questions regarding zoonotic viruses that originate in bats and rodents. First, what biological strategies have evolved that allow RNA viruses to reside in bats and rodents? Second, what are the environmental and ecological causes that drive viral spillover? Third, how does virus spillover occur from bats and rodents to humans?"

A search was conducted in MEDLINE via PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Open Gray; in addition to a hand search in reference lists of selected articles and creating a search alert in electronic databases. Selection criteria included randomized and prospective clinical trials comparing post-expansion skeletal and/or dento-alveolar effects of tooth-bone-borne expanders to those of bone-borne expanders. Following study retrieval and selection, relevant data was extracted, and risk of bias was assessed using the revised RoB 2 tool for randomized clinical trials. After examining 10 full text articles, one randomized clinical trial was finally included. The study compared the dento-alveolar effects of tooth-bone-borne and bone-borne expanders, following expansion and after 6 months, using digital dental casts. Using the RoB 2 tool, the study was judged overall to show some concerns. A definitive conclusion could not be drawn from this systematic review due to the scarcity of clinical trials tackling the research question. A need for future well-conducted research was highlighted in this review."

Vector control is an important component of every vector control operations for the vector borne disease control. Actually the bioluminescence phenomena and the green fluorescent protein GPF open great field of researches and “On December 10, 2008 Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie and Roger Tsien were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for \"the discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, GFP\". Bio-molecular technologies and transgenesis open the field for getting BL mosquitoes such as Plasmodium (several references) for “Transmission Reducing Activity” (TRA) without any hazard on human beings and ecological level. For exemple BL mosquitoes would be of paramount importance for mark-release-recapture becoming easier to implement and giving more relevant and reliable data on relation between density (size of the population) and distance (and wind) as the vector population size decrease with increasing distance from the source of production (breeding site) or release point. BL appeared already of great interest to understand the relation vector/parasite and to assess transmission intensity. Our idea is to genetically produce “Bioluminescent Mosquitoes” allowing a better identification of their presence, behavior, densities, infected specimens, risk of transmission before/after vector control operations which could be greatly improved thanks to the targeting of mosquitoes resting site or flight range and any other biological component."

		"abstract": "Ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) are major constraints to camel health and production, yet epidemiological data on their diversity and impact on dromedary camels remain limited. We surveyed the diversity of ticks and TBPs associated with camels and co-grazing sheep at 12 sites in Marsabit County, northern Kenya. We screened blood and ticks (858 pools) from 296 camels and 77 sheep for bacterial and protozoan TBPs by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing of PCR products. Hyalomma (75.7%), Amblyomma (17.6%) and Rhipicephalus (6.7%) spp. ticks were morphologically identified and confirmed by molecular analyses. We detected TBP DNA in 80.1% of blood samples from 296 healthy camels. “Candidatus Anaplasma camelii”, “Candidatus Ehrlichia regneryi” and Coxiella burnetii were detected in both camels and associated ticks, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Rickettsia africae, Rickettsia aeschlimannii and Coxiella endosymbionts were detected in camel ticks. We also detected Ehrlichia ruminantium, which is responsible for heartwater disease in ruminants, in Amblyomma ticks infesting camels and sheep and in sheep blood, indicating its endemicity in Marsabit. Our findings also suggest that camels and/or the ticks infesting them are disease reservoirs of zoonotic Q fever (C. burnetii), ehrlichiosis (E. chaffeensis) and rickettsiosis (R. africae), which pose public health threats to pastoralist communities."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses represent a unique class of nucleic acid polymerases. RdRPs are essential in virus life cycle due to their central role in viral genome replication/transcription processes. However, their contribution in host adaption has not been well documented. By solving the RdRP crystal structure of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a tick-borne flavivirus, and comparing the structural and sequence features with mosquito-borne flavivirus RdRPs, we found that a region between RdRP catalytic motifs B and C, namely region B-C, clearly bears host-related diversity. Inter-virus substitutions of region B-C sequence were designed in both TBEV and mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus backbones. While region B-C substitutions only had little or moderate effect on RdRP catalytic activities, virus proliferation was not supported by these substitutions in both virus systems. Importantly, a TBEV replicon-derived viral RNA replication was significantly reduced but not abolished by the substitution, suggesting the involvement of region B-C in viral and/or host processes beyond RdRP catalysis. A systematic structural analysis of region B-C in viral RdRPs further emphasizes its high level of structure and length diversity, providing a basis to further refine its relevance in RNA virus-host interactions in a general context."

		"abstract": "Camels represent an important resource for inhabitants of the most arid regions of the world and their survival is mainly related to environment conditions including the risk of parasitic diseases, which may represent a significant cause of losses in livestock production of these areas. Camels may be parasitized by several hematophagous arthropods, which can be vectors of several diseases including zoonosis. This study aimed to investigate in dromedary camels and their ticks the importance of tick-borne hemoparasites that might be responsible for a recent and obscure morbidity of camels in Al Dhafra region of Abu Dhabi, UAE. Blood samples and ticks from 93 naturally infected camels belonging to 36 herds, affected by variable acute clinical syndromes lasting from 3 to 5 days, were analyzed through molecular techniques for specific DNA presence of different blood pathogens: Anaplasmamarginale/Anaplasmaovis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Coxiella burnetii,Babesia spp., and Theileria spp. DNA. All the 72 ticks collected belonged to the Hyalomma dromedarii species and were negative for blood pathogens. n = 15 camels (16.1%) were found positive to the following tick-borne hemoparasites: A. phagocytophilum 11 (11.8%), Coxiella burnetii 3 (3.2%), and Babesia/Theileria spp. 2 (2.1%). One singular camel showed coinfection of C. burnetii and A. phagocytophiulm. Genetic profile of C. burnetii showed a high phylogenetic relatedness to European, Asian and African C. burnetii strains. This is the first laboratory investigation on tick-borne pathogens in camels in UAE, and the first report of A. phagocytophilum and C. burnetii. Moreover, since the detected pathogens are recognized pathogens for humans, this study highlights the zoonotic risk for humans working in camel husbandry."

		"abstract": "Ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBD) are constraints to the development of livestock and induce potential human health problems. The worldwide distribution of ticks is not homogenous. Some places are ecologically suitable for ticks but they are not introduced in these areas yet. The absence or low density of hosts is a factor affecting the dissemination of the parasite. To understand the process of introduction and spread of TTBD in different areas, and forecast their presence, scientists developed different models (e.g., predictive models and explicative models). This study aimed to identify models developed by researchers to analyze the TTBD distribution and to assess the performance of these various models with a meta-analysis. A literature search was implemented with PRISMA protocol in two online databases (Scopus and PubMed). The selected articles were classified according to country, type of models and the objective of the modeling. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy available data of these models were used to evaluate their performance using a meta-analysis. One hundred studies were identified in which seven tick genera were modeled, with Ixodes the most frequently modeled. Additionally, 13 genera of tick-borne pathogens were also modeled, with Borrelia the most frequently modeled. Twenty-three different models were identified and the most frequently used are the generalized linear model representing 26.67% and the maximum entropy model representing 24.17%. A focus on TTBD modeling in Africa showed that, respectively, genus Rhipicephalus and Theileria parva were the most modeled. A meta-analysis on the quality of 20 models revealed that maximum entropy, linear discriminant analysis, and the ecological niche factor analysis models had, respectively, the highest sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve effect size among all the selected models. Modeling TTBD is highly relevant for predicting their distribution and preventing their adverse effect on animal and human health and the economy. Related results of such analyses are useful to build prevention and/or control programs by veterinary and public health authorities."

		"abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Water vapor (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) is the strongest greenhouse gas in our atmosphere, and it plays a key role in multiple processes that affect weather and climate. Particularly, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O in the upper troposphere - lower stratosphere (UTLS) is of great importance to the Earth's radiative balance, and has a significant impact on the rate of global warming. Hence, accurate measurements of UTLS H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are crucial for understanding and projecting climate. Currently, the reference method used for in-situ measurements of UTLS H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O aboard meteorological balloons is cryogenic frostpoint hygrometry (CFH) [1]. However, the cooling agent required for this technique (trifluoromethane) is phasing out as of 2020, due to its strong global warming potential. This represents a major challenge for the continuity of global, long-term stratospheric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O monitoring networks, such as the GCOS Reference Upper Air Network (GRUAN).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an alternative to CFH, we developed a compact instrument based on mid-IR quantum-cascade laser absorption spectroscopy (QCLAS) [2]. The spectrometer, with a total weight of 3.9 kg, relies on a segmented circular multipass cell [3] that was specifically developed to meet the stringent requirements, in mass, size and temperature resilience, posed by the harsh environmental conditions of the UTLS. Quick response and minimal interference by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O outgassing from surfaces are achieved by an open-path approach. An elaborate thermal management system ensures excellent internal temperature stability, despite of outside temperature variations of up to 80 K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with the German Weather Service (DWD), two successful test flights were performed in December 2019 in Lindenberg, Germany. We will report on the results of these test flights, highlighting the instrument outstanding capabilities under UTLS and stratospheric conditions (up to 28 km altitude), and identifying some limitations. Further development activities triggered by the test flights, involving both hardware adaptations and spectral analysis modifications, will be also discussed.&amp;#160; The final validation will be addressed, in cooperation with the Swiss Federal Institute of Metrology (METAS), by laboratory experiments in a custom-made climate chamber, using dynamically generated, SI-traceable reference mixtures with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O amount fractions below 20 ppmv and uncertainty &lt; 1%. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the potential of QCLAS as a highly valuable technique for quantitative balloon-borne measurements of UTLS and stratospheric H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[1] Brunamonti et al.

		"abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Tropical Africa is characterized by the world-wide largest degree of mesoscale convective organisation. During boreal summer, the wet phase of the West African Monsoon (WAM), the midlevel African easterly jet (AEJ) over the Sahel allows for the formation of synoptic-scale African easterly waves (AEWs) with a maximum intensity close to the West African coast. AEWs interact with convection and its mesoscale organization through modifications in humidity, temperature and vertical wind shear, and often serve as initial disturbances for tropical cyclogenesis. In addition, rainfall can be modulated by other types of tropical waves such as Kelvin or mixed Rossby gravity waves. Upper-tropospheric conditions are dominated by the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ), whose variability appears to be connected to convective activity. Overall, our quantitative understanding of the WAM system is still limited. The observational network over the region is sparse and rainfall forecasts with current Numerical Weather Prediction models are hardly better than climatology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aeolus satellite launched in 2018 offers a great opportunity to further investigate the WAM with an unprecedented density of free-tropospheric wind data. Assimilating Aeolus wind observations in denial experiments using the current operational system of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) shows that the main circulation features of the WAM are greatly impacted: the AEJ and the TEJ are systematically weaker and stronger respectively by~1m/s in the analysis fields including Aeolus data. As a consequence AEWs also show a weakening in the propagation amplitude. We are currently investigating the contributions of the HLOS (horizontal line-of-sight) Rayleigh and Mie wind observations to these observed differences. Mie observations (i.e., those related to backscatter from hydrometeors and aerosol particles) seems to contribute strongly to the difference in the AEJ, which lies within a convectively active region with a high aerosol load. On the other hand, the difference seen in the TEJ appears to originate mostly in the Rayleigh (i.e., clear air) observations. Surprisingly, the ascending and descending HLOS observations contribute differently to the data impact, possibly revealing a remaining bias or model problems with the diurnal cycle. Future work will include systematic comparisons between the operational systems of DWD and ECMWF to understand the influence of different data assimilation approaches as well as the impact on forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;"

However, no studies have thus far quantified or monetised the parental productivity burden of AS. The present study sought to estimate this burden. Methods: The parental productivity burden of AS in Australia was estimated using cost-of-illness modelling with simulated follow-up over a 10-year period using 2019 as the baseline year. This involved estimating the prevalence of persons with AS and their parents, the productivity adjusted life years (PALYs) lost by parents, and the corresponding cost to society. Results: The productivity burden borne by the estimated 153 to 1,322 (lower to upper scenario) parents of the 199 to 1,714 persons with AS ranged from 229.6 to 1,980.2 PALYs (discounted). This corresponded to a societal cost (discounted) of AUD$21.0 to $181.2 million, and a loss of 38% of PALYs per-parent. Conclusion: AS imposes a significant productivity burden on Australian parents of affected persons, with a large associated impact on the broader economy. These findings are important for informing government planning regarding the supports that should be provided to persons with AS and their families. They will also be important for informing the reimbursement strategy for AS therapies."

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT: SAM is a powerful methylating agent, with a methyl group transfer potential matching the phosphoryl group transfer potential of ATP. SAM-dependent N-methyltransferases have evolved to catalyze the modification of specific lysine residues in histones and transcription factors, in addition to generating epinephrine, N-methylnicotinamide, and a quaternary amine (betaine) that is used to maintain osmotic pressure in plants and halophilic bacteria. To assess the catalytic power of these enzymes and their potential susceptibility to transition state and multisubstrate analogue inhibitors, we determined the rates and positions of equilibrium of methyl transfer from the trimethylsulfonium ion to model amines in the absence of a catalyst. Unlike the methyl group transfer potential of SAM, which becomes more negative with increasing pH throughout the normal pH range, equilibrium constants for the hydrolytic demethylation of secondary, tertiary and quaternary amines are found to be insensitive to changing pH and resemble to each other in magnitude, with an average ΔG value of ∼ -0.7 kcal/mol at pH 7. Thus, each of the three steps in the mono- di- and trimethylation of lysine by SAM is accompanied by a free energy change of -7.5 kcal/mol in neutral solution. Arrhenius analysis of the uncatalyzed reactions shows that the unprotonated form of glycine attacks the trimethylsulfonium ion (TMS+"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Face masks are a primary preventive measure against airborne pathogens. Thus, they have become one of the keys to controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Common examples, including N95 masks, surgical masks, and face coverings, are passive devices that minimize the spread of suspended pathogens by inserting an aerosol-filtering barrier between the user’s nasal and oral cavities and the environment. However, the filtering process does not adapt to changing pathogen levels or other environmental factors, which reduces its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. This paper addresses the limitations of passive masks by proposing ADAPT, a smart IoT-enabled “active mask”. This wearable device contains a real-time closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes near the mask by using an on-board particulate matter (PM) sensor. It then intelligently mitigates the threat by using mist spray, generated by a piezoelectric actuator, to load nearby aerosol particles such that they rapidly fall to the ground. The system is controlled by an on-board micro-controller unit (MCU) that collects sensor data, analyzes it, and activates the mist generator as necessary. A custom smartphone application enables the user to remotely control the device and also receive real-time alerts related to recharging, refilling, and/or decontamination of the mask before reuse. Experimental results on a working prototype confirm that aerosol clouds rapidly fall to the ground when the mask is activated, thus significantly reducing PM counts near the user. Also, usage of the mask significantly increases local relative humidity (RH) levels."
