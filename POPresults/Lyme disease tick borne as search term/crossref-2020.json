Enhancements provided by molecular assays, including speed, throughput, sensitivity, and specificity, have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of newly characterized tick-borne agents. The use of unbiased high throughput sequencing has enabled the prompt identification of new pathogens and the examination of tick microbiomes. These efforts have led to the identification of hundreds of new tick-borne agents in the last decade alone. However, little is currently known about the majority of these agents beyond their phylogenetic classification. Our article outlines the primary methods involved in tick-borne agent discovery and the current status of our understanding of tick-borne agent diversity."

		"abstract": "Background: Surveillance data of tick-borne disease (TBD) incidence in the United States are compiled at the county level, yet few studies have classified TBD risk using established county classification systems. Objective: Determine if significant differences in TBD incidence rates exist between Indiana counties based on population size classification (i.e. urban, rural, and rural-mixed). Methods: County TBD data for the period 2009 to 2016, were obtained from the Epidemiology Resource Center at the Indiana State Department of Health. Using the 2010 decennial population census, we normalized TBD counts to derive incidence rates per 1,000 population. We classified Indiana counties as either rural, rural-mixed, or urban based on population size. We used Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test to determine if median TBD incidence rates differed between urban, rural, and rural-mixed urban counties. We used choropleth maps in ESRI ArcGIS to display TBD incidence rate by county classification. Results: Kolmogorov-Smirnov pairwise comparisons test results, revealed no evidence of a difference in TBD incidence rates between rural, rural-mixed, and urban counties (p≥ 0.1208 ± 0.0065). Furthermore, Kruskal-Wallis test showed no evidence of a difference in the median TBD incidence rates by county classification (p = 0.9754). Higher TBD incidence rate counties occur in the western region, while lower rate counties occur in the eastern region. Although no differences exist in incidence rates by county classification, the two highest incidence rates were recorded in rural counties. Conclusion: A classification of Indiana counties based on population size is inadequate in identifying counties with a greater or lesser risk of TBD incidence. For a better understanding of county population-level TBD risk, future studies should aim at obtaining and exploring TBD incidence data at more granular, sub-county population levels such as zip codes, census- blocks and tracts."

		"abstract": "Background: Although the prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBD) continues to increase, there remains significant confusion regarding treatment for Lyme and other TBDs. We conducted a chart review of all new patients that came to an academic center for Lyme and TBDs. We then initiated a quality improvement project for feedback from a small subset of patients with Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Methods: Charts of patients visiting the clinic between March and November 2018 were reviewed. Data abstracted from the electronic health record included demographics, laboratory and clinical data. A small subset of patients who reported a history of Lyme and at least 6 months of symptoms after antibiotic treatment were enrolled in a phone survey to evaluate their experience with treatment for PTLDS. Results: Symptoms most commonly seen in 218 new patients included fatigue (66.5%), joint pain (58.2%), cognitive difficulty (32.1%), headache (27.9%) and sleep disturbance (27.5%). 87% had already received tick-borne disease directed antibiotic treatment. Over half (60.5%) of patients report having symptoms for more than 6 months. More than half of patients (54.8%) who had more than 6 months of Lyme-related symptoms had positive serological testing. Common themes identified in the 16 phone surveys of patients with PTLDS conducted so far included significant frustration related to the dismissive attitudes from medical professionals (n=9/16), and many sought alternative or complementary therapies (n=11/16). Six patients reported receiving very long-term antibiotic regimens from other Lyme specialists. Many patients expressed satisfaction with the visit and medical advice even in the absence of curative therapy (n=9/16), although a significant number continued to seek care elsewhere (n=6/16). Conclusion: More than half of new patients reported symptoms lasting more than 6 months after targeted antibiotic therapy. Further research is needed to develop interventions for the common symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, cognitive difficulty and sleep disturbance. Treatments to improve sleep, diet, and physical activity and decrease inflammation among patients who suffer from PTLDS are needed. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

Colorado tick fever is common in parts of north-western North America; acquired from tick (ixodid) bites, most often by hikers and campers, presenting 3–6 days later with sudden fever, rigors, generalized aches, myalgia, headache and backache, rashes (12%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (20%). Diagnosis is confirmed by detection of viral antigen in erythrocytes or serum, or by serodiagnosis. Management is symptomatic. Illness usually resolves in 10–14 days, but convalescence may be prolonged. Prevention is by avoiding, repelling, and rapidly removing ticks; no vaccines are available.</p>"

We synthesize key aspects of tick life history that enable ticks to persist, spread and impact human health, including a two-year life cycle, multiple transmission pathways and dependence on hosts for tick feeding, movement and pathogen transmission. We discuss modeling advances that incorporate these traits in the context of climate-driven variation in tick feeding phenology. For established pathogens, such as the Lyme disease agent in the United States, we disentangle the linkages between land use change, habitat fragmentation and host diversity influencing human risk of infection along an urbanization gradient. We propose a coupled natural-human system framework for tick-borne pathogens that accounts for nonlinear effects and feedbacks between the enzootic cycle and human spillover. A deeper understanding of the eco-bio-social determinants of these diseases is required to develop more effective public health interventions.</p>"

Only hospitalized patients with a recent tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection confirmed by laboratory diagnosis are counted as cases. Confirmation is usually based on immunoglobulin (Ig) serology (namely enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] for IgM and IgG). However, this confirmation may be supplemented by virus neutralization and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses if needed."

Based on phylogenetic studies, four TBEV subtypes (Far-Eastern, Siberian, European, Baikalian) and two putative subtypes (Himalayan and “178-79” group) are known. Within each subtype, some genetic lineages are described. The European subtype (TBEV-EU) (formerly known also as the “Western subtype”) of TBEV is prevalent in Europe, but it was also isolated in Western and Eastern Siberia in Russia and South Korea. The Far-Eastern subtype (TBEV-FE) was preferably found in the territory of the far-eastern part of Eurasia, but some strains were isolated in other regions of Eurasia. The Siberian (TBEV-SIB) subtype is the most common and has been found in almost all TBEV habitat areas. The Baikalian subtype is prevalent around Lake Baikal and was isolated several times from ticks and rodents. In addition to the four TBEV subtypes, one single isolate of TBEV (178-79) and two genetic sequences (Himalayan) supposed to be new TBEV subtypes were described in Eastern Siberia and China. The data on TBEV seroprevalence in humans and animals can serve as an indication for the presence or absence of TBEV in studied area."

Recent clinical studies show long-term seropersistence of TBE antibodies after the first booster vaccination (dose 4) with the two European vaccines. An effectiveness of approximately 99% (years 2000–2006) and 98.7% (years 2000-2011) was calculated for regularly vaccinated persons in Austria, a country with established high vaccination uptake.

		"abstract": "TBE appears with non-characteristic clinical symptoms, which cannot be distinguished from other forms of viral encephalitis or other diseases. Cerebrospinal fluid and neuro-imaging may give some evidence of TBE, but ultimately cannot confirm the diagnosis. Thus, proving the diagnosis “TBE” necessarily requires confirmation of TBEV-infection by detection of the virus or by demonstration of specific antibodies from serum and/or cerebrospinal fluid. During the phase of clinic symptoms from the CNS, the TBEV can only rarely be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients. Most routinely used serological tests for diagnosing TBE (ELISA, HI, IFA) show cross reactions resulting from either infection with other flaviviruses or with other flavivirus vaccines."

An additional 2 genotypes have been identified in the Irkutsk region of Russia, currently named TBE virus Baikalian subtype (TBEV-BKL) and TBE virus Himalayan subtype (Himalayan and “178-79” group; TBEV-HIM). TBEV virions are small enveloped spherical particles about 50 nm in diameter. The TBEV genome consists of a single-stranded positive sense RNA molecule. The genome encodes one open reading frame (ORF), which is flanked by untranslated (non-coding) regions (UTRs). The 5′-UTR end has a methylated nucleotide cap for canonical cellular translation. The 3′-UTR is not polyadenylated and is characterized by extensive length and sequence heterogeneity. The ORF encodes one large polyprotein, which is co- and post-translationally cleaved into 3 structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and 7 non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5). TBEV replicates in the cytoplasm of the host cell in close association with virus-induced intracellular membrane structures. Virus assembly occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. The immature virions are transported to the Golgi complex, and mature virions pass through the host secretory pathway and are finally released from the host cell by fusion of the transport vesicle membrane with the plasma membrane."

Pathogenesis of TBE is not well understood, but both direct viral effects and immune-mediated tissue damage of the central nervous system may contribute to the natural course of TBE. The effect of TBEV on the innate immune system has mainly been studied in vitro and in mouse models. Characterization of human immune responses to TBEV is primarily conducted in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid, due to the inaccessibility of brain tissue for sample collection. Natural killer (NK) cells and T cells are activated during the second (meningo-encephalitic) phase of TBE. The potential involvement of other cell types has not been examined to date. Immune cells from peripheral blood, in particular neutrophils, T cells, B cells and NK cells, infiltrate into the cerebrospinal fluid of TBE patients."

		"abstract": "TBE is a flavivirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), transmitted by ticks and in some instances by ingestion of unpasteurized milk. It is diagnosed in the forested belts of Northern Eurasia ranging from the UK, eastern France, The Netherlands and Norway down to Italy through central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Kazakhstan, and China to Japan. About 10,000 cases of TBE are reported annually, likely a significant underestimate as serological testing is more sporadic than complete and, in some countries, (like Japan) not even available. The European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) have put TBE on their list of notifiable diseases. Their case definition requires clinical symptoms of CNS infection plus virological or serological confirmation of the infection, usually by detection of specific immunoglobulins IgG and IgM. Vaccination against TBE is on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines. the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. Surveillance of TBE and the TBEV is incomplete. Reported incidences do not reflect actual risk since this fluctuates annually as a result of changes in exposure, vaccine uptake, intensity of case finding and reporting, climate factors, reservoir animals and ticks – just to mention the most relevant factors. For largely unknown reasons (including human behavior, improved diagnostics, or climate change) TBEV appears to be spreading north, east, west, even south and to higher altitudes to areas that were previously believed to be free of the virus."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore blood digestion is very important for tick survival. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. However, most of these studies have focused on partially engorged ticks. In other hematophagous arthropods, the serine proteases play an important role in blood protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of four I. scapularis serine proteases with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. An in vitro hemoglobinolytic assay was performed with or without serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 day post host detachment, respectively. The knockdown of three previously identified serine proteases by RNAi negatively impacted blood intake, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the gut and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation in vitro. A trypsin inhibitor, PMSF, blocked the action of trypsin in the gut extract resulting in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Our data also demonstrated that in addition to blood digestion, these serine proteases might have a role in blood feeding success in I. scapularis."

This number may be considered as ‘low’ – not only as an individual risk but also from a public health perspective. If an individual does contract TBE, however, the disease may deeply change her/his life due to the need for acute hospital care and due to potentially severe and long-term sequelae. In 1–2% (-20%) of cases, TBE may even result in death. No specific treatments exist for TBE. The severity of the disease and high frequency of long-term sequelae result in high public awareness and concerns about tick bites in endemic areas. Public health officials in TBE-endemic areas need to address these concerns; moreover, they need to address the concerns of travelers at risk. The principal public health measures aim at reducing TBE cases by reduction of exposure and preventive vaccination. Recommendation/reimbursement of TBE vaccination still is under discussion from side of healthcare payer perspective as well as from the individuals perspective considering long term sequelae."

Tools to study TBEV pathogenicity such as mouse knock-out models and reverse genetics are also discussed."

		"abstract": "TBEV-particles are assembled in an immature, noninfectious form in the endoplasmic reticulum by the envelopment of the viral core (containing the viral RNA) by a lipid membrane associated with two viral proteins, prM and E. Immature particles are transported through the cellular exocytic pathway and conformational changes induced by acidic pH in the trans-Golgi network allow the proteolytic cleavage of prM by furin, a cellular protease, resulting in the release of mature and infectious TBE-virions. The E protein controls cell entry by mediating attachment to as yet ill-defined receptors as well as by low-pH-triggered fusion of the viral and endosomal membrane after uptake by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Because of its key functions in cell entry, the E protein is the primary target of virus neutralizing antibodies, which inhibit these functions by different mechanisms. Although all flavivirus E proteins have a similar overall structure, divergence at the amino acid sequence level is up to 60 percent (e.g. between TBE and dengue viruses), and therefore cross-neutralization as well as (some degree of) cross-protection are limited to relatively closely related flaviviruses, such as those constituting the tick-borne encephalitis serocomplex."

Despite this, TBE vaccination rates have ranged from 10% to 40% in Italy, even in at-risk workers. The reasons for this low rate are investigated in this present study of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of occupational physicians (OP) regarding TBE disease and vaccination in at-risk workers. A total of 229 OP participated in an internet-based survey by completing a structured questionnaire. Adequate general knowledge of TBE disease was found in 58% of OP. Accurate perception of TBE risk in occupational settings was found in 20%. TBE vaccination for at-risk workers was recommended by 19%. Willingness to recommend TBE vaccination was more likely by OP practicing in endemic areas (Odds Ratio 3.10, 95% confidence intervals 1.47–6.55), who knew the existence of the term “arboviruses” (3.10, 1.29–7.44), or exhibited a better understanding of TBE (2.38, 1.11–5.12)—and were positive predictors for promoting TBE vaccine, while acknowledging that TBE as a severe disease was a negative one. Tick-borne disorders in Italy are a still rare (but increasing) occupational health threat, and vaccination gaps for TBE virus may find an explanation in OP incomplete knowledge of evidence-based recommendations."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases affecting humans and animals are on the rise worldwide. Vaccines constitute an effective control measure, but very few are available. We selected Lyme borreliosis, a bacterial infection transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes, to validate a new concept to identify vaccine candidates. This disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Although attempts to develop a vaccine exist, none have been successfully marketed. In tick-borne diseases, the skin constitutes a very specific environment encountered by the pathogen during its co-inoculation with tick saliva. In a mouse model, we developed a proteomic approach to identify vaccine candidates in skin biopsies. We identified 30 bacterial proteins after syringe inoculation or tick inoculation of bacteria. Discovery proteomics using mass spectrometry might be used in various tick-borne diseases to identify pathogen proteins with early skin expression. It should help to better develop sub-unit vaccines based on a cocktail of several antigens, associated with effective adjuvant and delivery systems of antigens. In all vector-borne diseases, the skin deserves further investigation to better define its role in the elaboration of protective immunity against pathogens."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-feeding arthropods and transmit a variety of medically important viral, bacterial, protozoan pathogens to animals and humans. Ticks also harbor a diverse community of microbes linked to their biological processes, such as hematophagy, and hence affect vector competence. The interactions between bacterial and/or protozoan pathogens and the tick microbiome is a black-box, and therefore we tested the hypothesis that the presence of a protozoan or bacterial pathogen will alter the microbial composition within a tick. Hence, this study was designed to define the microbial composition of two tick species, Hyalomma (H.) anatolicum and Rhipicephalus (R.) microplus. We used a combination of PCR based pathogen (Anaplasma marginale and Theileria species) and symbiont (Wolbachia species) identification followed by metagenomic sequencing and comparison of the microbial communities in PCR positive and negative ticks. A total of 1786 operational taxonomic units was identified representing 25 phyla, 50 classes, and 342 genera. The phylum Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota were the most represented bacteria group. Alpha and beta diversity were not significantly affected in the presence or absence of Theileria sp. and A. marginale as see with H. anatolicum ticks. Interestingly, bacterial communities were significantly reduced in Theileria sp. infected R. microplus ticks, while also exhibiting a significant reduction in microbial richness and evenness. Putting these observations together, we referred to the effect the presence of Theileria sp. has on R. microplus a “pathogen-induced dysbiosis”. We also identify the presence of Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria from the microbiome of both H. anatolicum and R. microplus ticks. These findings support the presence of a “pathogen-induced dysbiosis” within the tick and further validation experiments are required to investigate how they are important in the vector competence of ticks. Understanding the mechanism of “pathogen-induced dysbiosis” on tick microbial composition may aid the discovery of intervention strategies for the control of emerging tick-borne infections."

The effects on the DINs were variable among microorganisms, more than likely due to contrasts in their biology (including transmission modes, host specificity and transmission efficiency). The strongest associations were found in rodent-associated pathogens that most heavily rely on horizontal transmission. Our results draw attention to the importance of considering transmission mode of a pathogen while developing preventative measures to successfully reduce the burden of disease."

Vaccines or standard medical interventions for many VDBs do not exist or are poorly developed so disease control is focused on managing vector numbers and dynamics. This involves understanding not only the population dynamics but also the population genetics of vectors. Using mosquitoes as a case study, in this chapter, the modern genetics-based methods of vector control (self-limiting, self-sustaining) on mosquito population and disease suppression will be reviewed. These genetics-based methods highlight the importance of understanding the interplay between genetics and ecology to develop optimal, cost-effective solutions for control. The chapter focuses on how these genetics-based methods can be integrated with other interventions, and concludes with a summary of regulatory and policy perspectives about the use of these approaches in the management of VBDs.</p>"

Differences between the map above and country maps are explained by the fact that Public Health officials try to quantify the risk for TBE and thus indicate only those areas as “TBE risk areas” where a certain incidence threshold of TBE case numbers or TBE incidence is reached. This approach, however, does neither take into account the (in-) completeness of testing of all encephalitis cases for TBE as well as vaccine uptake nor the existence of TBEV in regions with low risk of exposition to humans (i.e. high TBE risk areas, however only rarely visited by humans). The goal of the map is to give a more real impression of the distribution of the TBEV, according to available virological/serological data – since all other data are biased by incomplete surveillance.Moreover, the map presented here may not entirely be complete, and very likely TBEV infections and thus TBE may occur in additional (“new”) areas."

These infections are among the oldest known diseases transmitted by vectors. In the last three decades there has been a rapid increase in the recognition of this disease complex. This unusual expansion of information was mainly caused by the development of molecular diagnostic techniques that have facilitated the identification of new and previously recognized rickettsiae. A lot of currently known bacteria of the genus Rickettsia have been considered nonpathogenic for years, and moreover, many new species have been identified with unknown pathogenicity. The genus Rickettsia is distributed all over the world. Many Rickettsia species are present on several continents. The geographical distribution of rickettsiae is related to their vectors. New cases of rickettsioses and new locations, where the presence of these bacteria is recognized, are still being identified. The variety and rapid evolution of the distribution and density of ticks and diseases which they transmit shows us the scale of the problem. This review article presents a comparison of the current understanding of the geographic distribution of pathogenic Rickettsia species to that of the beginning of the century."

They and members of a second expedition under the leadership of the Academician Evgeny N. Pavlovsky 1938 elucidated the basic eco-epidemiology of the virus. In their natural foci, TBE virus circulates between vectors, certain ixodid ticks, and some of their hosts, so-called reservoir hosts, mostly small mammals. Five different subtypes of TBE virus have been described to date."

This rapid spread, alongside the presence of the Ixodes ricinus vector throughout the UK, had led to concerns that it may become endemic through introduction of infected ticks on imported animals or on migratory birds. This was realised last year when evidence of endemic foci in the UK was demonstrated, particularly in Thetford Forest. This article reviews current information on tick-borne encephalitis, its distribution in Europe and the risk it poses to UK dogs and their owners."

		"abstract": "Significance: Tick-borne disease incidence has increased in the United States over the last three decades. Because life-long symptoms can occur if reactive antibiotics are not administered soon after the tick bite, prevention is imperative. Yet, control of tick-borne zoonoses has been largely unsuccessful, at least partly because of a limited understanding of the ecological complexities of these diseases, especially non-Lyme disease tick-borne zoonoses. We use continental-scale data to quantify the relationships among four tick-borne diseases and tick and reservoir host communities, revealing that disease incidence is driven by a combination of tick densities and reservoir host densities and diversity. Thus, the efficacy of tick-borne disease interventions is likely dependent on these ecological contexts."

The whole inactivated TBE vaccine is highly effective, as proven by high seroconversion rates and near eradication of the disease in countries where vaccination programs have been implemented. TBE vaccine potency testing currently requires the use of in vivo methods that present issues of reproducibility as well as animal discomfort. As an alternative, public and private entities are currently exploring a batch-to-batch consistency approach which would demonstrate conformity of a newly produced vaccine batch with a batch with proven in vivo efficacy with respect to a range of in vitro measurable quality parameters. For the identification of a suitable cellular platform to be used in a panel of in vitro batch-to-batch assessments for the TBE vaccine, we exposed human cell-based systems, both of primary origin and cell line-derived, to vaccine formulations of high and low quality. Following stimulation, cell responses were evaluated by assessing the expression of selected genes by qPCR. Our findings show that the expression of interferon-stimulated genes differed after treatment with non-adjuvanted vaccine batches of different quality in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, but not in monocyte-free PBMC suspensions nor in cell line-derived immune cells. These results indicate suitable platforms and potential biomarkers for a cell-based assay that, together with other immunochemical analyses, could serve for batch-to-batch assessment of the TBE vaccine, reducing (and eventually replacing) in vivo methods for potency testing."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne diseases are an important cause of human morbidity and mortality in the United States. The past several decades have witnessed an increase in both the number of recognized tick-borne pathogens and the number of tick-borne disease cases, whereas tick surveys have revealed substantial geographic expansions of tick populations throughout the country. Multiple laboratory testing options exist for diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, including serology, microscopy, and molecular-based methods. The preferred approach varies by the specific disease, locally available test options, and the stage of illness at patient presentation. Accurate and timely detection of tick-borne illness is of utmost importance, as prompt treatment is strongly linked to better outcomes. Content: This review covers the clinical manifestations and preferred diagnostic approaches for important bacterial, viral, and parasitic tick-borne diseases in the United States, including Lyme disease, tick-borne relapsing fever, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever rickettsioses, and babesiosis. Infection with emerging pathogens such as Borrelia miyamotoi, Powassan virus, Heartland virus, Colorado tick fever virus, and Bourbon virus are also covered. Summary: Our understanding of tick-borne diseases in the United States continues to improve with the detection of novel pathogens and development of new diagnostic modalities. While conventional diagnostic methods, including serology and microscopy, will play an ongoing role in the diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, implementation of advanced molecular diagnostics will further broaden our understanding of these diseases by facilitating detection of emerging pathogens and providing more accurate and timely diagnosis."

At the completion of therapy, all three patients major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25-30 months. In conclusion, Double dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS, especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

Long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing has demonstrated high initial protection against bites from blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), in laboratory settings, and sustained protection against bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in field tests. However, long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has not been field tested among outdoor workers who are frequently exposed to blacklegged ticks. We conducted a 2-yr randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial among 82 outdoor workers in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Participants in the treatment arm wore factory-impregnated permethrin clothing, and the control group wore sham-treated clothing. Outdoor working hours, tick encounters, and bites were recorded weekly to assess protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin-impregnated garments. Factory-impregnated clothing significantly reduced tick bites by 65% in the first study year and by 50% in the second year for a 2-yr protective effect of 58%. No significant difference in other tick bite prevention method utilization occurred between treatment and control groups, and no treatment-related adverse outcomes were reported. Factory permethrin impregnation of clothing is safe and effective for the prevention of tick bites among outdoor workers whose primary exposure is to blacklegged ticks in the northeastern United States."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the Eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore efficient blood digestion is critical for survival. Studies in partially engorged ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. In this study, we investigated the potential role of serine proteases in blood digestion in replete ticks. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. Hemoglobinolytic activity was determined in vitro, with or without a serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after repletion. Knockdown of serine proteases negatively impacted blood feeding, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the midgut, and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation. Incubation of midgut extract with a trypsin inhibitor resulted in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Understanding the digestive profile of trypsin during blood meal digestion in I. scapularis improves our understanding of the basic biology of ticks and may lead to new methods for tick control."

Prevention and diagnosis of tickborne diseases are improved by access to current and accurate information on where medically important ticks and their associated human and veterinary pathogens are present, their local abundance or prevalence, and when ticks are actively seeking hosts. The true extent of tick and tickborne pathogen expansion is poorly defined, in part because of a lack of nationally standardized tick surveillance. We surveyed 140 vector-borne disease professionals working in state, county, and local public health and vector control agencies to assess their 1) tick surveillance program objectives, 2) pathogen testing methods, 3) tick control practices, 4) data communication strategies, and 5) barriers to program development and operation. Fewer than half of respondents reported that their jurisdiction was engaged in routine, active tick surveillance, but nearly two-thirds reported engaging in passive tick surveillance. Detection of tick presence was the most commonly stated current surveillance objective (76.2%). Most of the programs currently supporting tick pathogen testing were in the Northeast (70.8%), Upper and Central Midwest (64.3%), and the West (71.4%) regions. The most common pathogens screened for were Rickettsia spp. (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae) and bacterial and viral agents transmitted by Ixodes (Acari: Ixodidae) ticks. Only 12% of respondents indicated their jurisdiction directly conducts or otherwise financially supports tick control. Responses indicated that their ability to expand the capacity of tick surveillance and control programs was impeded by inconsistent funding, limited infrastructure, guidance on best practices, and institutional capacity to perform these functions."

Behaviors of and interactions between viruses, vectors, hosts, and the environment each play a part in determining the transmission of a disease. Public health surveillance systems and other sources provide valuable data that can be used to accurately forecast disease incidence. However, many aspects of common infectious disease surveillance data are imperfect: cases may be reported with a delay or in some cases not at all, data on vectors may not be available, and case data may not be available at high geographical or temporal resolution. In the face of these challenges, researchers must make assumptions to either account for these underlying processes in a mechanistic model or to justify their exclusion altogether in a statistical model.</p>"

		"abstract": "A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2019 to February 2020 with the objective of identifying ixodid ticks and haemoparasites, in extensively managed livestock, in Alle district, Southwestern Ethiopia. The study area is assumed to be free from ticks, and there had been no diagnostic and treatment options for tick-borne diseases. Among 384 heads of cattle examined for tick infestation and haemoparasites, 139 (36.19%) were infested with one or more tick species and 25 (6.51%) were haemoparasitised. Two genera of ticks, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus formerly (Boophilus), and four species (Amblyomma variegatum, Amblyomma lepidum, Rhipicephalus microplus, and Rhipicephalus annulatus) were identified. The haemoparasite identified was Babesia bovis. Among the risk factors, body condition score and season of the year were found to be significantly associated with tick infestation with x2 = 9.919,"

Methods: Adult patients with autoimmune conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment such as infliximab and rituximab were invited to participate in the study when they attended the hospital for treatment and/or control of the disease. Whole-blood samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, and Babesia spp. Results: The occurrence of tick-borne pathogens in the blood of patients (n = 163) with autoimmune conditions requiring immunosuppressive treatment was evaluated. Pathogen DNA was detected in 8.6% (14/163) of the patients. The predominant pathogen was Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (12/14), which was carried in the blood of infected patients for 10–59 days until treatment with doxycycline. B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp. were detected in 1 patient each. The B. burgdorferi–infected patient presented with fever, whereas the remaining patients were judged to have subclinical infections. B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, and Babesia spp. were not detected in any patient. Conclusions: Patients treated with biologicals and living in a tick-endemic area seem to have a high risk of contracting Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis infection, which, if left untreated, could result in thromboembolic complications."

However, enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammals and ticks is poorly characterized throughout much of the region. Here we report prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammal and tick communities in the understudied region of southern California. We found B. burgdorferi s.l. in 1.5% of Ixodes species ticks and 3.6% of small mammals. Infection was uncommon (~0.3%) in Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent to humans in western North America, but a diversity of spirochetes—including Borrelia bissettiae, Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, and B. burgdorferi s.s.—were identified circulating in Ixodes species ticks and their small mammal hosts. Infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. is more common in coastal habitats, where a greater diversity of Ixodes species ticks are found feeding on small mammal hosts (four species when compared with only I. pacificus in other sampled habitats). This provides some preliminary evidence that in southern California, wetter coastal areas might be more favorable for enzootic transmission than hotter and drier climates. Infection patterns confirm that human transmission risk of B. burgdorferi s.s. is low in this region. However, given evidence for local maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l., more studies of enzootic transmission may be warranted, particularly in understudied regions where the tick vector of B. burgdorferi s.s. occurs."

		"abstract": "Given the high medical importance of ticks, we analyzed the most common preventive behaviors and practices adopted by medical students from Poland, Germany, and Thailand, and the level of their knowledge of ticks and tick-borne diseases. A survey consisting of 19 questions was conducted among 636 randomly selected students. The study showed that the Polish and German students preferred inspection of the body on their return home (86.9% and 63.5%, respectively) and wearing protective clothes (79.8% and 32.3%, respectively) as part of prophylaxis. The Thai students most often chose wearing protective clothes (54.7%) and preventive behavior in tick habitats (42.7%). Approximately 7% of the Polish medical students and as many as 22% of the German and Thai respondents did not use any means of prevention. Our analyses suggest that the use of preventive methods and respondents’ behaviors depend on socio-demographic factors and the level of health education. The insufficient practical implementation of tick prevention measures by the medical students suggests a need for verification of health education programs in schools as well as effective popularization and educational activities. It is also necessary to develop a public health protection strategy against the effects of tick bites."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne Encephalitis (TBE) is a CNS infection caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), transmitted by ticks or by ingestions of unpasteurized dairy products. Persisting sequelae occur in up to 50% of patients and case fatality rates are 0.4-6% (up to 20% in Russia). There is no specific treatment, but prevention exists. New areas of TBEV circulation were recently identified. Here the current distribution of the TBEV by the end of 2019 is summarized. Methods: Data were obtained from solicitation of local expert data from countries in Europe and Asia on TBEV isolation, type of surveillance/reporting, past/current case counts, and vaccine uptake, supplemented by literature searches. Countries were classified as suggested by the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as TBE- “predisposed” (competent ticks present), “imperiled” (TBEV isolated), “affected” (sporadic autochthonous cases) or “endemic” (annually autochthonous cases). Results: TBE has now been diagnosed in Eurasia from the United Kingdom, Norway and France in the west, northern Italy in the south, central/eastern Europe, Russia, China on to Japan in the east. “New endemic” countries in the last five years include the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, as well as “new endemic regions”, e.g. in France, Norway, Germany, Finland and Poland. Six countries are considered as predisposed only, three as imperiled, five as affected and 29 as endemic. Misclassification is likely as some countries have no testing (no test), incomplete testing and/or underreporting. Conclusion: The main considerations of TBEV risk for oversea travelers to Eurasia are: 1) the exact region and terrain within a country; 2) the planned type of (outdoor) activity; 3) the reliability of within country TBEV surveillance. TBE incidences per region may fluctuate log-fold over just a few years and low reported case counts may reflect a lack of testing, and/or preventive measures including vaccine uptake, and underreporting. As the incidence of TBE is unpredictable, prevention measures should be considered for any person traveling or residing in a recognized TBE “risk area”.

While research has focused more on vaccinations against measles or influenza, and described how the framing approach can be applied to vaccination, this is not the case with tick-borne encephalitis, a potentially fatal infection induced by tick bites. This study takes one step back and seeks to investigate whether health and scientific frames in online communication are even recognized by the public. Moreover, the influence of selected health- and vaccine-related constructs on the recognition of frames is examined. Study results indicate that health frames are the most easily identified and that their use might be a fruitful strategy when raising awareness of health topics such as vaccination."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most common viral tick-borne disease in Europe causing thousands of human infections every year. Available risk maps in Europe are solely based on human incidences, but often underestimate areas with TBE virus circulation as shown by several autochthonous cases detected outside known risk areas. A dataset of more than 1300 georeferenced TBE virus detections in ticks and mammals except for humans was compiled and used to estimate the probability of TBE virus presence in Europe. For this, a random forests model was implemented using temperature- and precipitation-dependent bioclimatic variables of the WorldClim dataset, altitude, as well as land cover of the ESA GlobCover dataset. The highest probabilities of TBE virus presence were identified in Central Europe, in the south of the Nordic countries, and in the Baltic countries. The model performance was evaluated by an out-of-bag error (OOB) of 0.174 and a high area under the curve value (AUC) of 0.905. The TBE virus presence maps may subsequently be used to estimate the risk of TBE virus infections in humans and can support decision-makers to identify TBE risk areas and to encourage people to take appropriate actions against tick bites and TBE virus infections."

There is, however, only limited knowledge about risk of vaccination failure, the disease course and the challenges for work-up and care. Of note, there is evidence that patients with breakthrough disease experience a more severe disease course. We report the case of a previously healthy 49-year-old woman who developed severe myeloradiculitis caused by the TBE virus despite receiving a complete cycle of primary immunization and booster vaccinations within the recommended timeframe. The disease course was characterized by progressive tetraparesis, pain and bladder dysfunction and necessitated intensive care unit admission (ICU) and the escalation of pain management. This case raises awareness for the recognition of breakthrough disease in younger patients and reinforces the need to develop measures to identify patients with insufficient protection."

The examined patients, aged 4 to 60 years, were divided into groups according to the age periodization of a person. Identification of general and specific IgE antibodies was carried out using modern methods of laboratory diagnosis of the immunological profile. Linked Immunosorbent Assay options such as Chemiluminescence Immunoassay (CLIA) and Immunoblotting were used. The obtained results indicate a widespread sensitization of Bishkek population to pollen allergens, sensitization to house dust mite allergens is more pronounced in the form of a polyvalent allergy. There is also a tendency to increase the prevalence of allergic diseases among the country’s child population. Pollinosis occupy a leading place among allergic diseases in the country due to the fact that weeds prevail in the city’s natural vegetation, which are highly allergenic. Data on the incidence of allergic diseases in Kyrgyzstan, as well as abroad, do not reflect the true spread of allergies, because like most patients with mild forms of allergic diseases do not go to the doctor. Therefore, the early detection, prevention and treatment of allergic diseases is one of the most important issues of modern medicine and biology. It is necessary to create annual flowering calendars of allergenic plants. Round the clock biomonitoring of the air to monitor pollen and air disputes is necessary to inform patients with hay fever. Preventive measures for patients with sensitization to house dust mite allergens include the prevention of mass reproduction of mites, namely the reduction of dust and humidity in rooms."

In Japan, TBE incidence is increasing and TBEV distributions are reported in wide areas, specifically in Hokkaido. However, an extensive epidemiological survey regarding TBEV has not been conducted yet. In this study, we conducted a retrospective study of the prevalence of antibodies against TBEV in patients with neurological disorders and healthy populations in a TBEV-endemic area in Hokkaido. Among 2000 patients, three patients with inflammatory diseases in the CNS had TBEV-specific IgM antibodies and neutralizing antibodies. The other four patients diagnosed clinically with other neurological diseases were positive for TBEV-specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies, indicating previous TBEV infection. In a total of 246 healthy residents in a TBEV-endemic region, one resident had TBEV-specific antibodies. These results demonstrated undiagnosed TBEV infections in Japan. Further surveys are required to reveal the actual epidemiological risk of TBE and to consider preventive measures, such as a vaccine program, for the control of TBE in Japan."

		"abstract": "Background: Impact of climate change on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle in a given region depends on how the region-specific climate change patterns influence tick population development processes and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission dynamics involving both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes. Predicting the transmission risk of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with projected climate conditions is essential for planning public health interventions including vaccination programs to mitigate the TBE incidence in the inhabitants and travelers. We have previously developed and validated a mathematical model for retroactive analysis of weather fluctuation on TBE prevalence in Hungary, and we aim to show in this research that this model provides an effective tool for projecting TBEV transmission risk in the enzootic cycle. Methods: Using the established model of TBEV transmission and the climate predictions of the Vas county in western Hungary in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, we quantify the risk of TBEV transmission using a series of summative indices - the basic reproduction number, the duration of infestation, the stage-specific tick densities, and the accumulated (tick) infections due to co-feeding transmission. We also measure the significance of co-feeding transmission by observing the cumulative number of new transmissions through the non-systemic transmission route. Results: The transmission potential and the risk in the study site are expected to increase along with the increase of the temperature in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. This increase will be facilitated by the expected extension of the tick questing season and the increase of the numbers of susceptible ticks (larval and nymphal) and the number of infected nymphal ticks co-feeding on the same hosts, leading to compounded increase of infections through the non-systemic transmission. Conclusions: The developed mathematical model provides an effective tool for predicting TBE prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle, by integrating climate projection with emerging knowledge about the region-specific tick ecological and pathogen enzootic processes (through model parametrization fitting to historical data). Model projects increasing co-feeding transmission and prevalence of TBEV in a recognized TBE endemic region, so human risk of TBEV infection is likely increasing unless public health interventions are enhanced."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infections have been the cause of threatening outbreaks for many years. Apart from several physical and chemical methods to prevent tick bites, active vaccination of people highly exposed to infection is still the most important strategy of prevention. However, in some subjects, the lack of or low response to TBEV antigens is observed. The aim of the current study was to assess the prevalence of seronegative rate for anti-TBEV antibodies and the risk factors for waning immunity. Materials and Methods: 2315 at least primary vaccinated subjects from the high risk group for TBEV infections participated in this study. A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was used for the assessment of anti-TBEV IgG serum level. Results: Data showed that 86.2% of subjects who underwent vaccination were positive for anti-TBEV antibodies within 5 years. As much as 13.8% of subjects that underwent primary or primary and booster vaccination were barely protected after vaccination. Women and subjects under 60 years underwent more effective protection but sex and older age was not a risk factor for being a subject of waning immunity. A logistic regression showed that both a longer time since the vaccination and a lower number of booster doses constantly increased the chance of lost anti-TBEV antibodies. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the vaccination schedule should be reevaluated. The extension of the interval of booster immunization is risky and all subjects should be surrounded by care consisting of more frequent monitoring of serum antibodies by personalized schedule to adjust the frequency of subsequent doses of booster vaccination."

		"abstract": "The analysis of the activity of natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the Far Eastern Federal District (Primorsky and Khabarovsk Territories, the Jewish Autonomous and Amur Regions), represented by a single Sikhote-Alin focal region was performed. Endemic territories of China, Korea, Japan are adjacent to this focal region. In the last decade the decrease of the infection rate in ixodid ticks and the morbidity of TBE compared to the 1990s was observed. Data on the infection rates in ixodid ticks based on ELISA, PCR and TBEV isolation are often discrepant. Active circulation of TBEV that involved dominant and less significant species of ixodid ticks and mouse-like rodents has been demonstrated since 1952 in China, since the 1990s in Japan and since 2011 in South Korea. The circulation of TBEV strains of the Far Eastern subtype was determined in all these territories. The exception was 7 strains isolated in South Korea, which appeared to be the European subtype based on the results of molecular genetic analysis. Two new strains of TBEV from the organs of wild rodents Marmota himalayana were isolated in 2017 in the territories of previously unknown natural foci in the Tien Shan, China. The genetic divergence of these strains from three TBEV subtypes allowed us to establish the existance of a new Himalayan TBEV subtype (Him-TBEV), which, according to the authors, has been \"hidden\" for hundreds of years. One can also speculate the processes of emergence of new TBEV subtypes The most complete picture of the Far Eastern population of TBEV was obtained in the last decade of the twentieth century, which served as the basis and impetus for the study and comparative analysis of the differences in numerous strains of TBEV isolated on the territory of the Eurasian continent."

		"abstract": "Ticks are widely distributed blood-sucking ectoparasites and vectors for numerous zoonotic pathogens that cause infectious diseases in humans and animals. The increase in the incidence of tick-borne diseases (TBD) is partially associated with climatic changes, such as shorter and warmer winters, prolonged growing seasons, and also with increasing urbanisation. In recent decades, a rising number of established populations of medically important ticks have been reported in urban and suburban areas such as city parks or suburban forests over many regions in Europe. The transformation of natural ecosystems into urban areas becomes actual significant problem because it could affect the circulation of tick-borne pathogens and increase the risk of infection for humans and domestic animals. Tick-borne pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi s. l., Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, and Babesia spp., have been detected in urban tick populations in Europe. Such places as parks, leisure-time areas, green spaces, and gardens become endemic zones of tick-borne pathogens. This review describes the investigations on the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in urbanised areas conducted in Europe during the last fifteen years (2005–2020)."

Seroconversion without signs of clinical disease is common in dogs and most of the cases previously described have been tentatively diagnosed by combining neurologic signs with serum antibody titres. Here, the first Scandinavian RT-qPCR-confirmed clinical case of TBE in a dog is reported. Case presentation: A 4-year old castrated male Pointer Labrador cross was presented with acute-onset ataxia. During hospitalisation, the dog developed seizures. Despite aggressive treatment with steroids, antimicrobials and sedation/anaesthesia, there was continued deterioration during the following 24 h after admission and the dog was euthanised and submitted for necropsy. Histopathological changes in the brain were consistent with lymphoplasmacytic and histiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis. RT-qPCR examination of the brain was positive for TBEV, confirming infection. Conclusions: Meningoencephalomyelitis caused by TBEV should be a diagnostic consideration in dogs presenting with clinical signs of central nervous system disease such as acute-onset ataxia and seizures in areas where TBEV-positive ticks are endemic. Clinical TBE may be underdiagnosed in dogs due to lack of specific testing."

		"abstract": "During the past decade, vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been continuously spreading in Europe, including Lithuania. VBDs are caused by bacteria, parasites, or viruses transmitted by the bite of hematophagous arthropods (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are a growing global threat. Since the majority of these diseases have a zoonotic potential, their management requires a multidisciplinary approach. Global warming and simplified rules for travelling with animal companions provide ideal conditions for the circulation and spreading of vector-borne pathogens in non-endemic geographical regions. Information on CVBD agents at the local and regional levels allows veterinarians to better recognize the pathogens that can affect dogs, thus facilitating diagnosis and treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and co-infection of mosquito- and tick-borne pathogens in domestic dogs using molecular DNA analysis methods. Blood samples were collected from dogs presented at different veterinary clinics in six regions of Lithuania. A total of 100 blood samples from dogs suspected for canine babesiosis were screened for the presence of tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp., Babesia canis and mosquito-borne pathogens Dirofilaria spp. Results of real-time PCR analysis demonstrated the presence of D. repens in 23.0%, A. phagocytophilum in 35.0%, Babesia spp. in 81.0%, and Borrelia spp. in 19.0% of examined dogs. Double, triple, or even quadruple co-infections were detected. The present study is the first investigation of multiple vector-borne pathogens in dogs from Lithuania using molecular detection methods. Our findings demonstrate a high infection rate of vector-borne pathogens in dogs and suggest that co-infections with anaplasmosis, borreliosis, babesiosis, and dirofilariosis in dogs are expected in Lithuania."

It might take several clinical courses such as: meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis. The aim this study was to compare the YKL-40 concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with different clinical presentations of TBE and patients with excluded meningitis (control group). Methods The concentration of YKL-40 in CSF was determined using Fujirebio tests (Ghent, Belgium) in 32 patients with TBE: group I—patients with meningoencephalitis (n = 16); group II—patients with meningitis (n = 16). The control group (CG) consisted of 17 patients in whom inflammatory process in central nervous system was excluded. Results The concentration of YKL-40 was significantly higher in encephalitis group than in CG after 7 days from the last dose of treatment. The concentration in patients with neuroinflammation had significantly different concentration of YKL-40 compared to patients with no neuroinflammation control groups. ROC curve analysis indicates that: CSF YKL-40 concentration at cut off 783.87 differentiated TBE patients from CG with 100% specificity and 70% sensitivity and CSF YKL-40 concentration at cut off 980.11 differentiated meningitis from meningoencephalitis with 87.5% specificity and 62.5% sensitivity. Conclusions YKL-40 takes part in TBE pathogenesis, its concentration is the highest at the early stage of Central Nervous System involvement and decreases in the convalescent period. As YKL-40 is significantly higher in meningitis than in meningoencephalitis, it might be used as biomarker in differentiation of these clinical forms of TBE."

At the same time, the speed of nucleotide sequences analysis is increasing, thereby creating a mismatch between the number of decoded genomes and the investigated 3D protein structures that are encoded by these sequences. Also, homology modeling is the easiest and fastest way to obtain the model of the desired protein.

The purpose of this work is to identify the inhibitory activity of eprosartan medication in comparison with ribavirin in vitro and in vivo in relation to tick-borne encephalitis virus. The value of the half the maximum cytotoxic concentration (CC50) for eprosartan (8.8±1.2 mg/ml) and ribavirin (1.074±0.16 mg/ml) was established. To obtain a medium effective virus-inhibiting concentration (IC50) of the medications, EIA data were used. Using nonlinear regression analysis of the percentage of antigen positive samples, IC50 values of the studied substances were obtained, which for eprosartan was 0.64±0.23 mg/ml in the treatment regimen. The selective index (SI) or chemotherapeutic index (CTI) was 13.7. The IC50 of ribavirin was 0.0067±0.0015 mg/ml, SI or CTI was 160. The suppression of viral reproduction 2.0 log TCID50 occurred in PEK cell culture under the influence of eprosartan at concentrations of 1.2–3.0 mg/ml (treatment regimen), under the influence of ribavirin — 0.2 mg/ml (prophylactic regimen) and 0.2–0.0125 mg/ml (treatment regimen). Samples with eprosartan (1.5 and 0.6 mg/ml) showed an increase in survival of mice by 50% and 20% compared with the virus control group in the in vivo model and, accordingly, an increase in average life expectancy of 5.2 and 2.1 days. Samples with ribavirin (0.05 and 0.025 mg/ml) increased the survival of mice by 60% and 40% and, accordingly, increased the life expectancy by 7.3 and 4.8 days. The data obtained allow recommending eprosartan as an active agent against tick-borne encephalitis virus along with ribavirin."

		"abstract": "Vaccination remains the only way to prevent tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). All TBE vaccines are based on strains of the Far Eastern and European subtypes of TBE virus. Currently, the Siberian subtype of the virus, which differs from the vaccine strains, accounts for 80–100% of the genetic population of TBE virus in most of Russia. The proportion of TBE vaccinated patients among those infected was different from year to year in Russia, e.g. 3.9% in 2012 and 1.5% in 2018, there were also some fatal cases registered among vaccinated patients. In this regard, evaluation of the effectiveness of vaccination against various genetic subtypes of TBE is a promising area of research. The purpose of this study was to summarise the results of studies investigating effectiveness of specific prevention of TBE as regards various genetic subtypes of the virus. The paper analyses data on the effectiveness of TBE vaccination in experimental settings and in real life. It was demonstrated that the use of vaccines for prevention of TBE is effective, provided the vaccination coverage is not less than 80%. The paper cites the data from a long-term study of the stability and protective activity of vaccine immunity against TBE virus strains isolated in highly endemic territories. It was established that TBE vaccines have high immunogenic activity and contribute to the production of stable protective antibodies against the strains of the three genetic subtypes of the virus. Protective efficacy of vaccination depends on the number of vaccinations received, the vaccination scheme, gender and age of those vaccinated. The paper concludes by saying that further studies are needed to assess TBE vaccine efficacy in order to improve vaccination tactics, to better understand causes of morbidity and mortality among vaccinated individuals."

Despite being the subject of intermittent studies over the past few decades, comprehensive information on the epidemiology and control of TTBDis is lacking. Herein, we have systematically reviewed the current knowledge on TTBDis of small ruminants in Pakistan. Critical appraisal of the selected 71 articles published between 1947 to 2020 revealed that morphological examination had been the most widely used method for the identification of TTBDis in Pakistan. Tick fauna comprise at least 40 species, mainly belonging to Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus. The prevalence of ticks is the highest in summer (June–September) and it is also higher in goats than sheep. Anaplasma, Babesia and Theileria spp. are the major tick-borne pathogens (TBPs), and their prevalence is usually higher in sheep than goats. Spatio-temporal distribution, genetic diversity and control of ticks and TBPs of small ruminants as well as the competence of tick vectors for various TBPs remain to be explored. Therefore, coordinated and focused investigations are required to fill knowledge gaps in these areas to maximise the health, production and welfare of small ruminants and minimise economic losses associated with TTBDis in Pakistan."

Departing from the theory on emotional appraisal coming from psychology, this study investigates which factors that modulate worry and fear associated with the presence of ticks among livestock owners of sheep and/or cattle. Methods: Survey data from 775 livestock owners in Norway were analysed by hierarchical multiple regression analysis with an index of fear of tick-borne diseases among livestock as the outcome variable. Results: Twenty-nine per cent of the livestock owners reported worry and fear of tick-borne diseases among their livestock. The model explained 35% of the variance in worry and fear. There was a weak association between estimated incidences of tick-borne diseases in livestock and livestock owners’ worry and fear. Whereas previous personal experience of ticks and tick-borne diseases in livestock, and the livestock owners’ appraisals of the situation were more strongly associated with relatively stronger feelings of worry and fear. Conclusions: Livestock owners’ worry and fear of tick-borne diseases in livestock can partly be understood as their appraisals of perceived personal relevance of the presence of ticks, its potential negative implications for their daily life at large, and what potential they have to cope by different strategies to adapt or adjust to the situation."

In this study, we highlight the potential role of dogs and cats taken for tourist trips or imported animals in the spread of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. The Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick, which is a vector of numerous pathogens causing diseases in animals and humans, is imported most frequently from endemic areas to many European countries. Additionally, alien tick species with high epizootic and epidemiological importance can be imported on dogs from other continents. Companion animals play an even greater role in the spread of autochthonous tick species and transmission of tick pathogens to other animals and humans. Although the veterinary and medical effects of the parasitism of ticks carried by companion animals travelling with owners or imported animals are poorly assessed, these animals seem to play a role in the rapid spread of tick-borne diseases. Development of strategies for protection of the health of companion animals in different geographic regions should take into account the potential emergence of unknown animal tick-borne diseases that can be transmitted by imported ticks."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, is one of the most important tick-transmitted viruses in Europe and Asia. Being a neurotropic virus, TBEV causes infection of the central nervous system, leading to various (permanent) neurological disorders summarized as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). The incidence of TBE cases has increased due to the expansion of TBEV and its vectors. Since antiviral treatment is lacking, vaccination against TBEV is the most important protective measure. However, vaccination coverage is relatively low and immunogenicity of the currently available vaccines is limited, which may account for the vaccine failures that are observed. Understanding the TBEV-specific correlates of protection is of pivotal importance for developing novel and improved TBEV vaccines. For affording robust protection against infection and development of TBE, vaccines should induce both humoral and cellular immunity. In this review, the adaptive immunity induced upon TBEV infection and vaccination as well as novel approaches to produce improved TBEV vaccines are discussed."

RNA/DNA pathogens was determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TBEV antigen by ELISA. The presence in ticks of pathogens of the following diseases was detected: Lyme borreliosis (35.3%), tick-borne replasing fever (11.3%), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (2.6%), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (2.4%), tick-borne encephalitis (1.8%), tick-borne ricketsiosis (1.0%). As agents of mono-infections, the virus of TBE, ehrlichia, anaplasma and rickettsia in ticks occurred less frequently than in combination with other pathogens. A high frequency of occurrence B. burgdorferi s.l. in mono-infection detected (58.7%). B. miyamotoi has met evenly at ticks with mono- and mixed infections. Total mixed infection of ticks was 23.1%.

Variants of double combinations (95.5 % of cases from all mixed infections) were as follows: B. burgdorferi s. l. + A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi s.l. + E. chaffeensis / E. muris, B. burgdorferi s.l. + TBEV, B. burgdorferi s.l. + R. heilongjiangensis, B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi. The most frequent combination was B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi (37.8% of all mixed infections). In triple infection of B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + TBEV and B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + B. miyamotoi, the frequency of occurrence for each combination was 2.2%. Given the above, a complex laboratory diagnosis of tick-borne infections in individuals who have been bitten by a tick is necessary, including the detection of all pathogens common in focal areas."

In this study, all tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) E gene sequences available in GenBank as of June 2019 with known date of isolation (n = 551) were analyzed. Simulation studies showed that a sample bias could significantly affect earlier studies, because small TBEV datasets (n = 50) produced non-overlapping intervals for evolutionary rate estimates. An apparent lack of a temporal signal in TBEV, in general, was found, precluding molecular clock analysis of all TBEV subtypes in one dataset. Within all subtypes and most of the smaller groups in these subtypes, there was evidence of many medium- and long-distance virus transfers. These multiple random events may play a key role in the virus spreading. For some groups, virus diversity within one territory was similar to diversity over the whole geographic range. This is best exemplified by the virus diversity observed in Switzerland or Czech Republic. These two countries yielded most of the known European subtype Eu3 subgroup sequences, and the diversity of viruses found within each of these small countries is comparable to that of the whole Eu3 subgroup, which is prevalent all over Central and Eastern Europe. Most of the deep tree nodes within all three established TBEV subtypes dated less than 300 years back. This could be explained by the recent emergence of most of the known TBEV diversity. Results of bioinformatics analysis presented here, together with multiple field findings, suggest that TBEV may be regarded as an emerging disease."

These variants exhibited distinct plaque sizes and virulence in a mouse model. Comparing the full-genome sequences of all variants, several nucleotide changes were identified in different genomic regions. Furthermore, different sequential variants were revealed to co-exist within one sample as quasispecies. Interestingly, the above-mentioned nucleotide changes found within the whole genome sequences of the new variants were present alongside the nucleotide sequence of the parental strain, which was represented as a minority quasispecies. These observations further imply that TBEV exists as a heterogeneous population that contains virus variants pre-adapted to reproduction in different environments, probably enabling virus survival in ticks and mammals."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), which causes central nervous system infections, is a major health problem in Europe and Asia. This virus is transmitted mainly via the bite of a tick. However, an infection may also occur as a result of consuming raw milk. In 2018, a total of 3 092 cases of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) were reported in EU countries. In recent years, TBE has emerged in previously unaffected regions; thus, new endemic areas have been identified. Most cases of TBE occur in spring and autumn, which correlates with increased tick activity. TBE is found in all age groups, including infants. The clinical presentation of TBE varies, but the severity of the infection and risk of complications increase with age. Post-encephalitic syndrome, which affects up to 50% of infected individuals, significantly reduces quality of life. Currently, there is no effective treatment for TBE, and supportive management is used in the acute phase of the disease. Therefore, anti-TBE immunization and the avoidance of tick bites are of key importance in preventing this infection."

The dynamics of morbidity of ТВЕ in the population characterized by complex cyclic, depending on many external variables. Retrospective analysis of the long-term dynamics (2007–2019) of the incidence of ТВЕ in regions of the UFD, taking into account the number of tick affected people was presented. The chances of getting sick in tick affected peoples to quantify the effect of predictors on TBE incidence were calculated. Standard apparatus of the theory of generalized linear models – logit-regression was used. It was established that the regions of the UFD characterized by a similar dynamics in the odds ratio indicator, therefore, TBE incidence with alternating ups and downs with a trend towards a decrease in the chance of TBE getting sick in tick affected people from 2007 to 2019. On average, over 13 years, the chances of developing TBE are statistically significantly different in the studied regions of the UFD, which can be explained by the influence of many risk factors and their combinations on the TBE incidence."

In the United States of America, the vast majority of Aedes-borne infections are imported from endemic regions by travelers, who can become new sources of mosquito infection once they are back in the country if the exposed population is susceptible to the disease, and if suitable environmental conditions for the mosquitoes and the virus are present. Since the susceptibility of the human population can be determined via periodic monitoring campaigns, environmental suitability for presence of mosquitoes and viruses becomes one of the most important pieces of information for decision makers in the health sector. Here, we develop a subseasonal to seasonal monitoring and forecasting system for environmental suitability of transmission of Aedes-borne diseases for the US, Central America, the Caribbean and northern South America, using multiple calibrated ento-epidemiological models, climate models, and quality-controlled temperature observations. We show that the predictive skill of this new system is higher than that of any of the individual models, and illustrate how a combination of deterministic and probabilistic forecasts can inform key prevention and control strategies.&lt;/p&gt;"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement ‘I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves ‘outdoorsy’, results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

At the completion of therapy, all three patients’ major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25–30 months. A retrospective chart review of 37 additional patients undergoing DDD CT therapy (40 patients in total) was also performed, which demonstrated tick-borne symptom improvements in 98% of patients, with 45% remaining in remission for 1 year or longer. In conclusion, double-dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

The scale of such lockdowns is unprecedented, and while some effects of lockdowns are readily apparent, it is less clear what effects they may have on outbreaks of serious communicable diseases. We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simulations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by different mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies."

		"abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is at the forefront of global health issues and contributes to myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. Lyme disease (LD), spread by ticks of the genus Ixodes, is a contributing factor to the potential development of abnormalities in the heart. The bacterial agents Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi are known to cause a variety of infections and we speculate that infection with Borrelia is a contributing factor to cardiac abnormalities, especially Lyme carditis (LC). Patients who demonstrate undiagnosed cardiac abnormalities should be monitored for potential infection with Lyme disease and, consequently LC. Lyme carditis affects up to 10% of patients that have been diagnosed with LD and additionally, it indiscriminately manifests across a range of ages, from the pediatric populace to the elderly. Given the grave cardiac abnormalities that can arise from LC and the propensity for misdiagnosis, it is critical that medical professionals be aware of the cardiovascular signs and symptoms of Atrioventricular Heart Block (AHB). AHB can lead to third degree heart block in patients and potentially lead to death if left not properly diagnosed and treated. Essential treatments are readily available for Lyme carditis, which include a range of antibiotics and surgical procedures. In this review, we highlight not only the true nature of Lyme disease, but more importantly, the positive correlation between LD and a variety of undiagnosed heart complications."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden."

Lyme optic neuritis  is a rare ocular manifestation of Lyme Disease. We report a case of a 13-year-old male patient, previously healthy, with decreased central visual acuity on his both eyes . On examination, best-corrected visual acuity on both eyes was 0,3 LogMar. Anterior segment biomicroscopy showed no inflammatory signs and the intraocular pressure was normal. A fundus examination performed under mydriasis revealed a swollen optic disk on both eyes confirmed by fluorescein angiography. The cerebrospinal fluid examination and Lyme Disease blood findings were positive. The diagnosis of Lyme disease-related optic neuritis was made. Treated with Ceftriaxone and Doxicycline, there was a vision recovery. We can state that isolated bilateral optic neuritis is uncommon and exceptional especially in children during Lyme disease."

Critical questions about when and why patients respond to treatment or stay ill, what kinds of treatments are effective, and even how to properly diagnose the disease remain largely unanswered. We investigate these questions by applying machine learning techniques to a large scale Lyme disease patient registry, MyLymeData, developed by the nonprofit LymeDisease.org. We apply various machine learning methods in order to measure the effect of individual features in predicting participants’ answers to the Global Rating of Change (GROC) survey questions that assess the self-reported degree to which their condition improved, worsened, or remained unchanged following antibiotic treatment. We use basic linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks, entropy-based decision tree models, and k-nearest neighbors approaches. We first analyze the general performance of the model and then identify the most important features for predicting participant answers to GROC. After we identify the “key” features, we separate them from the dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of these features at identifying GROC. In doing so, we highlight possible directions for future study both mathematically and clinically."

		"abstract": "Over the past four decades, Lyme disease has remained a virulent and pervasive illness, persisting throughout North America and many other regions of the world. Recent increases in illness in many countries has sparked a renewed interest in improved Lyme diagnostics. While current standards of diagnosis are acceptable for the late stages of the disease, it remains difficult to accurately diagnose early forms of the illness. In addition, current diagnostic methods tend to be relatively expensive and require a large degree of laboratory-based analysis. Biosensors represent the fusion of biological materials with chemical techniques to provide simple, inexpensive alternatives to traditional diagnostic methods. Lyme disease biosensors have the potential to better diagnose early stages of the illness and provide possible patients with an inexpensive, commercially available test. This review examines the current state of Lyme disease biosensing, with a focus on previous biosensor development and essential future considerations."

Despite being prevalent in many regions of the world, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the disease, and consensus on the most appropriate and effective means of treating the illness remains to be achieved. Recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), the primary guidelines followed by health care professionals treating Lyme disease, diverge in many of their key recommendations, including treatment duration. Given this lack of consensus, surprisingly little research has been conducted on patient outcomes following different treatment approaches. In this study, patient outcomes were evaluated from a cohort of 210 Canadian Lyme disease patients seeking treatment at one US Lyme disease clinic following a treatment regimen conforming to the ILADS treatment guidelines. It was found that the majority of Lyme disease patients at the clinic responded positively to treatment and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in symptoms was observed over time. This study, along with related studies, may help to guide physicians to provide their patients with the most effective care."

Since the severity of symptoms and probability of recurrence significantly increases as time progresses, there is a need to find a new alternative diagnostic system for Early Lyme disease. Many solutions to this problem are considered within this document, most notably: polymerase chain reaction detection, metabolic biosignature testing, and OspC targeting serological testing. After further analysis, metabolic biosignature testing is considered the best alternative since it yields the highest diagnosis sensitivity with around 89% accuracy. Additionally, metabolic biosignature testing is both cost effective and widely applicable since it does not require the Erythema migran rash to be used. Once in place, Lyme disease will be able to be diagnosed quicker, thus reducing the number of cases of Chronic Lyme disease which significantly reduces personal quality of life and is often costly.

This tick-borne zoonosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and, worldwide, presents with at least 20 different types of rashes. Certain cutaneous rashes are inherently interconnected to various stages of Lyme disease. In this study, five Canadian Lyme disease patients from a multi-age range presented various phases of the acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) rash. In each case of ACA, the underlying etiological pathogen was the Lyme disease spirochete. Although ACA rashes are normally found on the lower extremities, this study illustrates that ACA rashes are not directly correlated with a tick bite, geographic area, age, Bbsl genospecies, exercise, or any given surface area of the body. Case 4 provides confirmation for an ACA rash and gestational Lyme disease. One patient (Case 5) puts forth a Bbsl and Bartonella sp. co-infection with a complex ACA rash. This study documents ACA rashes on Lyme disease patients for the first time in Canada."

The aim of this article is to present the current methods of Lyme disease diagnosis and its future perspectives. A serological test is often the first step in supporting clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Recently, a new generation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays has been created. These assays use recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides in their antigenic spectrum. It is postulated that these tests may replace the classic immunoblot as the second step in the Lyme disease diagnostic protocol. Direct detection methods based on bacterial culture techniques or using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have inadequate sensitivity, which prevents their widespread use in clinical practice. Recently, a number of other tools have been developed that are of supportive importance. Among them, measuring of the CXCL13 chemokine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has the potential to become a routine procedure in the diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Future diagnostic strategies of Lyme disease might include: innovative immunological tests using new antigens, combining serology with direct methods in order to increase sensitivity, standardization of selected unconventional tests, identification of host response biochemical metabolic markers or linking clinical symptoms reported by patients with appropriate test panels. In the absence a vaccine which protects against the disease, the preventive recommendations given to parents to prevent tick bites in children remain valid."

		"abstract": "Infections with spirochetes (Borelia burgdoferi) occur through contact with ticks (Ixodes ricinus) found in forests, meadows, lawns, in bushes, most often from May to September. The risk of developing Lyme disease after a single tick bite does not exceed 1%. Clinically overt disease develops usually after 0.3-1.4% bites. Lyme disease may affect many organs and is chronic. Symptoms may include skin, eyes, nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive and urogenital system. Cardiovascular system involvement occurs, according to va­rious reports, in 0.5 to 10% of cases. Men are sick more often than women, young patients predominate, < 50 years old. The clinical onset is acute and atrioventricular conduction disturbances are most commonly diagnosed (80-90% of cases). Atrioventricular blocks: first (>70%), second (30%) and third (70%) degree may occur. There are also descriptions of cardiac arrhythmias – both supraventricular and ventricular – as well as cases of prolonged QT interval, especially in children. Identification of patients who are more likely to have a third degree atrioventricular block in Lyme disease is critical to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. In most patients, antibiotic treatment helps to avoid the use of permanent cardiac pacing, but 20-50% of patients may need temporary pacing. In patients quickly, correctly diagnosed and treated – the prognosis is good."

The aim of this review was to summarize published data on clinical and economic outcomes associated with LD. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify all studies of LD that incorporate both clinical outcomes and costs. Included studies were described and categorized based on costs consistent with best practices used in economic evaluation. Results: The most frequent costs identified focused on formal health costs and productivity losses were the most common costs identified outside of the health system. Travel and informal care costs were less frequently reported. Clinical and economic outcomes of LD are primarily studied through economic models or observational analyses and focus on formal health care. Conclusions: This review provides and overview of existing evidence and recommendations for future economic analyses in LD."

		"abstract": "Nowadays Lyme disease (systemic tick-borne borreliosis, Lyme borreliosis) remains one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases with inoculable transmission mechanism, with ixodid ticks as carriers and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato as the causative agent. The disease is characterized by a staged course and severe damage to various organs and systems. In Ukraine, the natural foci of this disease are almost throughout the country. Sumy region occupies a leading place in terms of morbidity. In Ukraine, the most affected regions are Kyiv (29.00 cases per 100 thousand population), Cherkasy (25.4), Vinnytsia (23.9), Sumy (25.89) regions, and Kyiv city (22.54). Lyme disease is mainly registered in the spring-autumn period, this may be due to increased visits to recreation areas and seasonal activity of ticks (May–June, September–October). Scientific data about etiology, epidemiology, clinical course, diagnostics, therapy, and disease preventive measures were analyzed. It was found that B. burgdorferi s. l. is one of the most widespread agents with inoculable transmission mechanism on the European continent, including Ukraine. There is no single worldwide conception concerning preventive measures, diagnostics, and treatment, which necessitates the further study of this problem. Detection of antibodies to B. Burgdorferi s. l. in the human blood serum is not evidence of infection but testifies the previous contact with these pathogens and the presence of high risk of Lyme disease development. To improve the epidemiologic situation concerning Lyme disease it is required to study sites of the disease in Ukraine more thoroughly, to improve epidemiological surveillance system by creating disease spread map for diseases which are transferred by ticks in Sumy region, to plan a series of anti-epidemic and preventive measures, which are of practical use for population, to prevent asymptomatic disease course and chronization."

Antibody detection is the most frequently used laboratory test, favoring a two-step serodiagnostic algorithm; immunoenzymatic detection of antibodies to C6 has been shown to perform similarly to a standard two-step workflow. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of the C6 Lyme ELISA kit compared to a standard two-step algorithm in three laboratories located in the northeastern region of Italy which cater to areas with different LD epidemiology. A total of 804 samples were tested, of which 695 gave concordant results between C6 testing and routine workflow (564 negative, 131 positive). Wherever available, clinical presentation and additional laboratory tests were analyzed to solve discrepancies. The C6 based method showed a good concordance with the standard two-step algorithm (Cohen’s κ = 0.619), however, the distribution of discrepancies seems to point towards a slightly lower specificity of C6 testing, which is supported by literature and could impact on patient management. The C6 ELISA, therefore, is not an ideal stand-alone test; however, if integrated into a two-step algorithm, it might play a part in achieving a sensitive, specific laboratory diagnosis of LD."

Urbanization, though it reflects development, is one crucial factor affecting the competence of existing vectors in certain geographic area, or allow for introducing and/or increasing the vectorial capacity of subsidiary vectors. Developing countries, challenging areas with political constrains and those affected by natural disasters are the most threatened areas in terms of VBD continuous change. Vector control strategies are mainly based on having an up-to-date complete knowledge of the spatial and temporal composition of disease vectors. Flexible control and planning decisions, and evidence-based interventions may help containing changes in VBD status due to the rapid urbanization."

Therefore some infections/infestations, some of zoonotic concern, have been recorded in geographic areas where they were unexpected. In Europe, arthropods (e.g. ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and sand flies) and the pathogens that they transmit are in general considered to be more frequent in the Mediterranean Basin. Nonetheless, a possible occurrence in other regions should not be a priori excluded, given that travels of animals (to or imported from endemic areas), movements of goods and global warming all may foster the introduction of vectors and/or transmitted pathogens in previously free areas. This could also be the case in the UK, which, because of its territorial characteristics as an island area in north-western Europe, is traditionally considered at minor risk of VBDs. Given the growing increase of movements and travels of pets, and changes in the phenology of many arthropod vectors, it is crucial that veterinary practitioners are aware of and prepared to diagnose, treat and control a series of unexpected diseases."

The scale of such lockdowns is unprecedented, and while some effects of lockdowns are readily apparent, it is less clear what effects they may have on outbreaks of serious communica-ble diseases. We examine the impact of these lockdowns on outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases. Using an agent-based model and simu-lations, we find that the risk and severity of such outbreaks is much greater under lockdown conditions, with the number of infected people doubling in some cases. This increase in number of cases varies by dif- ferent mosquito-borne diseases, and is significantly higher for diseases spread by day-biting mosquitoes. We analysed various intervention strategies and found that during lockdowns, decentralised strategies such as insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying are more effective than centralised strategies."

Ft includes four subspecies, of which two are the etiologic agents of tularemia: Ft subsp. tularensis (Ftt) and Ft subsp. holarctica (Fth), mainly distributed in North America and the whole northern hemisphere, respectively. Several routes of human infection with these bacteria exist, notably through bites of Ixodidae ticks. However, mosquitoes represent the main vectors of Fth in Scandinavia, where large tularemia outbreaks have occurred, usually during the warm season. The mechanisms making mosquitoes vectors of Fth are still unclear. This review covers the inventory of research work and epidemiological data linking tularemia to mosquitoes in Scandinavia and highlights the gaps in understanding mosquitoes and Ft interactions."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background Ticks and tick-borne diseases are increasingly recognized as a cause of disease in dogs worldwide. The epidemiology of ticks and tick-transmitted protozoa and bacteria has changed due to the spread of ticks to urban and peri-urban areas and the movement of infected animals, posing new risks for animals and humans. This countrywide study reports information on distribution and prevalence of pathogens in ticks collected from privately-owned dogs in Italy. We analyzed 2681 Ixodidae ticks, collected from 1454 pet dogs from Italy. Specific PCR protocols were used to detect i) Piroplasms of the genera Babesia and Theileria , ii) Gram-negative cocci of the family Anaplasmataceae and iii) Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Sequencing of positive amplicons allowed for species identification. Results Babesia / Theileria spp. DNA was detected in 435 homogeneous tick-pools (Minimum Infection Rate (MIR) = 27.6%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 25.4-29.8%) with higher prevalence in Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus sanguneus group. The zoonotic B. venatorum was the most prevalent species (MIR = 7.5%; 95% CI = 6.3-9.0%). Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species were detected in 165 tick-pools (MIR = 10.5%; 95% CI = 9.3-11.8%) and specifically, A. phagocytophilum was identified with MIR = 5.1% (95% CI = 4.1-6.3%). Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and B. afzelii were detected with MIR = 0.4% (95% CI = 0.2-0.8%) and MIR = 0.3% (95% CI 0.1-0.7%) respectively. Conclusions Zoonotic pathogens B. venatorum and A. phagocytophilum were the most frequently detected in ticks collected from privately-owned dogs which might be used as markers of pathogens presence and distribution."

The Republic of Altai is one of the regions of the Siberian Federal District endemic for tick-borne encephalitis with high altitude mountain belts with characteristic landscape and climatic conditions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the epidemiological situation of tick-borne encephalitis in the Republic of Altai from 2000 to 2017. Material and methods. In conducting a retrospective epidemiological study, data from sanitary-epidemiological and medical services for 2000-2017 were used. Statistical data processing was carried out with the software “Statistica 12.0”, the construction and analysis of cartograms - with the software ArcGIS. Results. The average long-term incidence rate of this infection in the period from 2000 to 2017 amounted to 21.7 ± 0.76 0/0000, which is 2.2 times higher than the similar indexby for the SFO (10.1 ± 0.23 0/0000). The number of persons affected by tick infestation in the period from 2000 to 2017 increased 3.5 times from 517.7 ± 15.95 0/0000 to 1810.5 ± 28.62 0/0000, respectively (p <0.001). Ranking on the level of the average long-term incidence allowed identifying three groups of the potential risk of infection of the population. Discussion. The factor analysis revealed the presence of an inverse correlation between the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis and the levels of seroprophylaxis (r = -0.93), acaricidal treatments (r = -0.95), vaccination (r = -0.10). The calculated levels of these factors were determined according to the results of the construction of spatial models of their mutual influences, capable of reducing the number of cases in the region to 6 per year. Conclusion. An analysis of the epidemic situation based on factor analysis and spatial modeling of the mutual influence of factors made it possible to determine the necessary volumes of preventive measures to reduce the incidence of the population to a given level. Such a calculation may be applicable in an endemic region to ensure the medical and economic effectiveness of preventive measures."

		"abstract": "Abstract: The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people’s behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales."

The main objective of the present work included the epidemiologic analysis of the occurrence of tick-borne diseases at the Independent Public Health Care Facility in Bielsk Podlaski. Material and Methods. An analysis of medical documentation stored in the hospital’s IT database of patients hospitalized in 2016, 2017 and 2018 was performed. Sixty-six patients admitted to the Observation and Infectious Disease Ward diagnosed with tick-borne diseases, were qualified for the study. Results. Analysis of the data showed that Lyme disease was diagnosed most often. It affected mainly middle-aged and elderly men. The second most-often diagnosed illness was TBM characterized by its seasonality. No other ticktransmitted diseases were recorded. Although not all patients were aware of having been bitten by a tick, their symptoms allowed the diagnosis of tick-related illnesses. After treatment relevant to each ailment all patients were discharged in a good state of health. Conclusions. The completed retrospective analysis of the documentation of hospitalized patients shows consistency with the work of other authors both with respect to the frequency of tick-borne disease diagnoses and the most often reported symptoms. It also confirms an upward trend with respect to tick-borne disease hospitalizations. (JNNN 2020;9(2):51–58) Key Words: tick-borne diseases, epidemiology, various infectious, invasive diseases"

		"abstract": "This study investigated ticks and tick-borne microorganisms of small ruminants from five districts of the Federally Administered Tribal Area (FATA) of Pakistan. Morphological (n = 104) and molecular (n = 54) characterization of the ticks revealed the presence of six ixodid ticks: Rhipicephalus (Rh.) haemaphysaloides, Rh. microplus, Rh. turanicus, Haemaphysalis (Hs.) punctata, Hs. sulcata and Hyalomma anatolicum. Phylogenetic analyses of nucleotide sequence data for two mitochondrial (16S and cytochrome c oxidase 1) and one nuclear (second internal transcribed spacer) DNA regions provided strong support for the grouping of the six tick species identified in this study. Microfluidic real-time PCR, employing multiple pre-validated nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers, detected 11 potential pathogens and endosymbionts in 72.2% of the ticks (n = 54) tested. Rickettsia (R.) massiliae was the most common pathogen found (42.6% of ticks) followed by Theileria spp. (33.3%), Anaplasma (A.) ovis and R. slovaca (25.9% each). Anaplasma centrale, A. marginale, Ehrlichia spp., R. aeschlimannii, R. conorii and endosymbionts (Francisella- and Coxiella-like) were detected at much lower rates (1.9–22.2%) in ticks. Ticks from goats (83.9%) carried significantly higher microorganisms than those from sheep (56.5%). This study demonstrates that ticks of small ruminants from the FATA are carrying multiple microorganisms of veterinary and medical health significance and provides the basis for future investigations of ticks and tick-borne diseases of animals and humans in this and neighboring regions."

		"abstract": "Here, we provide an analysis on 1996–2016 St. Petersburg tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) epidemiological and ecological data. In particular, two main TBE transmission vectors were observed in St. Petersburg: Ixodes persulcatus Ixodes ricinus. TBE tick contamination was 0.61% as shown by ELISA and polymerase chain reaction data. It is found that number of subjects seeking for medical aid due to tick bites rises, whereas TBE incidence declines. In particular, a mean 1996–2002 vs. 2010–2016 tick-bite incidence rate increased from 141.9 up to 288.9, respectively. Despite that the Leningrad region is a major area for TBE spread, however, a risk of exposure to tick bites as well as TBE infection exists even in the city of St. Petersburg. In connection with this, around 1,000 subjects undergo tick bites within the city limits. Moreover, whereas a 1996–2002 mean TBE incidence rate was 1.66, it decreased in 2010–2016 down to 1.17. A peak TBE incidence was documented in St. Petersburg Kurortny, Pushkinsky and Primorsky districts. In addition, males vs. females suffered from TBE at higher frequency in Russian Federation, with its peak incidence rate being reported in children under 14 that differs St. Petersburg from the most of other regions in the Russian Federation. A seasonal distribution of TBE cases in St. Petersburg does not differ from that one for the remainder of Russian regions, which displays a spring-summer seasonality lasting from April to September. Of note, 1996–2016 St. Petersburg TBE mortality was 1.37%. A coverage of TBE vaccinated population tends to rise but still remains at low level (0.25–0.58%). Lack of reported TBE cases in occupationally threatened human cohorts evidences about efficient preventive measures. Detection of TBE virus-specific serum antibodies in 5.0% apparently healthy and unvaccinated residents in St. Petersburg significantly complements the official TBE recording data and provides a more accurate understanding of its actual spread."

This study was conducted to diagnose Anaplasma and Babesia infection using molecular techniques in imported Aberdeen Angus cattle imported from Uruguay to El-Kharga Oasis in New Valley, Egypt, and to investigate the effects of disease on some serum biochemical and oxidative stress parameters. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 31 cattle, 21 diseased and ten apparently normal, of varying ages and sex. The blood was used for the preparation of blood smears, polymerase chain reaction assay, and separation of serum for biochemical investigation. The experimental production farm at the Faculty of Agriculture, New Valley University, was infested with ticks and variable clinical manifestations during the period from December 2017 to March 2018. One calf died of a suspected blood parasite infection. Results: The blood film examination revealed infection by blood parasites in 21 samples. Anaplasma marginale and Babesia bovis were identified in 12 and 14 samples, respectively. A total of 14 samples were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to make these identifications. Biochemical parameters showed significantly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin (T. Bil), and urea in blood from parasite-infected female cattle and male calves compared with controls. Increased serum total protein, globulin, and creatinine were recorded only in infected female cattle. The blood glucose level was significantly decreased in infected female cattle and male calves compared with controls. Furthermore, albumin and albumin/globulin ratio was significantly reduced in the infected female cattle. Oxidative stress profiles of infected animals showed a significant increase in serum nitric oxide and malondialdehyde, and both total antioxidant capacity and reduced glutathione (GSH) were significantly reduced in comparison with control animals. Conclusion: The incidence of A. marginale and B. bovis infection is high in imported Aberdeen Angus cattle in New Valley Province. PCR methods provide a short-term assessment of disease. An extensive epidemiological survey, employing serology together with molecular genetic methods, monitoring of abundance and distribution of tick vectors, availability of vaccination programs, and tracking of animal transport is also needed for control of blood parasites."

		"abstract": "Introduction: In recent decades, the incidence of Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been increasing and posing a growing health problem because of the high costs to the healthcare system and society. The clinical manifestations are well studied but there is a lack of research analyzing the severity of the disease. Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze the epidemiology and clinical presentation of severe TBE, to identify the predictors for a severe disease course, and also predictors for meningoencephalomyelitic and severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic forms. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in the Center of Infectious Diseases and the Center of Neurology at Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos in the years 2005–2017 to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of TBE in adults. Results: 1040 patients were included in the study. A total of 152/1040 (14.6%) patients had a severe course. The highest proportion of severe cases, reaching 41.2%, was reported in the 70–79 year-old age group. A total of 36/152 (23.7%) severe patients presented meningoencephalomyelitis. Myelitic patients were older, were frequently infected in their living areas, and usually reported a monophasic disease course compared with severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic patients. Severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic patients, compared with non-severe meningoencephalitic/encephalitic, were older, less often noticed the tick bite, and often had a monophasic course. The sequelae on discharge were observed in 810/1000 (81%) of patients. Conclusions: The prognostic factors associated with a severe disease course and severe meningoencephalitic form are: older age, comorbidities, a monophasic course, a fever of 40˚C and above, CRP more than 30 mg/l, CSF protein more than 1 g/l, delayed immune response of TBEV IgG, pathological findings in CT. Age above 60 years, presence of CNS disease, bulbar syndrome, pleocytosis 500x10"

At the beginning of the 2000s, the Ixodes tick populations in Karelia increased. At the same time, the area of I. persulcatus, the main vector of the Siberian TBEV subtype, also expanded. Herein, we sequenced 10 viruses isolated from ticks collected in three locations from the Karelia region in 2008–2018. PCR positive samples were passaged in suckling mice or pig embryo kidney cells (PEK). After the second passage in suckling, mice viral RNA was isolated and E-gene fragment was sequenced. Viral sequences were expected to be similar or nearly identical. Instead, there was up to a 4.8% difference in nucleotide sequence, comparable with the most diverse viruses belonging to the Baltic subgroup in Siberian TBEV subtype (Baltic TBEV-Sib). To reveal whether this was systemic or incidental, a comprehensive phylogeographical analysis was conducted. Interestingly, viruses within each geographic region demonstrated comparable diversity to the whole Baltic TBEV-Sib. Moreover, Baltic TBEV-Sib has a distribution area limited by three ecological regions. This means that active virus mixing occurs in the vast geographic area forming one common virus pool. The most plausible explanation is the involvement of flying animals in the TBEV spread."

		"abstract": "Introduction. At present, the areas endemic for tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) tend to expand. Monitoring of TBEV antibody detection rates in the population of non-endemic areas in order to adopt timely measures for specific and non-specific disease prevention thus acquires particular importance. The Tuguro-Chumikansky District is not among the endemic areas of the Khabarovsk Krai. Yet, the rise in the number of people seeking medical attention for an ixodes tick bite and TBE rates in the local population has been registered recently. Our purpose was to establish the level of natural herd immunity to the tick-borne encephalitis virus in the population of the Tuguro-Chumikansky District. Materials and methods. We conducted a serological survey among unvaccinated permanent residents of 6 villages of the study district. Results. The highest TBEV antibody detection rates were registered in the examined residents of the villages of Tugur (61.3 ± 8.75%) and Udskoye (51.4 ± 8.22%). On the whole, specific immunoglobulins for the tick-borne encephalitis virus were found in 29.4 ± 2.26% of the subjects, thus indicating that the locals have contacts with infected vectors or have possibly suffered from the inapparent (subclinical) infection. Discussion. The established immunoglobulin G detection rates and immunity levels to TBEV may show that the population of the Tuguro-Chumikansky District is involved in the epidemic process. A further increase in the number of people bitten by ticks can lead to an increase in the registered TBE incidence in the district making it yet another regional area endemic for the disease."

		"abstract": "Background: The emergence and spread of tick-borne arboviruses pose an increased challenge to human and animal health. In Europe this is demonstrated by the increasingly wide distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, Methodology/principal findings: We sequenced a virus archive composed of 22 LIV isolates which had been sampled throughout the UK over a period of over 80 years. Combining this dataset with published virus sequences, we detected no sign of recombination and found low diversity and limited evidence for positive selection in the LIV genome. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of geographic clustering as well as long-distance movement, including movement events that appear recent. However, despite genomic data and an 80-year time span, we found that the data contained insufficient temporal signal to reliably estimate a molecular clock rate for LIV. Additional analyses revealed that this also applied to TBEV, albeit to a lesser extent, pointing to a general problem with phylogenetic dating for TBFV. Conclusions/significance: The 22 LIV genomes generated during this study provide a more reliable LIV phylogeny, improving our knowledge of the evolution of tick-borne flaviviruses. Our inability to estimate a molecular clock rate for both LIV and TBEV suggests that temporal calibration of tick-borne flavivirus evolution should be interpreted with caution and highlight a unique aspect of these viruses which may be explained by their reliance on tick vectors. Author Summary: Tick-borne pathogens represent a major emerging threat to public health and in recent years have been expanding into new areas. LIV is a neglected virus endemic to the UK and Ireland (though it has been detected in Scandinavia and Russia) which is closely related to the major human pathogen TBEV, but predominantly causes disease in sheep and grouse. The recent detection of TBEV in the UK, which has also emerged elsewhere in Europe, requires more detailed understanding of the spread and sequence diversity of LIV. This could be important for diagnosis and vaccination, but also to improve our understanding of the evolution and emergence of these tick-borne viruses. Here we describe the sequencing of 22 LIV isolates which have been sampled from several host species across the past century. We have utilised this dataset to investigate the evolutionary pressures that LIV is subjected to and have explored the evolution of LIV using phylogenetic analysis. Crucially we were unable to estimate a reliable molecular clock rate for LIV and found that this problem also extends to a larger phylogeny of TBEV sequences. This work highlights a previously unknown caveat of tick-borne flavivirus evolutionary analysis which may be important for understanding the evolution of these important pathogens."

		"abstract": "Vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is based on the use of formalin-inactivated, culture-derived whole-virus vaccines. Immune response following vaccination is primarily directed to the viral envelope (E) protein, the major viral surface antigen. In Europe, two TBE vaccines are available in adult and pediatric formulations, FSME-IMMUN&reg; (Pfizer) and Encepur&reg; (GlaxoSmithKline). Herein, we analyzed the content of these vaccines using mass spectrometry (MS). The MS analysis revealed that the Encepur vaccine contains not only proteins of the whole virus particle, but also viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). MS analysis of the FSME-IMMUN vaccine failed due to the high content of human serum albumin used as a stabilizer in the vaccine. However, the presence of NS1 in FSME-IMMUN was confirmed by immunization of mice with six doses of this vaccine, which led to a robust anti-NS1 antibody response. NS1-specific western blot analysis detected anti-NS1 antibodies also in sera of humans who received multiple doses of either of these two vaccines; however, most vaccinees who received &le;3 doses were negative for NS1-specific antibodies. The contribution of NS1-specific antibodies to protection against TBE was demonstrated by immunization of mice with purified NS1 antigen, which led to a significant (p &lt; 0.01) prolongation of the mean survival time after lethal virus challenge. This indicates that stimulation of anti-NS1 immunity by the TBE vaccines may increase their protective effect."

Previous studies in South Korea have examined TBPs residing in ticks; however, there is no phylogenetic information on TBPs in ticks parasitizing native Korean goat (NKG; Capra hircus coreanae). The present study assessed the prevalence, risk factors, and co-infectivity of TBPs in ticks parasitizing NKGs. In total, 107 hard ticks, including Haemaphysalis longicornis, Ixodes nipponensis, and Haemaphysalis flava, were obtained from NKGs in South Korea between 2016 and 2019. In 40 tested tick pools, genes for four TBPs, namely Coxiella-like endosymbiont (CLE, 5.0%), Candidatus Rickettsia longicornii (45.0%), Anaplasma bovis (2.5%), and Theileria luwenshuni (5.0%) were detected. Ehrlichia, Bartonella spp., and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus were not detected. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report CLE and T. luwenshuni in H. flava ticks in South Korea. Considering the high prevalence of Candidatus R. longicornii in ticks parasitizing NKGs, there is a possibility of its transmission from ticks to animals and humans. NKG ticks might be maintenance hosts for TBPs, and we recommend evaluation of the potential public health threat posed by TBP-infected ticks."

As still no effective antiviral treatment is available, in the present study, a series of uridine glycoconjugates containing amide or/and 1,2,3-triazole moiety in the linker structure was synthesized and evaluated for the antiviral activity against two strains of TBEV: a highly virulent Hypr strain and less virulent Neudoerfl strain, using standardized previously in vitro assays. Our data have shown that four compounds from the series (18–21) possess strong activity against both TBEV strains. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of compounds 18–21 were between 15.1 and 3.7 μM depending on the virus strain, which along with low cytotoxicity resulted in high values of the selectivity index (SI). The obtained results suggest that these compounds may be promising candidates for further development of new therapies against flaviviruses."

Whereas CCHFV is a biosafety level (BSL) 4 agent, HAZV is classified as BSL 2, as it is not known to cause any disease in humans. Belonging to the same serogroup as CCHFV, HAZV might act as a model which can provide a better understanding of this important zoonosis. Furthermore, the serological relatedness may cause diagnostic problems if antibodies against HAZV interfere with current CCHFV serological assays. Therefore, sheep and cattle—important natural hosts for CCHFV—were experimentally infected with HAZV to prove their susceptibility and evaluate potential antibody cross-reactivities. According to this study, neither sheep nor cattle are susceptible to experimental HAZV infections. Consequently, the HAZV infection in ruminants is clearly distinct from CCHFV infections. Sera of immunized animals weakly cross-reacted between HAZV and CCHFV in immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays, but not in commercial CCHFV ELISAs commonly used for field studies."

		"abstract": "Tick-transmitted pathogens cause infectious diseases in both humans and animals. Different types of adaptive immune mechanisms could be induced in hosts by these microorganisms, triggered either directly by pathogen antigens or indirectly through soluble factors, such as cytokines and/or chemokines, secreted by host cells as response. Adaptive immunity effectors, such as antibody secretion and cytotoxic and/or T helper cell responses, are mainly involved in the late and long-lasting protective immune response. Proteins and/or epitopes derived from pathogens and tick vectors have been isolated and characterized for the immune response induced in different hosts. This review was focused on the interactions between tick-borne pathogenic hemoparasites and different host effector mechanisms of T- and/or B cell-mediated adaptive immunity, describing the efforts to define immunodominant proteins or epitopes for vaccine development and/or immunotherapeutic purposes. A better understanding of these mechanisms of host immunity could lead to the assessment of possible new immunotherapies for these pathogens as well as to the prediction of possible new candidate vaccine antigens."

		"abstract": "Over the last years, an increasing rate of ixodes tick bites has been registered in the northern regions of the European Russia. In addition, the number of subjects request medical assistance due to tick bites has been dramatically increased in the Komi Republic. In addition, incidence of tick-borne encephalitis was also increased particularly starting since 2009. However, highly limited data on pathogen genetic diversity related to viral tick-borne infections in this region are currently available. Taiga ticks (Ixodespersulcatus) collected from the Komi Republic southern and central part vegetation were examined to identify and genotype tick-borne viruses. Individual ticks were used to identify by RT-PCR viral RNA coupled to tick-borne encephalitis and Kemerovo viruses. Viral genome fragment sequencing allowed to unambiguously identify these viruses. It was found that viral RNA tick-borne encephalitis was detected in 6.8±1.2% individual ticks. Moreover, tick-linked isolate genotyping based on analyzing E protein gene fragment nucleotide sequence derived from tick-borne encephalitis discovered that 35% and 65% isolates belonged to the Far Eastern and Siberian subtype, respectively. In addition, subsequent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that at least four variants of the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes of tick-borne encephalitis virus were detected, which were close to the viruses circulating in the Urals and Siberia. In contrast, prevalence of Kemerovo virus in taiga ticks was 0.8±0.2%. Sequencing of Kemerovo virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene fragment showed around 94% homology with the remainder of the Kemerovo virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the Kemerovo virus genome fragments demonstrated at least two subtypes circulating in the Komi Republic. Thus, it was suggested that tick-borne encephalitis virus was introduced relatively recently from the Urals and Siberian region into the natural foci of the Komi Republic. Moreover, genetic differences found in Kemerovo virus strains presume for them a longer lasting evolution throughout the natural foci of this region. In addition, a potential role for birds and their ticks in rapid spreading of viral tick-borne infections in the Komi Republic is also discussed. Thus, the data on genetic diversity of the viral agents related to tick-born encephalitis and Kemerovo fever may be useful for improving their diagnostics, prevention and treatment in the Komi Republic."

The establishment and validation of inactivation procedures is a prerequisite for downstream analyses and management of occupational exposure. Therefore, different procedures for TBEV inactivation were tested. Our results suggest that TBEV is susceptible to inactivation by heat, acidic pH, different concentrations of alcohol, formaldehyde, or detergents, and exposure to UV irradiation, which may depend on sample size and composition."

		"abstract": "In the past decade, interest to electrochemical assays have grown for determination antibodies in clinical and biological samples, where instead of the enzyme label metal nanoparticle is used. Such types of electrochemical immunosensors represent an upcoming trend in analytical chemistry. In this work, the electrochemical behavior of silver nanoparticles conjugated with antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus at different stages of electrode modification is investigated. Silver nanoparticles were obtained by chemical reduction from silver nitrate. Passive adsorption was chosen as a strategy for binding silver nanoparticles to antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus. The optimal ratio of antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus (4.5 IU ml-1) in a solution of silver nanoparticles [1 mmol l-1 AgNO3] was found experimentally. The development of an electrochemical immunosensor was based on indirect, non-competitive format of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The electrochemical situation on the electrode surface after modification steps was demonstrated by cyclic voltammetry using a standard redox pair [Fe(CN)6]3-/[Fe(CN)6]4-. Glassy carbon electrode with electrochemically deposited gold nanoparticles was used as a platform for immobilization of biological material. It has been established that after sensitization of the electrode with antigen, passivation of the surface occurs. The voltammetric signal was recorded through the detection of silver ions oxidation on unmodified glassy carbon electrode under the working conditions: scan rate 0.1 V s-1, potential accumulation –0.8 V, accumulation time 60 s. Thus, this work paves the way for a new alternative method for monitoring antibodies to tick-borne encephalitis virus in biological fluids."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in Europe and Asia for which there is currently no specific therapy. The adenosine analogue galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, has entered a phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics study in healthy subjects and is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola and yellow fever virus infections. Moreover, galidesivir also inhibits the reproduction of TBEV and numerous other medically important flaviviruses. Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded resistant viruses. In our study, we performed serial in vitro passaging of TBEV in the presence of increasing concentrations of galidesivir (up to 50 μM), which resulted in the generation of two drug-resistant TBEV mutants. The first TBEV mutant was characterized by a single amino acid change, E460D. The other carried two amino acid changes, E460D and Y453H. Both mutations mapped to the active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Galidesivir-resistant TBEV exhibited no cross-resistance to structurally different antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2′-C-methyladenosine, 2′-C-methyladenosine, and 4′-azido-aracytidine. Although the E460D substitution led to only a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in vivo, with a 100% survival rate and no clinical signs observed in infected mice. Furthermore, no virus was detected in the sera, spleen, or brain of mice inoculated with the galidesivir-resistant TBEV. By contrast, infection with wild-type virus resulted in fatal infections for all animals. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of galidesivir antiviral activity, flavivirus resistance to nucleoside inhibitors, and the potential contribution of viral RdRp to flavivirus neurovirulence."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a well-recognized public health problem in the USA, however, other tick-borne diseases also have major public health impacts. Yet, limited research has evaluated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases within endemic regions. Using laboratory data from a large healthcare system in north-central Wisconsin from 2000–2016, we applied a Kulldorf’s scan statistic to analyze spatial, temporal and seasonal clusters of laboratory-positive cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis at the county level. Older males were identified as the subpopulation at greatest risk for non-Lyme tick-borne diseases and we observed a statistically significant spatial and temporal clustering of cases (p < 0.05). HGA risk shifted from west to east over time (2000–2016) with a relative risk (RR) ranging from 3.30 to 11.85, whereas babesiosis risk shifted from south to north and west over time (2004–2016) with an RR ranging from 4.33 to 4.81. Our study highlights the occurrence of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases, and identifies at-risk subpopulations and shifting spatial and temporal heterogeneities in disease risk. Our findings can be used by healthcare providers and public health practitioners to increase public awareness and improve case detection."

		"abstract": "A greater knowledge of the ecology of the natural foci of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is essential to better assess the temporal variations of the risk of tick-borne encephalitis for humans. To describe the seasonal and inter-annual variations of the TBEV-cycle and the epidemiological parameters related to TBEV nymph-to-larva transmission, exposure of small mammals to TBEV, and tick aggregation on small mammals, a longitudinal survey in ticks and small mammals was conducted over a 3-year period in a mountain forest in Alsace, eastern France. TBEV prevalence in questing nymphs was lower in 2013 than in 2012 and 2014, probably because small mammals (Myodes glareolus and Apodemus flavicollis) were more abundant in 2012, which reduced tick aggregation and co-feeding transmission between ticks. The prevalence of TBEV in questing nymphs was higher in autumn than spring. Despite these variations in prevalence, the density of infected questing nymphs was constant over time, leading to a constant risk for humans. The seroprevalence of small mammals was also constant over time, although the proportion of rodents infested with ticks varied between years and seasons. Our results draw attention to the importance of considering the complex relationship between small mammal densities, tick aggregation on small mammals, density of infected questing nymphs, and prevalence of infected nymphs in order to forecast the risk of TBEV for humans."

Radi se o prirodno žarišnoj zoonozi, čiji rezervoar čine šumski glodavci, domaće i divlje životinje, a čovjek se zarazi prigodno, ubodom inficiranog krpelja. U posljednje je vrijeme sve više izvješća o epidemijama KME povezanih s konzumacijom svježeg mlijeka i mliječnih proizvoda. Cilj je rada prikazati kliničke značajke i tijek bolesti kod oboljelih od KME u tijeku grupiranja u Primorsko- goranskoj županiji (lipanj 2019. godine), povezanog s konzumacijom nepasteriziranog kozjeg mlijeka iz istog izvora. Tri su bolesnika hospitalizirana s kliničkom slikom meningitisa, a kod dvoje se infekcija prezentirala kao febrilna bolest s mijalgijama i općom slabošću. Kod svih je bolesnika infekcija potvrđena serološkom obradom. Niti jedan bolesnik nije bio cijepljen protiv KME niti je imao podatak o ugrizu krpelja. Ovim radom želimo ukazati na zdravstvene opasnosti prehrambenih navika konzumiranja sirovog mlijeka koje u današnje vrijeme postaje sve popularnije, osobito među zagovornicima „zdrave hrane“."

The identification of putative drug targets and vaccine candidates is crucial to control TBPs. No information has been recorded on designing novel drug targets and vaccine candidates based on proteins. Subtractive proteomics is an in silico approach that utilizes extensive screening for the identification of novel drug targets or vaccine candidates based on the determination of potential target proteins available in a pathogen proteome that may be used effectively to control diseases caused by these infectious agents. The present study aimed to investigate novel drug targets and vaccine candidates by utilizing subtractive proteomics to scan the available proteomes of TBPs and predict essential and non-host homologous proteins required for the survival of these diseases causing agents. Subtractive proteome analysis revealed a list of fifteen essential, non-host homologous, and unique metabolic proteins in the complete proteome of selected pathogens. Among these therapeutic target proteins, three were excluded due to the presence in host gut metagenome, eleven were found to be highly potential drug targets, while only one was found as a potential vaccine candidate against TBPs. The present study may provide a foundation to design potential drug targets and vaccine candidates for the effective control of infections caused by TBPs."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is one of the most important viral zoonosis caused by a neurotropic arbovirus (TBEV). In Germany, TBE is classified as a notifiable disease with an average of 350 autochthonous human cases annually. The incidence-based risk assessment in Germany came under criticism because every year, a number of autochthonous human TBE cases have been detected outside of the official risk areas. Therefore, it is necessary to find additional parameters to strengthen TBEV surveillance. The aim of this study was to examine red foxes as sentinels for TBE. Thus far, there are no published data about the sensitivity and specificity for serological methods testing fox samples. Hence, we aimed to define a system for the screening of TBEV-specific antibodies in red foxes. A total of 1233 fox sera were collected and examined by ELISA and IIFA and confirmed by micro-NT. The overall seroprevalence of antibodies against TBEV in red foxes from Germany confirmed by micro-NT was 21.1%. The seroprevalence differed significantly between risk (30.5%) and non-risk areas (13.1%), with good correlations to local TBE incidence in humans. In conclusion, serological monitoring of red foxes represents a promising surrogate marker system and may even determine unexpected TBEV foci in regions currently regarded as non-risk areas."

The incidence rate of tick-borne encephalitis in Perm Krai annually exceeds that in the Russian Federation by several times, and therefore, the aim of the study was to reveal the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the course of infection. Materials and methods. A continuous retrospective clinical and laboratory survey including 314 adult patients admitted to the Perm Regional Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital in 2014-2019 was carried out. Results. The following features were revealed: the disease is diagnosed more often in persons over 41 years old, infection mainly occurs when visiting the forest and park areas. That is why, it is necessary to reduce the number of infection carriers. In every fifth patient, the disease is characterized by the development of an inapparent form, as well as mixed infection in association with pathogens circulating in ticks in the territory of Western Ural ticks. Conclusions. In 45.9 % of cases, the infection has a moderate and severe course, involving not only meninges but also the brain substances into the pathological process that requires early diagnosis and timely adequate therapy."

This study aimed to detect the presence of the causative agents of babesiosis and anaplasmosis among cattle in different provinces in Saudi Arabia and to characterise their species genetically. Methods: A total of 362 blood samples were taken from cattle in four regions (Riyadh, Al-Kharj, Al-Hasa and Al-Qassim) of Saudi Arabia and were molecularly screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of partial 18S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes to detect Babesia and Anaplasma species. Results: The overall prevalence of Babesia and Anaplasma in cattle was 2.49% and 5.80%, respectively. Theileria annulata (T. annulata) and Theileria ovis (T. ovis) were found in seven (1.93%) and two (0.55%) of the 362 samples, respectively. Anaplasma ovis (A. ovis) was detected in 21 (5.80%) of 362 samples. Likewise, four of the cattle were found to be coinfected with more than one pathogen (1.10%). All cattle samples tested negative for other species of Babesia, Theileria and Anaplasma. Conclusions: The presence of T. ovis and A. ovis has been reported in Saudi Arabia. Here, the presence of two novel genotypes of T. annulata is also reported in Saudi Arabian cattle. Further molecular surveys on larger numbers of samples from the entire country are needed to correctly address the prevalence and geographical distribution of tick-borne disease."

Chart review and identification of TBE, HSV- I, and VZV-I was carried out, fulfilling the following criteria: (1) clinical signs of encephalitis and/or meningitis, (2) complete CSF analysis and confirmed viral etiology by either PCR or antibody testing in CSF, (3) hospitalized patients, and (4) available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Fifty-nine patients with 118 CSF/serum pairs were included. These comprised 21 with TBE (35 CSF/serum pairs), 20 (40 CSF/serum pairs) with HSV-I, and 18 (43 CSF/serum pairs) with VZV-I. In contrast to HSV-I and VZV-I, CSF cell differentiation in TBE showed more often an increased (>20%) proportion of granulocytes (p < 0.01) and a more frequent quantitative intrathecal IgM synthesis (p = 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), while the second was even more pronounced when follow-up CSF analyses were included (p < 0.001). CSF findings help to distinguish TBE from other viral infections. In cases with CSF pleocytosis and a positive history for a stay in or near an endemic area, TBE antibodies in CSF and serum should be determined, especially if granulocytes in CSF cell differentiation and/or an intrathecal IgM synthesis is present."

Dogs play an important role as a biological host for several tick species and can serve as sentinels for rickettsial infections. Our aim was to determine the presence of TBRP in dogs and in dog-associated ticks and their potential risk to human diseases in Medellin, Colombia. DNA for E. canis (16S rRNA and dsb) and A. platys (groEl) was detected in 17.6% (53/300) and 2.6% (8/300) of dogs, respectively. Antibodies against Ehrlichia spp. 82 (27.3%) and Anaplasma spp. 8 (2.6%) were detected in dogs. Antibody reactivity against both agents were found in 16 dogs (5.3%). Eight dogs showed antibody for Rickettsia spp. with titers that suggest 3 of them had a probable exposure to R. parkeri. Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (178/193) was the main tick in dogs, followed by R. microplus (15/193). The minimum infection rates (MIR) in R. sanguineus were 11.8% for E. canis and 3.4% for A. platys. E. canis and A. platys are the main TBRP infecting dogs and ticks and R. sanguineus s.l. is likely involved in the transmission of both agents. Interestingly, we found serological evidence of exposure in dogs for spotted fever group rickettsiae."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is considered to be the medically most important arthropod-borne virus in Europe. The symptoms of an infection range from subclinical to mild flu-like disease to lethal encephalitis. The exact determinants of disease severity are not known; however, the virulence of the strain as well as the immune status of the host are thought to be important factors for the outcome of the infection. Here we investigated virulence determinants in TBEV infection. Method: Mice were infected with different TBEV strains, and high virulent and low virulent TBEV strains were chosen. Sequence alignment identified differences that were cloned to generate chimera virus. The infection rate of the parental and chimeric virus were evaluated in primary mouse neurons, astrocytes, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and in vivo. Neutralizing capacity of serum from individuals vaccinated with the FSME-IMMUN® and Encepur® or combined were evaluated. Results: We identified a highly pathogenic and neurovirulent TBEV strain, 93/783. Using sequence analysis, we identified the envelope (E) protein of 93/783 as a potential virulence determinant and cloned it into the less pathogenic TBEV strain Torö. We found that the chimeric virus specifically infected primary neurons more efficiently compared to wild-type (WT) Torö and this correlated with enhanced pathogenicity and higher levels of viral RNA in vivo. The E protein is also the major target of neutralizing antibodies; thus, genetic variation in the E protein could influence the efficiency of the two available vaccines, FSME-IMMUN® and Encepur®. As TBEV vaccine breakthroughs have occurred in Europe, we chose to compare neutralizing capacity from individuals vaccinated with the two different vaccines or a combination of them. Our data suggest that the different vaccines do not perform equally well against the two Swedish strains. Conclusions: Our findings show that two amino acid substitutions of the E protein found in 93/783, A83T, and A463S enhanced Torö infection of neurons as well as pathogenesis and viral replication in vivo; furthermore, we found that genetic divergence from the vaccine strain resulted in lower neutralizing antibody titers in vaccinated individuals."

Here, the ecological interactions among Ixodiphagus hookeri, Ixodes ricinus, and two vertebrate species groups were investigated in relation to their effects on tick-borne disease risk. In 1129 questing ticks, I. hookeri DNA was detected more often in I. ricinus nymphs (4.4%) than in larvae (0.5%) and not in adults. Therefore, we determined the infestation rate of I. hookeri in nymphs from 19 forest sites, where vertebrate, tick, and tick-borne pathogen communities had been previously quantified. We found higher than expected co-occurrence rates of I. hookeri with deer-associated Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and lower than expected rates with rodent-associated Borrelia afzelii and Neoehrlichia mikurensis. The prevalence of I. hookeri in nymphs varied between 0% and 16% and was positively correlated with the encounter probability of ungulates and the densities of all life stages of I. ricinus. Lastly, we investigated the emergence of I. hookeri from artificially fed, field-collected nymphs. Adult wasps emerged from seven of the 172 fed nymphs. From these observations, we inferred that I. hookeri is parasitizing I. ricinus larvae that are feeding on deer, rather than on rodents or in the vegetation. Since I. hookeri populations depend on deer abundance, the main propagation host of I. ricinus, these wasps have no apparent effect on tick populations. The presence of I. hookeri may directly interfere with the transmission cycle of A. phagocytophilum, but not with that of B. afzelii or N. mikurensis."

		"abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) maintains protein-folding homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and has been implicated as both beneficial and detrimental to flavivirus infection. Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), a sensor of the UPR, is commonly associated with antiviral effects during mosquito-borne flavivirus (MBFV) infection, but its relation to tick-borne flavivirus (TBFV) infection remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified changes in UPR and autophagic activity during Langat virus (LGTV) infection. LGTV robustly activated UPR and altered autophagic flux. Knockdown of endogenous PERK in human cells resulted in increased LGTV replication, but not that of closely related Powassan virus (POWV). Finally, on examining changes in protein levels of components associated with UPR and autophagy in the absence of PERK, we could show that LGTV-infected cells induced UPR but did not lead to expression of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), an important downstream transcription factor of multiple stress pathways. From these data, we hypothesize that LGTV can antagonize other kinases that target eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), but not PERK, implicating PERK as a potential mediator of intrinsic immunity. This effect was not apparent for POWV, a more pathogenic TBFV, suggesting it may be better equipped to mitigate the antiviral effects of PERK."

Identifying the reservoir hosts for particular zoonotic pathogens in a specific area enables the implementation of adequate measures in order to prevent the occurrence of zoonotic diseases in humans and domestic animals. The present review aims to summarize the role of wild canids in the epidemiology of tick-borne zoonoses in Serbia based on previously published papers and to discuss the available data from an epidemiological point of view. The results of previously published studies indicate that wild canids are potential reservoir hosts for several zoonotic tick-borne pathogens in Serbia, and hosts for several tick species which are proven competent vectors. Based on molecular studies conducted so far, the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, was confirmed in jackals while the presence of Candidatus Neoehrlichia micurensis (FU98), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia lusitaniae was proven by PCR in analyzed red foxes. There is a need for continuous epidemiological monitoring of diseases caused by pathogens previously confirmed in wild canids. Also, further research is needed to reveal the role of other wild and domestic animals in the epidemiology of tick-borne zoonoses in Serbia."

Dogs can be clinically ill, reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens, or sentinel populations for research. Certainly, small-scale research has been conducted in dogs and this review will focus on the recent studies of emergent and re-emergent tick-borne pathogens in dogs in Serbia. Babesiosis stands out as the most common and important tick-borne disease in dogs. In addition to this pathogen, the presence of Hepatozoon canis and ?Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum? in the blood of dogs was proved using molecular methods. Seroreactivity in dogs has been proven for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Rickettsia conorii, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. complex, A. phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp. from the group of spotted fevers, and TBEV in ticks indicates the geographical distribution and potential for infecting humans, dogs, and other animals in Serbia. Further systematic, comprehensive, well designed, bacteriological, virological, parasitological, epidemiological, clinical (infectological), and acarological research is needed in Serbia."

To develop therapeutics against these pathogens, increased understanding of their interactions with the mammalian host is required. The PI3K-AKT pathway has been implicated in TBFV persistence, but its role during acute virus infection remains poorly understood. Previously, we showed that Langat virus (LGTV)-infected HEK 293T cells undergo a lytic crisis with a few surviving cells that become persistently infected. We also observed that AKT2 mRNA is upregulated in cells persistently infected with TBFV. Here, we investigated the virus-induced effects on AKT expression over the course of acute LGTV infection and found that total phosphorylated AKT (pAKT), AKT1, and AKT2 decrease over time, but AKT3 increases dramatically. Furthermore, cells lacking AKT1 or AKT2 were more resistant to LGTV-induced cell death than wild-type cells because they expressed higher levels of pAKT and antiapoptotic proteins, such as XIAP and survivin. The differential modulation of AKT by LGTV may be a mechanism by which viral persistence is initiated, and our results demonstrate a complicated manipulation of host pathways by TBFVs."

Birds with different lifestyles, i.e., non-migrants residing in a specific area, or short-, medium-, and long-distance migrants, migrating within one or several distant geographical regions are carriers of a number of ticks and tick-borne pathogens. During seasonal migrations, birds that cover long distances over a short time and stay temporarily in different habitats can introduce tick and pathogen species in areas where they have never occurred. An increase in the geographical range of ticks as well as the global climate changes affecting the pathogens, vectors, and their hosts increase the incidence and the spread of emerging tick-borne diseases worldwide. Tick infestations of birds varied between regions depends on the rhythms of tick seasonal activity and the bird migration rhythms determined by for example, climatic and environmental factors. In areas north of latitude ca. 58°N, immature Ixodes ricinus ticks are collected from birds most frequently, whereas ticks from the Hyalomma marginatum group dominate in areas below 42°N. We concluded that the prognosis of hazards posed by tick-borne pathogens should take into account changes in the migration of birds, hosts of many epidemiologically important tick species."

Tick-borne diseases represent a major health concern, posing an increasing risk to the public health during the last century and affecting millions of people. The aim of the current study was to provide epidemiological data regarding the presence of certain tick-borne pathogens in ticks feeding on humans in Romania. Overall, 522 Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from humans were screened for six pathogens: Borrelia spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Babesia spp., Coxiella spp., Bartonella spp., and Francisella tularensis. Ticks attached to humans were collected between 2013–2015 in Cluj County, Romania. Conventional, nested and quantitative PCR were used to detect specific genetic sequences of each pathogen. For identifying the infectious agents, positive samples were sequenced. The infection prevalence was 21.07% from which 8.18% were mixed infections. The detected agents were Borrelia spp., N. mikurensis and Babesia spp. The present data reveal the endemic occurrence of potentially zoonotic pathogens in Romania. Revealing the current distribution of tick-borne pathogens in ticks collected from humans may provide new insights in understanding the complex ecology of tick-borne diseases and enlightens current knowledge about the infection prevalence at local, regional and national levels."

		"abstract": "Background: Tick distribution in Sweden has increased in recent years, with the prevalence of ticks predicted to spread towards the northern parts of the country, thus increasing the risk of tick-borne zoonoses in new regions. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the most significant viral tick-borne zoonotic disease in Europe. The disease is caused by TBE virus (TBEV) infection which often leads to severe encephalitis and myelitis in humans. TBEV is usually transmitted to humans Methods: Milk and colostrum samples were collected from sheep and goats in Örebro County, Sweden. The milk samples were analysed for the presence of TBEV antibodies by ELISA and validated by western blot in which milk samples were used to detect over-expressed TBEV E-protein in crude cell extracts. Neutralising titers were determined by focus reduction neutralisation test (FRNT). The stability of TBEV in milk and colostrum was studied at different temperatures. Results: In this study we have developed a novel strategy to identify new TBEV foci. By monitoring TBEV antibodies in milk, we have identified three previously unknown foci in Örebro County which also overlap with areas of TBE infection reported during 2009–2018. In addition, our data indicates that keeping unpasteurised milk at 4 °C will preserve the infectivity of TBEV for several days. Conclusions: Altogether, we report a non-invasive surveillance technique for revealing risk areas for TBE in Sweden, by detecting TBEV antibodies in sheep milk. This approach is robust and reliable and can accordingly be used to map TBEV “hotspots”. TBEV infectivity in refrigerated milk was preserved, emphasising the importance of pasteurisation (i.e. 72 °C for 15 s) prior to consumption."

In adults, meningoencephalitis and meningoencephalomyelitis made up 49.26% of cases. Nausea and vomiting are more frequent in children, while neurological manifestations are more frequent in adults. There were no differences in CSF pleocytosis at the onset of disease in both groups, while CSF protein concentration was higher in adults. Children treated with corticosteroids over 7 days had higher checkup pleocytosis than pleocytosis at the onset of disease compared with adults. Corticosteroid use prolongs the disease duration but does not influence the development of TBE sequelae. Children had more favourable outcomes than adult patients."

		"abstract": "Background: Why human tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases differ from year to year, in some years more 100%, has not been clarified, yet. The cause of the increasing or decreasing trends is also controversial. Austria is the only country in Europe where a 40-year TBE time series and an official vaccine coverage time series are available to investigate these open questions. Methods: A series of generalized linear models (GLMs) has been developed to identify demographic and environmental factors associated with the trend and the oscillations of the TBE time series. Both the observed and the predicted TBE time series were subjected to spectral analysis. The resulting power spectra indicate which predictors are responsible for the trend, the high-frequency and the low-frequency oscillations, and with which explained variance they contribute to the TBE oscillations. Results: The increasing trend can be associated with the demography of the increasing human population. The responsible GLM explains 12% of the variance of the TBE time series. The low-frequency oscillations (10 years) are associated with the decadal changes of the large-scale climate in Central Europe. These are well described by the so-called Scandinavian index. This 10-year oscillation cycle is reinforced by the socio-economic predictor net migration. Considering the net migration and the Scandinavian index increases the explained variance of the GLM to 44%. The high-frequency oscillations (2–3 years) are associated with fluctuations of the natural TBE transmission cycle between small mammals and ticks, which are driven by beech fructification. Considering also fructification 2 years prior explains 64% of the variance of the TBE time series. Additionally, annual sunshine duration as predictor for the human outdoor activity increases the explained variance to 70%. Conclusions: The GLMs presented here provide the basis for annual TBE forecasts, which were mainly determined by beech fructification. A total of 3 of the 5 years with full fructification, resulting in high TBE case numbers 2 years later, occurred after 2010. The effects of climate change are therefore not visible through a direct correlation of the TBE cases with rising temperatures, but indirectly via the increased frequency of mast seeding."

		"abstract": "Vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is based on the use of formalin-inactivated, culture-derived whole-virus vaccines. Immune response following vaccination is primarily directed to the viral envelope (E) protein, the major viral surface antigen. In Europe, two TBE vaccines are available in adult and pediatric formulations, namely FSME-IMMUN® (Pfizer) and Encepur® (GlaxoSmithKline). Herein, we analyzed the content of these vaccines using mass spectrometry (MS). The MS analysis revealed that the Encepur vaccine contains not only proteins of the whole virus particle, but also viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). MS analysis of the FSME-IMMUN vaccine failed due to the high content of human serum albumin used as a stabilizer in the vaccine. However, the presence of NS1 in FSME-IMMUN was confirmed by immunization of mice with six doses of this vaccine, which led to a robust anti-NS1 antibody response. NS1-specific Western blot analysis also detected anti-NS1 antibodies in sera of humans who received multiple doses of either of these two vaccines; however, most vaccinees who received ≤3 doses were negative for NS1-specific antibodies. The contribution of NS1-specific antibodies to protection against TBE was demonstrated by immunization of mice with purified NS1 antigen, which led to a significant (p < 0.01) prolongation of the mean survival time after lethal virus challenge. This indicates that stimulation of anti-NS1 immunity by the TBE vaccines may increase their protective effect."

Studies on different aspects of disease require to access infective sporozoite of parasite which produced by tick vector. This study was carried out to establish of T. annulata life cycle to achieve T. annulata infected ticks. Methods: Laboratory rabbit and calf were used for rearing of Hyalomma anatolicum different instars. Unfed nymphs were fed on T. annulata infected calf. Clinical signs, Giemsa stained smears and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) methods were used for detection of infection in blood and tick specimens. Susceptible calf was used for confirmation of sporozoites maturation and infectivity in bioassay test. Results: Hyalomma anatolicum two and three-host strategies of life cycle was lasted 90 and 116 days respectively. The PCR confirmed T. annulata infection in blood and tick samples. Maturation of T. annulata sporozoites was confirmed in bioassy test. First clinical symptom of disease was seen earlier in the case of transmission of disease through feeding of live ticks in comparison with blood injection method. Conclusion: Complete life cycle of T. annulata was done and confirmed by clinical signs, microscopic examination, molecular methods and bioassay test. According to published reports to date, this is the first report of establishment of H. anatolicum tick infection with T. annulata using susceptible calf under controlled conditions in Iran.  "

We enrolled 20 patients with MS receiving TBE vaccination who had been on disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for at least 6 months. Serum samples were obtained before and after 4 weeks of vaccination to determine the specific TBE antibody response. MS disease activity (Expanded Disability Status Scale and relapse rates) was evaluated for 1 year after immunization. Local and systemic adverse events were registered. Results: In 20 subjects with TBE vaccination, the annualized relapse rate decreased from 0.65 in the year before vaccination to 0.21 in the following year. Expanded Disability Status Scale remained stable during the 2-year period before vaccination and 1 year after vaccination (range: 1.50–1.97). The geometric mean titer (GMT) increased from 169 Vienna units per milliliter (VIEU/mL) to 719 VIEU/mL 4 weeks after vaccination ( Conclusion: TBE vaccination showed good tolerability and was safe in patients with MS.

Nineteen adult patients 11–13 months after HSCT and 15 age-matched immunocompetent adults received up to three TBE vaccinations. Antibodies against TBE virus were measured by neutralization test (NT). As primary endpoint, the antibody response (NT titer of ≥10 and at least a twofold increase from baseline 4 weeks after second vaccination) was compared between patients and controls using Fisher exact test. Prior vaccination, 15 (79%) HSCT patients still had detectable neutralizing antibodies. At primary endpoint, the antibody response was significantly lower in patients than in controls (35% versus 93%;"

The observation of epidemic process dynamics of TBVE in Russia covers an 80-year long period and it’s the world longest. The existence of extensive records, various data from different geographic and administrative areas opens the way to interpretation of certain ecological and social factors and their role in the regional epidemiological situation. The targeted measures against TBVE are feasible only when the role of basic predictors of decreasing incidence is defined. Objective: analysis of TBVE incidence among the population and preventive measures in the Districts and constituent entities of Russia in 2019, forecast for 2020 based on the data collected in 2010–2019. The article shows a continued downward trend in TBVE incidence, noted in recent years. However, cases of infection were registered in 6 Federal Districts and 46 regions just like in the past. The number of patients amounted to 1559 (the incidence rate is 1.02 per 100000 people), of whom 23 have died. The rate of seeking medical care among those who were bitten by ticks increased. Specific preventive measures against TBVE haven’t significantly changed by volume and focus compared to the previous period. The scope of acaricide treatments has declined. The article also presents the data concerning TBVE carriers’ infection rate, and the laboratory study results in districts and regions across the country. It is recognized that the epidemiological situation on TBVE in Russia is still unfavorable. It requires the constant attention of health facilities and Rospotrebnadzor and management decisions aimed at further decrease in the incidence by improved prevention especially in the regions with high TBVE incidence."

Also known as Lyme borreliosis, it is caused by Borrelia spirochetes, which are distributed by ticks of the genus Ixodes. Early diagnosis is difficult due to frequent occurrence of atypical symptoms, unnoticed tick bites, the absence of migratory erythematous lesions, and symptoms occurring during the nontick season. If not diagnosed and treated in time, dissemination of the infection occurs and various complications develop since borrelias damage not only the skin but also the nervous system, joints, and, in rare cases, the heart and eyes. Materials and methods. This article presents a clinical case of Lyme borreliosis-induced myocarditis, which led to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and, consequently, urgent cardiac transplantation. According to our data, this is one of the first described cases of this complication in the world. Results and conclusions. When diagnosed in time and treated properly, the prognosis of Lyme myocarditis is usually good. In most cases, the atrioventricular block disappears within 1–2 weeks of antibiotic treatment and the implantation of a temporary pacemaker is rarely needed. In those rare cases of a chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection, dilated cardiomyopathy may develop; thus if a sudden atrioventricular block occurs, the physician should be vigilant and perform the necessary tests to exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Background: Current literature presents conflicting results regarding the clinical manifestations of coinfection with Babesia microti (Babesiosis) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect that coinfection with Babesiosis and Lyme Disease has on standard and novel biomarkers markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (Pc), which may assist in elucidating how these pathogens interact within human hosts. Methods: Babesia cases were collected from Stony Brook University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. Cases of Babesia were included if parasites were detected by peripheral blood smear and confirmed by PCR. Lyme disease diagnosis criteria involved 2-tier testing per CDC guidelines. Cases were divided into three cohorts based on if they had CRP, ESR or Pc tested. Cohorts were divided into two groups: Babesiosis alone vs coinfection with Lyme Disease. Median values were analyzed for the following biomarkers across both groups: parasitemia, hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, indirect bilirubin (IB), lactate dehydrogenase, ESR, CRP and Pc. Fisher Exact and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were used and P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: ESR values trended higher in monoinfection compared to coinfection (50 vs 36 mm/hr, p=0.63). Within this cohort, the coinfection group had significantly lower platelet values compared to monoinfection (52 vs. 75.5 K/uL, p=0.04, Table 1). Within the CRP and Pc cohorts, monoinfection had higher trends of parasitemia compared to coinfection (CRP group: 1.6 vs 0.7%, p=0.14, Pc group: 1.4 vs 0.7% p=1.0, Table 2&3). Pc levels were similar in both groups (1.1 vs 1.2 ng/mL, p=1.0, Table 3). Conclusion: Coinfection had significantly lower platelets within the ESR cohort but not in other cohorts. While not statistically significant, monoinfection showed greater trends of ESR and parasitemia, which is consistent with previous studies that suggest that Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

This has created a need to understand the environmental and human components of LD risk in open habitats. This study quantified both elements of LD risk and compared these between treeless islands with high and low LD incidence. We found high LD incidence was linked to higher prevalence in ticks (6.4% vs 0.4%) and increased human tick bite exposure. Most reported tick bites (72.7%) were within 1km of the home address and commonly in gardens. Residents on islands with high LD incidence reported increasing problems with ticks and suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. This study highlights the benefits to public health of an integrated approach to understand the factors contributing to LD emergence and a need to evaluate LD ecology in treeless habitats more broadly."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease (LD) is caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Over the past ten years, robust local public health data indicates that the incidence of LD has increased significantly in the eastern region of Ontario due to the spread of its vector, the blacklegged tick. As a result, we have seen an increase in the number of cases of LD in children at our tertiary paediatric centre, at all stages of infection. Familiarity with Lyme disease is important as incidence increases. We sought to characterize the cases at our centre. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of LD in children at our centre from 2009-2018, as well as the variety of clinical presentations of paediatric LD. Design/Methods: We completed a retrospective chart review from 2009-2018 of all cases admitted or seen in the Infectious Disease (ID) clinic or the Emergency Department (ED) with a diagnosis of LD. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, including geographic location where infection occurred and resource utilization. We used descriptive statistics to describe cases and comparative statistics to determine changes in number of cases over time. Results: There were 171 LD cases managed at our centre during this period. Mean age was 7.4 (SD 4.5) years, 89 (52.0%) were male. The annual number of cases from 2009 - 2018 increased from 1 to 44 and peaked in 2017 (47 cases). The highest number of cases occurred among children &lt;6, the lowest in children ≥11. Most cases occurred in summer (60%), with the fewest in winter months (4%). Stage of LD was not documented in 1 case. Of the remainder, 98 (57.6%) cases were early localized, 41 (25.7%) early disseminated and 31 (19.7%) late disseminated LD. Conclusion: Cases of LD managed at our paediatric centre have increased in keeping with population trends, with all LD stages experienced. Severe cases of meningitis, carditis, and arthritis resulted in hospitalization, with increasing numbers over the study period."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is a spirochetal disease. Lyme disease-related ocular findings may also provide important clues. Ocular involvement is most commonly seen as uveitis, chorioretinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, papillitis, panuveitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, and retinal vasculitis. Case:: A 27-year-old male patient was admitted with a history of fatigue, malaise, and sudden loss of vision in his left eye for 3 days. The best visual acuity was found 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed no pathological findings in the right eye; but hyperfluorescence that was compatible with choroiditis foci was seen in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening in the left eye compared to the right eye. Lyme IgM antibody was found to be positive, explaining choroiditis etiology, while IgG values were found to be negative. Western blot verification test was positive. The patient was treated with 2 × 100 mg doxycycline (21 days) with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, prednol 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) for choroiditis. Omeprazole tablets were given 1 × 1 during the period of cortisone intake. On the third day of treatment, visual acuity increased to 20/200 and continued to increase until reaching 20/20 in the second week. Conclusions:: Lyme disease is rare, but must be kept in mind when investigating the etiology of chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The patient reported here is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in literature that shows atypical clinic for Lyme disease with unilateral chorioretinitis without Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)."

Methods: Participants were 82 individuals who had a confirmed diagnosis of Lyme disease and had been experiencing symptoms for 6 months or more. They were recruited through various online mechanisms (e.g., social media, online support groups), and they completed the consent form and questionnaires via Qualtrics. Participants completed questions about their demographics and health status as well as the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (Moss-Morris et al., 2002), the Brief COPE (Carver, 1997), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). Results: Illness perceptions and coping explained a significant amount of variance in HRQOL. Among the illness perceptions, the consequences and identity dimensions were most strongly associated with HRQOL. Behavioral disengagement and substance use were the coping strategies most strongly associated with the emotional health outcomes. Discussion: Illness perceptions and coping are related to HRQOL among individuals with CLD. Given the increase in Lyme disease incidence and the chronicity of symptoms in some cases, it is critical to continue to examine the psychosocial factors associated with HRQOL in this population."

		"abstract": "As the prevalence of Lyme disease increases across Canada, it is imperative that the educational needs of at-risk groups be identified. The current study compared the level of knowledge and the knowledge needs about Lyme disease among individuals that spend time outdoors for work and for recreational purposes. Between December 2018 and February 2019, a survey was distributed to outdoor organizations across New Brunswick, Canada. Within the current sample of 137 individuals, 36% spent time outdoors for their occupation and 64% for recreational activities. Results showed no significant difference between these groups with regard to their level of knowledge, perceived efficacy and performance of various methods of prevention, and educational needs. Overall, the entire sample reported a low level of knowledge about Lyme disease. Participants perceived each prevention behavior to be at least somewhat effective, and behaviors perceived to be more effective were more likely to be carried out, but the performance of the behaviors varied. The most frequently performed behaviors included wearing long pants and protective footwear. Participants identified several aspects of Lyme disease about which they would like to have more information. The findings call attention to the specific needs of at-risk groups that must be considered when developing educational interventions."

Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (sNPH) based on chronic infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi (Bb) is an even rarer entity, that with the right treatment is potentially curable. Case presentation: A 67-year-old male with a slow onset of progressive balance problems, also presented unspecified dizziness, urge feeling, neck soreness and discrete cognitive complaints. An MRI scan revealed an enlarged ventricular system compatible with NPH. After further liquor dynamic procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed with the surprising results of lymphocytic pleocytosis, and signs of increased antibody production. Microbiology revealed chronic neuroborreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics accordingly. At the one-year follow-up no symptoms remained and the ventricular system almost normalized. Conclusions: We describe the 7th published case of sNPH secondary to chronic Borreliosis in a previous healthy adult. Existing published literature has been reviewed and previous cases showed similarly nearly full clinical recovery. Primary/idiopathic NPH (iNPH) is treated with the surgical intervention of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and can be mistaken for a sNPH. The awareness of rare causes of sNPH like chronic Borreliosis is important as it is easily treated non surgically."

		"abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding treatment of Lyme disease patients who do not respond fully to initial short-term antibiotic therapy. Choosing the best treatment approach and duration remains challenging because treatment response among these patients varies: some patients improve with treatment while others do not. A previous study examined treatment response variation in a sample of over 3500 patients enrolled in the MyLymeData patient registry developed by LymeDisease.org (San Ramon, CA, USA). That study used a validated Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale to identify three treatment response subgroups among Lyme disease patients who remained ill: nonresponders, low responders, and high responders. The present study first characterizes the health status, symptom severity, and percentage of treatment response across these three patient subgroups together with a fourth subgroup, patients who identify as well. We then employed machine learning techniques across these subgroups to determine features most closely associated with improved patient outcomes, and we used traditional statistical techniques to examine how these features relate to treatment response of the four groups. High treatment response was most closely associated with (1) the use of antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and alternative treatments, (2) longer duration of treatment, and (3) oversight by a clinician whose practice focused on the treatment of tick-borne diseases."

Single populations of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, were revealed in southwestern Québec, Canada. Blacklegged tick nymphs and, similarly, larval and nymphal rabbit ticks were tested for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), using PCR and the flagellin (flaB) gene, and 14 (42%) of 33 of blacklegged tick nymphs tested were positive. In contrast, larval and nymphal H. leporsipalustris ticks were negative for Bbsl. The occurrence of Bbsl in I. scapularis nymphs brings to light the presence of a Lyme disease endemic area at this songbird nesting locality. Because our findings denote that this area is a Lyme disease endemic area, and I. scapularis is a human-biting tick, local residents and outdoor workers must take preventive measures to avoid tick bites. Furthermore, local healthcare practitioners must include Lyme disease in their differential diagnosis."

Four patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 67 evaluable patients. Our retrospective review found patients to fall into a “high-dose” group (≥4 mg/kg/day) and a “low-dose” group (<4 mg/kg/day). In total, 62 of 67 (92.5%) patients treated with disulfiram were able to endorse a net benefit of the treatment with regard to their symptoms. Moreover, 12 of 33 (36.4%) patients who completed one or two courses of “high-dose” therapy enjoyed an “enduring remission”, defined as remaining clinically well for ≥6 months without further anti-infective treatment. The most common adverse reactions from disulfiram treatment in the high-dose group were fatigue (66.7%), psychiatric symptoms (48.5%), peripheral neuropathy (27.3%), and mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes (15.2%). We observed that although patients on high dose experienced a higher risk for adverse reactions than those on a low dose, high-dose patients were significantly more likely to achieve enduring remission."

		"abstract": "Background and objective: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB), is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia. The risk of infection depends on the geographical area, ecological factors, and human behavior. Clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have a wide range, but the most frequent clinical symptom, which is also a diagnostic symptom, is a skin rash called erythema migrans (EM). The disease is very common worldwide. In Lithuania, the disease frequency is 99.9 cases per 100,000 population (Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Lithuania, 2017). The main aim of this study was to obtain the baseline characteristics of the disease regarding the infected Lithuanian population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS about all Lyme disease (A69.2) diagnosed patients over a three-year period (from 2014 to 2016) in Lithuania. Results: In 2014–2016, 7424 (crude incidence rate 85.4) cases with LB were diagnosed in Lithuania. Most of them (4633 (62.4%)) were identified in women. Older people were more likely to suffer from LB. Urban residents were 2.6 times more often affected that those living in villages. Tick bites were primarily observed in high season months, from May to September (90%), with the highest peak in July. There was a higher number of observed tick bites (p = 0.003) in the urban residents. Erythema migrans occurred in 75.6% LB cases, while other symptoms did not exceed a quarter of all LB cases. There were 7353 (99.6%) cases where LB was confirmed via clinical symptoms and/or laboratory tests. Also, 1720 (23.2%) patients were tested for LB immunoglobulins. Conclusions: This study found a high incidence of Lyme disease in Lithuania. We elucidated the baseline characteristics regarding the infected Lithuanian population which may ease medical clinicians’ work on new Lyme diagnoses."

Clinical manifestations vary greatly, with localized skin findings functioning as early signs of the disease, followed by disseminated disease. The rarest dermatologic presentation of Lyme is a borrelial lymphocytoma, occurring distinctly in Europe and caused typically by Case presentation: We report a case of a Caucasian 5-year-old European-American boy with slowly progressing, painless edema and erythema of his right pinna. Travel history revealed significant exposure to ticks during a recent trip to Eastern Europe. Laboratory testing for Conclusions: Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease in North America, although not uncommon in Europe. Diagnosis is made by the presence of a painless erythematous swelling typically found on the ear lobe, nipples, or testes. Laboratory tests are available but with low sensitivity, therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a clinical diagnosis to be made. Treatment for isolated borrelial lymphocytoma is doxycycline 4 mg/kg up to 100 mg twice daily, whereas for children less than 8 years of age amoxicillin 50 mg/kg divided three times daily, for 3–4 weeks, is preferred."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The current therapeutic approach to this disease is limited to antibiotics. However, after their administration, about 20% of patients experience delayed onset of this illness manifesting as lingering persistent symptoms. Methods:: To determine a suitable approach that would help reduce this number, we examined the efficacy of a composition of polyphenolic compounds (baicalein, luteolin, and rosmarinic acid) with fatty acids (monolaurin and cis-2-decenoic acid), and iodine/kelp in a Lyme disease animal model and volunteers. Results:: The results showed that 4 weeks of dietary intake of this composition reduced the spirochete burden in animal tissues by about 75%. Basic and differential blood parameters did not show significant differences between control animals and the animals fed with this composition. Also, hepatic and renal toxicity markers were not changed and apoptosis was not observed. Relevant inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were elevated in infected animals but normalized in infected and treated animals. A small observational study revealed that after administration of this composition to 17 volunteers three times per day for 6 months, 67.4% of the volunteers with late or persistent LD, and not receptive to previous antibiotic application, responded positively, in terms of energy status as well as physical and psychological wellbeing to supplementation with this composition, while 17.7% had slight improvement, and 17.7% were none responsive. Conclusion:: We concluded that this specific composition revealed feasible benefits in late or persistent LD management, although double-blind controlled clinical trials are warranted."

Simple models often ignore finer details of vector biology, commonly due to lack of pertinent field data. However, for tsetse (<italic>Glossina</italic> spp), vectors of the parasites causing debilitating human and livestock trypanosomiasis in Africa, extensive field and laboratory data facilitate improved models and predictions of vector control outcomes. We review studies on the effects of environmental temperature, and fly age and sex, on survival and reproduction in tsetse, savannah species particularly–emphasizing the extreme maternal investment and sensitivity of early life stages to high temperatures. We consider implications of these results for predictive models of tsetse populations, and of the transmission and control of African trypanosomiasis. We discuss how further research on vectors, and improved models of vector populations and disease dynamics, can lead to improved predictions of vector abundance and disease spread.</p>"

The most common and earliest clinical manifestation is erythema migrans, a distinctive cutaneous lesion that occurs at the site of deposition of the spirochaete by the vector tick. Most people treated for Lyme borreliosis respond well to a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for patients who have or develop subjective complaints of unclear aetiology despite successful resolution of the objective manifestation of Lyme borreliosis following antibiotic therapy.</p>"

While framing the problem this way—through the paradigm of a poverty-trap—may leverage aid and motivate political will toward disease control, it misses a wide range of socio-political contexts both driving, and driven by, vector borne diseases. In this chapter, we present a series of global vignettes, to illustrate different facets of the broad remit of social drivers and interactions with VBDs. We approach the urban social-ecological context in Latin America and the Caribbean, impacts and aftermath of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tropical storms, struggles with trust in intervention implementation in Haiti, and drivers and impacts of ruminant arbovirus emergence events in Europe. We conclude that incorporating an understanding of social context, including political history and cultural perceptions, is a key part of VBD research and intervention practice.</p>"

There are a number of applied goals of these predictions, including appropriately targeting resources for surveillance and intervention and accurately quantifying disease burden. Although spatial heterogeneity is evident in the epidemiology of many diseases, several aspects of the biology of vector-borne diseases amplify this form of heterogeneity. Here, we review several aspects of this biology, highlighting seven distinct ways in which the biology of vector-borne diseases impacts understanding spatial heterogeneity in disease incidence. Whereas traditional methods place emphasis on spatial regression and other forms of statistical analysis of empirical data, the goal here is to offer a perspective on potential pitfalls of analyses that take data at face value and do not acknowledge the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic relationships between spatial patterns of disease incidence and spatial heterogeneity in transmission.</p>"

Here, we review development of the Ross–Macdonald model, present one simple version, and provide an eclectic critique of the theory based on studies conducted more recently. While mosquito populations are logically necessary for mosquito-borne pathogen transmission, the study of transmission since then shows it is noisy, heterogeneous, and complex.

Data from the University of Rhode Island’s TickEncounter Resource Center’s photo-based surveillance system, TickSpotters, indicate that users incorrectly identified their submitted specimen 83% of the time. Of the top four most commonly submitted tick species, western blacklegged ticks (Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls [Ixodida: Ixodidae]) had the largest proportion of unidentified or misidentified submissions (87.7% incorrectly identified to species), followed by lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum Linneaus [Ixodida: Ixodidae]; 86.8% incorrect), American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis Say [Ixodida: Ixodidae]; 80.7% incorrect), and blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say [Ixodida: Ixodidae]; 77.1% incorrect). More than one quarter of participants (26.3%) submitted photographs of ticks that had been feeding for at least 2.5 d, suggesting heightened risk. Logistic regression generalized linear models suggested that participants were significantly more likely to misidentify nymph-stage ticks than adult ticks (odds ratio [OR] = 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.23, 0.68, P &lt; 0.001). Ticks reported on pets were more likely to be identified correctly than those found on humans (OR = 1.07, 95% CI: 1.01–2.04, P &lt; 0.001), and ticks feeding for 2.5 d or longer were more likely to be misidentified than those having fed for one day or less (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.29–0.65, P &lt; 0.001). State and region of residence and season of submission did not contribute significantly to the optimal model. These findings provide targets for future educational efforts and underscore the value of photograph-based tick surveillance to elucidate these knowledge gaps."

The chapter topics provide an up-to-date presentation of classical concepts, reviews of emerging trends, synthesis of existing knowledge, and a prospective agenda for future research. The contributions offer authoritative and international perspectives from leading thinkers in the field. The dynamics of vector-borne diseases are far more intrinsically ecological compared with their directly transmitted equivalents. The environmental dependence of ectotherm vectors means that vector-borne pathogens are acutely sensitive to changing environmental conditions. Although perennially important vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue have deeply informed our understanding of vector-borne diseases, recent emerging viruses such as West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus have generated new scientific questions and practical problems. The study of vector-borne disease has been a particularly rich source of ecological questions, while ecological theory has provided the conceptual tools for thinking about their evolution, transmission, and spatial extent.</p>"

Development of tick control tools have focused primarily on the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Application of acaricides or entomopathogenic fungal agents to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks on rodents can suppress I. scapularis abundance in residential landscapes, but evidence is lacking for impact on human tick bites or tick-borne disease. Similar studies remain limited for the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Other knowledge gaps include how well homeowners and pest control companies perform in the broadcast application of tick-killing products, relative to high efficacy reported in research studies, and the tick-killing potential of natural product formulations exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration. Area-wide control based on preventing ticks from feeding on their main reproductive host, the white-tailed deer, can suppress populations of both I. scapularis and A. americanum. Some studies also suggest an impact on Lyme disease cases, but this needs to be further validated in larger-scale intervention studies. The effectiveness, scale, cost, and implementation of various tick management strategies are important considerations in efforts to reduce human tick encounters and tick-borne disease. Additional barriers include weak incentives for industry and academia to develop, test, and register new tick and pathogen control technologies, including vaccines targeting humans, tick reproductive hosts, or wildlife pathogen reservoirs. Solutions will need to be ‘two-pronged’: improving the tick and pathogen control toolbox and strengthening the public health workforce engaging in tick control at local and state levels."

Pathogen infection increases the expression of several tick gut proteins, which disturb the tick gut microbiota and impact bacterial biofilm formation. Anaplasma phagocytophilum induces ticks to express I. scapularis antifreeze glycoprotein (IAFGP), a protein with antimicrobial activity, while Borrelia burgdorferi induces the expression of PIXR. Here, we tested the resistance of I. scapularis microbiome to A. phagocytophilum infection, antimicrobial peptide IAFGP, and anti-tick immunity specific to PIXR. We demonstrate that A. phagocytophilum infection and IAFGP affect the taxonomic composition and taxa co-occurrence networks, but had limited impact on the functional traits of tick microbiome. In contrast, anti-tick immunity disturbed the taxonomic composition and the functional profile of tick microbiome, by increasing both the taxonomic and pathways diversity. Mechanistically, we show that anti-tick immunity increases the representation and importance of the polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways involved in biofilm formation, while these pathways are under-represented in the microbiome of ticks infected by A. phagocytophilum or exposed to IAFGP. These analyses revealed that tick microbiota is highly sensitive to anti-tick immunity, while it is less sensitive to pathogen infection and antimicrobial peptides. Results suggest that biofilm formation may be a defensive response of tick microbiome to anti-tick immunity."

The direct transmission is considered to be a nonmonotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to [Formula: see text] and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibrium is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when [Formula: see text] although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bistable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bistable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal that the equilibrium level of infected hosts decreases as psychological effect increases."

Therefore some infections/infestations, some of zoonotic concern, have been recorded in geographic areas where they were unexpected. In Europe, arthropods (e.g. ticks, fleas, mosquitoes and sand flies) and the pathogens that they transmit are in general considered to be more frequent in the Mediterranean Basin. Nonetheless, a possible occurrence in other regions should not be a priori excluded, given that travels of animals (to or imported from endemic areas), movements of goods and global warming all may foster the introduction of vectors and/or transmitted pathogens in previously free areas. This could also be the case in the UK, which, because of its territorial characteristics as an island area in north-western Europe, is traditionally considered at minor risk of VBDs. Given the growing increase of movements and travels of pets, and changes in the phenology of many arthropod vectors, it is crucial that veterinary practitioners are aware of and prepared to diagnose, treat and control a series of unexpected diseases."

The pest control of vector-borne diseases in agricultural settings is in urgent need of more effective tools. Ongoing research in genetics, molecular biology, physiology, and vector behavior has begun to unravel new insights into the transmission of phytopathogens by their insect vectors. However, the intricate mechanisms involved in phytopathogen transmission for certain pathosystems warrant further investigation. In this review, we propose the corn stunt pathosystem (Zea mays–Spiroplasma kunkelii–Dalbulus maidis) as an ideal model for dissecting the molecular determinants and mechanisms underpinning the persistent transmission of a mollicute by its specialist insect vector to an economically important monocotyledonous crop. Corn stunt is the most important disease of corn in the Americas and the Caribbean, where it causes the severe stunting of corn plants and can result in up to 100% yield loss. A comprehensive study of the corn stunt disease system will pave the way for the discovery of novel molecular targets for genetic pest control targeting either the insect vector or the phytopathogen."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Vector-borne disease risk assessment is crucial to optimize surveillance, preventative measures (vector control), and resource allocation (medical supplies). High arthropod abundance and host interaction strongly correlate to vector-borne pathogen transmission. Increasing host density and movement increases the possibility of local and long-distance pathogen transmission. Therefore, we developed a risk assessment framework using climate (average temperature and rainfall) and host demographic (host density and movement) data, particularly suitable for regions with unreported or under-reported incidence data. This framework consisted of a spatiotemporal network-based approach coupled with a compartmental disease model and a non-homogeneous Gillespie algorithm. One-month and two-month lagged temperature and rainfall data have been used to develop the correlation of climate data with vector abundance and host-vector interactions. This correlation can be expressed as vectorial capacity— a parameter, which governs the spreading of infection from an infected host to a susceptible via vectors. As an example, the novel risk assessment framework is applied for dengue in Bangladesh. Vectorial capacity is inferred for each week throughout a year using average monthly temperature and rainfall data, while the whole country is divided into some spatial locations (upazilas). Long-distance pathogen transmission is expressed with human movement data in the spatiotemporal network. We have identified the spatiotemporal suitability of dengue spreading in Bangladesh as well as the significant-incidence window and peak incidence period. Analysis of yearly dengue data variation suggests the possibility of a significant outbreak with a new serotype introduction. The outcome of the framework comprises of weather-dependent spatiotemporal suitability maps and probabilistic risk maps for spatial infection spreading. This framework is capable of vector-borne disease risk assessment without historical incidence data and can be a useful tool for preparedness with accurate human movement data."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). In addition, there is evidence for transmission to humans from I. ricinus of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia divergens, Babesia microti, Babesia venatorum, Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis. However, whether infection with these potential tick-borne pathogens results in human disease has not been fully demonstrated for all of these tick-borne microorganisms. To evaluate the available evidence for a causative relation between infection and disease, the current study analyses European case reports published from 2008 to 2018, supplemented with information derived from epidemiological and experimental studies. The evidence for human disease causality in Europe found in this review appeared to be strongest for A. phagocytophilum and B. divergens. Nonetheless, some knowledge gaps still exist. Importantly, comprehensive evidence for pathogenicity is lacking for the remaining tick-borne microorganisms. Such evidence could be gathered best through prospective studies, for example, studies enrolling patients with a fever after a tick bite, the development of specific new serological tools, isolation of these microorganisms from ticks and patients and propagation in vitro, and through experimental studies."

One of the determinantsof dengue infection severity was virus virulence. This study aimed to determine the clinical and virologicalcharacteristics of dengue virus infection patients based on the severity degree. A cross-sectional study wasconducted in RSUD Dr. H. Abdul Moeloek, Lampung Province between July-November 2016 with 56 denguepatients as samples selected using purposive sampling. The serological test was done using a rapiddiagnostic test. Blood samples for DENV serotype identification were examined using reverse-transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction. Classification of DENV infection severity was obtained from the patient’s medicalrecord. The results showed that the most common clinical manifestations were fever, headache, and retroorbitalpain, appearing in all patients from every degree of severity. There were Grade I DHF patients whoexperienced Myalgia (15.6%) and petechiae (22.2%). Laboratory results showed that thrombocytopeniaappeared in every grade, even though 13.3% of grade I patients did not experience it. Secondary infectionwas found in 92.9% of samples, and all DENV serotype can be detected in 39.2%samples: DENV-1 (46.7%),DENV-2 (6.7%), DENV-3 (26.7%), and DENV-4 (20%). This study concluded that the majority of clinicalcharacteristics in DHF patients are in line with the degree of severity, with the bleeding as the dominantmanifestation in patients with grade II-IV. Virological characteristics of DENV-1 are dominant in all patientswith DHF grade I-IV.Keywords: dengue virus, serotype, severity, secondary infection, Bandar Lampung"

According to anecdote evidence, this is because of non-uniformity to environmental health practices in South Africa.Aim: This study aimed to determine and describe the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of environmental health practitioners (EHPs) when conducting outbreak investigations of FBD at a local municipality.Setting: This study was conducted in three sub-districts of Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality (EMM), one of five municipalities in Gauteng province, South Africa.Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data using a semi-structured questionnaire. Data collected were analysed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Continuous variables were compared using analysis of variances, and correlation was used to determine any association.Results: Knowledge responses were scored out of 9. Open-ended questions were themed into five items (support, guidelines, resources, training and specialisation). Sixty-one (76.3%) participants were randomly selected to participate in the study. There were more female participants (55.7%) than male participants, and the mean age was 30.9 years. The participants’ knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9. There were 17 (27.9%) participants who have conducted FBD outbreak investigation. Twenty-six (42.6%) believed that they were properly trained to conduct FBD outbreak investigations. Age was associated with position (p = 0.000) and qualification (p = 0.033).Conclusion: The results indicated that there are gaps and challenges in the knowledge, while the practices were not consistent amongst environmental health practitioners. However, the attitude of EHPs was positive with regard to their role in FBD outbreak investigations."

		"abstract": "Abstract. Mosquitoes are insects that can transmit diseases to humans through their bites. Dengue haemorrhagic fever is one of the diseases that could be transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito. The use of insecticides to control the occurrence of dengue haemorrhagic fever builds resistance of the mosquito towards the chemical substance. Therefore, natural larvicide was used as an alternative to chemical insecticides. This research was conducted to study the effectiveness of larvicides from the ethyl acetate fraction of Bangun-bangun leaves (Plectranthus amboinicus) in killing the Aedes aegypti larvae and to identify the active larvicide compounds. This laboratory experiment research tested six extract concentrations (0.0; 1.0; 1.8; 3.2; 5.6; 10.0%) in three replications. Observations were administered for 48 hours to count the number of the dead Aedes aegypti instar III larvae obtained from the Entomology Laboratory of the Faculty of Veterinary, IPB. The results showed that the larvae mortality increased as the extract concentration increased. The percentage of Aedes aegypti killed reached 96% at an extract concentration of 10%. Meanwhile, the probit analysis showed that LC50 was found at a concentration of 5.56%. The identification of active compounds using GCMS revealed that the larvicidal compounds in ethyl acetate fraction were the ones from an organic acid group which were, stearic acid, and palmitic acid.  Keywords: Aedes aegypti, identification, larvacidal, mortality   Abstrak. Nyamuk merupakan serangga yang dapat menularkan penyakit melalui gigitannya. Salah satu penyakit yang ditularkan adalah demam berdarah dengue yang dibawa oleh nyamuk Aedes aegypti. Pengendalian demam berdarah dengue menggunakan insektisida berbahan kimia dapat menyebabkan resisten nyamuk terhadap insektisida meningkat, oleh karena itu larvasida alami diharapkan dapat menjadi alternatif pengganti insektisida kimia. Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah mengetahui afektifitas larvasida dari fraksi etil asetat daun Bangun-bangun (Plectranthus amboinicus) terhadap mortalitas larva Aedes aegypti dan mengidentifikasi jenis senyawa aktif yang berperan sebagai larvasida. Penelitian ini merupakan eksperimen laboratorium dengan enam konsentrasi ekstrak (0,0; 1,0; 1,8; 3,2; 5,6; 10,0%) dan tiga kali ulangan. Pengamatan dilakukan selama 48 jam terhadap jumlah kematian larva Aedes aegypti instar III yang diperoleh dari Laboratorium Entomologi Fakultas Kedokteran Hewan, IPB. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kematian larva meningkat seiring dengan meningkatnya konsentrasi ekstrak. Kematian Aedes aegypti mencapai 96% pada konsentrasi ekstrak 10% dan hasil analisa probit menunjukkan LC50 terdapat pada konsentrasi 5,56%.  Identifikasi senyawa aktif menggunakan GCMS menunjukkan bahwa senyawa yang bersifat larvasida dalam fraksi etil asetat ini adalah senyawa dari golongan asam organik yaitu, asam stearate, dan asam palmitat.  Kata Kunci: Aedes aegypti, identifikasi, larvasida, mortalitas"

Therefore, laboratory diagnostics is required. The general objective of this study was to detect dengue IgG in serum samples with rapid tests and in urine samples of suspected dengue patients using ELISA. The procedure of this study consisted of three stages. First, collecting urine samples from healthy individuals and collecting blood and urine samples from suspected dengue patients; second, examining dengue IgG  in serum samples of suspected dengue patients with rapid tests; and third, examining dengue-specific IgG in urine samples from suspected dengue patients and from healthy individuals with ELISA technique. Data analyzed using experimental analytics to determine the cut off point used to interpret  laboratory diagnostic results. The results showed that patients with positive serum dengue IgG test at the same time also showed positive results on the examination of dengue-specific IgG in their urine samples while patients with negative serum at the same time showed negative results on the examination of dengue-specific IgG in urine samples.  Dengue-specific IgG examination in urine samples with ELISA technique can be used as an alternative examination in establishing the diagnosis of dengue, in which urine samples are taken from patients with more than 4 days fever.  Keywords: Dengue, IgG, Urine, ELISA   Abstrak.

		"abstract": "Parinaud’s oculoglandular syndrome (POGS) is defined as unilateral granulomatous conjunctivitis and facial lymphadenopathy. The aims of the current study are to describe a case of POGS with uveitis due to flea-borne typhus (FBT) and to present a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to POGS. The patient, a 38-year old man, presented with persistent unilateral eye pain, fever, rash, preauricular and submandibular lymphadenopathy, and laboratory findings of FBT: hyponatremia, elevated transaminase and lactate dehydrogenase levels, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia. His condition rapidly improved after starting doxycycline. Soon after hospitalization, he was diagnosed with uveitis, which responded to topical prednisolone. To derive a diagnostic and empiric therapeutic approach to POGS, we reviewed the cases of POGS from its various causes since 1976 to discern epidemiologic clues and determine successful diagnostic techniques and therapies; we found multiple cases due to cat scratch disease (CSD; due to Bartonella henselae) (twelve), tularemia (ten), sporotrichosis (three), Rickettsia conorii (three), R. typhi/felis (two), and herpes simplex virus (two) and single cases due to tuberculosis, paracoccidioidomycosis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pasteurella multocida, Chlamydia trachomatis, Epstein–Barr virus, and Nocardia brasiliensis. Preauricular lymphadenopathy is a common clinical clue for POGS and is unusual in viral and bacterial conjunctivitis. For POGS, the major etiological consideration is B. henselae, which is usually diagnosed by the indirect immunofluorescence serologic technique. Although CSD POGS is usually self-limited, oral azithromycin may hasten resolution. However, other possible etiologies of POGS may also arise from cat or cat flea contact: sporotrichosis, tularemia, Pasteurella multocida, or FBT. If there is no cat contact, other epidemiologic and clinical findings should be sought, because several of these conditions, such as tularemia, paracoccidioidomycosis, and tuberculosis, may have grave systemic complications. Although there are usually no long-term ocular sequelae if POGS is properly diagnosed, it still may cause prolonged ocular discomfort and require multiple physician contacts."

Although most cases are self-limited, 26%–28% have complications and up to one-third require intensive care. Flea-borne typhus was recognized as an illness similar to epidemic typhus, but having a milder course, in the Southeastern United States and TX from 1913 into the 1920s. Kenneth Maxcy of the US Public Health Service (USPHS) first described the illness in detail and proposed a rodent reservoir and an arthropod vector. Other investigators of the USPHS (Eugene Dyer, Adolph Rumreich, Lucius Badger, Elmer Ceder, William Workman, and George Brigham) determined that the brown and black rats were reservoirs and various species of fleas, especially the Oriental rat flea, were the vectors. The disease was recognized as a health concern in the Southern United States in the 1920s and an increasing number of cases were observed in the 1930s and 1940s, with about 42,000 cases reported between 1931–1946. Attempts to control the disease in the 1930s by fumigation and rat proofing and extermination were unsuccessful. The dramatic increase in the number of cases from 1930 through 1944 was due to: the diversification of Southern agriculture away from cotton; the displacement of the smaller black rat by the larger brown rat in many areas; poor housing conditions during the Great Depression and World War II; and shortages of effective rodenticides and insecticides during World War II."

Outbreaks of the emerging viruses chikungunya and Zika in 2014 and 2016, respectively, demonstrated the rapidity with which these viruses can spread between islands. At the same time, the number of reported dengue fever cases, caused by the endemic dengue virus, has steadily climbed over the past decade, and a large dengue outbreak that began sweeping through this region in 2019 continues in 2020. Sustainable disease and mosquito control measures are urgently needed to quell virus transmission in the long term and prevent future outbreaks from occurring. To improve upon current surveillance methods, we analyzed temporal and spatial patterns of chikungunya, Zika, and dengue outbreaks reported in the Dominican Republic between 2012 and 2018.

This is due to a combination of factors, primarily environmental change, encroachment of human habitats from urban to peri-urban areas and rural to previously uninhabited areas, persistence of poverty, malnutrition and resource limitation in geographical areas where these diseases are endemic. Pregnant women represent the single largest ‘at risk’ group, due to immune-modulation and a unique physiological state. Many of these diseases have not benefitted from the same level of drug development as other infectious and medical domains, a factor attributing to the ‘neglected tropical disease’ title many vector-borne diseases hold. Pregnancy compounds this issue as data for safety and efficacy for many drugs is practically non-existent, precluding exposure in pregnancy to many first-line therapeutic agents for ‘fear of the unknown’ or overstated adverse pregnancy-foetal outcomes. In this review, major vector-borne diseases, their impact on pregnancy outcomes, current treatment, vaccination and short-comings of current medical practice for pregnant women will be discussed."

		"abstract": "Flea-borne typhus, due to Rickettsia typhi and R. felis, is an infection causing fever, headache, rash, and diverse organ manifestations that can result in critical illness or death. This is the second part of a two-part series describing the rise, decline, and resurgence of flea-borne typhus (FBT) in the United States over the last century. These studies illustrate the influence of historical events, social conditions, technology, and public health interventions on the prevalence of a vector-borne disease. Flea-borne typhus was an emerging disease, primarily in the Southern USA and California, from 1910 to 1945. The primary reservoirs in this period were the rats Rattus norvegicus and Ra. rattus and the main vector was the Oriental rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis). The period 1930 to 1945 saw a dramatic rise in the number of reported cases. This was due to conditions favorable to the proliferation of rodents and their fleas during the Depression and World War II years, including: dilapidated, overcrowded housing; poor environmental sanitation; and the difficulty of importing insecticides and rodenticides during wartime. About 42,000 cases were reported between 1931–1946, and the actual number of cases may have been three-fold higher. The number of annual cases of FBT peaked in 1944 at 5401 cases. American involvement in World War II, in the short term, further perpetuated the epidemic of FBT by the increased production of food crops in the American South and by promoting crowded and unsanitary conditions in the Southern cities. However, ultimately, World War II proved to be a powerful catalyst in the control of FBT by improving standards of living and providing the tools for typhus control, such as synthetic insecticides and novel rodenticides. A vigorous program for the control of FBT was conducted by the US Public Health Service from 1945 to 1952, using insecticides, rodenticides, and environmental sanitation and remediation. Government programs and relative economic prosperity in the South also resulted in slum clearance and improved housing, which reduced rodent harborage. By 1956, the number of cases of FBT in the United States had dropped dramatically to only 98. Federally funded projects for rat control continued until the mid-1980s. Effective antibiotics for FBT, such as the tetracyclines, came into clinical practice in the late 1940s. The first diagnostic test for FBT, the Weil-Felix test, was found to have inadequate sensitivity and specificity and was replaced by complement fixation in the 1940s and the indirect fluorescent antibody test in the 1980s. A second organism causing FBT, R. felis, was discovered in 1990. Flea-borne typhus persists in the United States, primarily in South and Central Texas, the Los Angeles area, and Hawaii. In the former two areas, the opossum (Didelphis virginiana) and cats have replaced rats as the primary reservoirs, with the cat flea (Ctenocephalides felis) now as the most important vector. In Hawaii, 73% of cases occur in Maui County because it has lower rainfall than other areas. Despite great successes against FBT in the post-World War II era, it has proved difficult to eliminate because it is now associated with our companion animals, stray pets, opossums, and the cat flea, an abundant and non-selective vector. In the new millennium, cases of FBT are increasing in Texas and California. In 2018–2019, Los Angeles County experienced a resurgence of FBT, with rats as the reservoir."

Agricultural landscapes, where animal breeding is a major activity, constitute a mosaic of habitat types of various quality for tick survival and are used at different frequencies by wild and domestic hosts across seasons. This habitat heterogeneity, in time and space, conditions the dynamics of these host-vector-pathogen systems and thus drives acarological risk (defined as the density of infected ticks). The principal objective of the OSCAR project (2011-2016) was to examine the links between this heterogeneity and acarological risk for humans and their domestic animals. Here, we present the data associated with this project."

The serum samples collected from animals (200 cows; 200 calves) were used in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (iELISA) to detect IgG antibodies against A. marginale, B. bovis, B. bigemina, and T. vivax, and Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) for detecting IgG antibodies against C. burnetii and A. phagocytophilum. No correlation was observed between seropositivity for C. burnetii and A. phagocytophilum with other agents whereas moderate correlation was observed for A. marginalexB. bigemina x B. bovis. Cows were more seropositive for T. vivax whereas calves were more seropositive for B. bovis and B. bigemina. The highest number of seropositive animals by a single agent was observed for T. vivax (15.2%). Co-seropositivity for T. vivax + A. marginale was higher in cows (25.5%) and for T. vivax + B. bovis + B. bigemina + A. marginale was higher in calves (57.5%). The high seropositivity correlation for A. marginale x B. bovis x B. bigemina is probably due to the presence of the tick biological vector, Rhipicephalus microplus, in the studied farms. Common transmission pathways, mediated by hematophagous dipterans and fomites, may explain the high co-seropositivity of cows for A. marginale and T. vivax. Low seropositivity to C. burnetii is probably due to the type of breeding system employed (extensive). Seropositivity for A. phagocytophilum in only one animal suggests the occurrence of a cross-serological reaction with another agent of the genus Anaplasma."

The Odenwald Hill region (OWH) in southwestern Germany is classified as a TBE risk region and frequent case numbers but also more severe infections have been reported within the past decade. The objective of the present study was to survey the prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in Methods: Ticks were collected by the flagging methods supported by a crowdsourcing project implementing the interested public as collectors to cover completely and collect randomly a 3532 km Results: Using the crowd sourcing approach we could analyse a total of 17,893 ticks. The prevalence of TBEV in Conclusions: TBEV prevalence within the OWH risk regions is comparatively low which is probably due to our methodological approach and may more likely reflect prevalence of natural TBEV foci. As for other European regions, TBEV genetics show a discontinuous phylogeny indicating among others an association with bird migration. Mutations within the pE gene are associated with more frequent, severe and fatal TBE infections in the OWH risk region."

Management and control of vector-borne disease require actual epidemiological data to better assess and anticipate the risk of (re)emergence of tick-borne diseases in the region. To simplify and reduce the costs of such large-scale surveys, we implemented a high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR system suitable for the screening of the main bacterial and parasitic genera involved in tick-borne disease and potentially circulating in the area. We used the new screening tool to perform an exploratory epidemiological study on 132 adult specimens of Amblyomma variegatum and 446 of Rhipicephalus microplus collected in Guadeloupe and Martinique. Not only the system was able to detect the main pathogens of the area—Ehrlichia ruminantium, Rickettsia africae, Anaplasma marginale, Babesia bigemina and Babesia bovis—but the system also provided evidence of unsuspected microorganisms in Caribbean ticks, belonging to the Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Borrelia and Leishmania genera. Our study demonstrated how high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR technology can assist large-scale epidemiological studies, providing a rapid overview of tick-borne pathogen and microorganism diversity, and opening up new research perspectives for the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens."

Ticks (n = 432, including 8 larvae, 59 nymphs, and 365 adults) were sampled from domiciled dogs (n = 73) living in Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul (Midwest Brazil). All ticks were morphologically identified as R. sanguineus. Genomic DNA was extracted in pools (three to five ticks per animal) and was used for definition of R. sanguineus haplotypes (based on 16S rRNA analysis) and pathogen identification (Cercopithifilaria sp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Hepatozoon canis, Babesia vogeli and Rickettsia spp.). Rhipicephal us sanguineus specimens were identified as haplotypes A and B. DNA of Cercopithifilaria bainae (43.83%; 32/73), Ehrlichia canis (24.65%; 18/73), Anaplasma platys (19.17%; 14/73), and Hepatozoon canis (5.47%; 4/73) was detected. The identity of pathogens was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The present study confirms the presence of haplotypes A and B of R. sanguineus in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul and its importance as a vector of several pathogens of veterinary concern. Finally, this is the first report to identify C. bainae in ticks in the Midwestern region of Brazil."

		"abstract": "Ticks and the vast array of pathogens they transmit, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths, constitute a growing burden for human and animal health worldwide. In Cuba, the major tropical island in the Caribbean, ticks are an important cause of vector-borne diseases affecting livestock production, pet animal health and, to a lesser extent, human health. The higher number of tick species in the country belong to the Argasidae family and, probably less known, is the presence of an autochthonous tick species in the island, Ixodes capromydis. Herein, we provide a comprehensive review of the ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) affecting animal and human health in Cuba. The review covers research results including ecophysiology of ticks, the epidemiology of TBPs, and the diagnostic tools used currently in the country for the surveillance of TBPs. We also introduce the programs implemented in the country for tick control and the biotechnology research applied to the development of anti-tick vaccines."

		"abstract": "Many pathogens are transmitted by tick bites, including Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp., Babesia and Theileria sensu stricto species. These pathogens cause infectious diseases both in animals and humans. Different types of immune effector mechanisms could be induced in hosts by these microorganisms, triggered either directly by pathogen-derived antigens or indirectly by molecules released by host cells binding to these antigens. The components of innate immunity, such as natural killer cells, complement proteins, macrophages, dendritic cells and tumor necrosis factor alpha, cause a rapid and intense protection for the acute phase of infectious diseases. Moreover, the onset of a pro-inflammatory state occurs upon the activation of the inflammasome, a protein scaffold with a key-role in host defense mechanism, regulating the action of caspase-1 and the maturation of interleukin-1β and IL-18 into bioactive molecules. During the infection caused by different microbial agents, very similar profiles of the human innate immune response are observed including secretion of IL-1α, IL-8, and IFN-α, and suppression of superoxide dismutase, IL-1Ra and IL-17A release. Innate immunity is activated immediately after the infection and inflammasome-mediated changes in the pro-inflammatory cytokines at systemic and intracellular levels can be detected as early as on days 2–5 after tick bite. The ongoing research field of “inflammasome biology” focuses on the interactions among molecules and cells of innate immune response that could be responsible for triggering a protective adaptive immunity. The knowledge of the innate immunity mechanisms, as well as the new targets of investigation arising by bioinformatics analysis, could lead to the development of new methods of emergency diagnosis and prevention of tick-borne infections."

		"abstract": "A workshop on ticks and tick-borne diseases (T&TBDs) was held on June 25 and 26, 2019, at the Tropical Pesticides Research Institute, Division of Livestock and Human Diseases Vector Control, Arusha, Tanzania. The objectives of the workshop were to discuss the current situation and to formulate actionable strategies to improve surveillance and control of T&TBDs in Africa. The workshop was funded by the National Research Foundation and the Cape Peninsula University of Technology and attended by livestock health providers, farmers, and researchers from East, West, and Southern African countries. During the workshop, experts presented recent surveillance data focused on T&TBDs; participants discussed research opportunities and community engagement. The primary outcome of the workshop was the creation of a new research consortium known as The African Consortium for T&TBDs. The consortium is intended to function as a community for researchers, students, farmers, policymakers, extension workers, and community members who are interested in the advancement of T&TBD control. The consortium will engage in research activities that focus on comprehensive surveillance of T&TBDs, developing tick acaricide resistance, alternative tick control programs, and policy development and education. These areas were identified as top priorities to be developed to improve T&TBD control on the continent."
