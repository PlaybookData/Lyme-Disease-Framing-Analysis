		"abstract": "An understanding of the influence of climate change on Ixodes scapularis, the main vector of Lyme disease in North America, is a fundamental component in assessing changes in the spatial distribution of human risk for the disease. We used a climate suitability model of I. scapularis to examine the potential effects of global climate change on future Lyme disease risk in North America. A climate-based logistic model was first used to explain the current distribution of I. scapularis in North America. Climate change scenarios were then applied to extrapolate the model in time and produce forecasts of vector establishment. The spatially modeled relationship between I. scapularis presence and large-scale environmental data generated the current pattern of I. scapularis across North America with an accuracy of 89% (p<0.0001). Extrapolation of the model revealed a significant expansion of I. scapularis north into Canada with an increase in suitable habitat of 213% by the 2080's. Climate change will also result in a retraction of the vector from southern United States, and movement into the central United States. This report predicts the effect of climate change on Lyme disease risk and specifically forecasts the emergence of a tick-borne infectious disease in Canada. Our modeling approach could thus be used to outline where future control strategies and prevention efforts need to be applied."

Specifically, this unit discusses the extraction of RNA from infected mouse tissues, removal of contaminating genomic DNA from the purified RNA, preparation of cDNA and genomic DNA standards, LightCycler-based PCR, and a relative quantification analysis of the cDNA. Q-RT-PCR as a highly relevant and powerful tool used to detect gene expression by bacteria within mammalian host tissues. It is also an invaluable technique used to measure and assess the small differences in expression that can exist among a set of genes, whereas this type of analysis is not feasible using less-sensitive techniques such as indirect immunofluorescence analysis or qualitative RT-PCR. Although the protocols described herein are tailored for B. burgdorferi, they are broadly applicable to other microbes."

		"abstract": "In order to be sustained within its enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi must adapt to two strikingly different environments, the arthropod vector and the mammalian host. The ability to rapidly adapt to environmental changes is therefore presumed to be central to spirochete survival and pathogenic programs. Indeed, it has now been well established that tick feeding initiates extensive changes in both gene expression and protein composition, collectively referred to as \"host adaptation,\" a process that is thought to continue throughout infection. The paucibacillary nature of borrelial infections, however, has hampered our ability to study this bacterium in vivo. To circumvent this limitation, an animal model was developed for obtaining sufficient numbers of organisms to directly examine differential gene expression and antigenic composition of B. burgdorferi within the context of the mammalian host. The DMC model allows for a direct comparison of host-adapted B. burgdorferi and their in vitro-cultivated counterparts."

The resulting instrument measured theoretical constructs such as attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, skills, and knowledge relative to Lyme disease. The survey assessment tool is described here, and the tool development process, the validation and reliability process, and results are presented. The assessment tool was created by using a standard instrument development process that first involved constructing possible items (questions) based on several health behavior theories and known health risk behaviors. These items were then further refined by using focus groups, a small pilot study, factor analysis, and a large-scale pilot study. Validity and reliability indices were established with a test-retest reliability coefficient of .66, and finally the tool was used among a population living in a Lyme-disease-endemic area. Cronbach's alpha coefficients of .737 for behavioral items, .573 for cognitive items, and .331 for environmental items were established."

		"abstract": "During a 3-yr comprehensive study, 196 ixodid ticks (9 species) were collected from 89 passerine birds (32 species) from 25 localities across Canada to determine the distribution of avian-associated tick species and endogenous Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner. We report the following first records of tick parasitism on avian hosts: the rabbit-associated tick, Ixodes dentatus Marx, from Manitoba and Ontario; the mouse tick, Ixodes muris Bishopp and Smith, from British Columbia; and the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, from New Brunswick. Moreover, we provide the first record of the Neotropical tick, Amblyomma humerale Koch (1 nymph), in Canada and its parasitism of any bird. This tick was compared morphologically with nymphs of other Neotropical Amblyomma spp., and genetically, using a 344-bp fragment of the 12S rDNA sequence of 41 New World Amblyomma species. The first collections of the western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls, from passerine species in Alberta and British Columbia, are also reported. Notably, we further report the first isolation of B. burgdorferi from the bird tick, Ixodes auritulus Neumann, collected from an American robin, Turdus migratorius L., on Vancouver Island. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi-positive I. auritulus larvae were collected from a reservoir-competent fox sparrow, Passerella iliaca (Merrem). Our findings indicate that ground-dwelling passerines, in particular, are parasitized by certain ixodid ticks and play an important role across Canada in the wide dispersal of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks and increased risk of Lyme disease exposure."

Six beagles and two control ones were used in the test. Formation of outer surface protein A specific antibodies (OspA antibodies) and borrelia specific immonoglobulins (IgG) was measured by Western blot and EIA in the sera samples. The tissue samples were used for detection of borreliae by cultivation method and dark field microscopy (DFM). Formation of IgG antibodies and OspA antibodies after vaccination was observed. The maximum titer level of antibodies was reached between 21. and 49. day after vaccination and then slowly decreased. Presence of borreliae was detected only in skin biopsies of non-vaccinated dogs. The post mortem tissue samples showed presence of borreliae in all of the samples of the non-vaccinated dogs. The tissues of the vaccinated dogs were not infected with borreliae, except for two samples of dog with low titer levels of OspA antibodies. The development of the new vaccine is based on preparation of recombinant outer surface proteins (e.g. rOspA and rOspC) of B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi and B. garinii origin. Chosen recombinant proteins were successfully expressed in E. coli. The obtained purified proteins are currently being tested on laboratory BALB/c mice. Formation of specific antibodies against some recombinant proteins has been confirmed. These proteins are suitable candidates for preparation of a vaccine prototype and they will be subsequently used in challenge tests."

For several years, research and development have been directed towards a vaccine for the prevention of this debilitating disease. Numerous animal studies demonstrate that pre-existing antibodies against the outer surface proteins of B. burgdorferi can prevent infection and disease caused by this organism. In this communication, using recombinant DNA technology, genes from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii were inserted into E. coli-expression vectors and the rOspA were produced.

The samples were screened for the presence of B. burgdorferi IgG antibodies with a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit (ImmunoWell Borrelia, Genbio, San Diego). As a result, one subject in the each group (0.4% and 0.7%, respectively) yielded positive result, however as these sera gave positive reaction in rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, these were evaluated as cross-reactivity (false positivity).

The antibody levels for A. phagocytophilum (IgG/Ap-Ab) and B. microti (IgM/Bm-Ab) were evaluated in two series of samples from the same persons (interval 5-6 months) by immunoenzymatic tests (Borrelia Biomedica, Austria), immunofluorescence test (Human Granulotic Ehrlichiosis IFA IgG and Babesia microti IFA IgG from MRL Diagnostics). Positive results for A. phagocytophilum were defined as titres > or =1:256 and for B. microti > or =1:64 and B. burgdorferi > or = 11 BBU/ml. Positive results for IgG B. burgdorferi during the first collection were revealed in 16% (n=24/142) of individuals from endemic area and in 4% (n=2/50) of the control group, which was statistically relevant (p<0,05). IgG A. phagocytophilum antibodies were present in 3,5% (n=5/142) of individuals from the endemic area, but for IgG B. microti antibodies (IgG/Bm-Ab) no positive results were found. No IgG antibodies against A. phagocytophilum and B.microti, were found in individuals from non-endemic area. During the second collection, in individuals from the endemic area, the antibodies against B. burgdorferi were found in 9,8% (n=14/142), IgG A. phagocytophilum antibodies (IgG/Ap-Ab) in 4,9% (n=7/142) and against B. microti (IgG/ Bm-Ab) in 1,4% (n=2/142). The antibodies against B. Burgdorferi were found in 2% (n=1/150) of the control group during the second collection, and no IgG against A. phagocytophilum and B. microti were found. [corrected] Evaluating the seroprevalance of the studied antibodies in both collections, a conclusion was drawn that there was no significant increase of antibodies levels directly after the highest exposition to tick bites. None of individuals showed 4-fold antibody level increase between the first and second collection. The seroconversion for IgG/Bm-Ab antibodies was present in 1,4% (n=2/142) of individuals, in those 2 cases a 2-fold antibodies level increase was observed. As far as IgG/Ap-Ab antibodies are concerned the seroconversion was observed in 2,1% (n-3/142), but only one case shown a 3-fold antibodies level increase. No seroconversion of B. burgdorferi antibodies were found in the second collection."

The highest consistency of findings was reached comparing strains Ir 112 and K 24, and the same high agreement of results was observed between the strains Ir 105 and V 123 and also Ir 112 and Ir 105. Higher consistency of findings of serologically examined horses with geographically close trains is in accordance with greater similarity of protein profiles of Slovak strains compared to the American strain."

SGE injected together with spirochetes reduced the numbers of leukocytes and gammadelta-T lymphocytes in infected epidermis at early time-points post infection. In draining lymph nodes, the anti-inflammatory effect of SGE was manifested by the decrease of total cell count compared with that in mice treated with inactivated SGE. Changes in subpopulations of immunocompetent cells apparently reflected the effect of SGE on the proliferation of spirochetes in the host. The significance of tick saliva anti-inflammatory effect for saliva activated transmission of B. afzelii is shown."

Two years of live trapping showed that Eastern chipmunks, Tamias striatus, were captured with significantly greater frequency in some residential areas than white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus, whereas the proportion of white-footed mouse captures was higher or similar to chipmunk captures in the undeveloped natural areas. Both mice and chipmunks seemed to adapt well to managed residential landscapes, with residential sites yielding similar or significantly greater numbers of captures compared with undeveloped sites. In areas where chipmunk captures outnumbered mice, larval tick burdens on mice were either higher or no different than in areas where few or no chipmunks were captured, in contrast to previous studies suggesting that alternate hosts should reduce larval burdens on mice. Chipmunks apparently play an important role in the Lyme disease transmission cycle in these residential settings."

In 2002, after the infectious, flu-like disease, she revealed arthritis and drowsiness, also with memory and language impairment. The patient continued to have symptoms consistent with previously examined clumsiness. She was diagnosed with Lyme via ELISA and PCR, and treated. She made a full recovery from acute symptoms. After a few months, neurological and neuropsychological examinations were performed. On the background of mild cognitive decline apraxia and difficulties of attention were noted as the main problems. A apraxia of the right hand complicated the patient's life and depreciated her quality of life. The patient underwent MRI examination. FSE, FAST and FLAIR sequences were made. The MRI demonstrated the appearance of several small hyperintense lesions in the white matter of the left and right frontal and left parietal lobe. These lesions were typical of the post-inflammatory leucoencephalopathy. Additionally, a ring-shaped, low-intensity lesion in the posterior part of the left parietal lobe was noticed. The lesion was 8 mm in diameter and described to be an old toxoplasmosis lesion. The patient had been treated and the symptoms consistent with Lyme disease resolved. Patient continues to have symptoms consistent with focal destruction of the parietal lobe. Over the past six months, she has not progressed and relapsed in a manner that is consistent with MS."

		"abstract": "The aim of the paper was an attempt to correlate clinical signs with the presence of DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) s.l. and the antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. in the blood of dogs. Among the animals studied there were 62 dogs delivered to the Veterinary Clinic in Szczecin and 30 from the Municipal Animal Shelter in Szczecin with varied clinical signs of borreliosis. In all cases the owners admitted frequent contacts of their dogs with ticks, both in the past, as well as shortly before the onset of sickness. We used two methods: PCR for detecting DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. and ELISA test for detecting antibodies against the spirochete. Lameness, the principal symptom of canine borreliosis was the most frequent symptom of the group of 31 PCR-positive animals. The other most common symptoms in PCR-positive dogs were fever, swelling of joints and loss of body weight. DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l. was most frequently detected in the blood of dogs of the group 2-5 years old (13/54.1 %). ELISA tests specific for IgG antibodies were positive in 37 of 92 sera (40.2 %) taken from examined dogs. Lameness was observed in 15 of 37 IgG-seropositive dogs and in 25 of 55 seronegative animals. In 54 % of dogs with the antibodies, swelling of instep- and wrist joints was observed compared to only 24.4 % in seronegative dogs. An attempt to correlate the PCR results with the results of tests detecting antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. revealed that fewer than half (45.1 %) of the dogs with presence of DNA of the spirochete, developed an immune response. Therefore the transfer of B. burgdorferi s.l. form, the primary lesion to the target tissues, is possible in dogs which did not develop immune response or develop an insufficient response. Among 92 borreliosis-suspected dogs 54 (over 58 %) were diagnosed positively using laboratory methods. In most cases there was a correlation between clinical symptoms of borreliosis and presence of DNA B. burgdorferi, thus PCR may contribute to improving to a large extent diagnostic of canine Lyme disease."

The infection is caused by the spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex which circulate between tick vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts. The complex of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. encompasses at least 12 species. Genetic variability within and between each species has a considerable impact on pathogenicity, clinical picture, diagnostic methods, transmission mechanisms and its ecology. The distribution of distinct genospecies varies with the different geographic area and over a time. In recent years, new molecular assays have been developed for direct detection and classification of different Borrelia strains. Profound studies of strain heterogeneity initiated a new approach to vaccine development and routine diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in Europe. Although great progress has been made in characterization of the organism, the present knowledge of ecology and epidemiology of B. burgdorferi s.l. is still incomplete. Further information on the distribution of different Borrelia species and subspecies in their natural reservoir hosts and vectors is needed."

Early forms of the disease were manifested in 70 % of all reported cases. Geographically, the spread of the disease shows major differences in the number of cases reported in the individual districts. Antibodies persist long after the original attack, and there is a high incidence of antibodies in the healthy population in endemic areas. The presence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi antigens was proven in the serum of 250 blood donors by 3 different screening tests in 4.4-15.6 % of all persons, signifying different sensitivity as well as specificity levels. Subsequent immunoblot examination confirmed the presence of specific antibodies in 12.8 % of all persons, implying high exposure of the population in Slovakia to this infection, although it obviously proceeds in inapparent forms in the majority of cases (Tab. 2, Fig. 4, Ref. 14)."

Comparisons of the several libraries led to identification of several significantly differentially expressed transcripts. Additionally, over 500 new predicted protein sequences are described, including several novel gene families unique to ticks; no function can be presently ascribed to most of these novel families. Among the housekeeping-associated transcripts, we highlight those enzymes associated with post translation modification of amino acids, particularly those forming sulfotyrosine, hydroxyproline, and carboxyl-glutamic acid. Results support the hypothesis that gene duplication, most possibly including genome duplications, is a major player in tick evolution."

Sera of 20 children with acute peripheral palsy with neuroborreliosis, sera of 20 children with facial palsy without reference to Lyme disease and sera of 14 blood donors were tested for antibodies against human MnSOD using an ELISA.

The disease is typically characterized by an erythema migrans (EM) rash at the site of tick feeding. EM rashes have also been associated with feeding by Amblyomma americanum ticks despite evidence suggesting that they are incompetent vectors for Lyme disease. In 1996, a Borrelia organism only recently cultivated in the laboratory was described in A. americanum ticks and designated B. lonestari. This Borrelia is believed to be the etiologic agent of a novel Lyme-like disease, southern tick associated rash illness (STARI). This study examined ticks collected from eight eastern states to evaluate the epidemiology of B. lonestari, B. burgdorferi, and their tick hosts. Three hundred individual or small pool samples were evaluated from tick genera that included Amblyomma, Ixodes, and Dermacentor. DNA was extracted following tick homogenization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using primers derived from the flagellin gene that amplify sequences from both B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari. Species specific digoxigenin labeled probes were designed and used to differentiate between B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari. Borrelia DNA was detected in approximately 10% of the A. americanum and I. scapularis tick samples, but none was present in any of the Dermacentor samples tested. Positive samples were detected in ticks collected from Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and Virginia. This is the first known report of B. lonestari from Massachusetts and New York and the first detection in I. scapularis. This suggests that B. lonestari and its putative association with STARI may be more widespread than previously thought."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a serious infectious disease of humans and some domestic animals in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. It is caused by certain spirochetes in the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) species complex. The complex consists of 11 species (genospecies). Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii are the major agents of human disease. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. species are transmitted mainly by ticks belonging to the Ixodes ricinus species complex plus a few additional species not currently assigned to the complex. B. burgdorferi infections may produce an acute or chronic disease with a wide array of clinical symptoms such as erythema migrans (EM), carditis, arthritis, neuroborreliosis, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA). Differences in LB spirochetes 'genospecies' and strains/isolates determine the occurrence and severity of this multi-system disease. Accurate and reliable identification of the LB spirochetes in ticks as well as knowledge of their prevalence are essential for prevention against the disease and development of an effective vaccine. An overview of the knowledge of molecular factors with emphasis on potential protein-carbohydrate interactions in the tick-borrelia system is the main focus of this review."

		"abstract": "This review discusses the literature on B. burgdorferi infections in view of the rising incidence of this infection in general and the increasing concerns of horse owners and equine practitioners. Lyme disease, the clinical expression of Borrelia infections in man is an important health problem. The geographic distribution of B. burgdorferi infections in equidae should resemble that of human cases because the vector tick involved, Ixodes ricinus, feeds on both species and, indeed, the infection has been established many times in horses. However, a definite diagnosis of the disease \"Lyme borreliosis\" in human beings as well as in horses and other animals is often difficult to accomplish. Although a broad spectrum of clinical signs has been attributed to B. burgdorferi infections in horses, indisputable cases of equine Lyme borreliosis are extremely rare so far, if they exist at all."

		"abstract": "The purpose of this article is to outline the interaction between ophthalmologists and internists in the management of uveitis. Two issues will be addressed: 1) which strategies should the internist follow when asked to investigate a case of uveitis; and 2) in which systemic diseases should the internist order an ocular examination to rule out intraocular inflammation. The modern approach to the diagnosis of uveitis is based on the naming-meshing system popularized by Smith and Nozik. After a short history (ocular complaints, general health) an ophthalmic examination is carried out to determine the anatomic structures involved. Based on the results a uveitis is classified as anterior uveitis, intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis. Associated factors (eg, unilateral versus bilateral, acute versus chronic, granulomatous versus nongranulomatous, etc.) are also assessed. Based on this information the type of uveitis will be named (eg, acute, nongranulomatous, unilateral, anterior uveitis) and matched (meshing) to a potential list of etiologies (eg, viral iritis, HLA-B 27 associated iritis). Targeted questioning and selected medical and laboratory investigations based on the shortlist will then identify a possible cause for a particular patient's uveitis. In other words the ophthalmologist should never ask the internist to run the full battery of tests in a patient with uveitis. He rather should indicate which type of uveitis is present and what are the most likely diagnoses to be excluded. Many systemic diseases cause diffuse inflammation and are associated with uveitis. These include tuberculosis, spirochaetal diseases such as Lyme disease and syphilis, sarcoidosis, Behçet syndrome, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and HIV infection amongst many others. Routine ophthalmic examination in patients with systemic disease may be indicated for diverse reasons: to prevent profound damage due to asymptomatic uveitis in JIA; to detect diagnostic clues in patients with febris e causa ignota; or to rule out opportunistic infections in HIV positive patients. It is clear that the information gained from routine examination in systemic disease will be greatly dependent on the prevalence of ocular involvement in a particular disease."

		"abstract": "The diagnosis of Lyme disease in the presence of an acute optical neuritis always raises a difficult diagnostic problem. We present a case of Lyme-associated Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). A 17-year-old Eurasian young man presented with left-eye visual impairment for 1 month. This loss of vision acuity in the left eye is related to an optic neuropathy. Mitochondrial DNA testing showed a G to A substitution at position 11778 confirming a diagnosis of LHON. The family history disclosed a case of LHON in a maternal cousin. The mother's family is Asian. Besides, serum examination of anti-Borrelia antibodies was performed and was positive against Borrelia burgdorferi garinii. The patient history indicated that he had been possessing a dog and was living in an endemic area of Lyme disease. But he did not recall receiving a tick bite nor having any erythema chronicum migrans. Initial examination showed bilateral green-red axis colour vision defects which made us fear bilateralisation of the optic neuropathy, which occurred 2 months later (that is 3 months after the onset of symptoms on the left eye). An antibiotic treatment by ceftriaxone was administered for 4 weeks all in all; and a long term ubidecarenone therapy was established. At present, after a 1-year follow up, the eyes' conditions remains unchanged. To our knowledge, this would be the first case reporting such an association, in which we can discuss the fortuitous character or the role of the infectious factor in the developing of the mitochondrial pathology. This observation also raises the problem of the positive diagnosis of Lyme disease when tick bite and erythema are absent or underestimated."

In total, 818 feeding ticks were recovered from 73 infested yellow-necked mice, Apodemus flavicollis Melchior; in addition, bank voles, Clethrionomys glareolus Schreber, were rarely captured and proved to be weakly parasitized. Only 2.7% of A. flavicollis and 2.2% of 320 engorging larvae were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive for the bacterium. All spirochete-PCR-positive samples yielded exclusively B. burgdorferi s.s. This genospecies was also the most prevalent in questing nymphs and accounted for 87.5% of the total number of Borrelia infections in nymphal ticks collected during May and June 2 yr later. The presence of the same genospecies both in naturally engorged larvae and blood-positive animals as well as the high predominance of B. burgdorferi s.s. in questing nymphs strongly differs from most study sites investigated in Europe. This unique pattern of Borrelia-diversity in both rodents and ticks seems to be determined by highly site-specific host vertebrate cenosis, and yellow-necked mice are involved in the maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.s. in the forest habitat. However, the transmission efficiency of this spirochete from the mice to the I. ricinus vector seems to be very low. The research provides additional information on the complexity of B. burgdorferi s.l. ecology in Europe, pointing to the importance of the local host community."

By adequate antimicrobial therapy they are treatable and usually show a good prognosis. Recovery may be delayed, some patients suffer from residual difficulties.

Thus, the 2-step serology of screening by ELISA and confirmation by immunoblot remains the most important diagnostic test of lyme borreliosis. The detection of borrelia by PCR or culture is of lesser importance due to the limited sensitivity, despite of the high specificity. In clinical practice, the risk of exposure to ticks and the stage of the clinical presentation guide the choice of appropriate diagnostic procedures and their interpretation."

A minority of the infected individuals develop neuroborreliosis, consisting of various combinations of meningitis, radiculitis and (cranial) neuritis. Lyme carditis, presenting with second or third degree atrioventricular block, is infrequent on both continents. Diagnostic limitations and the protean manifestations of Lyme borreliosis frequently give rise to misunderstandings and overdiagnosis of Lyme disease. Targeted use of Lyme serology, judicious application of a case definition, strict adherence to established treatment options and thorough patient information may lead the narrow path between unjustified exclusion and careless assumption of the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."

Ultrasound was the initial imaging method used in all cases; this was supplemented by MRI in three patients. Four children were diagnosed to be suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), one child from Lyme Arthritis, whereas in one child no underlying disease was identified. Well-demarcated hypoechogenic lesions without signs of perfusion extending from the shoulder (two patients), elbow (one patient), hip (one patient), knee (1) or ankle (one patient) far into the adjacent musculature were detected on ultrasonography. A direct connection to the joint was demonstrated in all cases. All synovial cysts in the five arthritic patients resolved rapidly with medical treatment for arthritis, whereas the cyst persisted in the non-JIA patient. Uncommon synovial cysts occur in particular as a complication of arthritis. Ultrasonography is the initial and follow-up imaging method of choice, which can be supplemented by MRI in unusual cases. Apart from treatment for arthritis, no specific therapeutic interventions were required in the present cases."

In Europe Lyme borreliosis is most frequent in Central Europe and Scandinavia (up to 155 cases per 100,000 individuals) and is caused by the species, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii. The recently detected genospecies A14S may also play a role in skin manifestations. Microbiological diagnosis in European patients must consider the heterogeneity of borreliae for development of diagnostic tools. According to guidelines of the USA and Germany, serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a two-step procedure (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as first step, if reactive; followed by immunoblot). The sensitivity and standardization of immunoblots has been considerably enhanced by use of recombinant antigens (p100, p58, p41i, VlsE, OspC, DbpA) including those expressed primarily in vivo (VlsE and DbpA) instead of whole cell lysates. VlsE is the most sensitive antigen for IgG antibody detection, OspC for IgM antibody detection. At present, detection rates for serum antibodies are 20%-50% in stage I, 70%-90% in stage II, and nearly 100% in stage III Lyme disease. Detection of the etiological agent by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be confined to specific indications and specialized laboratories. Recommended specimens are skin biopsy specimens, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and synovial fluid. The best results are obtained from skin biopsies with culture or PCR (50%-70%) and synovial tissue or fluid (50%-70% with PCR). CSF yields positive results in only 10%-30% of patients except when the duration of symptoms is shorter than 2 weeks (50% sensitivity). Methods which are not recommended or adequately documented for diagnosis are antigen tests on body fluids, PCR of urine, and lymphocyte transformation tests."

Based on an isolated positive Borrelia burgdorferi serology (later interpreted as a cross-reaction), early ceftriaxone was initiated, in the suspect of Lyme borreliosis. Even after the diagnosis was corrected into that of a neurosyphilis, ceftriaxone administration was continued, until it achieved complete clinical and microbiological success after 24 days of treatment in a day-hospital setting, and three-weekly penicillin administrations. When considering the differential diagnosis, a luetic aetiology should not be underestimated when facing young patients with signs-symptoms of a meningoencephalitis. Our case report was characterized by an extremely low patient's age, compared with the occurrence of tertiary neurosyphilis, more than three years after the last sexual contacts. The diagnosis was confirmed by highly positive treponemal and non-treponemal serum and cerebrospinal fluid serology, and several suggestive clinical manifestations: seizures, altered mentation, cognitive impairment, lip drop, and anisochoria. These concomitant findings, together with a neuroradiological report indicating a diffuse meningoencephalitis, allowed us to confirm the diagnosis of neurosyphilis, together with a demonstrated cross-reaction of B. burgdorferi serology. Although ceftriaxone benefits from its once-daily administration (and can be easily delivered on outpatient basis), it is not the firstline treatment of neurosyphilis. However, our experience demonstrated a favourable and rapid response to ceftriaxone, in the absence of toxicity and disease sequelae."

		"abstract": "To determine whether cats in the northeastern United States develop serum antibodies against antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum and whether coinfection with the 2 organisms occurs. Serum samples from 84 healthy cats and 9 cats with lameness, fever, anorexia, or fatigue. Serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum were measured with an ELISA incorporating a whole-cell preparation or purified recombinant antigens, by means of Western blot analysis, or indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) staining. ELISA results indicated that 44 of 93 (47%) sera contained antibodies against > or = 3 B. burgdorferi antigens, whereas 43 (46%) were reactive to whole-cell B. burgdorferi. Serum reactivity to protein 35, VlsE, and outer surface proteins A and F was most common. Seropositivity to > or = 3 antigens occurred at the same rate (5/9) in the 9 ill cats as in the 84 healthy cats (46% [39/84]). Of 13 sera reactive to recombinant antigens, 9 were seropositive as measured by Western blot testing with whole-cell antigen. Seropositivity rates of 30% and 38% were detected for antibodies against A phagocytophilum via IFA and ELISA testing, respectively. Fifteen (16%) sera had antibodies against both pathogens. Cats living in areas infested by Ixodes scapularis ticks are exposed to B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum and, in some instances, may be coinfected. Most cats appeared healthy. An ELISA incorporating specific recombinant antigens may be used adjunctively with Western blot and other assays to confirm B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum infection in cats."

Owing to the recent confirmation of human tick-borne encephalitis cases, vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis was offered to the population living in the endemic area through the use of leaflets and media campaigns. At the time of the initial dose, information and enrollment to this cohort study was carried out. Participants' characteristics, frequency of tick-bites and preventive measures were included in questionnaires. Logistic analysis was used to determine behavioural differences in activities taken in order to prevent tick bites. In total, 70% of the permanent residents had themselves vaccinated before the next tick season. Of the studied participants 356/517 (69%) regularly took preventive measures in their environment and/or personally. Women in particular, and those previously treated for a tick-borne disease, took significantly more preventive measures. When analysing all variables together, spending less time in a tick-endemic area and being tick-bitten during the latest tick season significantly increased the probability of taking preventive measures. After being tick-bitten, men were more inclined to start taking preventive measures than women. Awareness of the risks caused by living in a high tick-endemic area influenced the participant's daily life through preventive activities. Public health action should be considered, thus encouraging out-of-door activities for the population without anxiety as to the risks of contracting tick-borne disease after being tick-bitten."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalopathies constitute a broad range of infectious diseases affecting the brain and other parts of the CNS. The causative agents are both viral and bacterial. This review focuses on the current most important tick-borne human diseases: tick-borne encephalitis (TBE; including Powassan encephalitis) and Lyme borreliosis. Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and Colorado tick fever (CTF), less common tick-borne diseases associated with encephalopathy, are also discussed. TBE is the most important flaviviral infection of the CNS in Europe and Russia, with 10 000-12 000 people diagnosed annually. The lethality of TBE in Europe is 0.5% and a post-encephalitic syndrome is seen in over 40% of affected patients, often producing a pronounced impairment in quality of life. There is no specific treatment for TBE. Two vaccines are available to prevent infection. Although these have a good protection rate and good efficacy, there are few data on long-term immunity. Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe and North America, with >50 000 cases annually. Localised early disease can be treated with oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), doxycycline or amoxicillin. The later manifestations of meningitis, arthritis or acrodermatitis can be treated with oral doxycycline, oral amoxicillin or intravenous ceftriaxone; intravenous benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) or cefotaxime can be used as alternatives. The current use of vaccines against Lyme borreliosis in North America is under discussion, as the LYMErix vaccine has been withdrawn from the market because of possible adverse effects, for example, arthritis. RMSF and CTF appear only in North America. RMSF is an important rickettsial disease and is effectively treated with doxycycline. There is no treatment or preventative measure available for CTF."

		"abstract": "Lyme-Arthritis is one of the most frequent manifestations of Lyme disease. Transient arthritides may already develop in the early disease stage. However, typical Lyme arthritis manifests weeks to months after the infection as intermittent mon- or oligoarthritis predominantly affecting the knees. Massive knee effusions may lead to popliteal cysts that often rupture. Chronic arthritides are rare. The diagnosis of Lyme arthritis mainly is based on clinical grounds and confirmed by laboratory tests. Direct detection of the causing agent by culture is difficult and not suitable for clinical use. With polymerase chain reaction based assays in up to 80% of untreated patients with Lyme arthritis B. burgdorferi DNA can be detected in joint fluid or synovial membrane specimens. While this method is not widely available yet it will become a routine diagnostic tool in Lyme arthritis in the near future. Borrelia serology is still the most important laboratory test. A negative serology almost certainly rules out Lyme arthritis. A positive serology alone, however, does not proof Lyme disease and must be critically interpreted in context with clinical symptoms."

This analysis was performed to investigate relation between seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG and carotid atherosclerosis. The cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania was conducted in a general community living in a region with endemic Lyme disease. A random sample of 2483 individuals aged 45-79 years was available for the present analysis. Carotid atherosclerosis was sonographically assessed as intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery and as prevalent atherosclerotic plaques in the extracranial carotid arteries. IgG antibodies to Borrelia were determined by ELISA. IgG antibodies to Borrelia were found positive (> 10 IU/mL) in 108 subjects (4.3%). Persons with and without positive anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies differed with respect to carotid intima-media thickness values (0.863 +/- 0.017 mm versus 0.792 +/- 0.004 mm; p < 0.001) and prevalent carotid plaques (odds ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.53-4.61; p = 0.001), respectively. Seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG was also associated with both atherosclerotic endpoints when age, sex and further atherogenic risk factors and confounders were included in multivariable statistical models. In a region with endemic Lyme disease, seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies is independently associated with atherosclerosis. Our findings add support to the hypothesis that exposure to infectious pathogens increases the atherosclerosis risk."

We used an IGS fragment for typing East African relapsing fever Borrelia spp. Borrelia recurrentis and their louse vectors showed 2 sequence types, while 4 B. duttonii and their tick vectors had 4 types. IGS typing was unable to discriminate between the tick- and louseborne forms of disease. B. crocidurae, also present in Africa, was clearly resolved from the B. recurrentis/B. duttonii complex. IGS analysis of ticks showed relapsing fever Borrelia spp. and a unique clade, distant from those associated with relapsing fever, possibly equivalent to a novel species in ticks from this region. Clinical significance of this spirochete is undetermined."

Prompt antimicrobial therapy using oral agents such as doxycycline or amoxicillin is successful among more than 90% of patients. Inadequate penetration of oral agents into the CNS may result in the development of overt neuroborreliosis. The parenteral agent ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for severe acute and chronic infections, due to good penetration into CSF, convenient single daily dosage regimen and proven high efficacy in clinical trials involving a wide variety of disseminated infections. Regardless of therapeutic agent, there appears to a small minority of patients (<10%) who do not respond; such cases may be due to long-term persistence of borrelial cysts and to misdiagnoses based solely on seropositivity. Several adjunct therapies are available, including hyperbaric oxygen therapy and immune system supplements, but clinical trials have yet to be conducted."

The sustained expression of adhesion molecules in the synovium of patients with chronic Lyme arthritis seems to contribute to this chronic inflammation. Whether cell adhesion molecules influence the early steps of Borreliosis is unclear. Therefore, we examined the expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1 and NCAM-1 in synovial cells exposed to two different Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains Geho and B31. The mRNA expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1 and NCAM-1 was not changed in synovial cells exposed to B31. Whereas ICAM-2 and VCAM-1 was upregulated, NCAM-1 mRNA was downregulated and ICAM-1 mRNA was unchanged by strain Geho. The ICAM-1 protein expression on the synovial cell surface was downregulated by both strains. Differential regulation of adhesion molecule mRNA, and subsequent high turnover or elevated shedding from the cell membrane may contribute to early pathogenesis in Lyme arthritis."

We hypothesized that if a qualitative difference between the cerebrospinal fluid and the serum immunoblot-banding patterns was observed, then the borrelia antibodies found in the CSF could not be the result of leakage of serum antibodies to the CSF due to blood-brain barrier damage, but rather had to be produced intrathecally. CSF/serum pairs from 69 NB patients and from 85 control patients with other neurological disorders were investigated. All samples were tested blindly by immunoblot and a commercial capture ELISA kit for NB. The concordance between the two methods was 85.7%. When using the other method as reference, the accuracy of the two assays in the two patient materials was similar: 80% for sensitivity and 95% for specificity. Four types of comparative immunoblot-banding patterns that reflected intrathecal borrelia antibody synthesis were distinguished. The study showed that a simple comparison between the immunoblot pattern of serum and CSF samples allows for a reliable diagnosis of NB by demonstration of intrathecal antibody production. This is the first study to show that a qualitative difference of the antibody response between the immune response of serum and CSF is a rule. The findings also imply that partly different B-cell populations are responsible for the antibody production in the blood and in the central nervous system. In addition, our observation provides possible implications for other infectious diseases with CNS involvement."

Here we report the development of a murine-targeted OspA vaccine utilizing Vaccinia virus to interrupt transmission of disease in the reservoir hosts, thus reducing incidence of human disease. Oral vaccination of mice with a single dose of Vaccinia expressing OspA resulted in high antibody titers to OspA, 100% protection of vaccinated mice from infection with B. burgdorferi, and significant clearance of B. burgdorferi from infected ticks fed on vaccinated animals. The results indicate the vaccine is effective and may provide a manner to reduce incidence of Lyme disease."

Of the 21 OspC types that have been identified, it has been postulated that types A, B, I, and K are specifically associated with invasive infections. Through an analysis of isolates collected from patients in Maryland we found that OspC types C, D, and N are also associated with invasive infections. This observation suggests that there is greater diversity in the group of OspC types associated with invasive infection than has been previously suggested. Detailed knowledge of the antigenic structure of OspC is essential for vaccine development. To determine if the antibody response to OspC is type specific, recombinant proteins of several different OspC types were immunoblotted and screened with sera from mice infected with isolates having known OspC types. These analyses revealed a high degree of specificity in the antibody response and suggested that the immunodominant epitopes of OspC reside in the variable domains of the protein. To localize these epitopes, OspC fragments were generated and screened with serum collected from infected mice. These analyses led to identification of previously uncharacterized epitopes that define the type specificity of the OspC antibody response. These analyses provide important insight into the antigenic structure of OspC and also provide a basis for understanding the variable nature of the antibody response to this important virulence factor of the Lyme disease spirochetes."

The understanding of mechanisms of arthritis in Lyme borreliosis may also shed light on the mechanisms of disease in other infectious and noninfectious arthritides."

Protein-saccharide complexes in these glycoconjugates were partially characterized by means of enzyme deglycosylation and mild alkali pretreatment of cryosections. The results of labeling were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Statistically evaluated results (relative labeling index, chi2 test) of gold labeling indicated that surfaces of Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 and external (outer) membrane vesicles (MVs) were covered with glycoconjugates containing O-glycosidically linked N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) and N-glycosidically linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc). The presence of N-linked GalNAc, sialic acid, mannose and fucose on the surfaces of outer membranes and MVs was probably due to an adherence of BSK-H medium components, especially rabbit serum, to Borrelia surfaces."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia genome is comprised of linear and circular elements, including a group of 32-kb circular plasmids (cp32s). Earlier analyses identified a bacteriophage, varphiBB-1, that may package cp32s, suggesting that these plasmids are prophages. cp32-8, cp32-9, and cp32-1 (plasmids L, N, and P, respectively) encode virulence factors such as the factor H binding, OspE proteins (BBL39, BBN38, and BBP38). Here the expression patterns of cp32-8 open reading frames (ORFs) in in vitro-cultivated 1-methyl-3-nitroso-nitroguanidine (MNNG)-treated and untreated spirochetes and during infection were assessed. ORFs BBL42 through BBL28, which encode several bacteriophage protein homologs, were found to be cotranscribed and expression was upregulated by MNNG. Immunoblotting revealed that MNNG-induced transcription led to increased protein production. The expression of several genes that reside outside of the BBL42-BBL28 operon was not affected by MNNG. Some of these genes, including OspE (BBL39), appear to represent morons. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR of spirochetes in mouse tissue revealed that although the phage operon was not induced during infection, transcription of BBL23 (previously designated BlyA), a putative holin, was upregulated. This observation indicates that some genes within the operon can be independently transcribed from internal promoters. Additional transcriptional analyses of the operon identified multiple transcriptional start sites and provided evidence for the expression of a homologous operon from other cp32s. The data support the hypothesis put forth by C. Eggers and D. S. Samuels (J. Bacteriol. 181:7308-7313, 1999) that the cp32s are prophages, a finding with broad implications for our understanding of Borrelia pathogenesis and Borrelia genome evolution."

		"abstract": "Motility and chemotaxis are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Controlling the phosphorylation state of CheY, a response regulator protein, is essential for regulating bacterial chemotaxis and motility. Rapid dephosphorylation of phosphorylated CheY (CheY-P) is crucial for cells to respond to environmental changes. CheY-P dephosphorylation is accomplished by one or more phosphatases in different species, including CheZ, CheC, CheX, FliY, and/or FliY/N. Only a cheX phosphatase homolog has been identified in the B. burgdorferi genome. However, a role for cheX in chemotaxis has not been established in any bacterial species. Inactivating B. burgdorferi cheX by inserting a flgB-kan cassette resulted in cells (cheX mutant cells) with a distinct motility phenotype. While wild-type cells ran, paused (stopped or flexed), and reversed, the cheX mutant cells continuously flexed and were not able to run or reverse. Furthermore, swarm plate and capillary tube chemotaxis assays demonstrated that cheX mutant cells were deficient in chemotaxis. Wild-type chemotaxis and motility were restored when cheX mutant cells were complemented with a shuttle vector expressing CheX. Furthermore, CheX dephosphorylated CheY3-P in vitro and eluted as a homodimer in gel filtration chromatography. These findings demonstrated that B. burgdorferi CheX is a CheY-P phosphatase that is essential for chemotaxis and motility, which is consistent with CheX being the only CheY-P phosphatase in the B. burgdorferi chemotaxis signal transduction pathway."

All clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis other than erythema migrans are notifiable to Folkehelseinstituttet, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. During the period 1995-2004 a total of 1506 cases of disseminated and chronic Lyme borreliosis were reported. Serological tests were the basis for laboratory diagnosis in almost all cases. The annual numbers of cases showed no clear trend over the period, but varied each year between 120 and 253 cases, with the highest number of cases reported in 2004. Seventy five per cent of cases with information on time of onset were in patients who fell ill during the months of June to October. There was marked geographical variation in reported incidence rates, with the highest rates reported from coastal counties in southern and central Norway. Fifty six per cent of the cases were in males and 44% in females. The highest incidence rate was found in children aged between 5 and 9 years. Neuroborreliosis was the most common clinical manifestation (71%), followed by arthritis/arthralgia (22%) and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (5%). Forty six per cent of patients were admitted to hospital. Prevention of borreliosis in Norway relies on measures to prevent tick bites, such as use of protective clothing and insect repellents, and early detection and removal of ticks. Antibiotics are generally not recommended for prophylaxis after tick bites in Norway."

The problem of a significant number of patients with clinical symptoms of lyme disease being reported as seronegative or equivocal by the confirmatory Western blot test was identified. Comparisons of current practice were made with American and European standards, and the Western blot scoring system revised. When applied retrospectively (April 2003 to March 2004), 39 (33 %) of 116 serum samples previously negative or equivocal became weak positive or stronger. Thirty-one (80 %) of these 39 samples were from patients with clinical details suggestive of early lyme disease. The changes were implemented and assessed prospectively for 6 months. There was a significant increase in the proportion of equivocal results, with fewer negatives compared to the same time period 1 year previously. This audit has helped clinicians in the diagnosis of lyme disease and the management of these patients in Scotland."

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles were determined for a group of culture-positive patients with Lyme disease-associated erythema migrans and were evaluated for an association with the genotype of the infecting B. burgdorferi strain. The DRB1*0101 allele carriage rate was higher in patients infected with RST3 strains (9/25 [36.0%]) than in patients infected with RST1 strains (2/28 [7.1%]) or RST2 strains (7/36 [19.4%]) (P=.010). The same relationship was found for carriage of the DRB1*0101-DQB1*0501 haplotype (P=.018), because of tight linkage disequilibrium. Similar associations could not be demonstrated for any of the other DRB1 and DQB1 alleles or haplotypes that were assessed. The DRB1*0101 allele and the DRB1*0101-DQB1*0501 haplotype may be relevant to the development of infection with strains from the least invasive genotypes of B. burgdorferi."

The pathogenesis of this kind of diarrhea includes cytokine action, intestinal inflammation, sequestration of red blood cells, apoptosis and increased permeability of endothelial cells in the gut microvasculature, and direct invasion of gut epithelial cells by various infectious agents. Of the travel-associated systemic infections presenting with fever, diarrhea occurs in patients with malaria, dengue fever and SARS. Diarrhea also occurs in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, when it is suggestive of legionellosis. Diarrhea can also occur in patients with systemic bacterial infections. In addition, although diarrhea is rare in patients with early Lyme borreliosis, the incidence is higher in those with other tick-borne infections, such as ehrlichiosis, tick-borne relapsing fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Unfortunately, it is often not established whether diarrhea is an initial symptom or develops during the course of the disease. The real incidence of diarrhea in some infectious diseases must also be questioned because it could represent an adverse reaction to antibiotics."

Using a globally distributed parasite of colonial seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae, we examined how host availability and geographic isolation influences this process. In particular, we sampled ticks from 30 populations of six different seabird host species, three in the Southern Hemisphere and three in the Northern Hemisphere. We show that parasite races have evolved independently on hosts of both hemispheres. Moreover, the degree of differentiation between tick races varied spatially within each region and suggests that the divergence of tick races is an ongoing process that has occurred multiple times across isolated areas. As I. uriae is vector to the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, these results may have important consequence for the epidemiology of this disease. With the increased occurrence of novel interspecific interactions due to global change, these results also stress the importance of the combined effects of gene flow and selection for parasite diversification."

Neurosyphilis, for example, was relatively common at the time and often led to the development of cognitive impairment and dementia. With the advent of effective antibiotic treatment, the association between infectious diseases and dementia became increasingly less frequent, although a resurgence of interest in this area has taken place during the past 15 years with the emergence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). This paper reviews the most frequent infectious causes of dementia, including prion diseases, as well as infections caused by herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus, cytomegalovirus, syphilis, borrelia and cysticercosis."

The enhancement of Lyme carditis in these mice is characterized by increased macrophage infiltration, correlating with augmented expression of the monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). The lack of CD18 results in the deficiency of all beta2 integrins, i.e., CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1/CR3), CD11c/CD18 (p150,95/CR4), and CD11d/CD18. To determine the roles of the various beta2 integrins in controlling the development of aggravated Lyme carditis, disease induction was analyzed in CD11a-/-, CD11b-/-, and CD11c-/- mice. CD11a-/- and CD11c-/- mice, but not CD11b-/- mice, developed aggravated Lyme carditis after exposure to B. burgdorferi. Similarly to CD18 hypomorph mice, CD11c-/- mice expressed higher levels of MCP-1, compared to both WT and CD11a-/- mice, as determined by in vitro analysis of MCP-1 secretion by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and in vivo analysis of MCP-1 mRNA expression in B. burgdorferi-infected hearts. On the other hand, CD11a deficiency was associated with heightened heart B. burgdorferi burden relative to that of WT mice. Overall, our results suggest that the increased severity of Lyme carditis in CD18 hypomorph mice is caused by deficiency in CD11a or CD11c, possibly via different mechanisms."

		"abstract": "During the natural mammal-tick infection cycle, the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi comes into contact with components of the alternative complement pathway. B. burgdorferi, like many other human pathogens, has evolved the immune evasion strategy of binding two host-derived fluid-phase regulators of complement, factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1). The borrelial complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 1 (CRASP-1) is a surface-exposed lipoprotein that binds both factor H and FHL-1. Analysis of CRASP-1 expression during the mammal-tick infectious cycle indicated that B. burgdorferi expresses this protein during mammalian infection, supporting the hypothesized role for CRASP-1 in immune evasion. However, CRASP-1 synthesis was repressed in bacteria during colonization of vector ticks. Analysis of cultured bacteria indicated that CRASP-1 is differentially expressed in response to changes in pH. Comparisons of CRASP-1 expression patterns with those of other infection-associated B. burgdorferi proteins, including the OspC, OspA, and Erp proteins, indicated that each protein is regulated through a unique mechanism."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, has a genome comprised of a linear chromosome and up to 21 plasmids. Loss of plasmids is associated with decreased infectivity and pathogenicity. Sixteen transformants were generated by transforming the noninfectious clone 5A13 with the recombinant plasmid pBBE22. The transformants were classified into nine groups based on plasmid content analysis. An infectivity study revealed that all nine transformants examined, each of which represented one of the plasmid patterns, were infectious in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) regardless of their genomic compositions. Tissue bacterial quantification revealed that the loss of plasmids significantly reduced the spirochete burden in the heart and joint tissues, not in the skin, suggesting virulence factors may be tissue specific. Four transformants containing lp28-1 induced severe arthritis in SCID mice, in contrast to the five transformants lacking lp28-1. These pathogenicity studies associated lp28-1 with an arthritic phenotype and further studies may identify factors that contribute to arthritic pathology."

		"abstract": "gammadelta T cells participate in the innate immune response to a variety of infectious microorganisms. They also link to the adaptive immune response through their induction of maturation of dendritic cells (DC) during the early phase of an immune response when the frequency of Ag-specific T cells is very low. We observe that in the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, synovial Vdelta1 T cells from Lyme arthritis synovial fluid potently induce maturation of DC, including production of IL-12, and increased surface expression of CD40 and CD86. The activated DC are then able to stimulate the Vdelta1 T cells to up-regulate CD25. Both of these processes are initiated primarily by Fas stimulation rather than CD40 activation of DC via high expression of Fas ligand by the Vdelta1 T cells. DC are resistant to Fas-induced death due to expression of high levels of the Fas inhibitor c-FLIP. This effect serves to divert Fas-mediated signals from the caspase cascade to the ERK MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. The findings affirm the importance of the interaction of certain T cell populations with DC during the early phases of the innate immune response. They also underscore the view that as levels of c-FLIP increase, Fas signaling can be diverted from induction of apoptosis to pathways leading to cell effector function."

		"abstract": "The goals of this study were to determine the historical, physical examination, and clinicopathologic findings in dogs with suppurative, nonseptic polyarthropathy and to identify concurrent disorders associated with this syndrome. Medical records of 52 dogs with cytologic evidence of suppurative inflammation in two or more joints were examined retrospectively. Age of dogs was 4.8 years (median, range: 0.5-12 years). There was no clear breed or sex predilection, but most were large-breed dogs (body weight > or = 20 kg [44.4 lbs] in 40/52). Body temperature was 103.0 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) (median, range: 100.0-105.9 degrees F), with 29 of 52 dogs having a body temperature > or = 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C). Lameness was identified in 42 of 52 dogs. Erosive changes were found in only 1 of 37 dogs that had radiography performed. A clear underlying disease process was not identified in 34 of 52 dogs. Seven dogs had evidence of infectious or inflammatory processes at extra-articular sites; 4 dogs were diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); 2 dogs had gastrointestinal disease; 2 dogs had been vaccinated within 1 month before onset of polyarthritis; 1 dog had cancer; 1 dog had polyarthritis and meningitis; and 1 dog had erosive polyarthritis. Of the 44 dogs tested, 25 had antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, detected by an ELISA assay, which was significantly greater than the general hospital population (P = .007). Antibodies against Rickettsia rickettsiae and Ehrlichia canis were not definitively identified in the sera of any dog tested in this study (45 and 44 dogs, respectively). We conclude that an underlying disease process is not identified in most cases of suppurative polyarthropathy in dogs and that intestinal disease, neoplasia, and SLE are uncommon causes of polyarthritis. While seropositivity against the causative agent of Lyme disease was common and possibly a cause of polyarthritis in some dogs of our study, evidence of other vector-borne infection was not identified."

Annual degree-days >0 degrees C limits for I. scapularis establishment, obtained from tick population model simulations, were mapped using temperatures projected for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s by two Global Climate Models (the Canadian CGCM2 and the UK HadCM3) for two greenhouse gas emission scenario enforcings 'A2'and 'B2' of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Under scenario 'A2' using either climate model, the theoretical range for I. scapularis establishment moved northwards by approximately 200 km by the 2020s and 1000 km by the 2080s. Reductions in emissions (scenario 'B2') had little effect on projected range expansion up to the 2050s, but the range expansion projected to occur between the 2050s and 2080s was less than that under scenario 'A2'. When the tick population model was driven by projected annual temperature cycles (obtained using CGCM2 under scenario 'A2'), tick abundance almost doubled by the 2020s at the current northern limit of I. scapularis, suggesting that the threshold numbers of immigrating ticks needed to establish new populations will fall during the coming decades. The projected degrees of theoretical range expansion and increased tick survival by the 2020s, suggest that actual range expansion of I. scapularis may be detectable within the next two decades. Seasonal tick activity under climate change scenarios was consistent with maintenance of endemic cycles of the Lyme disease agent in newly established tick populations. The geographic range of I. scapularis-borne zoonoses may, therefore, expand significantly northwards as a consequence of climate change this century."

Comparison between disease groups revealed significant differences between bacterial and viral meningitis and neuroborreliosis for S-100B and also when compared with controls. NSE was not significantly elevated. S-100B is altered in CNS infection but does not provide additional benefit in the differential diagnosis when compared with standard CSF parameters. Nevertheless, S-100B values might be used as an additional monitoring parameter especially when sequential lumbar punctures are contraindicated."

In earlier studies, only serum-resistant strains of the genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto or B. afzelii, but not serum-sensitive B. garinii strains, have been shown to bind FH. Since B. garinii often causes neuroborreliosis in man, we have readdressed the interactions of B. garinii with FH. B. garinii 50/97 strain did not express FH-binding proteins. By transforming the B. garinii 50/97 strain with an OspE-encoding gene from complement-resistant B. burgdorferi (ospE-297), its resistance to serum killing could be increased. OspE genes were detected and cloned from the B. garinii BITS, Pistoia and 40/97 strains by PCR and sequencing. The deduced amino acid sequences differed in an N-terminal lysine-rich FH-binding region from OspE sequences of resistant strains. Recombinant B. garinii BITS OspE protein was found to have a considerably lower FH-binding activity than the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto 297 OspE protein P21 (P21-297). Unlike bacteria that had been kept in culture for a long time, neurovirulent B. garinii strains from neuroborreliosis patients were found to express approximately 27-kDa FH-binding proteins. These were not recognized by polyclonal anti-OspE or anti-BbA68 antibodies. We conclude that B. garinii strains carry ospE genes but have a decreased expression of OspE proteins and a reduced ability to bind FH, especially when grown for prolonged periods in vitro. Recently isolated neuroinvasive B. garinii strains, however, can express FH-binding proteins, which may contribute to the virulence of neuroborreliosis-causing B. garinii strains."

However, laboratory testing is useful for patients with confusing presentations and for validation of disease in clinical studies. Although cultivation of Borrelia burgdorferi is definitive, prior investigations have shown that no single test is optimal for Lyme disease diagnosis. We applied high-volume blood culture, skin biopsy culture, PCR, and serodiagnosis to a cohort of patients with suspected Lyme disease acquired in Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. The study was performed to confirm the relative utility of culture and to identify laboratory testing algorithms that will supplement clinical diagnosis. Overall, 30 of 86 patients (35%) were culture positive, whereas an additional 15 of 84 (18%) were seropositive only (51% total sero- and culture positive), and PCR on skin biopsy identified 4 additional patients who were neither culture nor seropositive. Among 49 laboratory test-positive patients, the highest sensitivity (100%) for diagnosis was obtained when culture, skin PCR, and serologic tests were used, although serologic testing with skin PCR was almost as sensitive (92%). Plasma PCR was infrequently positive and provided no additional diagnostic value. Although culture is definitive and has a relatively high sensitivity, the results required a mean of 3.5 weeks to recovery. The combination of acute-phase serology and skin PCR was 75% sensitive, offering a practical and relatively rapid alternative for confirming clinical impression. The full battery of tests could be useful for patients with confusing clinical signs or for providing strong laboratory support for clinical studies of Lyme disease."

Young immunocompetent, young asplenic, and aged C3H/HeN mice, as well as young BALB/c mice, were coinfected with B. burgdorferi and B. microti, and disease severity was compared with that in singly infected and uninfected control mice. Babesiosis followed its normal course of infection in coinfected mice, without evidence for increased severity, as reflected by percentage of parasitemia, spleen weights, and hematologic and clinical chemistry parameters. Likewise, Lyme disease followed its established course and severity in coinfected mice, as reflected by the degrees of spirochete dissemination and arthritis. This study demonstrates that, in the mouse model, these 2 infections proceed independently."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, a potentially debilitating human disease for which no vaccine is currently available. We developed an oral bait delivery system for an anti-B. burgdorferi vaccine based in OspA. Mice were immunized orally via gavage and bait feeding. Challenge was performed via Ixodes scapularis field nymphs carrying multiple B. burgdorferi strains. Vaccination protected 89% of the mice and the systemic immune response was skewed toward IgG2a/2b production. Moreover, this oral vaccine reduced the pathogen in the tick vector by eight-fold. We conclude that this oral vaccine induces a protective systemic immune response against a variety of infectious B. burgdorferi strains found in nature and therefore it can eliminate this zoonotic pathogen from its major host reservoirs. Because we observed elimination of the spirochete from the tick vector, a broad delivery of this oral vaccine to wildlife reservoirs is likely to disrupt the transmission cycle of this pathogen."

		"abstract": "Although the immune system evolved to protect the host from foreign infection, it can sometimes recognize and attack host tissues, a phenomenon known as autoimmunity. In addition to genetic factors, environmental elements such as viruses and bacteria are thought to play a role in the development of autoimmune diseases. The major hypothesized mechanism by which infection with these agents can lead to autoimmunity is termed molecular mimicry. Here, immune responses initiated against foreign antigens are cross-reactive with self-antigens. This is thought to occur especially if the foreign antigen is similar in structure or amino acid sequence to the self-antigen. In this review, we explore evidence for the role of molecular mimicry in neurological diseases."

Certain plasmid losses cause an inability or reduction in the ability of spirochetes to infect mice. In the current study, nine strains of spirochetes with varying plasmid profiles were used to identify plasmids necessary for nymphal tick infection. Nymphal ticks were artificially fed the nine spirochete strains as well as the parental strain containing a full complement of plasmids. The capillary fed nymphs were allowed to feed on mice for at least 63 h and then examined for the presence of spirochetes in their guts and salivary glands. All spirochete strains tested were able to infect ticks guts, but to different degrees. We determined that the plasmids lp5, lp28-1, and cp9 were not required for infecting tick guts, whereas loss of lp25 and lp28-4 was associated with reduced gut infectivity. A reduction in the ability of spirochetes to invade salivary glands was seen in bacteria that did not have lp28-1, whereas cp9 was not required for salivary gland infection. This study has pinpointed specific plasmids whose absence is deleterious to infecting nymphal tick guts and salivary glands."

To determine the potential role of mites as vectors of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, mites were collected from wild rodents in the Bazantula region of North Moravia (Czech Republic). These samples were examined for the presence of Borreliae by using DFM and PCR methods. Mites positive for the presence of DNA of B. burgdorferi sensu lato were determined as members of the families Haemogamasidae and Parasitidae. One sample from a mite of genus Haemogamasus was successfully isolated, and the specimen was confirmed as B. afzelii by using PCR-RFLP and by gradient SDS-PAGE. This suggests the possible participation of gamasid mites in borrelial circulation in nature and also points to the utility of further such studies to identify potential vectors (other than ticks) of the spirochete."

In response to these concerns, a statewide surveillance program was initiated in 1990 based on ticks received by the Department of Entomology at Iowa State University. Ticks were received from health care professionals, state government agencies, and the general public. A total of 5,343 ticks from all 99 Iowa counties were identified during the 12 years of this study. Dermacentor variabilis was the most numerous species, followed by Amblyomma americanum, and Ixodes scapularis. Dermacentor variabilis were distributed statewide, but A. americanum came primarily from southern Iowa counties. Prior to 1996, most I. scapularis came from counties along the Mississippi River. In the last 5 years, I. scapularis have been received from several counties in central and western Iowa and there is molecular evidence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi in a substantial percentage of ticks. All I. scapularis were tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi. During the 12 years of this study, the presence of B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis varied from a low of zero percent in 1991-1995 to 18% in 1996. On average, fewer than 10% of all ticks examined per year were I. scapularis. In the 2000 tick season, the number of I. scapularis per year increased to 22% of submissions. This species further increased to 36.6% of ticks received in 2002."

We tested this observed relationship in a suburban region around Lyme, Connecticut, where we collected data on the density of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis and prevalence of the Lyme bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi at 30 sites. Analysis of the landscape pattern of forest patches was performed using satellite imagery. The calculated landscape indices, which included patch size and isolation, revealed a positive link between fragmentation and both tick density and infection prevalence in ticks. In spite of higher entomologic risk, human incidence of Lyme disease is lower in fragmented contexts suggesting that entomologic risk is not the critical driver of human infections. These results represent a departure from the prior claims that fragmentation and human Lyme disease risk are positively linked. A complete understanding of the influence of landscape fragmentation will allow for improved risk mapping and potential environmental management of Lyme disease."

Eighty-six cases of Lyme disease were reported and validated, of which 77 (90%) consisted of erythema migrans. At national level, the incidence was estimated at 9.4/100,000 inhabitants. Compared to the French general population, Lyme disease patients were older (P<10(-4)), more were living in rural areas (P<10(-3)), and amongst the working population, more were farmers (P<10(-3)) and fewer, salaried workers (P<0.005). Cervidae density correlated strongly with the estimated regional incidence of Lyme disease (r=0.82).

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is genetically heterogeneous. Previous studies have shown a significant association between the frequency of hematogenous dissemination in Lyme disease patients and the genotype of the infecting B. burgdorferi strain. Comparative transcriptional profiling of two representative clinical isolates with distinct genotypes (BL206 and B356) was undertaken. A total of 78 open reading frames (ORFs) had expression levels that differed significantly between the two isolates. A number of genes with potential involvement in nutrient uptake (BB0603, BBA74, BB0329, BB0330, and BBB29) have significantly higher expression levels in isolate B356. Moreover, nearly 25% of the differentially expressed genes are predicted to be localized on the cell surface, implying that these two isolates have cell surface properties that differ considerably. One of these genes, BBA74, encodes a protein of 257 amino acid residues that has been shown to possess porin activity. BBA74 transcript level was >20-fold higher in B356 than in BL206, and strain B356 contained three- to fivefold more BBA74 protein. BBA74 was disrupted by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region. The growth rates of both wild-type and mutant strains were essentially identical, and cultures reached the same final cell densities. However, the mutant strains consistently showed prolonged lags of 2 to 5 days prior to the induction of log-phase growth compared to wild-type strains. It is tempting to speculate that the absence of BBA74 interferes with the enhanced nutrient uptake that may be required for the entry of cells into log-phase growth. These studies demonstrate the value of comparative transcriptional profiling for identifying differences in the transcriptomes of B. burgdorferi clinical isolates that may provide clues to pathogenesis. The 78 ORFs identified here are a good starting point for the investigation of factors involved in the hematogenous dissemination of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Borrelia hermsii is the primary cause of tick-borne relapsing fever in North America. When its tick vector, Ornithodoros hermsi, acquires these spirochetes from the blood of an infected mammal, the bacteria switch their outer surface from one of many bloodstream variable major proteins (Vmps) to a unique protein, Vtp (Vsp33). Vtp may be critical for successful tick transmission of B. hermsii; however, the gene encoding this protein has been described previously in only one isolate. Here we identified and sequenced the vtp gene in 31 isolates of B. hermsii collected over 40 years from localities throughout much of its known geographic distribution. Seven major Vtp types were found. Little or no sequence variation existed within types, but between them significant variation was observed, similar to the pattern of diversity described for the outer surface protein C (OspC) gene in Lyme disease spirochetes. The pattern of sequence relatedness among the Vtp types was incongruent in two branches compared to two genomic groups identified among the isolates by multilocus sequence typing of the 16S rRNA, flaB, gyrB, and glpQ genes. Therefore, both horizontal transfer and recombination within and between the two genomic groups were responsible for some of the variation observed in the vtp gene. O. hermsi ticks were capable of transmitting spirochetes in the newly identified genomic group. Therefore, given the longevity of the tick vector and persistent infection of spirochetes in ticks, these arthropods rather than mammals may be the likely host where the exchange of spirochetal DNA occurs."

		"abstract": "After infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, humans and mice under certain conditions develop arthritis. Initiation of inflammation is dependent on the migration of innate immune cells to the site of infection, controlled by interactions of a variety of adhesion molecules. In this study, we used the newly synthesized compound S18407, which is a prodrug of the active drug S16197, to analyze the functional importance of alpha4beta1-dependent cell adhesion for the development of arthritis and for the antibacterial immune response. S16197 is shown to interfere specifically with the binding of alpha4beta(1 integrin to its ligands VCAM-1 and fibronectin in vitro. Treatment of B. burgdorferi-infected C3H/HeJ mice with the alpha4beta1 antagonist significantly ameliorated the outcome of clinical arthritis and the influx of neutrophilic granulocytes into ankle joints. Furthermore, local mRNA up-regulation of the proinflammatory mediators IL-1, IL-6, and cyclooxygenase-2 was largely abolished. Neither the synthesis of spirochete-specific Igs nor the development of a Th1-dominated immune response was altered by the treatment. Importantly, the drug also did not interfere with Ab-mediated control of spirochete load in the tissues. These findings demonstrate that the pathogenesis, but not the protective immune response, in Lyme arthritis is dependent on the alpha4beta1-mediated influx of inflammatory cells. The onset of inflammation can be successfully targeted by treatment with S18407."

		"abstract": "The clinical course and outcome of several infectious diseases are dependent on the type of immune response elicited against the pathogen. In adults with neuroborreliosis (NB), a type 1 response with high production of Borrelia-specific IFN-gamma, but no IL-4, has been reported. Since children have a more benign course of NB than adults, we wanted to investigate type 1 and type 2 responses in children with NB. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood were collected from children during the acute stage of 'confirmed NB' (n = 34), 'possible NB' (n = 30) and 'non-NB' (n = 10). The number of Borrelia-specific IL-4- and IFN-gamma-secreting cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Borrelia-specific secretion of both IL-4 and IFN-gamma was increased in CSF in confirmed (P < 0.05) and possible (P < 0.01) NB, when compared with non-NB controls. Furthermore, children with NB had significantly higher Borrelia-specific IL-4 secretion in CSF than an adult reference material with NB (P < 0.05). There were no differences in cytokine secretion in relation to onset or recovery of neurological symptoms. Since IL-4 is known to down-regulate the pro-inflammatory and possibly harmful effects of prolonged IFN-gamma responses, the prominent IL-4 response observed in the central nervous system compartment might contribute to the more benign disease course seen in children with Lyme NB."

This pathogen circulates in various ecosystems and has a wide range of reservoir hosts and transmitters. The results of studies of genetic heterogeneity of the spirochaetae B. afzelii are considered. A total of 139 primary isolates were studied. The isolates were isolated from three species of Ixodes ticks at different stages of development and obtained from the laboratory of infection transmitters, Gamaleya Scientific Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russran Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow. The transmitters and reservoir hosts of borrelias were caught in natural foci of Russia (from Kaliningrad region irk the west to south Sakhalin in the east), Czechia, Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, and Moldavia. Analysis of genotype sequence similarity obtained by sequencing of the rrf(SS)-rrl(23S) spacer demonstrated that the B. afzelii genospecies incorporated no less than 10 genetic variants of spirochaetae, most variants being geographically widespread."

		"abstract": "We studied retrospectively four patients with Lyme arthritis of the knee, the role of PCR for the detection of B. burgdorferi DNA and its influence on further therapeutic decisions. All four patients with Lyme arthritis suffered from knee pain and effusions. None of them remembered having had a tick bite or an erythema migrans. The diagnosis was confirmed by positive serology and in three cases by detection of B. burgdorferi DNA by PCR analysis of the joint fluid. In one patient, PCR was also positive in the synovial tissue. Because of persistent symptoms after adequate antibiotic therapy, PCR was repeated in the joint fluid of two patients. In one patient a positive PCR suggested an ongoing infection. Thus, the antibiotic treatment was changed. A further PCR was negative. Symptoms resolved slowly in all patients over a time of two to seven months after the end of the antibiotic treatment. PCR to detect B. burgdorferi DNA in synovial fluid or tissue respectively is a helpful tool for the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis. Moreover, in patients with refractory Lyme arthritis PCR may be helpful in monitoring the course of the disease."

Any ticks that were detected on campers' skin or clothing were collected by the camp nurse and we studied them for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. In addition, we sent detailed questionnaires home with the 1,623 campers. A total of 537 campers returned the questionnaire and 200 had found ticks on their skin or clothing while at camp. Risks were analyzed using logistic regression models. Participation in the ropes-course, night-trip and camp-out events significantly increased the risk of tick exposure (OR 1.6 to 2.3). Six cases of LD were identified among campers, which was an estimated incidence of 3.3 per 1,000 campers/10-14 day camp session, and two counselors had LD. Of the 238 ticks collected mainly in June-July 1995, 19% were identified as Ixodes scapularis larvae and nymphs; 11% of the latter were infected with B. burgdorferi. The risk for LD in campers and staff was much higher than that of the general population despite the use of tick-exposure precautions. Focused interventions need to be put in place in summer camps to prevent transmission of LD."

This was updated and newly implemented in 1997. With implementation of the national Protection against Infection Act in 2001 further amendment of the state regulation (published in April 2005) be came necessary. The following diseases or laboratory evidence of the underlying pathogens, respectively, will now be notifiable with inclusion of the affected individual's name: aseptic meningitis, mumps, rubella, varicella, epidemickera to conjunctivitis, pertussis, and pneumococcal meningitis. The possibility of preventing further spread of the pathogen to others though immediate implementation of preventive measures by the public health service justifies notification of the individual's name. Furthermore, the epidemiological situation is to be monitored and evaluated. This also applies to Lyme disease, which will be anonymously notifiable. Particular emphasis is placed on vaccine-preventable diseases in the state regulation for mandatory notification in Saxony-Anhalt, since priority is placed on attaining the health goal \"age-appropriate vaccination status in over 90% of the population\". The state-specific notification regulation of Saxony-Anhalt has worked well in preventing and controlling communicable diseases. It is a source of reliable data, which may be helpful in the discussion regarding the amendment of the Protection against Infection Act. Non-anonymous notification should be enforced nationally at least for all vaccine-preventable diseases for which a post-exposure vaccination is recommended by the Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO)."

		"abstract": "This paper describes the development of a Bayesian model for diagnosis of patients suspected of Lyme disease, and the integration of such a model into a medical information system. A Bayesian network incorporating the clinical history and laboratory results has been constructed. Because many of the symptoms are not exclusive to Lyme disease and they develop over time, the clinical history is important for making the correct diagnosis. The model is based on time slices, where each time slice contains the observed pathological picture from one consultation with for example, the general practitioner. Since the time intervals between consultations typically are not equivalent, we have developed a novel method that can handle non-equivalent time intervals between the time slices in the network. The method is based on a description of the general development pattern of Lyme disease, which is implemented in a model that states the conditional probabilities of experiencing a certain pathological picture given time since infection. The model has been integrated into a web-based medical information system, called Borrelia Systems, which has enabled us to evaluate the model during a progressive diagnostic process. The integration has been accomplished through the development of a Bayesian Application Framework. This framework specifies a communication data structure in XML providing a graphical user interface and database components, which can be used when developing systems that are based on Bayesian networks. The framework generalizes the integration of Bayesian networks so that it is possible to switch network without manually having to update or change the system."

Morphologic, immunohistochemical, molecular-genetic, and clinical features of 58 specimens from 56 patients were analyzed. They were re-diagnosed as cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (CLH, n = 44); other benign lymphoid infiltrates (OBLI, n = 8); peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (n = 1); cases with overlapping features of CLH and B-cell lymphoma (n = 3), one of them composed of spindle cells. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia infiltrates were dense, composed mainly of B cells forming follicles with germinal centers (GC). Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia frequently showed features suggesting a malignancy as coalescing follicles with non-polarized germinal centers lacking mantle zones, and smudged infiltrates of lymphoid cells spreading into collagen (often as \"Indian files\"), smooth muscle, vessel walls, and nerve sheaths. Only two cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias recurred; otherwise all patients are without disease (mean follow-up 62 months). Monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected in five, and of T-cell receptor gamma gene in two cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the patients fared well too. In 47% of cases Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by polymerase chain reaction and/or serology, of which one was monoclonal. We conclude that cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia is the most common lymphoproliferation of the breast nipple, rarely recognized clinically, and often overdiagnosed histologically as lymphoma."

All of these patients had been treated with antibiotics and were free of disease within 6 to 12 months of follow-up. Results show that a serum specimen taken at this time was either C(6) negative or had a >or=4-fold decrease in C(6) antibody titer with respect to a specimen taken at baseline (or during the early convalescent period if the baseline specimen was C(6) negative) for all of the multiple-EM patients (P<0.0001) and in 89% of the single-EM patients (P<0.0001).

We examined whether B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies were present within PEG-precipitated ICs (PEG-ICs) in patients with LD, posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, and controls, including individuals who received the outer surface protein A (OspA) vaccine. Using a B. burgdorferi whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we obtained positive PEG-IC results not only in patients with a history of LD, but also in individuals vaccinated with OspA vaccine. The frequency of positive PEG-IC ELISAs in OspA vaccinees was significantly higher with ELISA-reactive than with ELISA-negative unprocessed serum samples (P=0.001), demonstrating dependency between the tests. Similar results were found using samples from rhesus macaques infected with B. burgdorferi, uninfected macaques vaccinated with OspA, and controls. Therefore, testing for the presence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in PEG-IC preparations is not more likely to reflect active infection than testing in unprocessed serum and should not be used in individuals who received the OspA vaccine."

An illness associated with an EM-like skin lesion, but which is not caused by B. burgdorferi, occurs in many southern states in the United States (southern tick-associated rash illness [STARI], also known as Masters disease). Clinical features of 21 cases of EM-like skin lesions in 21 patients from Missouri were compared in a prospective study with those of 101 cases in 97 patients with EM-like skin lesions from New York. Among Missouri cases, the peak incidence of EM-like skin lesions occurred earlier in the year than it did among New York cases (P<.001). Case patients from Missouri were more likely to recall a tick bite than were case patients from New York (85.7% and 19.8%, respectively; P<.001), and the time period from tick bite to onset of the skin lesion was shorter among Missouri case patients (6.1+/-4.2 days and 10.4+/-6.1 days, respectively; P=.011). Missouri case patients were less likely to be symptomatic than were New York case patients (19.0% and 76.2%, respectively; P<.001), and Missouri case patients were less likely to have multiple skin lesions (4.8% and 26.7%, respectively; P=.042). EM-like lesions in Missouri cases were smaller in size than those in New York cases (8.3+/-2.2 cm and 16.4+/-11.5 cm, respectively; P<.001), more circular in shape (P=.004), and more likely to have central clearing (76.2% and 21.6%, respectively; P<.001). After antibiotic treatment, Missouri case patients recovered more rapidly than did New York case patients (P=.037).

		"abstract": "Several quantitative trait loci regulating murine Lyme arthritis severity have been mapped, including a highly significant linkage found on chromosome 5, termed Bb2Bb3. Within this region, the Ncf1 gene of the phagocyte nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase has recently been identified as a major regulator of arthritis severity in rodent models of rheumatoid arthritis, an effect attributed to protective properties of reactive oxygen species. To assess the role of Ncf1 in Lyme arthritis, we introgressed Bb2Bb3 from severely arthritic C3H/He mice onto mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice. This increased Lyme arthritis severity, whereas the reciprocal transfer conferred protection from disease. A single nucleotide polymorphism was identified in the Ncf1 gene that did not influence the protein sequence or expression of Ncf1. Although polymorphonuclear leukocytes from C57BL/6 mice generated a greater oxidative burst than polymorphonuclear leukocytes from C3H/He mice, studies with the Bb2Bb3 congenic mice demonstrated this difference was not linked to Ncf1 alleles. Furthermore, Lyme arthritis severity was not altered in mice lacking either the Ncf1 or Gp91phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex. Together, these results argue that Ncf1 is not a candidate gene for regulation of Lyme arthritis and reveal Lyme arthritis to be independent of NADPH oxidase activity, distinguishing it from other models of rheumatoid arthritis."

The genetic requirements for persistence in these disparate environments have not been well defined. B. burgdorferi has a complex genome composed of a chromosome and >20 plasmids. Previous work has demonstrated that B. burgdorferi requires two plasmids, lp25 and lp28-1, in the mammalian host. To investigate the requirement for these same two plasmids during tick infection, we experimentally infected larval ticks with B. burgdorferi lacking either lp25 or lp28-1 and then assessed the spirochete load in ticks at different points of the infection. Whereas plasmid lp28-1 was dispensable in ticks, plasmid lp25 was essential for tick infection. Furthermore, we investigated the requirement in ticks for the lp25 gene bbe22, which encodes a nicotinamidase that is necessary and sufficient for mammalian infection by B. burgdorferi clones lacking lp25. This gene was also sufficient in ticks to restore survival of spirochetes lacking lp25. This is the first study to investigate the requirement for specific plasmids by B. burgdorferi within the tick vector, and it begins to establish the genomic components required for persistence of this pathogen throughout its natural infectious cycle."

		"abstract": "We report for the first time that saliva of the hard tick and Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis, is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Saliva (< or = 1:500 dilutions) or salivary gland (0.1-0.5 pairs/assay) dose-dependently inhibits microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) proliferation. Inhibition was also detected with the saliva of the cattle tick Boophilus microplus but not with the salivary gland of Anopheles gambiae, An. stephensi, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Phlebotomus papatasi, Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Cimex lectularius. Inhibition of MVEC proliferation by I. Scapularis saliva was accompanied by a change in cell shape (shrinkage of the cytoplasm with loss of cell-cell interactions) and apoptosis which was estimated by expression of phosphatidylserine using the Apopercentage dye, and by a typical pattern of chromatin margination, condensation, and fragmentation as revealed by nuclear staining with Hoechst 33258. The effect of saliva appears to be mediated by endothelial cell alpha5beta1 integrin, because monoclonal antibodies against this but not alphavbeta3, alphavbeta5, alpha9beta1, or alpha2beta1 integrins remarkably block its effect. In addition, SDS/PAGE shows that saliva specifically degrades purified alpha5beta1 but not alphavbeta5 or alphavbeta3 integrins. Incubation of saliva with EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline, but not phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), inhibits saliva-dependent degradation of purified alpha5beta1 integrin, suggesting that a metalloprotease is responsible for the activity. Finally, saliva at < or = 1:1,000 dilutions blocks sprouting formation from chick embryo aorta implanted in Matrigel, an in vitro model of angiogenesis. These findings introduce the concept that tick saliva is a negative modulator of angiogenesis-dependent wound healing and tissue repair, therefore allowing ticks to feed for days. Inhibition of angiogenesis was hitherto an unidentified biologic property of the saliva of any blood-sucking arthropod studied so far. Its presence in tick saliva may be regarded as an additional source of angiogenesis inhibitors with potential applications for the study of both vector and vascular biology."

We conducted a retrospective chart review of 23 adult patients presenting to the dermatology clinic at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma between January 1999 and May 2003. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas generally present on the head and neck, with the trunk and extremities afflicted to a lesser extent. Patients were found to have serologic evidence of prior infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (n = 10), Helicobacter pylori (n = 5), and Epstein-Barr virus (n = 6). Overall, treatment of primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma should involve multiple modalities; however, specific treatment aimed at concurrent or suspected infection, particularly B burgdorferi, is a helpful adjunct and may achieve complete remission in a small subset of patients."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochetes, comprised of at least three closely related species, Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii, are fascinating and enigmatic bacterial pathogens. They are maintained by tick-mediated transmission between mammalian hosts, usually small rodents. The ability of these bacteria, which have relatively small genomes, to survive and disseminate in both an immunocompetent mammal and in an arthropod vector suggests that they have evolved elegant and indispensable strategies for interacting with their hosts. Recognition of specific mammalian and tick tissues is likely to be essential for successful completion of the enzootic life cycle but, given the historical difficulties in genetic manipulation of these organisms, characterization of factors promoting cell adhesion has until recently largely been confined to either the manipulation of host cells or the analysis of potential bacterial ligands in the form of recombinant proteins. These studies have led to the identification of several mammalian receptors for Lyme disease spirochetes, including glycosaminoglycans, decorin, fibronectin and integrins, as well as a tick receptor for the bacterium, and also candidate cognate bacterial ligands. Recent advances in our ability to genetically manipulate Lyme disease spirochetes, particularly B. burgdorferi, are now providing us with firm evidence that these ligands indeed do promote bacterial adherence to host cells, and with new insights into the roles of these multifacted Borrelia-host cell interactions during mammalian and arthropod infection."

Retrospective chart review of children presenting to a children's hospital in a Lyme-endemic region between October 1999 and September 2004. Patients were included if they had both Lyme serology and Lyme CSF-PCR performed during the same hospital encounter and had documented meningitis. Patients were considered to have Lyme meningitis if they had meningitis and met CDC criteria for Lyme disease. The Lyme CSF-PCR assay amplified a Borrelia burgdorferi DNA flagellin gene sequence. Of 108 patients with meningitis who qualified for the study, 20 patients met criteria for Lyme meningitis and 88 were classified as aseptic meningitis. Positive Lyme CSF-PCR was found in 1 patient (1 of 20, 5%) with Lyme meningitis and one patient classified as aseptic meningitis (1 of 88, 1%). Lyme CSF-PCR had a sensitivity of 5% and a specificity of 99%. The only Lyme meningitis patient with positive Lyme CSF-PCR had the highest CSF white blood cell count and CSF protein values compared with the other Lyme meningitis patients. This is the first study to evaluate Lyme CSF-PCR exclusively in North American children.

Doses were raised over a period of 4-12 weeks to the individually effective and tolerated maximum dose (500-1,200 mg). Treatment was maintained until pain disappeared and then gradually reduced in dose over weeks. If symptoms recurred, the doses were raised again. Therapy was maintained over an average of 1-2 years. Pain quality and pain quantity were evaluated using the McGill pain questionnaire and a visual analogue scale. There was an improvement of 'crawling' and 'burning' pain sensations, neck and radiating lumbar pain in 9/10 (90%) patients as well as a positive effect on mood, general feeling of health and quality of sleep in 5/10 (50%) patients. The average dose leading to a clear-cut pain reduction was 700 mg. In an open pilot study (10 patients), gabapentin monotherapy which has to our knowledge not been published as treatment of chronic neuropathic pain in patients with late Lyme borreliosis is efficacious in treating pain associated with neuroborreliosis and can thus improve quality of life in these patients."

P39 reactivity against Borrelia burgdorferi lysate in immunoblots of Lyme disease patients has long been identified with reactivity to BmpA, but responses to other Bmp proteins have not been examined. To determine if patients with Lyme disease developed such responses, immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-Bmp reactivity in patient and control sera was studied by using soluble recombinant Bmp (rBmp) proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Although some patient sera contained IgG immunoblot and immunodot reactivities against all four Bmp proteins, analysis of IgG anti-Bmp fine specificity by a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with graded doses of soluble homologous and heterologous rBmp proteins showed that only the responses to BmpA, BmpB, and BmpD were specific. This suggests that at least three of the four Bmp proteins are expressed by B. burgdorferi in infected patients and that specific antibodies to them are likely to be present in the P39 band in some patients."

In the present study, a standardized protocol spiking urine from healthy donors with a defined amount of whole Borrelia or Borrelia DNA was established. The development of a nested real-time PCR targeting ospA enabled a highly sensitive and quantitative analysis of these samples. We show the following. (i) Storage of spiked urine samples for up to 6 months at--20 degrees C had no negative effect on spike recovery. (ii) Centrifugation of 10 ml of urine at 40,000 x g for 30 min resulted in a concentration of both spikes, i.e., whole Borrelia and DNA. (iii) The inhibition of DNA spike recovery in 48% (11 of 23 samples) of urine samples tested could be attributed to nuclease activity. This was abrogated by alkalizing the urine or by working with the samples on ice. Despite optimized conditions, analysis of urine samples of 12 patients with erythema migrans, the clinical stage considered to be associated with the highest bacterial load, revealed a positive result in only one sample. All 12 samples were negative by an alternative PCR targeting flagellin. The results of our study support doubts that urine is a suitable material for diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "We developed and evaluated a recombinant Borrelia line immunoblot assay based on 18 homologues of seven different antigens, i.e., p100, p58, p41i, BmpA, VlsE, OspC, and DbpA. Each recombinant antigen can be detected separately and is distinct even from homologues with identical molecular weights. This blot was compared to the recently described recombinant Borrelia Western immunoblot assay (U. Schulte-Spechtel, G. Lehnert, G. Liegl, V. Fingerle, C. Heimerl, B. J. Johnson, and B. Wilske, J. Clin. Microbiol. 41:1299-1303, 2003). To verify sensitivity and specificity, both blots were evaluated for reactivity with Borrelia-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM antibodies with 85 sera from patients with different manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and 110 controls. According to European interpretation criteria for Borrelia Western blots, which define a serum as positive when it recognizes at least two bands, sensitivity increased significantly from 70.6% (Western blot) to 84.7% (line blot) for IgG (P = 0.042) and from 40.0% (Western blot) to 73.8% (line blot) for IgM (P < 0.005). The increased sensitivity for IgG detection is due to the new line blot technique, whereas the improvement in detection of IgM is mainly achieved through incorporation of the additional antigens. Notably, the recombinant VlsE of Borrelia garinii strain PBi displayed the highest sensitivity of all antigens tested for IgG detection and is also one of the most useful antigens for IgM. Due to its excellent sensitivity and specificity combined with ease of evaluation, this line immunoblot assay offers a useful improvement in serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and displays different stages, including localized, early disseminated, and persistent infection, all of which are associated with profound inflammatory reactions in the host. Induction of proinflammatory cytokines by B. burgdorferi is mainly mediated by outer surface proteins interacting with TLR-2/TLR-1 heterodimers. In this study, we show that TNF-alpha induction by Borrelia lysate was impaired in heterozygous TLR-2 knockout mice, while reactivity to lipoteichoic acid, another TLR-2 ligand signaling via TLR-2/TLR-6 heterodimers, was unaffected. Blood from individuals heterozygous for the TLR-2 polymorphism Arg753Gln was tested for cytokine release upon stimulation with Borrelia lysate, and induction of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma was significantly lower as compared with individuals not exhibiting this variation. Overexpression of TLR-2 carrying the Arg753Gln polymorphism in HEK 293 cells led to a significantly stronger impairment of activation by TLR-2/TLR-1 ligands as compared with TLR-2/TLR-6 ligands. To study whether heterozygosity for the Arg753Gln variant of TLR-2 influenced susceptibility for LD, we analyzed 155 patients for this polymorphism. The Arg753Gln variant occurs at a significantly lower frequency in LD patients as compared with matched controls (5.8 vs 13.5%, odds ratio 0.393, 95% confidence interval 0.17-0.89, p = 0.033), with an even more pronounced difference when late stage disease was observed (2.3 vs 12.5%, odds ratio 0.163, 95% confidence interval 0.04-0.76, p = 0.018). These data suggest that Arg753Gln may protect from the development of late stage LD due to a reduced signaling via TLR-2/TLR-1."

Antibody specificity was analysed with the Meridian's western blot. 1504/16 176 (9%) sera were positive for IgG isotype, and 978/3298 (29%) for IgM. The specificity was confirmed by western blot in 49% cases for IgG and in 54% for IgM. The highest positive serology rates were found in eastern and centre regions and in Aquitaine. Forty-two cases have been investigated leading to the identification of 16 borreliosis cases, each suffering of an erythema migrans. Five of them had neurological signs. Patient mean age was 40 years. 87% of patients had risk factors and 69% reported previous tick bites, mainly on lower limbs. A low rate of positive borreliosis sera was found, suggesting that serology prescription should be limited to patients suffering of compatible clinical signs, as recommended by the EUCALB. Erythema migrans was the most frequent clinical manifestation and neurological signs were present in 30% of cases. Finally, the geographical case distribution was similar to that provided by the study of the Sentinelle network in 1999-2000."

		"abstract": "The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi has over 20 different circular and linear plasmids. Some B. burgdorferi plasmids are readily lost during in vitro culture or genetic manipulation. Linear plasmid 25, which is often lost in laboratory strains, is required for the infection of mice. Strains missing linear plasmid 25 (lp25(-)) are able to infect mice if the BBE22 gene on lp25 is provided on a shuttle vector. In this study, we examined the role of lp25 and BBE22 in tick infections. We tested the hypothesis that complementation with BBE22 in spirochetes lacking lp25 would restore the ability of spirochetes to infect ticks. A natural tick infection cycle was performed by feeding larvae on mice injected with the parental, lp25(-), or lp25(-) BBE22-complemented spirochete strains. In addition, larvae and nymphs were artificially infected with different strains to study tick infections independent of mouse infections. B. burgdorferi missing lp25 was significantly impaired in its ability to infect larval and nymphal ticks. When an lp25(-) strain was complemented with BBE22, the ability to infect ticks was partially restored. Complementation with BBE22 allowed spirochetes lacking lp25 to establish short-term infections in ticks, but in most cases the infection prevalence was lower than that of the wild-type strain. In addition, the number of infected ticks decreased over time, suggesting that another gene(s) on lp25 is required for long-term persistence in ticks and completion of a natural infection cycle."

B. lusitaniae was isolated once until now from a patient with a long standing and expanding skin disorder. A 46-year-old Portuguese woman presented with a skin lesion on the left thigh which had evolved slowly over ten years. The patient reported limb paraesthesias, cramps, chronic headaches, and cardiac rhythm disturbances. History of tick bites was negative nor had the patient ever noticed a skin lesion comparable with erythema chronicum migrans. Skin biopsies were taken for histological evaluation, culture and DNA detection. Antibodies to borrelia were searched by indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western-blot. A bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome and local synovitis was diagnosed. Dermato-histology was normal, serology was negative. Spirochaetal organisms were cultured from a skin biopsy and identified as B. lusitaniae. The patient improved after a 2-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone; the skin lesions did not expand further. This culture confirmed skin infection by B. lusitaniae in a patient from Portugal suggests an additional human pathogen out of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex in Europe, particularly in Portugal."

Entry criteria included objective abnormalities compatible with late Lyme disease and serologic reactivity to Borrelia burgdorferi. Randomization took place prior to obtaining serologic results. Clinical response was rated as cure; improvement; failure; or not assessable. Of the 201 patients randomized, 21 patients in the 14 day group and 37 in the 28-day group were excluded from the study for failure to meet serologic criteria. Of those who met serologic criteria, 80 patients received 14 days and 63 received 28 days of ceftriaxone. At time of last evaluation, there were 5 treatment failures in the 14 day group and none in the 28 day group (p = 0.07). Clinical cure rates were 76% for the 14 day group and 70% for the 28 day group (p = NS). Therapy was discontinued due to adverse events for a significantly greater proportion of patients in the 28-day group compared to the 14-day group (p < 0.02). Ceftriaxone for 14 days eradicated the signs and symptoms of late Lyme disease in the majority of evaluable patients. Although there were more failures in the 14-day group than in the 28-day group, this study did not have the power to determine if a clinical subset of patients may benefit from 28 days of therapy."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, the most common tick-borne disease in both North America and Europe, is acquired through the bite of certain tick species in the genus Ixodes. The number of Ixodes ticks in the environment can be reduced by relatively simple interventions such as removing leaf litter and brush, which increases exposure of the tick to sun and air and takes advantage of the tick's vulnerability to desiccation, or by application of acaricides to property. Deer elimination or exclusion, application of topical acaricides to mice or deer, and application of systemic acaricides to deer are more complex approaches. However, none of these methods for reducing tick numbers, nor any of the recommended personal prevention measures, such as reducing the amount of exposed skin, use of tick repellents on exposed skin or clothing, and frequent tick checks to remove attached ticks expeditiously, has been demonstrated to decrease significantly the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in humans. Only two strategies have been shown to do so. A recombinant outer surface protein A (OspA) vaccine was approximately 80% effective in clinical trials in the United States, and a single 200 mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours of an I. scapularis tick bite, was shown to be 87% effective. The OspA vaccine is no longer manufactured due to poor sales. Consequently, single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis is rapidly gaining acceptance in the United States. Limiting single-dose doxycycline to just the highest risk tick bites can be accomplished if the health care provider has learned to differentiate engorged from unengorged I. scapularis ticks. Limitations of single-dose doxycycline prophylaxis are that the majority of patients with Lyme borreliosis do not recall a tick bite, and that there is no evidence that other Ixodes transmitted infections, such as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, would be prevented. A safe, effective, inexpensive and well-accepted vaccine would be welcome."

		"abstract": "The use of serologic testing and its value in the diagnosis of Lyme disease remain confusing and controversial for physicians, especially concerning persons who are at low risk for the disease. The approach to diagnosing Lyme disease varies depending on the probability of disease (based on endemicity and clinical findings) and the stage at which the disease may be. In patients from endemic areas, Lyme disease may be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone in the presence of erythema migrans. These patients do not require serologic testing, although it may be considered according to patient preference. When the pretest probability is moderate (e.g., in a patient from a highly or moderately endemic area who has advanced manifestations of Lyme disease), serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach in which a positive or equivocal serology is followed by a more specific Western blot test. Samples drawn from patients within four weeks of disease onset are tested by Western blot technique for both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies; samples drawn more than four weeks after disease onset are tested for immunoglobulin G only. Patients who show no objective signs of Lyme disease have a low probability of the disease, and serologic testing in this group should be kept to a minimum because of the high risk of false-positive results. When unexplained non-specific systemic symptoms such as myalgia, fatigue, and paresthesias have persisted for a long time in a person from an endemic area, serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach described above."

Here we show that B. burgdorferi usurps a tick salivary protein, Salp15 (ref. 3), to facilitate the infection of mice. The level of salp15 expression was selectively enhanced by the presence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis, first indicating that spirochaetes might use Salp15 during transmission. Salp15 was then shown to adhere to the spirochaete, both in vitro and in vivo, and specifically interacted with B. burgdorferi outer surface protein C. The binding of Salp15 protected B. burgdorferi from antibody-mediated killing in vitro and provided spirochaetes with a marked advantage when they were inoculated into naive mice or animals previously infected with B. burgdorferi. Moreover, RNA interference-mediated repression of salp15 in I. scapularis drastically reduced the capacity of tick-borne spirochaetes to infect mice. These results show the capacity of a pathogen to use a secreted arthropod protein to help it colonize the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "Autoantibody production during infections is considered to result from nonspecific activation of low-affinity autoreactive B cells. Whether this can lead to autoimmune disease remains uncertain. We show that chronic infection by Borrelia burgdorferi of Tg animals expressing human rheumatoid factor (RF) B cells (of low or intermediate affinities) in the absence or in the constitutive presence of the autoantigen (represented here by chimeric IgG with human constant region) breaks their state of immunological ignorance, leading to the production of RFs. Surprisingly, this production was more pronounced in intermediate-affinity RF Tg mice co-expressing the autoantigen. This overproduction was mediated by immune complexes and involved synergistic signaling between the B cell receptor and Toll-like receptors and T cell help. These findings indicate that chronic infection can activate autoreactive B cells with significant affinity and creates conditions that can drive them to differentiate into memory cells. Such cells may have some physiological yet undetermined role, but in autoimmune-prone individuals, this scenario may initiate autoimmunity."

Five studies with 504 patients and 530 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of symptoms was significantly higher in the LB patients, with P-values between <0.00001 and 0.007 for 8 of the 10 symptoms in the three categories listed above. The higher prevalence of certain neurocognitive symptoms but not others, in the same pattern as reported in the literature, is further confirmation of this syndrome. The pattern of symptoms appears to be different from that seen in fibromyalgia, depression, and chronic fatigue syndrome. This meta-analysis provides strong evidence that some patients with LB have fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and neurocognitive difficulties that may last for years despite antibiotic treatment."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis transmits several pathogens including Borrelia burgdorferi. Bioactive compounds in tick saliva support tick feeding and influence pathogen transmission to the mammalian host. These studies utilized oral delivery of dsRNA to silence an anticomplement gene (isac) in I. scapularis nymphs. Silencing of isac significantly reduced fed-tick weight compared to delivery of control lacZ dsRNA, and immunoblots specific for FlaB protein indicated a reduction in spirochete load in isac-silenced infected nymphs. SDS-PAGE demonstrated that isac gene silencing affected expression of a number of salivary and non-salivary gland proteins in ticks. Finally, multiple isac cDNA homologues were cloned, and these may represent a new gene family coexpressed during tick feeding. This work presents a novel oral delivery approach for specific gene silencing in I. scapularis nymphs and characterizes the effect of isac on blood-feeding in an attempt to block transmission of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The objective of the present study was to assess the risk of borreliosis and anaplasmosis (ehrlichiosis) among the forestry workers of the Roztocze National Park (south-eastern Poland) by examination of Ixodes ricinus ticks living in park area with PCR method, and by the serological and clinical examination of the workers. In 406 examined ticks, the prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was 11.5 %. The nested PCR reaction for determining the genospecies showed that the most common was Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (55.3 % of total positive) followed by Borrelia afzelii (38.3 %). As many as 6.1 % out of 115 examined ticks showed the presence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA. The infection rate was high in males and females (14.3 % and 11.1 % respectively) and low in nymphs (1.5 %). In 46 out 113 examined forestry workers (40.7 %) the presence of specific IgG and/or IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was found in ELISA test, while only 4 out of 56 urban blood donors showed a positive response (p<0.0001). The prevalence of IgG antibodies against Anaplasma phagocytophilum determined with the use of indirect immunofluorescence test (IFA) was 17.7 % in forestry workers compared to 5.4 % in reference group of blood donors (p<0.05). No correlation was found between the presence of antibodies to A. phagocytophilum and to B. burgdorferi s. l. Clinical investigations of 113 forestry workers showed 3 cases of borreliosis (2.7 %) and no cases of anaplasmosis (ehrlichiosis). In conclusion, forestry workers of the Roztocze National Park in south-eastern Poland are often exposed to Ixodes ricinus ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and show a high proportion of asymptomatic borreliosis and anaplasmosis (ehrlichiosis) manifested by a positive serologic response, while the number of clinical cases is relatively low."

In USA only one species B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is prevalent, whereas in Europe at least 5 different pathogenic species could be identified. The most prevalent species are B. afzelii and B. garinii. Infection is not always causing disease. In early infection, a localized skin inflammation, called erythema migrans, occurs around the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination of Borrelia causes flu like symptoms up to meningitis and multiple erythemata migrantia on the skin. In late stage multiple organ systems can be affected, in Europe especially the skin with various forms of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, the central and peripheral nervous system, joints and heartmuscle. Lyme borreliosis can be diagnosed by the typical history, the clinical symptoms and the elevated Borrelia specific IgM- and IgG-antibodies in serum and CSF according to the MIQ guidelines, in special cases B. burgdorferi can be cultivated or DNA detected by PCR. Therapy of choice for early infection is oral antibiotics like doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime for at least 10 days up to 21 days. Late stage infections should be treated for 3-4 weeks. Patients with neurological symptoms should be treated intravenously with ceftriaxone or penicillin G."

Stimulation of the facial nerve was performed electrically at the stylomastoid foramen and magnetically at the labyrinthine segment of the Fallopian channel within 3 days from symptom onset in 65 patients with Bell's palsy, five patients with Zoster oticus, one patient with neuroborreliosis and one patient with nuclear facial nerve palsy due to multiple sclerosis. Absence or decreased amplitudes of muscle responses to early transcranial magnetic stimulation was not specific for Bell's palsy, but also evident in all cases of Zoster oticus and in the case of neuroborreliosis. Amplitudes of electrically evoked muscle responses were more markedly reduced in Zoster oticus as compared to Bell's palsy, most likely due to a more severe degree of axonal degeneration. The degree of amplitude reduction of the muscle response to electrical stimulation reliably correlated with the severity of facial palsy. Transcranial magnetic stimulation in the early diagnosis of Bell's palsy is less specific than previously thought. While not specific with respect to the etiology of facial palsy, transcranial magnetic stimulation seems capable of localizing the site of lesion within the Fallopian channel. Combined with transcranial magnetic stimulation, early electrical stimulation of the facial nerve at the stylomastoid foramen may help to establish correct diagnosis and prognosis."

When a hemagglutination-inhibition test was used, 8.7% of deer were found positive for tickborne encephalitis (TBE)-complex virus. A total of 42.6% were found positive by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for A. phagocytophilum with significant seasonal variation. All were PCR negative for Rickettsia helvetica. PCR and sequencing also showed a novel bacterium in roe deer previously only found in ticks. The study showed that the emerging pathogen A. phagocytophilum is widely distributed and that a marked shift has occurred in the distribution of TBE-complex virus in Denmark. This finding supports studies that predict alterations in distribution due to climatic changes."

		"abstract": "A large amount of knowledge has been acquired since the original descriptions of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and of its causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. The complexity of the organism and the variations in the clinical manifestations of LB caused by the different B. burgdorferi sensu lato species were not then anticipated. Considerable improvement has been achieved in detection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato by culture, particularly of blood specimens during early stages of disease. Culturing plasma and increasing the volume of material cultured have accomplished this. Further improvements might be obtained if molecular methods are used for detection of growth in culture and if culture methods are automated. Unfortunately, culture is insensitive in extracutaneous manifestations of LB. PCR and culture have high sensitivity on skin samples of patients with EM whose diagnosis is based mostly on clinical recognition of the lesion. PCR on material obtained from extracutaneous sites is in general of low sensitivity, with the exception of synovial fluid. PCR on synovial fluid has shown a sensitivity of up to >90% (when using four different primer sets) in patients with untreated or partially treated Lyme arthritis, making it a helpful confirmatory test in these patients. Currently, the best use of PCR is for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of suspected Lyme arthritis in patients who are IgG immunoblot positive. PCR should not be used as the sole laboratory modality to support a clinical diagnosis of extracutaneous LB. PCR positivity in seronegative patients suspected of having late manifestations of LB most likely represents a false-positive result. Because of difficulties in direct methods of detection, laboratory tests currently in use are mainly those detecting antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Tests used to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato have evolved from the initial formats as more knowledge on the immunodominant antigens has been collected. The recommendation for two-tier testing was an attempt to standardize testing and improve specificity in the United States. First-tier assays using whole-cell sonicates of B. burgdorferi sensu lato need to be standardized in terms of antigen composition and detection threshold of specific immunoglobulin classes. The search for improved serologic tests has stimulated the development of recombinant protein antigens and the synthesis of specific peptides from immunodominant antigens. The use of these materials alone or in combination as the source of antigen in a single-tier immunoassay may someday replace the currently recommended two-tier testing strategy. Evaluation of these assays is currently being done, and there is evidence that certain of these antigens may be broadly cross-reactive with the B. burgdorferi sensu lato species causing LB in Europe."

Infection occurs after the bite of an Ixodid tick that is infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs have often been reported to serve as effective sentinel animals to assess the risk of human B. burgdorferi infection. Based on published data of human Lyme disease case numbers and our clinical impressions, we hypothesized that canine exposure to B. burgdorferi would be lower in North Carolina when compared to the exposure in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated B. burgdorferi exposure status utilizing a specific and sensitive C6 peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our convenience sample included 1,666 canine serum samples submitted to the Vector-Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from North Carolina (n = 987), Virginia (n = 472), Maryland (n = 167), and Pennsylvania (n = 40). Comparisons among states were made using the Chisquare test or the Fisher's exact test; p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. A Chi-square test for trend was used to determine if there was an increase in the frequency of seroreactors associated with the geographical origin of the samples. The proportion of seroreactive dogs in North Carolina was markedly lower (p < 0.008) than that observed in dogs from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. These results support the hypothesis that B. burgdorferi transmission seems to occur infrequently in North Carolina dogs as compared to dogs residing in other southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. Furthermore, they support the utility of dogs as a sentinel to characterize the risk of B. burgdorferi transmission to humans in a defined geographical location."

In the northeastern U.S., the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is the primary vector and the white-footed mouse, (Peromyscus leucopus), the primary reservoir for Borrelia burgdorteri, the bacterium causing Lyme disease. Targeting I. scapularis engorging on white-footed mice with an effective biological control agent, such as the fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, could be an effective and relatively safe control technique. In 2002-2003, we performed laboratory and field experiments to determine whether M anisopliae-treated nesting material could effectively control larval I. scapularis ticks engorging on white-footed mice, and therefore reduce the number of infected nymphal I. scapularis questing the following summer. Our laboratory experiment demonstrated a strong negative effect of M. anisopliae-treated nesting material on survival of I. scapularis larvae feeding on P. leucopus, with 75% versus 35% larval mortality in treatment versus control nests. Our field trials caused only modest, localized reductions in nymphal abundance and had no effect on the proportion of nymphal I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi. Field results probably could be improved by increasing the density of nestboxes to allow fungal delivery to a higher proportion of the mouse population and by deploying nestboxes in an area with lower mammalian diversity, such as a suburban landscape."

In addition, the hypothetical possibility that peptides selected by this type of \"epitope discovery\" technique might identify the original antigens eliciting antibody responses was tested by searching for sequence similarities in bacterial protein databases. In support of this hypothesis, our search uncovered similarities between peptides representing two different sequence motifs and sequences in the VlsE and BBA61 antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi. Utilizing synthetic peptides, we verified that the sequence KAASKETPPALNK, located at the C terminus of the VlsE antigen, had the same reactivity pattern to sera from patients with extracutaneous Lyme disease as the diagnostic peptide SKEKPPSLNWPA, with which it shared a 7-amino-acid-residue match (consensus residues are underlined). A peptide with conservative mutations of five of the consensus residues was nonreactive, strongly suggesting that the VlsE sequence represents the epitope that originally elicited antibody responses in these patients. The diagnostic sensitivity of this new VlsE epitope was relatively low (30%) compared to that (100%) of the well-documented C6 diagnostic peptide of VlsE when tested in our small cohort of 10 patients with Lyme disease. Nonetheless, the identification of this previously unknown epitope serves as a proof of the principle of the hypothetical ability of \"epitope discovery\" techniques to detect specific microbial antigens with diagnostic relevance in infectious diseases."

It is important for family physicians to consider these illnesses when patients present with influenza-like symptoms. A petechial rash initially affecting the palms and soles of the feet is associated with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, whereas erythema migrans (annular macule with central clearing) is associated with Lyme disease. Various other rashes or skin lesions accompanied by fever and influenza-like illness also may signal the presence of a tick-borne disease. Early, accurate diagnosis allows treatment that may help prevent significant morbidity and possible mortality. Because 24 to 48 hours of attachment to the host are required for infection to occur, early removal can help prevent disease. Treatment with doxycycline or tetracycline is indicated for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and relapsing fever. In patients with clinical findings suggestive of tick-borne disease, treatment should not be delayed for laboratory confirmation. If no symptoms follow exposure to tick bites, empiric treatment is not indicated. The same tick may harbor different infectious pathogens and transmit several with one bite. Advising patients about prevention of tick bites, especially in the summer months, may help prevent exposure to dangerous vector-borne diseases."

The town dwellers' visit rates were grouped by ages and months. In the republic, Borreliae, the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, were first isolated from Ixodes ricinus by darkground microscopy. Thus, there is one more available Lyme borreliosis focus. Enzyme immunoassay was used to study the sera from the dwellers bitten by ticks. Anti-M and anti-G antibodies were isolated.

Doxycycline is the antimicrobial treatment of choice for all patients, regardless of age, with Rocky Mountain spotted fever, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat these infections in children but is demonstrably inferior to doxycycline. In patients with Mediterranean spotted fever, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, and newer macrolides all appear to be effective therapies. Therapy of Lyme disease depends on the age of the child and stage of the disease. For early localized disease, amoxicillin (for those aged <8 years) or doxycycline (for those aged >/=8 years) is effective. Doxycycline, penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) or penicillin G (benzylpenicillin) preparations, and erythromycin are all effective treatments for tick-borne relapsing fever. Hospitalized patients with tularemia should receive gentamicin or streptomycin. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin have each been investigated for the treatment of tularemia in outpatients; however, these agents do not yet have established roles in the treatment of this disease in children. Combination therapy with clindamycin and quinine is preferred for children with babesiosis; the combination of azithromycin and atovaquone also appears promising. Ribavirin has been recently shown to markedly improve survival in patients with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. The role of antiviral therapy in the treatment of other tick-borne viral infections, including other hemorrhagic fevers and tick-borne encephalitis, is not yet defined."

		"abstract": "Uveitis remains an important cause of visual impairment, particularly in young patients. Idiopathic forms of intraocular inflammation should no longer be regarded as a presumed clinical entity, and the ophthalmologist must reconsider the specific etiology of primary uveitis when the clinical examination does not yield a definitive diagnosis or when the course of the disease on corticosteroids remains atypical. Laboratory tests based on serum analysis have limited value and should not be considered as diagnostic proof in different clinical presentations. The diagnostic management of infectious uveitis has been greatly improved by the use of molecular techniques applied to ocular fluids and tissues. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is a powerful tool that should be proposed in atypical cases of uveitis or retinitis of unclear but potentially infectious origin. This strategy is a major step before using unconventional and new immunomodulatory agents such as anti-TNF-alpha molecules. Under strict experimental conditions including adequate testing to rule out a possible contamination, PCR and its variants have changed our practical approach to intraocular inflammatory disorders and have provided new details for the understanding of infectious uveitis. The concept of pathogen-induced intraocular inflammation can be revisited in the light of molecular data obtained after anterior chamber paracentesis or diagnostic vitrectomy."

It has been suggested that Borrelia induces the immunological mechanisms that either can amplify the inflammatory response or can suppress it. To reveal the underlying mechanisms of chemoattraction and activation of responding leukocytes, we investigated the induction of chemokines in human synoviocytes exposed to two different B. burgdorferi sensu stricto isolates (strain Geho and B31). Synoviocytes were exposed in vitro up to 5 days. Semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to assess the relative chemokine mRNA expression of RANTES/CCL5, SDF-1alpha/CXCL12 alpha, SDF-1beta/CXCL12 beta, MCP-1/CCL2, MCP-2/CCL8, IL-8/CXCL8 and MIP-1alpha/CCL3, and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) was used to assess the protein expression of RANTES, SDF-1, MCP-1, and MIP-1alpha in the culture supernatant. MCP-1 gene expression was not changed by strain B31 but MCP-1 gene expression along with protein concentration was suppressed by strain Geho. Both strains induced RANTES mRNA and protein concentration. SDF-1 gene expression was suppressed, whereas protein concentrations were unchanged by both strains. IL-8 gene expression was unchanged by using strain Geho but significantly upregulated by strain B31. Both strains induced MCP-2 mRNA expression. MIP-1alpha mRNA expression was induced, but chemokine concentration was suppressed by both strains. This study suggests that the orchestra of chemokines plays an important role in the immunopathogenesis of early Lyme arthritis."

In addition to HGA, human monocytic ehrlichiosis caused by E. chaffeensis has been reported in North America, as well as cases of infection due to E. ewingii in immunocompromised hosts.

Many Erp proteins have been demonstrated to bind the host complement regulator factor H, and may thereby help protect the bacteria from complement-mediated killing during mammalian infection. Consistent with that hypothesis, all Erp proteins are produced by Borrelia burgdorferi during transmission between tick vectors and mammalian hosts. The present study examined whether erp genes are also expressed by B. burgdorferi following establishment of mammalian infection. To that end, quantitative RT-PCR was utilized to assess erp transcription levels within different tissues of infected non-human primates, a model that closely mimics human Lyme disease. The majority of erp genes were detectably transcribed after more than 3 months of mammalian infection. Intriguingly, differences in expression levels were noted among the various erp loci. No significant differences in erp expression were apparent between examined tissues, which included central and peripheral nervous system tissue, skeletal muscle, bladder, skin and heart tissues. These data strongly suggest that Erp proteins are expressed by B. burgdorferi throughout infection of their vertebrate hosts."

People exposed to blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, from this region can potentially contract one or all of these diseases concurrently. Within the past several years, there have been cases of Lyme disease reported from southeastern Wisconsin, an area that contains deer, mice, and similar vegetation found at regions with high endemicity. However, past white-tailed deer surveys suggested no existence of I. scapularis in southeastern Wisconsin. However, in 1996, we identified questing adult I. scapularis in the southernmost part of the Southern Kettle Moraine State Forest, Walworth County. To determine whether an established population of I. scapularis exists in this region, we performed a detailed survey of the abundance of host-seeking I. scapularis adults and the presence and abundance of subadults feeding on white-footed mice, Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque. We also tested for possible infections of B. burgdorferi, Ba. microti, and A. phagocytophilum in ticks and B. burgdorferi harbored by mice. In 1997 and 1998, a total of 249 P. leucopus mice and 118 questing adult I. scapularis ticks, in addition to 157 larvae and seven nymphs feeding on mice, were collected and their locations were recorded from the Nordic trails of the Southern Kettle Moraine State Forest. Only one P. leucopus and its attached engorged I. scapularis nymph were infected with B. burgdorferi, whereas none of the engorged larvae attached to mice were infected. However, 4.2% of questing adult I. scapularis were infected with B. burgdorferi. The abundance of questing adult I. scapularis was 1.6 ticks per hour. The prevalence of subadult ticks on mice was 27%, with a mean intensity on infested mice of 2.0. I. scapularis adults were not infected with either Ba. microti or A. phagocytophilum. A unique strain of B. burgdorferi s.l. (W97F51) was discovered, showing 33 nucleotide substitutions and one codon insertion in a 567-bp fragment of the OspB gene, compared with Borrelia bissettii (strain Ca389). The sequences of ospA, ospB, ospC,fla, and rrs genes and the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region were compared between W97F51 and other B. burgdorferi s.l. species. Although W97F51 was most genetically related to B. bissettii, the genetic identity of W97F51 was less than that of B. bissettii conspecifics. This study documents the existence of an established population of I. scapularis and the presence of B. burgdorferi with a novel strain in southeastern Wisconsin."

		"abstract": "To evaluate their relative importance in tick-borne disease transmission in New Jersey, host-seeking Amblyomma americanum (L.) and Ixodes scapularis Say adults and nymphs were collected during spring activity periods in 2003 and 2004 to determine relative frequencies at which these ticks were encountered from an area known to be hyperendemic for Lyme disease. Although similar numbers of the two species were encountered during early spring of both years, A. americanum were encountered more often later in the season and exhibited a longer activity period than I. scapularis. A. americanum nymphs were collected at frequencies between 2.6 and 7.3 times higher than I. scapularis nymphs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of 121 A. americanum adults yielded infection prevalences of 9.1% for Borrelia lonestari, 12.3% for Ehrlichia chaffeenensis, and 8.2% for E. ewingii, and coinfection prevalences of 4.1% for E. chaffeensis/E. ewingii and 0.8% for E. chaffeensis/B. lonestari. Infection prevalences in 147 I. scapularis adults were 50.3% for B. burgdorferi, 6.1% for Anaplasma (Ehrlichia) phagocytophilum, and 1.4% for a recently described novel Borrelia species, whereas the coinfection prevalences were 2.7% for B. burgdorferi/A. phagocytophilum, 0.7% for B. burgdorferi/novel Borrelia, and 0.7% for A. phagocytophilum/novel Borrelia. The B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in I. scapularis was considerably higher than that in A. americanum. However, the higher A. americanum encounter frequencies compared with I. scapularis may result in increased risk of acquiring exposure to A. americanum-transmitted pathogens. The potential public health implications of these results are discussed."

		"abstract": "Reservoir competence for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, was tested for six species of native North American birds: American robin, gray catbird, brown thrasher, eastern towhee, song sparrow, and northern cardinal. Wild birds collected by mist netting on Fire Island, NY, were held in a field laboratory in cages over water and locally collected larval ticks were placed on the birds, harvested from the water after engorgement, and tested for infection by direct fluorescentantibody staining after molting to the nymphal stage. American robins were competent reservoirs, infecting 16.1% of larvae applied to wild-caught birds, compared with 0% of control ticks placed on uninfected laboratory mice. Robins that were previously infected in the laboratory by nymphal feeding infected 81.8% of applied larvae. Wild-caught song sparrows infected 4.8% of applied larvae and 21.1% when infected by nymphal feeding. Results suggest moderate levels of reservoir competence for northern cardinals, lower levels for gray catbirds, and little evidence of reservoir competence for eastern towhees or brown thrashers. Lower infection rates in larvae applied to wild-caught birds compared with birds infected in the laboratory suggest that infected birds display temporal variability in infectiousness to larval ticks. Engorged larvae drop from birds abundantly during daylight, so the abundance of these bird species in the peridomestic environment suggests that they might contribute infected ticks to lawns and gardens."

		"abstract": "In California, dense woodlands have been recognized as important biotopes where humans are exposed to the nymphal stage of the western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), in the far-western United States. To identify the principal reservoir host(s) of this spirochete, and of closely related spirochetes in the B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, in dense woodlands in Mendocino County, California, approximately 50 species of birds and mammals, including wood rats and kangaroo rats, were evaluated as potential hosts for vector ticks and borreliae in 2002 and 2003. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses revealed that many vertebrate species had been exposed to one or more members of the B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetal complex, only the western gray squirrel, Sciurus griseus, fulfilled the major criteria for a reservoir host of B. burgdorferi s.s. Ear-punch biopsies from eight of 10 squirrels collected from five separate woodlands were PCR-positive for B. burgdorferi s.s., 47% of I. pacificus larvae (n = 64) and 31% of nymphs (n = 49) removed from squirrels contained B. burgdorferi s.l., and the engorgement status of I. pacificus larvae was associated positively with acquisition of spirochetes. Overall, 83 and 100% of the amplicons sequenced from PCR-positive I. pacificus larvae and nymphs, respectively, were identified as B. burgdorferi s.s, Among the five remaining positive I. pacificus larvae, three contained B. bissettii and two had uncharacterized B. burgdorferi s.l. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was detected in one of five larvae and zero of two nymphs of the Pacific Coast tick, Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, that likewise had been removed from squirrels. The rickettsial agent of human anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, was detected in the blood or ear biopsies of two squirrels and in one (1.6%) of 64 I. pacificus larvae and two (4.1%) of 49 nymphs obtained from squirrels. The one rickettsial-positive larva was coinfected with B. burgdorferi s.s. The apparently high reservoir potential of S. griseus for B. burgdorferi s.s., plus the fact that the geographic distribution of this squirrel coincides well with that of most reported human cases of Lyme disease in this region, indicated that it may be essential for maintaining foci of B. burgdorferi s.s. in certain types of woodlands. The findings with respect to A. phagocytophilum, although of less certain significance, suggest that S. griseus could serve as a secondary host of this rickettsia."

In order to study early cytokine responses, in vitro differentiated dendritic cells (DCs) and whole blood cells from 21 patients with different clinical outcomes of Lyme neuroborreliosis were stimulated with live borrelia spirochetes. The borrelia-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12p70, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in DCs and IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, TNF-alpha, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta and eotaxin in whole blood cells was measured by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and multiplex arrays, respectively. We found increased numbers of TNF-alpha-secreting DCs (P = 0.018) in asymptomatic seropositive individuals compared to patients with subacute neuroborreliosis and seronegative controls. Asymptomatic individuals were also found to have elevated levels of IL-12p70 (P = 0.031) in whole blood cell supernatants compared to seronegative controls. These results are in line with previous experiments using cells of the adaptive immune response, indicating that strong T helper type 1 (Th1) proinflammatory responses might be associated with a successful resolution of Lyme disease."

It involves no DNA purification and is based on the amplification of a specific region of ospA gene of B. burgdorferi, followed by direct detection of the PCR product with SYBR Green I by agarose gel electrophoresis. The method was used to analyze samples from patients with LB diagnosis, with presumable infection with the LB spirochete, those with unclear clinical symptoms and after the course of an antibiotic treatment. Spirochetal DNA was detected by PCR even in contaminated samples in which B. burgdorferi was overgrown by fungi and other bacteria. Spirochetal DNA was detected and borrelia species was identified in cerebrospinal fluid of two patients hospitalized with the diagnosis \"fever of unknown origin\". Western blot and ELISA were negative in both cases. Total analysis of 94 samples from the hospital in Ceské Budejovice (South Bohemia, Czechia) showed infection with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in 11% and B. garinii in 15% of cases. The highest prevalence was found for B. afzelii (43%). Co-infection was confirmed in 24 % of the analyzed symplex; 7% of samples that were B. burgdorferi sensu lato positive gave no results in DNA amplification with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto-, B. garinii- and B. afzelii-specific primers. The proposed reliable, rapid, unexpensive and specific technique could form the basis of laboratory tests for routine detection and identification of Lyme-disease spirochete in different samples."

In addition to dermatological, cardiac, articular, and neurologic manifestations, psychiatric disorders such as depression, panic attacks, and schizophrenia-like psychosis can also arise. We report on a 61-year-old woman who developed a severe pain syndrome following several tick bites. She was diagnosed with neuroborreliosis; she received various courses of antibiotics over several years, but without any clinical improvement in her condition. Her eventual admission to a psychiatric ward due to mental symptoms and neuroleptic treatment led to a dramatic improvement of her pain symptoms. However, increasing delusions disclosed a psychotic episode, which ceased over time. We discuss therapeutic difficulties and psychiatric complications in the absence of a clear-cut diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. Although this patient might have suffered from late-onset schizophrenia with painful hallucinations right from the start of her disease, the case highlights psychiatric complications that might be associated with neuroborreliosis."

Because conflicting results may originate from the site of subcutaneous inoculation, we addressed the dissemination capacity of spirochetes injected in the shoulder region versus the footpad. Spirochetes inoculated in the footpad disseminated to a lesser extent to distant organs, such as the ear and the heart. This resulted in distinct degrees of joint and cardiac inflammation at the peak of the disease. The differences eventually leveled out. These results suggest that caution must be exercised in the interpretation of results obtained with routes of inoculation that do not closely represent the natural site of infection."

Members of four paralogous gene families, revealed by genome sequencing, have been suggested as replication/partition functions for both the linear and circular plasmids. Some of these genes have been experimentally shown to be essential for the replication of the B. burgdorferi replicons that encode them. In this study, we located the region essential for replication of lp17, the second smallest linear plasmid in B. burgdorferi. We used a novel in vivo method, targeted deletion walking, to systematically delete DNA from either the left or right end of lp17. We report that the region essential for replication of lp17 is 1.8 kb (bp 7946-9766) and contains only one intact open reading frame (BBD14). Expression of BBD14 is required for the replication, suggesting that it is the replication initiator for lp17. The BBD14 protein is a member of paralogous family (PF) 62 and we present the first experimental evidence for the role of a PF 62 member. Adjacent non-coding sequences are also required, suggesting that the origin lies at least partially outside the coding region. Surprisingly, deletion of BBD21, the ParA orthologue (PF 32), had little effect upon plasmid stability or incompatibility. Finally, data are presented suggesting that lp17 replication occurs preferentially on a linear rather than a circular DNA molecule."

Borrelia burgdorferi is the cause of Lyme borreliosis, and TBE is a biphasic meningoencephalitis induced by an arbovirus belonging to the flavivirus family. The principal aims of the current investigation were (i) to determine the frequency of serological evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and TBE infections in healthy agricultural and forestry workers, (ii) to determine the incidence of seroconversion for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and TBE virus in Tuscan workers during a 1-year survey; and (iii) to assess the occupational risk for agricultural and forestry activities in a defined area (Tuscany, Italy). A total of 412 blood samples were taken from agricultural and forestry workers, and information on age, duration of employment, and history of tick bites was collected in a questionnaire to establish the risk factors for the diseases. Three hundred sixty-five blood donors from the same region served as controls. To estimate the rate of seroconversion, 176 of the agricultural and forestry workers were tested 1 year later. IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and TBE virus were detected in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by Western blot analysis for Borrelia burgdorferi and by a test for inhibition of hemagglutination for TBE. Antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were more frequent among the workers than in the control group (7.8% vs. 4.9% in the IgG-IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 7.03% vs. 3.56% in the confirmatory test). No seropositivity was observed for TBE virus. Eighteen of 176 subjects who underwent a second blood test developed specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi within 1 year."

We previously demonstrated the epitope recognized by immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG OspC borreliacidal antibodies was located within the 50 amino acids nearest the carboxy (C) terminus. In this study, we show the immunodominant epitope is located in the highly conserved region within the seven C-terminal amino acids. Six early Lyme disease sera that contained borreliacidal activity and IgM and/or IgG OspC antibodies were chosen randomly and adsorbed with truncated OspC containing the 16 or 7 amino acids nearest the C terminus. Adsorptions with each truncated protein abrogated the borreliacidal activity completely. In addition, only small concentrations of OspC antibodies remained detectable by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting. Moreover, borreliacidal OspC antibodies were not induced in laboratory mice or hamsters despite heavy infections with B. burgdorferi spirochetes. These findings confirm that borreliacidal antibodies comprise the majority of the IgM and IgG OspC antibody response in human Lyme disease and that the epitope is located in the highly conserved C terminus. In addition, rodent animal models appear to be inappropriate subjects for assessing the effectiveness of the epitope for serodiagnosis or as a human Lyme disease vaccine."

		"abstract": "Establishing a causal relationship between optic neuritis and Lyme disease (LD) has been hampered by technical limitations in serologic diagnosis of LD. Even so, there is a general impression that optic neuritis is a common manifestation of LD. Retrospective case analysis of Lyme serology in 440 patients with optic neuritis examined between 1993 and 2003 in a single neuro-ophthalmic practice at Stony Brook University Medical Center, Suffolk County, New York, a region hyper-endemic for LD. Lyme enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was positive in 28 (6.4%) patients with optic neuritis, three of whom had syphilis with cross-reactive antibodies. Among the remaining 25 ELISA-positive patients, optic neuritis could be confidently attributed to LD in only one case, a patient with papillitis. The other 24 cases had reactive Lyme serologies related to a history of LD years earlier, asymptomatic exposure, false-positive results, or non-specific humoral expansion. The ELISA in these 24 cases were weakly positive and the Western blots were negative by Centers for Disease Control criteria. There were no significant clinical differences between the 25 seropositive optic neuritis cases and 50 seronegative optic neuritis cases. Based on these cases and a review of the literature, there is insufficient evidence for a causal link between LD and retrobulbar optic neuritis or neuroretinitis. There is sufficient evidence to establish a causal link between LD and papillitis and posterior uveitis."

		"abstract": "Here, we describe a structure-based approach to reduce the size of an antigen protein for a subunit vaccine. Our method consists of (i) determining the three-dimensional structure of an antigen, (ii) identifying protective epitopes, (iii) generation of an antigen fragment that contains the protective epitope, and (iv) rational design to compensate for destabilization caused by truncation. Using this approach we have successfully developed a second-generation Lyme disease vaccine. Outer surface protein A (OspA) from the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi elicits protective immunity that blocks transmission of Borrelia from the tick vector to the vaccinated animal, and thus has been a focus of vaccine development. OspA has two globular domains that are connected via a unique single-layer beta-sheet. All anti-OspA monoclonal antibodies that block Borrelia transmission bind to conformational epitopes in the C-terminal domain of OspA, suggesting the possibility of using the C-terminal domain alone as a recombinant protein-based vaccine. The removal of ineffective parts from the OspA antigen may reduce side effects and lead to a safer vaccine. We prepared a C-terminal fragment of OspA by removing approximately 45% of residues from the N terminus. Although the fragment retained the native conformation and affinity to a protective antibody, its vaccine efficacy and conformational stability were significantly reduced with respect to full-length OspA. We successfully stabilized the fragment by replacing amino acid residues involved in buried salt-bridges with residues promoting hydrophobic interactions. The mutations promoted the vaccine efficacy of the redesigned fragment to a level comparable to that of the full-length protein, demonstrating the importance of the antigen stability for OspA's vaccine efficacy. Our strategy should be useful for further refining OspA-based vaccines and developing recombinant vaccines for other diseases."

To our knowledge, only 4 cases of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans in children have been described. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent progression of disease and extracutaneous complications. We describe a 15-year-old girl with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans of the left leg that had been misdiagnosed as chronic venous insufficiency for 6 years. Because of the long-standing disease course, skin changes expanded and progressed to marked atrophy. The correct diagnosis was finally based on clinical, histopathologic, and serologic findings. The girl was treated with oral doxycycline for 6 weeks, but her skin changes did not fully normalize. This case illustrates the possibility of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans appearing in childhood and the difficulties in differentiating vascular disorders from acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans on the basis of the clinical appearance alone."

		"abstract": "Chronic, tertiary Lyme disease, a vector-borne infection most accurately designated neuroborreliosis, is often misdiagnosed. Infectors of the human brain, Lyme borrelial spirochetes are neurotropic, similar to the spirochetes of syphilis. Symptoms of either disease may be stable and persistent, transient and inconsistent or severe yet fleeting. Characteristics may be incompatible with established knowledge of neurological dermatomes, appearing to conventional medical eyes as anatomically impossible, thus creating confusion for doctors, parents and child patients. Physicians unfamiliar with Lyme patients' shifting, seemingly vague, emotional, and/or bizarre-sounding complaints, frequently know little about late-stage spirochetal disease. Consequently, they may accuse mothers of fabricating their children's symptoms--the so-called Munchausen's by proxy (MBP) \"diagnoses.\" Women, following ancient losses of feminine authority in provinces of religion, ethics, and healing - disciplines comprising known fields of early medicine, have been scapegoated throughout history. In the Middle Ages, women considered potentially weak-minded devil's apprentices became victims of witch-hunts throughout Europe and America. Millions of women were burned alive at the stake. Modern medicine's tendency to trivialize women's \"offbeat\" concerns and the fact that today's hurried physicians of both genders tend to seek easy panaceas, frequently result in the misogyny of mother-devaluation, especially by doctors who are spirochetally naïve. These factors, when involving cases of cryptic neuroborreliosis, may lead to accusations of MBP. Thousands of children, sick from complex diseases, have been forcibly removed from mothers who insist, contrary to customary evaluations, that their children are ill. The charges against these mothers relate to the idea they believe their children sick to satisfy warped internal agendas of their own. \"MBP mothers\" are then vilified, frequently jailed and publicly shamed for the \"sins\" of advocating for their children. In actuality, many such cases involve an unrecognized Lyme borreliosis causation that mothers may insist is valid despite negative tests. Doctors who have utilized MBP tactics against mothers are likely to be unaware that in advanced borreliosis, seronegativity is often the rule, a principle disagreed upon by its two extant, published, peer-reviewed, Standards of Care. These are guidelines for Lyme disease management--the older system questioning the existence of persistent Lyme and the newer system relying on established clinical criteria. Mothers must be free to obtain the family's preferred medical care by choosing between physicians practicing within either system without fear of reprisal. Doctors and mothers together may then explore medical options with renewed mutual respect toward the best interest of children's health."

The controversial science and politics of Lyme disease have created barriers to reliable diagnosis and effective treatment of this protean illness. Two major clinical hurdles are the absence of a therapeutic end point in treating Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, and the presence of tickborne coinfections with organisms such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Bartonella that may complicate the course of the disease. From a pathophysiologic standpoint, the affinity of Borrelia burgdorferi for multiple cell types and the presence of nonreplicating forms of the Lyme disease spirochete have contributed to persistent infection and failure of simple antibiotic regimens. Newer approaches to the treatment of Lyme disease should take into account its clinical complexity in coinfected patients and the possible need for prolonged combination therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of this potentially debilitating illness. The optimal antibiotic regimen for chronic Lyme disease remains to be determined."

ResT is an essential cellular function that processes replication intermediates to produce linear replicons terminated by covalently closed hairpin telomeres. ResT generates these hairpin telomeres in a reaction with mechanistic similarities to those catalyzed by type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. We report here, that like most of the tyrosine recombinases, ResT requires interprotomer communication, likely in an in-line synapse, to activate reaction chemistry. Unlike the tyrosine recombinases, however, we infer that the cleavage and strand transfer reactions on the two sides of the replicated telomere occur nearly simultaneously. Nonetheless, the chemical steps of the forward and reverse reactions performed by ResT can occur in a non-concerted fashion (i.e. events on the two sides of the replicated telomere can occur independently). We propose that uncoupling of reaction completion on the two sides of the substrate is facilitated by an early commitment to hairpin formation that is imposed by the precleavage action of the hairpin binding module of the ResT active site."

Considerable overlap can occur in the clinical presentation of Lyme arthritis and acute septic arthritis. Early differentiation is critical, given the disparate therapeutic implications; Lyme arthritis is treated with outpatient oral antibiotics, while septic arthritis requires hospitalization, IV antibiotics, and, often, surgical drainage. We wanted to identify MRI features that may distinguish Lyme arthritis from septic arthritis in children. Knee MR images in 11 children with Lyme arthritis and 7 with septic arthritis, with a mean age 10.6 years old and 11.7 years old, respectively, were reviewed by a radiologist blinded to the final diagnosis. Joint effusion size, synovial thickness, adenopathy, subcutaneous, marrow, and muscle edema on MRI; and clinical parameters including age, sex, fever, WBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and joint fluid WBC in the two patient groups were compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. Subcutaneous edema was seen in all septic arthritis patients but in only one of 11 patients with Lyme arthritis (p < 0.01). Myositis and adenopathy were present in all Lyme arthritis patients and two of seven patients with septic arthritis (both p < 0.01). No significant difference was present in synovial thickness, marrow edema, or joint fluid size. There were no statistically significant differences in the clinical parameters assessed. Our results identified three MRI features, specifically, myositis, adenopathy, and lack of subcutaneous edema, that strongly suggest the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis rather than septic arthritis in children with acute inflammation of the knee. Awareness of these characteristic MRI features may avoid unnecessary invasive procedures and cost."

The population distributions of tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection were assessed using quantitative PCR targeting the flaB gene of B. burgdorferi in the ear, heart base, quadriceps muscle, skin, and tibiotarsal joint tissue of C3H mice previously infected with A. phagocytophilum. Population distributions of Anaplasma infection were assessed by targeting the p44 gene. A. phagocytophilum in blood and serologic response to both agents were evaluated. Spirochete numbers were increased in the ears, heart base, and skin of coinfected mice, but Anaplasma numbers remained constant. Antibody response to A. phagocytophilum, but not B. burgdorferi, was decreased in coinfected mice. These results suggest that coinfection with A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi modulates pathogen burden and host antibody responses. This may be explained by the ability of A. phagocytophilum to functionally impair neutrophils, important cells in the early defense against B. burgdorferi infection."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, down-regulates outer surface protein A (OspA), which is abundantly expressed in ticks, during infection of the mammalian host. In this study we examined the signals that may be responsible for maintaining the OspA-negative state of spirochetes during infection. Transcription of ospA mRNA was found in tissues of C3H-severe combined immunodeficient (C3H-scid) mice, but not immunocompetent C3H mice, inoculated with cultured B. burgdorferi, tick-borne spirochetes, and host-adapted spirochetes. Transcription was more frequent at 4 weeks than at 1 week. Transcription was present at the host-tick interface as early as 24 h after tick attachment but declined at 48 and 72 h. Thus, ospA mRNA transcription in distant tissues and at later times in C3H-scid mice is probably due to up-regulation during infection. Adoptive lymphocyte transfer from naive C3H mice to infected C3H-scid mice resulted in OspA seroconversion, confirming OspA expression in the host. Passive transfer of normal mouse serum, immunoglobulin M (IgM) from normal mouse serum, or IgG from normal mouse serum into infected C3H-scid mice resulted in down-regulation of ospA, but transfer of normal mouse serum depleted of immunoglobulin did not influence ospA mRNA transcription. Collectively, our results indicate that ospA mRNA transcription in the host is regulated by nonspecific immunoglobulin, which may be a natural antibody."

		"abstract": "Infection of C57BL/6 (B6) mice with the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi can result in development of arthritis and carditis. B. burgdorferi induces expression of beta2/CD18 integrins, adhesion molecules that mediate the firm adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium necessary for cellular extravasation during inflammation. The important role of beta2/CD18 integrins during extravasation suggests that these molecules play a role in the development of Lyme arthritis and carditis. The dependency of these inflammatory processes on the beta2 integrins was investigated in CD18 hypomorph mice, which express low levels of CD18. The results indicate that CD18 deficiency did not abrogate development of Lyme arthritis or carditis. Moreover, it resulted in increased severity of Lyme carditis. B. burgdorferi-infected CD18 hypomorph mice showed an increased macrophage infiltration of the heart, while they produced lower levels of borreliacidal anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies compared to wild-type mice. In accordance with these results, we demonstrate that dendritic cells from CD18 hypomorph mice secrete higher levels of monocyte/macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2) in response to B. burgdorferi. Similarly, we show by real-time PCR that B. burgdorferi-infected hearts from CD18 hypomorph mice express increased levels of MCP-1 RNA compared to wild-type mice. Overall, our results indicate that beta2 integrin deficiency does not abrogate B. burgdorferi-induced inflammation; rather, it results in increased recruitment of macrophages into the B. burgdorferi-infected heart, likely due to the increased expression of MCP-1 in this tissue. Thus, beta2 integrins may play a regulatory role in B. burgdorferi-induced inflammation beyond mediating adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium."

Clinical signs of Lyme disease occurred in 39/62 dogs, the remaining 23 being subclinically infected. Clinical signs consisted of one to six episodes of transitory lameness with joint swelling and pain, most commonly affecting the elbow or shoulder joints. The polymerase chain reaction and culture demonstrated that the dogs remained infected for up to 581 days. At necropsy, gross findings consisted of lymphadenopathy in the area of tick attachment. Microscopical changes consisted of effusive fibrinosuppurative inflammation or nonsuppurative inflammation, or both, affecting synovial membranes, joint capsules and associated tendon sheaths. Plasma cells dominated areas of chronic inflammation, with CD3(+) T cells being present in lesser numbers. Microscopical signs of arthritis were polyarticular and more widespread than indicated by clinical signs, and most of the subclinically affected animals also had synovitis. In areas of tick attachment to the skin, hyperkeratosis and a mixture of suppurative and nonsuppurative dermatitis were encountered. Lymphadenopathy in superficial lymph nodes resulted from follicular and parafollicular hyperplasia. In 14/62 dogs, lymphoplasmacytic periarteritis and perineuritis were noted, resembling lesions found in human Lyme disease and syphilis, in which an underlying microangiopathy has been proposed."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial tick borne infection due to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In 50% of the cases, the disease begins by a centrifuge erythema migrans localized around the tick bite. Neurological, articular and rarely cardiac, ocular or cutaneous manifestation may be observed as secondary manifestations. They sign the dissemination, the proliferation of Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato and the development of the immune response. In the absence of erythema migrans, secondary clinical manifestations may be difficult to diagnose. Direct detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato by culture is fastidious, time consuming and of a low sensitivity. Molecular methods (polymerase chain reaction) are very specific but limited by a low bacterial burden in the tissues. Serological testing interpretation is tricky but guides the diagnosis at the disseminate phase. Curative antibiotherapy is efficient, especially at the initial phase of infection. The two main elements for prophylaxis are individual protection from tick bites and a rapid and complete tick extraction. Antibioprophylaxy of tick bites is not recommended and a strict clinical surveillance must be done."

Sequencing of the T-cell receptors of the OspA reactive clones showed significant skewing of the T-cell receptor repertoire. Of the 101 T-cell clones sequenced, 81 possessed TCR beta chains that were present in at least one other clone isolated. Complete sequencing of both alpha and beta chains of a subset of clones showed that at least two distinct T-cell clones were expanded in vivo. Binding studies using a panel of Ala-substituted peptide ligands were performed to determine potential MHC binding sites of the OspAp164-175 to DRB1*0401. In addition, T-cell clones were tested functionally for their reactivity to the wild-type peptide as well as to altered peptide ligands (APLs) and peptide libraries based on the OspA epitope in order to determine the TCR contact residues and the stringency in T cell recognition. We are among the first to define the characteristics of TCR usage of T cells isolated from an inflamed immune compartment in an individual with an autoimmune disease potentially triggered by a microbial antigen."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, which is prevalent both in the US and in Europe, is an infectious disease that may cause local inflammation in numerous organs. We have hypothesized that, as with some neurodegenerative diseases, the pathogenesis of the neurocognitive deficiencies associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis of the central nervous system also has an inflammatory component. Dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha can lead to neuronal damage. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play a key role in the regulation of neuronal development, growth, and survival, as well as that of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. As a model, we explored the possibility that MAPK-mediated lipoprotein-induced apoptosis and gliosis of rhesus monkey astrocytes stimulated in vitro. Lipoproteins are the key inflammatory molecule type of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, and we had previously shown that lipoprotein-induced TNF-alpha production in astrocytes caused astrocyte apoptosis, and IL-6 enhanced proliferation of these cells. Lipoproteins readily activated p38 and Erk1/2 MAPK, thus enlisting these pathways among the kinase pathways that spirochetes may address as they invade the central nervous system. We also investigated whether specific inhibition of p38 and Erk1/2 MAPK would inhibit TNF-alpha and IL-6 production and thus astrocyte apoptosis, and proliferation, respectively. Lipoprotein-stimulated IL-6 production was unaffected by the MAPK inhibitors. In contrast, inhibition of both p38 and Erk1/2 significantly diminished TNF-alpha production, and totally abrogated production of this cytokine when both MAPK pathways were inhibited simultaneously. MAPK inhibition thus may be considered as a strategy to control inflammation and apoptosis in Lyme neuroborreliosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a potentially serious infection common in Germany, but little data about its incidence, distribution, and clinical manifestations are available. Lyme borreliosis is not a notifiable disease in Germany, but six of Germany's 16 states - Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt and Thüringen, have enhanced notification systems, which do include Lyme borreliosis. The efforts made in these states to monitor confirmed cases through notification are therefore an important contribution to understanding the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis in Germany. This report summarises the analysis of Lyme borreliosis cases submitted to the Robert Koch-Institut during 2002-2003. The average incidence of Lyme borreliosis of the six East German states was 17.8 cases per 100,000 population in 2002 and increased by 31% to 23.3 cases in 2003, respectively. Patient ages were bimodally distributed, with incidence peaks among children aged 5- 9 and elderly patients, aged 60- 64 in 2002, and 65- 69 in 2003. For both years, 55% of patients were female. Around 86% of notified cases occurred from May to October. Erythema migrans affected 2697 patients (89.3%) in 2002 and 3442 (86.7%) in 2003. For a vector-borne disease, like Lyme borreliosis, the risk of infection depends on the degree and duration of contact between humans and ticks harbouring Borrelia burgdorferi. As infectious ticks probably occur throughout Germany, it is likely that the situation in the remaining 10 German states is similar to that of the states in this study."

The study included 122 forestry workers; the control group consisted of 93 indoor workers. All participants were examined twice in 2002: before the beginning of tick activity (March) and at the end of tick activity (November). At each examination, principal demographic and epidemiological data were collected and a blood sample taken for serological analysis. Specific IgM and IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. in the paired sera were determined with an in-house IFA and a commercially available ELISA flagellin test (DAKO). 9.8% of the forestry workers and 4.3% of the indoor workers tested positive for IgG with the IFA (p = 0.26); 23.8% of the forestry workers and 9.7% of the indoor workers tested positive for IgG with the ELISA (p = 0.02). During the study period the incidence of symptomatic Lyme borreliosis was 2.3% and the rate of IgG and/or IgM seroconversion of 10.2% was the same with both tests. The seroprevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. among the Slovene forestry workers was greater than among the indoor workers, but the difference between the two groups was not significant when the IFA was used. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis during the period of tick activity was lower than we expected, with a large proportion of seroconversions being asymptomatic."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) group spirochetes, collectively known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, are distributed worldwide. Wild rodents are acknowledged as the most important reservoir hosts. Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the eastern United States, and in the southeastern United States, the larvae and nymphs mostly parasitize certain species of lizards. The primary aim of the present study was to determine whether wild lizards in the southeastern United States are naturally infected with Lyme borreliae. Blood samples obtained from lizards in Florida and South Carolina were tested for the presence of LB spirochetes primarily by using B. burgdorferi sensu lato-specific PCR assays that amplify portions of the flagellin (flaB), outer surface protein A (ospA), and 66-kDa protein (p66) genes. Attempts to isolate spirochetes from a small number of PCR-positive lizards failed. However, PCR amplification and sequence analysis of partial flaB, ospA, and p66 gene fragments confirmed numerous strains of B. burgdorferi sensu lato, including Borrelia andersonii, Borrelia bissettii, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, in blood from lizards from both states. B. burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was identified in 86 of 160 (54%) lizards representing nine species and six genera. The high infection prevalence and broad distribution of infection among different lizard species at different sites and at different times of the year suggest that LB spirochetes are established in lizards in the southeastern United States."

		"abstract": "Bloodstream invasion in Lyme disease has been difficult to study because until recently blood culture methods were too insensitive to detect spirochetemia. To evaluate the clinical and laboratory features of spirochetemic patients. Cross-sectional study. Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center in Valhalla, New York, 1997 to 2002. 213 untreated adults with erythema migrans. Blood culture for Borrelia burgdorferi. Symptom scores and selected laboratory measures. Spirochetemia was found in 93 (43.7%) patients. Spirochetemic patients were more often symptomatic (89.2% vs. 74.2%; P = 0.006) and more often had multiple erythema migrans lesions (41.9% vs. 15.0%; P < 0.001) than patients without spirochetemia. However, 8 (22.9%) of the 35 asymptomatic patients with a single skin lesion nevertheless had a positive blood culture. Risk for spirochetemia was present the day the patient noticed the lesion and continued for more than 2 weeks. Long-term outcome data were not available. The high rate, early onset, and prolonged duration of risk for spirochetemia explain why untreated patients with erythema migrans are at risk for dissemination of B. burgdorferi to anatomic sites beyond the lesion site. Differences in the strain of the infecting spirochete, as well as host factors, may be important determinants of hematogenous dissemination."

Additionally, immature stages of I. pararicinus collected on wild mice and birds in Uruguay and Argentina were compared with specimens from the laboratory colony. A taxonomic key to the nymphs of the species of the ricinus complex established in the Western Hemisphere is presented. The distribution of I. pararicinus comprises Argentina, Colombia and Uruguay, but it is also probably established in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile and Peru. Most adult ticks of this species have been found on introduced domestic artiodactyles, although Neotropical deer species must have been the ancestral host. Larvae and nymphs of I. pararicinus have also been found on sigmodontine rodents and passeriform birds. Although I. pararicinus is a member of the ricinus complex, which contains the main vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), there are few studies concerning its potential for pathogen transmission."

Doxycyline and ceftiofur treatment were inconsistent in eliminating persistent infection in this experimental model. However, tetracycline treatment seems to eliminate persistent infection. Although serum antibody levels to B. burgdorferi in all ponies declined gradually after antibiotic treatment, three out of four ponies treated with doxycline and two out of four ponies treated with ceftiofur, serum KELA titers were raised again 3 month after treatment was discontinued. Five months after antibiotic treatment, tissues aseptically collected at necropsy from ponies with increased antibody levels after antibiotic treatment also showed culture positive to B. burgdorferi in various post-mortem tissues. However, all four-tetracycline treatment ponies showed a negative antibody level and culture negative from post-mortem tissues. Untreated infected ponies maintained high KELA titers throughout the study and were tissue culture positive."

First, the nucleotides of B. burgdorferi tRNA(Lys) in contact with B. burgdorferi LysRS were determined by enzymatic footprinting experiments. Second, the kinetic parameters for a series of variants of the B. burgdorferi tRNA(Lys) were then determined during aminoacylation by B. burgdorferi LysRS.

Transplantation of the identified identity elements into the Escherichia coli tRNA(Asp) scaffold endowed lysylation activity on the resulting chimera, indicating that a functional B. burgdorferi lysine tRNA identity set had been determined."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease, is a zoonotic spirochetal bacterium that depends on arthropod (Ixodes ticks) and mammalian (rodent) hosts for its persistence in nature. The quest to identify borrelial genes responsible for Bb's parasitic dependence on these two diverse hosts has been hampered by limitations in the ability to genetically manipulate virulent strains of Bb. Despite this constraint, we report herein the inactivation and genetic complementation of a linear plasmid-25-encoded gene (bbe16) to assess its role in the virulence, pathogenesis, and survival of Bb during its natural life cycle. bbe16 was found to potentiate the virulence of Bb in the murine model of Lyme borreliosis and was essential for the persistence of Bb in Ixodes scapularis ticks. As such, we have renamed bbe16 a gene encoding borrelial persistence in ticks (bpt)A. Although protease accessibility experiments suggested that BptA as a putative lipoprotein is surface-exposed on the outer membrane of Bb, the molecular mechanism(s) by which BptA promotes Bb persistence within its tick vector remains to be elucidated. BptA also was shown to be highly conserved (>88% similarity and >74% identity at the deduced amino acid levels) in all Bb sensu lato strains tested, suggesting that BptA may be widely used by Lyme borreliosis spirochetes for persistence in nature. Given Bb's absolute dependence on and intimate association with its arthropod and mammalian hosts, BptA should be considered a virulence factor critical for Bb's overall parasitic strategy."

PCR for A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi was negative in all blood and kidney samples. Increased seroprevalence was a positive function of rainfall. Ehrlichial seropositivity was increased in blue-oak foothill pine, montane hardwood, and redwood vegetation regions, and decreased in coastal sagebrush and cropland. Increased exposure to B. burgdorferi occurred in blue oak woodland."

The symptomatology is classically divided into three phases depending on the time between the tick bite and the first symptoms. However, in a number of cases this clinical division of the disease is not easily applied. We describe three cases of atypical ocular manifestations to illustrate this problem. Recently developed laboratory tests help confirm the diagnosis but should not be used without a good knowledge of the disease. This study aims to emphasize the difficulty of diagnosis and the importance of appropriate treatment and to avoid potentially permanent complications."

The predicted amino acid sequences of these genes (BH0209, BH0512, and BH0553) have hydrophobic N termini, indicating that these proteins may be secreted. B. hermsii transcribed the three ORFs in vitro, and the BH0512- and BH0553-encoded proteins (PBH-512 and PBH-553) were produced in vitro and in experimentally infected mice. PBH-512 and PBH-553 were on the spirochete's outer surface, and antiserum to these proteins reduced the adherence of B. hermsii to red blood cells. PCR analyses of 28 isolates of B. hermsii and 8 isolates of B. turicatae demonstrated polymorphism in each gene correlated with the number of repeats. Serum samples from relapsing fever patients reacted with recombinant PBH-512 and PBH-553, suggesting that these proteins are produced during human infection. These polymorphic proteins may be involved in the pathogenicity of these relapsing fever spirochetes and provide a mechanism for antigenic heterogeneity within their populations."

These 20 patients were representative of the spectrum of the severity and duration of Lyme arthritis. Among the 124 antibiotic-treated patients, 53% with culture-proven erythema migrans (EM) had IgG responses to recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Arp, as did 59% of the patients with facial palsy and 68% of those with Lyme arthritis. In addition, 75 to 80% of the 20 past, untreated patients had reactivity with this protein when EM was present, during initial episodes of joint pain, or during the maximal period of arthritis. There was no association at any of these three time points between GST-Arp antibody levels and the severity of the maximal attack of arthritis or the total duration of arthritis. Thus, after the first several weeks of infection, 60 to 80% of patients had IgG antibody responses to GST-Arp, but this response did not correlate with the severity or duration of Lyme arthritis."

The lack of an adequate ex vivo system for human tissue infection is an obstacle to fully understanding the molecular mechanisms of invasion of tissue by B. burgdorferi and its adaptation within the human host. Here, we report on the development of such a system. We inoculated blocks of human tonsillar tissue with B. burgdorferi spirochetes, cultured them in a low-shear rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor, and analyzed them using light and electron microscopy, nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and quantitative real-time PCR. Also, we evaluated the expression of the outer surface proteins (Osps) OspA and OspC by use of quantitative Western blotting. Light and electron microscopic analysis revealed multiple spirochetes localized extracellularly within the tissue, and their identity was confirmed by PCR. Quantification of spirochetes inside the RWV-cultured tonsillar tissue demonstrated that the number of B. burgdorferi exceeded the initial inoculum by an order of magnitude, indicating that spirochetes replicated in the tissue. Electron microscopic analysis showed that some spirochetes were arranged in cystic structures and that invading spirochetes differentially expressed surface proteins; both of these features have been described for infected tissues in vivo. The system we have developed can be used to study B. burgdorferi pathogenesis under controlled conditions ex vivo, in particular to explore the gene activation responsible for the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to human tissue that leads to Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Defining the metabolic capabilities and regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression is a valuable step in understanding the pathogenic properties of infectious agents such as Borrelia burgdorferi. The present studies demonstrated that B. burgdorferi encodes functional Pfs and LuxS enzymes for the breakdown of toxic products of methylation reactions. Consistent with those observations, B. burgdorferi was shown to synthesize the end product 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) during laboratory cultivation. DPD undergoes spontaneous rearrangements to produce a class of pheromones collectively named autoinducer 2 (AI-2). Addition of in vitro-synthesized DPD to cultured B. burgdorferi resulted in differential expression of a distinct subset of proteins, including the outer surface lipoprotein VlsE. Although many bacteria can utilize the other LuxS product, homocysteine, for regeneration of methionine, B. burgdorferi was found to lack such ability. It is hypothesized that B. burgdorferi produces LuxS for the express purpose of synthesizing DPD and utilizes a form of that molecule as an AI-2 pheromone to control gene expression."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of infection of Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) with Borrelia spp. was evaluated in an area of northwestern California (USA) where Lyme disease is endemic and the relapsing-fever group spirochete Borrelia coriaceae is enzootic, and in a far-removed comparison area having a disparate climate and lower density of vector ticks. Blood samples collected from both deer herds in 1987, 1988, and from 2000-02 were assayed for borrelial infection with microscopic and molecular methods. Serum specimens from two (5%) of 39 deer from the Dye Creek Preserve in Tehama County versus 13 (20%) of 64 animals from the Hopland Research and Extension Center (HREC) in Mendocino County, California were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test positive for B. burgdorferi sensu lato. DNA sequencing analyses revealed that eight animals were infected with B. bissettii, six with three unclassified genotypes, and one with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. One serum sample (2%) from HREC was positive for a relapsing-fever group spirochete that had a 16S rRNA sequence homology of 99% with the C053 type strain of B. coriaceae. Spirochetes undetermined to geno-species were detected in thick-blood drops prepared from three (8%) of 36 deer from the HREC by direct immunofluorescence. Adults of the hippoboscid flies Lipoptena depressa (n=73) and Neolipoptena ferrisi (n=24), the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis) (n=22), and the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) (n=1) that had been removed from deer from both study areas in 2002 were PCR test negative for borreliae. The occurrence of diverse borreliae in deer from northern California confounds and, consequently, reduces the utility of borrelial serosurveys for detecting specific genospecies, unless they are complemented by more specific assays (e.g., immunoblotting, PCR/sequencing analysis)."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, is a multi-organ infection with dermatological, rheumatological, neurological, and cardiac manifestations. The main characteristic is a skin lesion, named erythema migrans. Relapsing fever, caused by numerous species of Borrelia, is characterized by a periodic cycle of acute and afebrile episodes. The serological diagnosis of these infections has limited value in sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Lyme borreliosis is usually diagnosed by recognition of a characteristic clinical picture with serological confirmation, and the diagnosis of relapsing fever relies on direct observation of spirochetes in peripherical blood. The elected treatment is almost always tetracycline for the young or for adults but not for pregnant women, although betalactamic (such as penicillin or 3rd generation cephalosporin for the central nervous system) or macrolides are indicated in several situations. The prognosis, with adequate treatment, is good. In the majority of Spanish regions, due to the low incidence of these diseases, the prophylactic antimicrobial treatment after a tick bite is not indicated."

To test this hypothesis and whether identical genotypes infect humans and small mammals in specific sites, B. burgdorferi ospC heterogeneity was tested among isolates from northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. Six culture-positive patients allowed collection of small animals from their properties, and spirochetes from animals trapped within 300 yards of each patient's home were isolated. 3' ospC sequences were compared to reference sequences. Of the 7 human and 15 mouse DNA templates that produced reliable sequences, all clustered with references into only four and seven distinct clades, respectively. A human and a mouse isolate with the same ospC were seen in only one locality, and five of six sites contained two or more B. burgdorferi ospC clones. Four invasive patient isolates and six small mammal isolates clustered with \"noninvasive\" reference ospC genotypes. A high degree of ospC diversity exists among B. burgdorferi isolates in Maryland and Pennsylvania, even in narrowly defined geographic localities. Dissemination in mice and humans by noninvasive ospC types contradicts the ospC invasiveness hypothesis. Alternative genetic markers for B. burgdorferi disseminated disease should be investigated."

		"abstract": "bmp gene family 36 of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, comprises four paralogs: bmpA, bmpB, bmpC, and bmpD. The bmpA and bmpB genes constitute an operon. All four genes have been found to be transcribed in cultured spirochetes. Expression from the bmpAB operon results in three distinct transcripts of 1.1, 1.6, and 2.4 kb, and the relative expression of bmpA mRNA is three- to fourfold greater than that of bmpB mRNA. However, thus far only expression of the BmpA protein has been demonstrated. Therefore, in this study we characterized the origins of the three transcripts and compared the relative expression of the BmpA and BmpB proteins. Northern blotting revealed that the three distinct transcripts originated from a single promoter located upstream of bmpA but terminated either 3' to the bmpA (1.1-kb RNA) or bmpB (2.4-kb RNA) gene or, most unusually, within the bmpB gene (1.6-kb RNA). Termination within the bmpB gene was associated with a functional Rho-independent transcription terminator. At the protein level, we also observed a 4.3-fold greater abundance of BmpA compared to that of BmpB. These studies identify a transcription termination mechanism in B. burgdorferi resulting in the disparate expression of the two genes of the bmpAB operon."

It has been studied extensively to help understand its pathogenicity of infection and how it can persist in different mammalian hosts. We report the proteomic analysis of the archetype B. burgdorferi B31 strain and two other strains (ND40, and JD-1) having different Borrelia pathotypes using strong cation exchange fractionation of proteolytic peptides followed by high-resolution, reversed phase capillary liquid chromatography coupled with ion trap tandem mass spectrometric analysis. Protein identification was facilitated by the availability of the complete B31 genome sequence. A total of 665 Borrelia proteins were identified representing approximately 38% coverage of the theoretical B31 proteome. A significant overlap was observed between the identified proteins in direct comparisons between any two strains (>72%), but distinct differences were observed among identified hypothetical and outer membrane proteins of the three strains. Such a concurrent proteomic overview of three Borrelia strains based upon only the B31 genome sequence is shown to provide significant insights into the presence or absence of specific proteins and a broad overall comparison among strains."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a potentially serious infection common in Germany, but little data about its incidence, distribution, and clinical manifestations are available. Lyme borreliosis is not a notifiable disease in Germany, but six of Germany's 16 states - Berlin, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Sachsen, Sachsen-Anhalt and Thüringen, have enhanced notification systems, which do include Lyme borreliosis. The efforts made in these states to monitor confirmed cases through notification are therefore an important contribution to understanding the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis in Germany. This report summarises the analysis of Lyme borreliosis cases submitted to the Robert Koch-Institut during 2002-2003. The average incidence of Lyme borreliosis of the six East German states was 17.8 cases per 100 000 population in 2002 and increased by 31% to 23.3 cases in 2003, respectively. Patient ages were bimodally distributed, with incidence peaks among children aged 5- 9 and elderly patients, aged 60- 64 in 2002, and 65- 69 in 2003. For both years, 55% of patients were female. Around 86% of notified cases occurred from May to October. Erythema migrans affected 2697 patients (89.3%) in 2002 and 3442 (86.7%) in 2003. For a vector-borne disease, like Lyme borreliosis, the risk of infection depends on the degree and duration of contact between humans and ticks harbouring Borrelia burgdorferi. As infectious ticks probably occur throughout Germany, it is likely that the situation in the remaining 10 German states is similar to that of the states in this study."

Vasculitis is a frequent cause of neuropathy in the setting of a connective tissue disease. The infectious neuropathies most likely to be encountered in the United States are those due to varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Lyme disease, hepatitis C virus, and, most recently, West Nile virus. Inherited neuropathies are divided into 2 main types: predominant motor or predominant sensory. The former are generally classed as the Charcot-Marie-Tooth diseases and the latter as the hereditary sensory neuropathies. Each category has a number of different subtypes. If the results of routine screening tests are negative, the clinician must consider special testing for unusual disorders, including evaluations for underlying autoimmune or malignant disorders, genetic tests for inherited neuropathies, and other unusual or selectively ordered tests. These tests are very expensive and should be ordered only after the common causes of neuropathy are excluded. Unless the neuropathy can be substantially alleviated or cured, symptomatic treatment (most often for pain) plays a significant role for these patients."

The \"one-step system\" of testing for IgM and IgG antibodies in LB is economically preferably, but it requires an EIA kit with more than 90% sensitivity and specificity. 90 blood samples were collected, 54 from patients with clinically defined LB and 36 samples from individuals free of LB. IgM and IgG antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were detected in parallel with five different EIA kits from various producers. The results were verified clinically in all cases, in disputable cases with additional immunoblot (BAG-Med), and analyzed statistically. Specificity and sensitivity were calculated from the measured values, and diagnostic efficiency was determined for each EIA kit. EIA kits for antiborrelia antibody assay with high specificity have low sensitivity and vice versa. In 9 samples from patients with clinical diagnoses (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, epilepsy, rheumatoid arthritis) we found false positives in EIA and WB tests. The best results for a \"one-step system\" of examinations for antiborrelia antibodies were obtained with the Abbot and Euroimmun EIA kits in our set. A \"two-step system\" of serological examination could be composed from the basic IgM and IgG examination with a high sensitivity EIA kit (Viroimmun, Test-Line) followed with confirmation of positives by specific immunoblot."

The prototype CRASP-1 of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (CRASP-1Bb) has been formerly characterized. As shown recently, serum-resistant Borrelia afzelii strains express a unique FHL-1 and factor H-binding protein, designated CRASP-1Ba. Here, we describe for the first time the isolation and functional characterization of the gene encoding the full-length CRASP-1Ba of 28 kDa, which, upon processing, is predicted to be 26.4 kDa. CPASP-1Ba of B. afzelii spirochetes is associated with a genetic locus encoding the orthologous gbb54 gene family that maps to the linear plasmid of approximately 54 kb. Ligand affinity blotting techniques demonstrate that both native and recombinant CRASP-1Ba molecules strongly bind to FHL-1 and much more weakly to factor H. The FHL-1 and factor-H-binding site in CRASP-1Ba is shown to be localized to a 12-amino-acid residue domain at the C terminus of the protein. For comparison, the corresponding cspA-like gene(s) of a serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii strain has also been cloned and characterized. Most notably, two CRASP-1-related B. garinii proteins were identified; however, both molecules bind only weakly to FHL-1 and not at all to factor H. The present identification of the binding site of CRASP-1Ba represents an important step forward in our understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and may be helpful to design therapeutic regimens to interfere with complement evasion strategies of human pathogenic Borrelia strains."

A protein displaying this activity was purified from B. burgdorferi by a two-step chromatographic procedure, yielding a approximately 300-kDa homo-oligomeric enzyme formed by monomers of approximately 50 kDa. Gel enzymography experiments showed that enzymatic activity depends on the oligomeric structure of the protease but does not involve interchain disulfide bonds. The enzyme was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as the putative aminopeptidase II of B. burgdorferi, encoded by the gene BB0069. It shares significant identity to members of the M29/T family of metallopeptidase, is sensitive to bestatin, has a neutral pH optimum, and displays maximal activity at 60 degrees C. Its activity is 1.75-fold higher at the temperature of the mammalian host than at that of the insect host of the pathogen. The activity of this thermophilic aminopeptidase of B. burgdorferi (TAP(Bb)) depends on Zn2+, and temperatures over 70 degrees C promoted its inactivation through a transition from the hexameric state to the monomeric state. Since B. burgdorferi is deficient in pathways for amino acid synthesis, TAP(Bb) could play a role in supplying required amino acids. Alternatively, the enzyme could be involved in peptide and/or protein processing."

Blood samples were collected from 98 dogs of various breeds, delivered to the Veterinary Clinic in Szczecin (northwestern Poland) for various reasons. Nested PCR revealed the presence of DNA characteristic of only 1 genospecies, i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), in all PCR-positive samples. Digestion of PCR products from a fragment of the fla gene amplified with primers FLA1 and FLA2 gave only one band pattern consistent with the pattern obtained from sequence analysis of the fla gene from a reference isolate of B. burgdorferi s.s.

		"abstract": "This study investigated the onset and development of the immune response to Borrelia burgdorferi infection in 30 Italian patients with culture-confirmed Lyme Borreliosis in the stage of erythema migrans (EM). All patients received antimicrobial treatment when entering the study and were prospectively evaluated monthly for up to 30 days after enrolment. A total of 60 serially collected serum samples were tested by using two different commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs): Anti-Borrelia plus VlsE ELISA, Euroimmun, and the synthetic peptide-based ELISA, Quick ELISA C6, Immunetics. Sixty-five potentially cross-reacting sera were also tested. Anti-Borrelia plus VlsE ELISA IgG was far more sensitive than Quick ELISA C6 (56.6% and 33.3%, respectively). Moreover, considering that 17 additional sera from the first bleeding group of Lyme disease patients were IgM positive when tested by Anti-Borrelia plus VlsE IgM, the sensitivity of Anti-Borrelia plus VlsE as a whole system rose to 85.0%. Nevertheless, due to the specificity values of Anti-Borrelia plus VlsE ELISA identified in this study (98.5% for IgG and 78.5% for IgM), the need of a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of Lyme disease remains. All the sera were also tested by two different commercial Western Blot (WB) assays: Euroline-WB against Borrelia, Euroimmun, and Qualicode B. burgdorferi WB, Immunetics, in comparison with a multispecies \"home made\" WB. Performances of the three WB methods for the detection of IgM were very similar. On the contrary, these WBs performed with different values of sensitivity and specificity when IgGs were evaluated. The most sensitive method was the \"home-made\" WB IgG (71.7%), followed by the Euroline-WB IgG against Borrelia (68.3%). Qualicode B. burgdorferi WB IgG demonstrated to be only 26.6% sensitive. Both \"home-made\" WB IgG and Qualicode B. burgdorferi WB IgG were 100% specific, whereas Euroline-WB IgG against Borrelia scored 12 cross-reacting samples as borderline, showing a specificity value of 80.0%."

Four strains belong to Borrelia afzelii species. Other strains distributed into tree major groups, identified as Borrelia garinii. Indeed, based on the ospA gene comparison, phylogenetic relationship of these groups among each other does not differ from relationship among other previously defined groups inside B. burgdorferi sensu lato genogroup, such as B. afzelii or Borrelia bissettii.

These bacteria have a highly segmented genome where most replicons are linear molecules terminated by covalently closed hairpin telomeres. Moreover, these genomes appear to be in a state of flux with extensive and ongoing DNA rearrangements by unknown mechanisms. The B. burgdorferi telomere resolvase ResT generates the hairpin telomeres from replication intermediates in a reaction with mechanistic similarities to that catalyzed by type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. We report here the unexpected ability of ResT to catalyze the fusion of hairpin telomeres in a reversal of the telomere resolution reaction. We propose that stabilized ResT-mediated telomere fusions are an underlying force for maintaining the B. burgdorferi genome in a state of flux."

Final outcome was evaluated by follow up visits or telephone interview. Sixty nine patients were included and followed until complete recovery, or for 5 years. Ten per cent were caused by Lyme disease, 17% by virus infection, 4% by other causes and 68% were classified as Bell's palsy. All patients with Lyme facial palsy had additional neurological symptoms, and 87% reported constitutional complaints. The overall final outcome was good with complete recovery in 77%, slight sequelae in 20% and moderate sequelae in 3%. No patients experienced severe sequelae. Two of 28 patients examined with neurography had absent compound muscle action potentials in orbicularis oculi. Both made good recovery with only slight sequelae. Peripheral facial palsy is a common disorder with a favourable prognosis. Lyme disease seems to be an infrequent cause of facial palsy in patients without constitutional symptoms or additional neurological findings."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus (L.) is a known vector of several zoonotic diseases such as Tick Borne Encephalitis (TBE), Lyme borreliosis and ehrlichiosis. The interaction between humans and ticks are at the very core of our understanding of the epidemiology of tick borne zoonoses, but only few experimental studies have been performed. Hence our understanding of the epidemiology of tick-borne disease has to rest on the assumption that the potential tick activity, which is reflected in tick samples from the vegetation or samples from animals, corresponds with tick-human interaction. Observations which may reflect the long term tick-human contact are available in Denmark. These observations are records of requests for information on I. ricinus forwarded to the Danish Pest Infestation Laboratory (DPIL). This article was based on the assumption that the request could be seen as a measure of tick-human interaction reflecting the tick densities in relative terms. The perceived tick densities given by the number of requests on I. ricinus divided by the total number of requests to DPIL was fairly stable from 1965 to 1985, while it doubled during the late 1980's reaching a higher level in the beginning of the 1990's. The perceived density was well explained by the variation in temperature, solar radiation (monthly measurement) and deer abundance (yearly assessments). The measure of deviation, i.e. the ratio between observed requests + 1 and modelled requests + 1, for the individual years varied between 0.91 and 1.20, with considerable within-year variation. A gradual change in periodicity of the residual might suggest gradually changing tick population dynamics. In conclusion, the perceived tick densities appear to be consistent with the current knowledge of tick ecology and tick-transmitted diseases."

The epidemiological analysis of morbidity at the territory for the period of 1992-2001 is indicative of the presence of the combined foci of tick-borne encephalitis and Ixodes tick-born borrelioses (TBB) in 42 regions of the territory. The cyclic character of morbidity and the irregularity of its spread in different regions of the territory can be observed. Among the TBB patients, town dwellers constitute, on the average, 75.8%. These tick-born infections exhibit regional differences connected with landscape variations and the patients age. However official statistics does not reflect the real epidemic situation at the territory: hypodiagnostics is primarily due to the absence of reliable laboratory confirmation in remote regions of the Krasnoyarsk territory."

Recent discoveries cast new light on Bb dissemination and the ensuing pathogenesis of inflammation. Although the strong proinflammatory Bb lipoproteins have been implicated in the induction of inflammation, they do not seem to act exclusively through Toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement. In fact, mice that are deficient for MyD88, a component of the TLR signaling pathway, manifest similar or increased recruitment of cells into Bb-infected tissues. By contrast, the absence of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 results in reduced inflammation. Overall, these findings highlight the complexity of Lyme disease pathogenesis and identify chemokine pathways as novel therapeutic targets for the control of Bb-induced inflammation."

Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using an oligonucleotide sequence, designated TEC1, was shown, in combination with a previously developed primer (LD2) to amplify strains of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii, but not the non-Lyme causing B. hermsii or B. turicatae. This primer pair, designated Bbsl, was successfully used to amplify B. burgdorferi sensu lato from skin biopsies of patients with Lyme disease symptoms as well as from Ixodes scapularis, Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis ticks. The primer set Bbsl allows for the rapid detection and differentiation of B. burgdorferi sensu lato from non-Lyme disease-causing Borrelia species in ticks and human tissues. The PCR primer set, Bbsl, will greatly facilitate detection of the causative agents of Lyme disease in infected ticks and human skin samples assisting in epidemiological studies, and potentially allowing for a more rapid diagnosis of the disease in patients."

A possible mechanism that could prevent acquisition of B. burgdorferi spirochetes from infected hosts is the toxic effect of A. americanum saliva on B. burgdorferi. The data presented here indicate that after 24 and 48 h of exposure to A. americanum saliva, significantly fewer B. burgdorferi were alive compared to treatment controls as assessed by spirochete motility under dark-field microscopy and resistance to the dead stain, propidium iodide. After 48 h, fewer than 13% of saliva-exposed B. burgdorferi were alive. In contrast, significantly more B. burgdorferi exposed to Ixodes scapularis (Acari: Ixodidae) saliva survived after 24 or 48 h compared to A. americanum saliva or treatment controls."

		"abstract": "The role of small mammals as reservoir hosts for Borrelia burgdorferi was investigated in several areas where Lyme disease is endemic in northern Spain. A low rate of infestation by Ixodes ricinus nymphs was found in the small mammal populations studied that correlated with the near-absence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in 184 animals tested and with the lack of transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato to I. ricinus larvae that fed on them. In contrast, questing ticks collected at the same time and in the same areas were found to carry a highly variable B. burgdorferi sensu lato repertoire (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia valaisiana, and Borrelia afzelii). Interestingly, the only isolate obtained from small mammals (R57, isolated from a bank vole) grouped by phylogenetic analyses with other Borrelia species but in a separate clade from the Lyme disease and relapsing fever organisms, suggesting that it is a new species. This new agent was widely distributed among small mammals, with infection rates of 8.5 to 12% by PCR. Moreover, a high seroprevalence to B. burgdorferi sensu lato was found in the animal sera, suggesting cross-reactivity between B. burgdorferi sensu lato and R57. Although small mammals do not seem to play an important role as reservoirs for B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the study area, they seem to be implicated in the maintenance of spirochetes similar to R57."

		"abstract": "Previous studies have shown that a sigma54-sigma(S) cascade regulates the expression of a few key lipoproteins in Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease. Here, we demonstrate that these sigma factors, both together and independently, regulate a much more extensive number of genes and cellular processes. Microarray analyses of sigma54 and sigma(S) mutant strains identified 305 genes regulated by sigma54 and 145 regulated by sigma(S), whereas the sigma54-sigma(S) regulatory cascade appears to control 48 genes in B. burgdorferi. In silico analyses revealed that nearly 80% of genes with altered expression in the sigma54 mutant were linked to potential sigma54-dependent promoters. Many sigma54-regulated genes are expressed in vivo, and through genetic complementation of the mutant, we demonstrated that sigma54 was required by B. burgdorferi to infect mammals. Surprisingly, sigma54 mutants were able to infect Ixodes scapularis ticks and be maintained for at least 24 wk after infection, suggesting the sigma54-sigma(S) regulatory network was not involved in long-term survival in ticks. However, sigma54 mutants did not enter the salivary glands during tick feeding, indicating that sigma54-regulated genes were involved in the transmission process."

In this study, we show that BBK32 shares sequence similarity with fibronectin module-binding motifs previously identified in proteins from Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry are used to confirm the binding sites of BBK32 peptides within the N-terminal domain of fibronectin and to measure the affinities of the interactions. Comparison of chemical shift perturbations in fibronectin F1 modules on binding of peptides from BBK32, FnBPA from S. aureus, and SfbI from S. pyogenes provides further evidence for a shared mechanism of binding. Despite the different locations of the bacterial attachment sites in BBK32 compared with SfbI from S. pyogenes and FnBPA from S. aureus, an antiparallel orientation is observed for binding of the N-terminal domain of fibronectin to each of the pathogens. Thus, these phylogenetically and morphologically distinct bacterial pathogens have similar mechanisms for binding to human fibronectin."

The study group consisted of 20 patients with Lyme meningitis (age range 16-72 years, mean age 42.6 years). For measurements of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) the control group consisted of 10 healthy volunteers and 10 patients with infection of the central nervous system ruled out, respectively. Cytokines and sIL-1RII levels in serum and CSF were measured twice, before and after the 30-day treatment period. Serum and CSF levels of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII were measured using ELISA, and CRP serum levels were measured using the immunoturbidimetric method. Before the treatment the concentration of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII in serum as well as in CSF was significantly higher as compared to the controls. After the treatment end the level of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII was reduced but the serum level of sIL-1RII and CSF level of IL-18 and sIL-1RII remained significantly higher than in the control group. The serum level of CRP was increased only in 15% of patients and after the treatment CRP concentration returned to a basal level (except one patient in whom CRP was slightly higher than in the control group). No correlation between CRP and IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII was observed. Our results confirm the involvement of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII in the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis and uselessness of CRP determination in the diagnosis of Lyme meningitis."

Here we describe studies with an OspA monoclonal antibody (C3.78) to understand the mechanism by which antibodies entering the tick block Borrelia transmission. Host complement in the tick's blood meal did not contribute to protection because the antibody was equally effective whether infected ticks fed on normal or complement-deficient mice. Antibody-mediated cross-linking of bacteria or cross-linking of OspA molecules was not required for protection because C3.78 Fab' fragments were as effective as whole antibody molecules. At low C3.78 concentrations, transmission was blocked despite the presence of many live spirochetes within the tick, confirming that clearance of Borrelia organisms was not required to block transmission. We propose that OspA antibody binding to the surface of spirochetes blocks transmission by a mechanism that does not require bacterial killing."

Chronic joint inflammation may persist despite spirochetal killing, suggesting an autoimmune etiology. The pathogenic mechanisms that sustain chronic Lyme arthritis have not been fully elucidated, although T cells are believed to play a role. The synovial lesion contains elements of a peripheral lymph node, with lymphoid aggregates, plasma cells and follicular dendritic cells. An analysis of activated cells at the site of injury could yield clues regarding the nature of the response and the identity of potential autoantigens. Using laser-capture microdissection, we have isolated plasma cells from the joint tissue of chronic Lyme arthritis patients who underwent synovectomy. Expressed Ig V regions were amplified by RT-PCR. A majority of isolated cells expressed gamma H chains, which is indicative of a class-switched response. There were a large number of nucleotide substitutions from germline, with a higher fraction of replacement mutations in the CDRs, suggesting a process of Ag-driven selection. We have recovered clonal clusters of cells containing identical junctions and V(D)J rearrangements. Sequence analysis reveals a hierarchy of shared somatic mutations between members of a given clone. Intraclonal diversity among plasma cells of close physical proximity points toward an ongoing process of diversification and affinity maturation, possibly driven by the chronic presence of an autoantigen."

Most isolates from I. ricinus were identified as Borrelia garinii type 20047 and B. afzelii. Two isolates were identified as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) and Borrelia valaisiana, respectively, but no B. garinii type NT29 was found. In contrast, isolates from I. persulcatus were identified as both types 20047 and NT29 of B. garinii, and B. afzelii. No B. burgdorferi s.s. isolate was found among isolates from I. persulcatus."

The H6831 epitope is topologically analogous to the LA-2 epitope of OspA and is centered around OspB Lys-253, a residue essential for H6831 recognition. A beta-sheet present in the free OspB fragment is either disordered or removed by proteolysis in the H6831-bound complex. Other conformational changes between free and H6831-bound structures are minor and appear to be related to this loss. In both crystal structures, OspB C-terminal fragments form artificial dimers connected by intermolecular beta-sheets. OspB structure, stability, and possible mechanisms of killing by H6831 and other bactericidal Fabs are discussed in light of the structural data."

To investigate the relationship between self-reactivity and the response to B. burgdorferi, NZB mice, models of autoimmunity, were infected. NZB mice infected with B. burgdorferi developed higher degrees of joint swelling and higher anti-B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin M cross-reactive responses than other strains with identical major histocompatibility complex (DBA/2 and BALB/c). These studies reveal immunological cross-reactivity and suggest that B. burgdorferi may share common epitopes which mimic self-proteins. These implications could be important for certain autoimmunity-susceptible individuals or animals who become infected with B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "A classic proinflammatory T helper cell type 1 (TH1) response directed against intracellular pathogens includes the cytokine osteopontin, which acts predominantly on macrophages, where it induces the secretion of interleukin (IL)-12 and suppresses the secretion of IL-10. As cell-mediated immune responses play an important role in the resistance to Lyme arthritis, a manifestation of infection by the extracellular pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi, we tested the hypothesis that osteopontin may be required to induce T(H)1 responses and inflammation. The role of osteopontin was tested in vivo and using ex vivo macrophages in B6129F3 mice susceptible to experimental Lyme arthritis. Mice of this genetic background and those fully backcrossed to C57BL/6, which lacked osteopontin expression (spp1-/-), were as susceptible to B. burgdorferi-induced arthritis as littermate controls. Furthermore, equal numbers of spirochetes, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the B. burgdorferi gene recA in spp1-/- and B6129F3 wild-type littermates, suggested that susceptibility to infection was not dependent on this cytokine. Neither of the B6129F3 parental mouse strains lacked the ability to secrete osteopontin. spp1-/- mice and controls had immunoglobulin G2 titers, suggestive of a TH1 response. B. burgdorferi was able to directly stimulate the secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha from wild-type and spp1-/- macrophages alike. These results indicate that the usually critical role of osteopontin in the induction of cellular immune responses to intracellular pathogens was circumvented by the ability of the extracellular pathogen B. burgdorferi to induce macrophages directly to produce proinflammatory cytokines."

Lyme disease is a condition which can be difficult to diagnose since one of the main features of the condition, the erythema migrans rash, may be absent or overlooked and serological testing for Lyme disease may be falsely negative. Symptoms of Lyme disease may not became apparent until years after exposure to the causative organism. Military personnel during training in the field are at risk of tick bites and it may be that those who developed Gulf War Syndrome entered the conflict with latent Lyme disease. There has been no systematic examination of Gulf War Syndrome sufferers for chronic Lyme disease and it is hypothesized that chronic Lyme disease has been overlooked as a cause of Gulf War Syndrome. To address this it is suggested that sufferers of Gulf War Syndrome or similar illnesses should be examined by physicians who have experience diagnosing and treating large numbers of patients with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "In California, Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls nymphs have been implicated as the primary bridging vectors to humans of the spirochetal bacterium causing Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). Because the nymphs typically do not ascend emergent vegetation, risk of human exposure is minimal in grasslands, chaparral, and woodland-grass. Instead, woodlands with a ground cover dominated by leaf litter (hereinafter referred to as woodland-leaf) have emerged as a primary risk habitat for exposure to B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs. As a means of differentiating woodland-leaf habitats from others with minimal risk (e.g., chaparral, grassland, and woodland-grass), we constructed a maximum likelihood model of these habitat types within a 7,711-ha area in southeastern Mendocino County based on the normalized difference vegetation index derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper imagery (based on a 30 by 30-m pixel size) over four seasons. The overall accuracy of the model to discriminate woodland-leaf, woodland-grass, open grassland, and chaparral was 83.85% (Kappa coefficient of 0.78). Validation of the accuracy of the model to classify woodland-leaf yielded high values both for producer accuracy (93.33% of validated woodland-leaf pixels correctly classified by the model) and user accuracy (96.55% of model-classified validation pixels correctly categorized as woodland-leaf). Woodland-leaf habitats were found to be highly aggregated within the examined area. In conclusion, our model successfully used remotely sensed data as a predictor of habitats where humans are at risk for Lyme disease in the far-western United States."

Novel cDNA clones with similarity to cytochrome c oxidase, salivary secreted protein, actin, and a cysteine protease propeptide were induced after a blood meal. Novel cDNA clones with similarity to thioredoxin peroxidases, dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase, glutathione S-transferase, defensin, ML domain-containing protein, and von Willebrand factor were induced after B. burgdorferi infection. Virtual Northern analysis was used to verify that these genes were differentially expressed in ticks after a pathogen-infected blood meal and to detect their tissues of expression. The characterization of genes that are induced after an infected blood meal is essential for gaining an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie vector-pathogen interactions."

Some Lyme disease and relapsing fever spirochete species bind factor H to their surface to facilitate immune evasion. The Lyme disease spirochetes produce several factor H binding proteins (FHBPs) that form two distinct classes. Class I FHBPs (OspE orthologs and paralogs) bind only factor H, while class II FHBPs (BBA68) bind both factor H and FHL-1. BBA68 belongs to a large paralogous protein family, and of these paralogs, BBA69 is the member most closely related to BBA68. To determine if BBA69 can also bind factor H, recombinant protein was generated and tested for factor H binding. BBA69 did not exhibit factor H binding ability, suggesting that among family 54 paralogs, factor H binding is unique to BBA68. To identify the determinants of BBA68 that are involved in factor H binding, truncation and site-directed mutational analyses were performed. These analyses revealed that the factor H binding site is discontinuous and provide strong evidence that coiled-coil structural elements are involved in the formation of the binding site."

Certain features of B. burgdorferi have hampered the development of an effective system of genetic analysis, but basic tools are now available and their application has begun to provide information about the identities and roles of key bacterial components in both the tick vector and the mammalian host. Increased genetic analysis of B. burgdorferi should advance our understanding of the infectious cycle and the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

The most common cause is viral infection and enteroviruses - Coxsackie and ECHO viruses account for more than half of all cases. Clinical manifestations include headache, fever, malaise, photophobia and meningeal signs. Convulsions, neurological deficits and severe obtundation are rare except with certain non viral infectious meningitis. Diagnostic work up includes blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination and serology for infectious meningitis.

Neurological manifestations of Lyme disease can present in many forms, and diagnostic techniques which detect the spirochete directly; the culture or polymerase chain reaction of the spirochete in cerebrospinal fluid, are of disappointingly low yield. Therefore, the diagnosis is frequently not easy. After the diagnosis is made, antibiotic therapy is straightforward; Lyme neuroborreliosis should be treated with at least 2 weeks of antibiotics. In the United States, intravenous therapy with ceftriaxone or penicillin for 2 weeks is the standard, whereas in Europe oral doxycycline therapy is commonly administered. Either is effective, and my choice of therapy generally depends on the patient. Many patients have symptoms which continue after antibiotic therapy referable to persistent inflammation, and, for those patients, I will commonly prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications."

The entire 255-amino acid ectodomain of the outer surface protein A (OspA) from Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, was inserted into the major B cell epitope of the HBV capsid, yielding a multimerization-competent fusion protein, termed coreOspA. CoreOspA, consisting only in part of regular CLP, induced antibodies to OspA, including the Ig isotype profile and specificity for the protective epitope LA-2, with an efficiency similar to that of recombinant lipidated OspA, the first generation vaccine against Lyme disease. Moreover, coreOspA actively and passively protected mice against subsequent challenge with B. burgdorferi. The data demonstrate the capacity of the HBV capsid protein to act as a potent immunomodulator even for full-length and structurally complex polypeptide chains and thus opens new avenues for novel vaccine designs."

However, how the spirochetes cross the BBB remains an unresolved issue. We examined the traversal of B. burgdorferi across the human BBB and systemic endothelial cell barriers using in vitro model systems constructed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) and EA.hy 926, a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line grown on Costar Transwell inserts. These studies showed that B. burgdorferi differentially crosses human BMEC and HUVEC and that the human BMEC form a barrier to traversal. During the transmigration by the spirochetes, it was found that the integrity of the endothelial cell monolayers was maintained, as assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance measurements at the end of the experimental period, and that B. burgdorferi appeared to bind human BMEC by their tips near or at cell borders, suggesting a paracellular route of transmigration. Importantly, traversal of B. burgdorferi across human BMEC induces the expression of plasminogen activators, plasminogen activator receptors, and matrix metalloproteinases. Thus, the fibrinolytic system linked by an activation cascade may lead to focal and transient degradation of tight junction proteins that allows B. burgdorferi to invade the CNS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi. In vitro evidence suggests that binding of spirochetal lipoproteins to CD14, a pattern recognition receptor expressed on monocytes/macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells, is a critical requirement for cellular activation and the subsequent release of proinflammatory cytokines that most likely contribute to symptomatology and clinical manifestations. To test the validity of this notion, we assessed the impact of CD14 deficiency on Lyme disease in C3H/HeN mice. Contrary to an anticipated diminution in pathology, CD14(-/-) mice exhibited more severe and persistent inflammation than did CD14(+/+) mice. This disparity reflects altered gene regulation within immune cells that may engender the higher bacterial burden and serum cytokine levels observed in CD14(-/-) mice. Comparing their in vitro stimulatory activity, live spirochetes, but not lysed organisms, were a potent CD14-independent stimulus of cytokine production, triggering an exaggerated response by CD14(-/-) macrophages. Collectively, our in vivo and in vitro findings support the provocative notion that: 1) pattern recognition by CD14 is entirely dispensable for elaboration of an inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi, and 2) CD14-independent signaling pathways are inherently more destructive than CD14-dependent pathways. Continued study of CD14-independent signaling pathways may provide mechanistic insight into the inflammatory processes that underlie development of chronic inflammation."

These have generally been attributed to either persistent infection or pathogen-induced autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated the presence of cross-reactive human neural epitopes that share amino acid sequences with Borrelia burgdorferi OspA protein. Sequence similarity analysis was carried out by searching known cDNA sequences from brain tissue. The cDNA database search yielded three sequences that were identical to sequences in OspA. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and antibodies were generated against them in rabbits. Antibodies against two of the homologous OspA peptides were found to react with neurons in human brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia by immunohistochemistry."

		"abstract": "In recent years a possible aetiological connection between skin sclerosis and an infection with Borrelia burgdorferi has been discussed, but this association has not yet been reported for systemic scleroderma. Several treatment modalities are suggested for systemic scleroderma, but no treatment has yet been found to alter the overall course of the disease. This report describes a 61-year-old woman with Raynaud's phenomenon, nail-fold changes and circulating anticentromere antibodies, who showed an abrupt onset of erythemas and doughy swellings involving the face and upper trunk, followed by thickening and induration of the skin mimicking diffuse systemic scleroderma. Laboratory tests including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunoblot and urine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed an infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato that was successfully treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, an antibiotic recommended for Lyme borreliosis. Fourteen days after the end of treatment the skin was no longer stiff and indurated and had returned to its normal predisease state. This case suggests that Lyme disease should be considered in atypical cases of skin sclerosis in patients predisposed to the development of systemic scleroderma."

		"abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are induced from host tissues in response to Borrelia burgdorferi. Upregulation of MMPs may play a role in the dissemination of the organism through extracellular matrix tissues, but it can also result in destructive pathology. Although mice are a well-accepted model for Lyme arthritis, there are significant differences compared to human disease. We sought to determine whether MMP expression could account for some of these differences. MMP expression patterns following B. burgdorferi infection were analyzed in primary human chondrocytes, synovial fluid samples from patients with Lyme arthritis, and cartilage tissue from Lyme arthritis-susceptible and -resistant mice by using a gene array, real-time PCR, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunohistochemistry. B. burgdorferi infection significantly induced transcription of MMP-1, -3, -13, and -19 from primary human chondrocyte cells. Transcription of MMP-10 and tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease 1 was increased with B. burgdorferi infection, but protein expression was only minimally increased. The synovial fluid levels of MMPs from patients with high and low spirochete burdens were consistent with results seen in the in vitro studies. B. burgdorferi-susceptible C3H/HeN mice infected with B. burgdorferi showed induction of MMP-3 and MMP-19 but no other MMP or tissue inhibitor of metalloprotease. As determined by immunohistochemistry, MMP-3 expression was increased only in chondrocytes near the articular surface. The levels of MMPs were significantly lower in the more Lyme arthritis-resistant BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Differences between human and murine Lyme arthritis may be related to the lack of induction of collagenases, such MMP-1 and MMP-13, in mouse joints."

		"abstract": "Apart from its devastating impact on individuals and their families, multiple sclerosis (MS) creates a huge economic burden for society by mainly afflicting young adults in their most productive years. Although effective strategies for symptom management and disease modifying therapies have evolved, there exists no curative treatment yet. Worldwide, MS prevalence parallels the distribution of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi, and in America and Europe, the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop MS exactly mirror the seasonal distributions of Borrelia transmitting Ixodes ticks. In addition to known acute infections, no other disease exhibits equally marked epidemiological clusters by season and locality, nurturing the hope that prevention might ultimately be attainable. As minocycline, tinidazole and hydroxychloroquine are reportedly capable of destroying both the spirochaetal and cystic L-form of B. burgdorferi found in MS brains, there emerges also new hope for those already afflicted. The immunomodulating anti-inflammatory potential of minocycline and hydroxychloroquine may furthermore reduce the Jarisch Herxheimer reaction triggered by decaying Borrelia at treatment initiation. Even in those cases unrelated to B. burgdorferi, minocycline is known for its beneficial effect on several factors considered to be detrimental in MS. Patients receiving a combination of these pharmaceuticals are thus expected to be cured or to have a longer period of remission compared to untreated controls. Although the goal of this rational, cost-effective and potentially curative treatment seems simple enough, the importance of a scientifically sound approach cannot be overemphasised. A randomised, prospective, double blinded trial is necessary in patients from B. burgdorferi endemic areas with established MS and/or Borrelia L-forms in their cerebrospinal fluid, and to yield reasonable significance within due time, the groups must be large enough and preferably taken together in a multi-centre study."

Ticks can transmit multiple pathogens, however, little is known about the co-existence of these pathogens within questing ticks. We looked for the presence of DNA from three micro-organisms, Bartonella sp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Babesia sp. which are known or suspected tick-borne pathogens, using a cohort of 92 questing Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from pastures in northern France. DNA was extracted from each individual tick and the presence of the three pathogens was investigated using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification. Nine among 92 samples (9.8%) demonstrated PCR products using Bartonella specific primers, 3 among 92 (3.3%) using Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato specific primers and 19 among 92 (20.6%) using Babesia specific primers. Seven among 92 samples (7.6%) were PCR positive for at least two of the pathogens and one sample was positive for all three. Adult ticks (12/18; 67%) showed significantly higher infection rates compared to nymphs (11/74; 15%) for all three pathogens (P < 0.001). This study is the demonstration of the simultaneous presence of Bartonella sp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Babesia sp. in questing Ixodes ricinus ticks."

		"abstract": "The Bdr proteins are polymorphic inner membrane proteins produced by most Borrelia species. In Borrelia burgdorferi B31MI, the18 bdr genes form three subfamilies, bdrD, bdrE, and bdrF. The production of at least one of the Bdr paralogs, BdrF2, is up-regulated in host-adapted spirochetes, suggesting a role for the protein in the mammalian environment. Here, we demonstrate using reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR that BBG29, BBG30, BBG31, and BBG32, which reside upstream of bdrF2, are cotranscribed with bdrF2 as a five-gene operon. While the functions of most of these proteins are unknown, BBG32 encodes a putative DNA helicase. Real-time RT-PCR analyses demonstrated higher levels of bdrF2 transcript relative to other genes of the operon, suggesting that bdrF2 may also be transcribed independently from an internal promoter. Internal promoters were detected using the 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends system. The putative promoter associated with bdrF2 was found to be highly similar in sequence to the multiple promoters associated with the ospC gene. Real-time RT-PCR analyses, performed to assess the expression of these genes in infected mice, revealed that genes of the bdrF2 locus are expressed only during early infection, suggesting a role in the establishment of infection. To further characterize the proteins encoded by the bdrF2 locus, which have unknown functions, the cellular localizations of these proteins were determined by Triton X-114 extraction and phase partitioning. BBG29 and BBG31 were found to be cytoplasmic. To determine if these proteins elicit an antibody (Ab) response during infection, immunoblot analyses were performed. Abs to these proteins were not detected. Based on the analyses presented here, we offer the hypothesis that BdrF2 and other proteins encoded by the operon form an inner-membrane-associated protein complex that may interact with DNA and which carries out its functional role during transmission or the early stages of infection."

It appears that both temporal and spatial regulation of outer surface proteins have contributed to this persistence. The spirochetes are able to bind fH and FHL-1 to their surface, resulting in decreased complement activation. In addition, the organisms have taken advantage of components of tick saliva to aid in their initial immune evasion and dissemination. Studies leading to these conclusions are reviewed here."

		"abstract": "From March to October 2003, a total of 2,518 host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks (1,944 nymphs, 264 females, 310 males) were collected by blanket dragging at 45 sites all over the city area of Bonn, western Germany, to be checked for Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The collection sites included 20 private gardens, nine public recreational parks, the boundaries of 14 sylvatic suburban areas and two footpaths between suburban farmed fields. Generally, numbers of specimens collected along sylvatic suburban areas and at urban sites with dense tree populations were significantly higher than at the other collection sites. Out of 1,394 specimens (865 nymphs, 241 females, 288 males) that were randomly chosen for Borrelia analysis by a simple PCR, 250 (17.9 %) were found to be infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. While the infection prevalences varied significantly between females (26.6%), males (12.5%) and nymphs (17.3%), there were no striking differences between sylvatic and unwooded sites. A total of 92.8% of the ticks Borrelia-positive by the simple PCR were also positive in a diagnostic nested PCR. Using genospecies-specific oligonucleotide probes, single Borrelia genospecies infections (91.4%) could be assigned to B. afzelii (39.5%), B. garinii (27.9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (15.6%) and B. valaisiana (8.6%) by DNA hybridization. Various combinations of double infections were observed in 4.3% of the infected ticks. Another 4.3% of the Borrelia infections were untypeable. The B. burgdorferi genospecies distribution in the city area was shown to be variable from site to site and, even more, it was distinct from rural collection sites near Bonn. This is ascribed to a different spectrum of reservoir hosts. Taking into account the infection prevalences of host-seeking ticks in the forested surroundings of Bonn, our study demonstrates that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease after a tick bite in urban/suburban areas is comparably as high as in woodlands outside of the city."

In this study, real time PCR was applied to quantify tissue-specific expression of four linear plasmid (lp54)-encoded (ospA, zs7.a36, zs7.a66 zs7.a68) and one circular plasmid (cp26)-encoded (ospC) gene from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, in a natural setting of tick-infected immunodeficient (C.B-17 SCID) and immunocompetent (BALB/c and AKR/OlaHsd) mice for up to 120 days post-infection (p.i.). Early during infection (day 30 p.i.) high numbers of spirochetes were found in the heart and joint, but not the ear and spleen tissues of disease-susceptible SCID mice. In disease-susceptible AKR mice spirochetes colonized the ear and joint tissues, but were undetectable in tissues of disease-resistant BALB/c mice. Later in infection (day 120 p.i.), spirochetes had expanded (approximately 1,000-fold) in all SCID tissues tested but were undetectable in AKR and BALB/c mice. Of the five genes analyzed, only zs7.a36 transcripts were detected in various tissues of all infected mouse strains, though at differing levels, whereas ospC transcripts were only found in tissue specimens of SCID mice. Furthermore, gene expression of ospC and zs7.a36 appears to be differentially regulated in distinct organs of individual mice. In contrast, transcripts for ospA, zs7.a66, and zs7.a68 were not detected in any of the mouse strains, independent of their immune status and/or the severity of their infection/inflammatory responses. Late during infection (day 120 p.i.), transcription of zs7.a36 and ospC was down-regulated in the tissues of SCID mice despite expansion of spirochetes. This type of quantitative analysis may be helpful to further disclose principles of pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis and to design strategies for its therapeutic treatment."
