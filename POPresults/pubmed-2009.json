		"abstract": "This study was undertaken to determine which rodent species serve as primary reservoirs for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in commonly occurring woodland types in inland areas of northwestern California, and to examine whether chaparral or grassland serve as source habitats for dispersal of B. burgdorferi- or B. bissettii-infected rodents into adjacent woodlands. The western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) was commonly infected with B. burgdorferi in oak woodlands, whereas examination of 30 dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) and 280 Peromyscus spp. mice from 13 widely spaced Mendocino County woodlands during 2002 and 2003 yielded only one infected woodrat and one infected deer mouse (P. maniculatus). These data suggest that western gray squirrels account for the majority of production by rodents of fed Ixodes pacificus larvae infected with B. burgdorferi in the woodlands sampled. Infections with B. burgdorferi also were rare in woodrats (0/47, 0/3) and mice (3/66, 1/6) captured in chaparral and grassland, respectively, and therefore these habitats are unlikely sources for dispersal of this spirochete into adjacent woodlands. On the other hand, B. bissettii was commonly detected in both woodrats (22/47) and mice (15/66) in chaparral. We conclude that the data from this and previous studies in northwestern California are suggestive of a pattern where inland oak-woodland habitats harbor a B. burgdorferi transmission cycle driven primarily by I. pacificus and western gray squirrels, whereas chaparral habitats contain a B. bissettii transmission cycle perpetuated largely by I. spinipalpis, woodrats and Peromyscus mice. The dominant role of western gray squirrels as reservoirs of B. burgdorferi in certain woodlands offers intriguing opportunities for preventing Lyme disease by targeting these animals by means of either host-targeted acaricides or oral vaccination against B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Infectious causes should always be considered in all patients with uveitis and it should be ruled out first. The differential diagnosis includes multiple well-known diseases including herpes, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis, Lyme disease, and others. However, clinicians should be aware of emerging infectious agents as potential causes of systemic illness and also intraocular inflammation. Air travel, immigration, and globalization of business have overturned traditional pattern of geographic distribution of infectious diseases, and therefore one should work locally but think globally, though it is not possible always. This review recapitulates the systemic and ocular mainfestations of several emergent infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist including Rickettsioses, West Nile virus infection, Rift valley fever, dengue fever, and chikungunya. Retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement have been associated with these emergent infectious diseases. The diagnosis of any of these infections is usually based on pattern of uveitis, systemic symptoms and signs, and specific epidemiological data and confirmed by detection of specific antibody in serum. A systematic ocular examination, showing fairly typical fundus findings, may help in establishing an early clinical diagnosis, which allows prompt, appropriate management."

		"abstract": "The nymph of the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus) is an important bridging vector of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi) to humans in the far-western United States. The previously unknown dispersal capabilities of this life stage were studied in relation to logs, tree trunks, and adjacent leaf-litter areas in a mixed hardwood forest using mark-release-recapture methods. In two spatially and temporally well-spaced trials involving logs, the estimated mean distances that nymphs dispersed ranged from approximately 0.04 to 0.20 m/day on logs vs 0.11 to 0.72 m/day in litter. Prior to recapture in either trial and within the confines of the sampling grids, the greatest estimated dispersal distances by individual nymphs released on logs, and in litter 0.5 m or 1.5 m from logs, were 2.4, 3.0, and 3.0 m, respectively. Nymphs released on logs or litter tended to remain within the same biotopes in which they were freed while host-seeking. In two simultaneous trials involving trunks spaced close-at-hand, nymphs released at the trunk/litter interface on all four aspects collectively dispersed a mean of 0.353 m/day on trunks vs 0.175 m/day in litter. In either trial, the greatest distances that recaptured nymphs climbed trunks, or dispersed in litter in an encircling 3-m grid, were 1.55 m and 2.97 m, respectively. Nymphs ascending trunks did not exhibit a preference for any one aspect, and the B. burgdorferi-infection prevalences in nymphs that climbed trunks (3.2-4.0%) did not differ significantly from those that moved horizontally into litter (10.5-17.6%). We conclude that I. pacificus nymphs use an ambush host-seeking strategy; that they disperse slowly in all biotopes studied; that they usually continue to host-seek in or on whatever substratum they access initially; and that B. burgdorferi-infected nymphs are as likely to move horizontally as vertically when offered a choice."

These new probes allowed us investigate the diversity of Borrelia in 915 I. ricinus collected on the south-facing slope of Chaumont (Switzerland). Among the 159 infected ticks, 7 Borrelia species were identified, and B. spielmanii and relapsing fever-like (RFL) spirochaetes were identified in this area for the first time. B. valaisiana and B. spielmanii were significantly less present in male than in female or nymphal ticks. Mixed infection with RFL spirochaetes and Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes were detected in 4 ticks. In addition, the set of probes could identify the recently described species, B. bavariensis."

		"abstract": "Child and adolescent catatonia has been poorly investigated. Moreover, diagnosis criteria only exist for adult psychiatry, and there are no therapeutic guidelines. The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 14-year-old girl presenting an overlap between psychogenic and neuroleptic induced catatonia, acute treatment and ten year's follow-up. A 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state. The etiopathogenic diagnosis is problematic. Some indices in the familial history may suggest a traumatic event. But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry."

It is transmitted to humans by the bites of infected ticks belonging to several species of the genus Ixodes. After the bacteria enter the body via the dermis, most patients develop the early, localised form of Lyme disease, which is characterised by erythema migrans and influenza-like symptoms. This disease may also affect the heart, nervous system and joints. The neurological findings of this disease may include peripheral and central nervous system signs. A 21-year-old woman attended a family medicine outpatient clinic complaining of unexplained pain and muscle power loss in her lower extremities. The problem had started in her right leg 3 months earlier and worsened in the last week. She had a neurology consultation and was hospitalised. Her neurological examination revealed bilateral facial paralysis and sensory impairment. Immunoglobulin M antibody to B. burgdorferi was positive on Western blotting in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was diagnosed with subacute neuroborreliosis and treated."

This paper reviews certain systemic bacterial and fungal diseases presenting ENT manifestations in the pediatric population from an otolaryngological perspective. A medline searching for specific issues was performed in order to achieve more information as possible with regards to ENT manifestation of systemic bacterial and fungal infections. Limits for pediatric age were used. Two separate sections for bacterial and fungal disease are included. The section on systemic bacterial infections considers cat-scratch disease, Lyme borreliosis, actinomycosis, Lemierre's syndrome and congenital syphilis, and the section on systemic fungal infections includes candidiasis, aspergillosis and histoplasmosis. Pediatricians and ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialists, approaching head and neck disorders in children, should therefore consider them among the possible differential diagnoses. This means that physicians need to recognize the first head and neck manifestations of systemic infections promptly in order to be able to treat them efficaciously and avoid the dangerous systemic spreading of the infective process."

Ticks are among the most competent and versatile arthropod vectors of infectious diseases because ticks of all ages and both sexes remain infectious for generations without having to reacquire infections from reservoir hosts. Today, ticks transmit the most common arthropod-borne infectious disease in the United States (US), Lyme disease (LD); and the most lethal arthropod-borne infectious disease in the US, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). Both LD and RMSF are endemic in Louisiana and the Gulf South. Ticks have also become frequent vectors of emerging zoonotic diseases in the Gulf South, including southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI), transmitted by the lone star tick, and Maculatum disease, transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick. Recent environmental changes and human lifestyle choices now place humans and ticks together outdoors in the Gulf South for longer periods in welcoming ecosystems for breeding, blood-feeding, and infectious disease transmission. An increasing incidence of emerging and re-emerging, endemic infectious diseases transmitted by existing and unanticipated tick vectors may be expected."

Although mouse and human iNKT cells respond to different antigens based on subtle differences in their fatty acids, the mechanism by which fatty acid structure determines antigenic potency is not well understood. Here we show that the mouse and human CD1d present glycolipids having different fatty acids, based in part upon a difference at a single amino acid position that is involved in positioning the sugar epitope. CD1d also can bind nonantigenic lipids, however, but unexpectedly, mouse CD1d orients the two aliphatic chains of a nonantigenic lipid rotated 180 degrees, causing a dramatic repositioning of the exposed sugar. Therefore, our data reveal the biochemical basis for the high degree of antigenic specificity of iNKT cells for certain fatty acids, and they suggest how microbes could alter fatty acid biosynthesis as an immune evasion mechanism."

Aqueous formulations of 1 and 5% nootkatone applied by backpack sprayer to the forest litter layer completely suppressed I. scapularis nymphs through 2 d. Thereafter, the level of reduction gradually declined to < or =50% at 28 d postapplication. Against A. americanum nymphs, 1% nootkatone was less effective, but at a 5% concentration, the level of control was similar or greater to that observed with I. scapularis through 21 d postapplication. Initial applications of 0.05% carvacrol were ineffective, but a 5% carvacrol formulation completely suppressed nymphs of both species through 2 d and resulted in significant reduction in I. scapularis and A. americanum nymphs through 28 and 14 d postapplication, respectively. Backpack sprayer applications of 5% nootkatone to the shrub and litter layers resulted in 100% control of I. scapularis adults through 6 d, but the level of reduction declined to 71.5% at 28 d postapplication. By contrast, high-pressure applications of 2% nootkatone to the litter layer resulted in 96.2-100% suppression of both I. scapularis and A. americanum nymphs through 42 d, whereas much lower control was obtained from the same formulation applied by backpack sprayer. Backpack sprayer application of a 3.1% nootkatone nanoemulsion resulted in 97.5-98.9 and 99.3-100% reduction in I. scapularis and A. americanum nymphs, respectively, at 1 d postapplication. Between 7 d and 35 d postapplication, the level of control varied between 57.1% and 92.5% for I. scapularis and between 78.5 and 97.1% for A. americanum nymphs. The ability of natural products to quickly suppress and maintain significant control of populations of these medically important ticks at relatively low concentrations may represent a future alternative to the use of conventional synthetic acaricides."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in humans. This inflammatory disease can affect the skin, the peripheral and central nervous system, the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular system and rarely the eyes. Early stages are directly associated with viable bacteria at the site of inflammation. The pathogen-host interaction is complex and has been elucidated only in part. B. burgdorferi is highly susceptible to antibiotic treatment and the majority of patients profit from this treatment. Some patients develop chronic persistent disease despite repeated antibiotics. Whether this is a sequel of pathogen persistence or a status of chronic auto-inflammation, auto-immunity or a form of fibromyalgia is highly debated. Since vaccination is not available, prevention of a tick bite or chemoprophylaxis is important. If the infection is manifest, then treatment strategies should target not only the pathogen by using antibiotics but also the chronic inflammation by using anti-inflammatory drugs."

The general level of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies was 12.8 % in IgM class, and 25 % in IgG class. Markedly more seropositive results were found in the group of fieldworkers (13.8 % - IgM and 25.0 % - IgG) than in office workers (10.0 % - IgM and 13.7 % - IgG). The highest proportions of infections both in IgM and IgG class (17.4 % and 34.8 %, respectively) were recorded in the group of persons over 50 years of age, the lowest - in the group of workers younger than 30 (IgM - 13.0 %, IgG - 14.1%). Significant differences in the level of seropositive results in IgG class were related to the workers' gender - in women the percentage was 9.8 %, in men - 28.1 %. It was found that in the studied region of southern Poland, considered to be non-endemic, borreliosis occurs as a health risk to forestry workers."

Documentation from the years 2000-2007 reviewed. The maximum number of the cases of borreliosis in the territory of Wielkopolska certified as the occupational disease fell in the years 2002-2003. In the territory of Wielkopolska, borreliosis as an occupational disease has been significantly more often certified in men. The population at the age of 41-60 prevailed in that case. The districts with the biggest number of certificed cases of borreliosis as an occupational disease include the following: Miedzychod, Poznan, Czarnkow-Trzcianka, Gostyn, Jarocin, Leszno and Krotoszyn. Further analyses concerning real exposure to infection with spirochaetes Borrelia burgdorferi and its effects in the population of the workers of forestry and agriculture in the territory of Wielkopolska is recommended. It should be suspected that the epidemiologic data concerning the cases of borreliosis in the occupational conditions are understated."

		"abstract": "It was 55 years ago when the first patients with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) were diagnosed in the Koprivnica-Krizevci County. Since then, we have acquired some new knowledge about the disease. TBE is an endemic disease and the second most common tick-borne disease following Lyme borreliosis in our country, with an average morbidity rate of 12 patients per year and predominance of male individuals older than 50. There are no specific risk groups because such patients have been continuously vaccinated for the past 27 years. In 88.0% of patients, the infection is manifested as aseptic meningitis and meningoencephalitis with a biphasic course. As opposed to detailed descriptions of acute morbidity, there are few reports on the course of disease and its outcome. The aim of the study was to assess the presence of post-encephalitic syndrome (PES) in patients with TBE, to evaluate its incidence and demonstrate its characteristics. This prospective study was conducted from 1995 to 2008 and enrolled PES patients treated at Department of Infectious Diseases, Dr. Tomislav Bardek General Hospital in Koprivnica during the study period. The study included patients of both sexes older than 14 years with recent TBE virus infection, patients with clear temporal correlation between acute morbidity and PES onset, and patients where any other cause of PES was ruled out. The immunoenzyme linked assay (ELISA) was used for detection of serum IgM and IgG antibodies. Recent TBE virus infection was detected in 133 patients. Nine of these patients refused further cooperation, and the remaining 124 patients, 80 male (64.5%) and 44 female (35.4%), aged 16-76, were included in the study. We longitudinally examined the manifestation and characteristics of PES in each patient during a 3-year period (and longer if necessary). Study patients were divided into three groups of mild, moderate and severe PES based on data collected and entered into specially prepared questionnaire and by qualitative analysis of PES effect on their daily habits and activities. Out of 124 patients included in the study, 60 (48.3%) had no symptoms/signs of PES, or these were mild and of short duration 15 (12.0%). The remaining 49 (39.5%) patients developed moderate (30/47.0%) or severe (19/30.0%) PES lasting for 3-18 months, with significant impact on their daily habits and activities requiring some adjustment. The main characteristics of PES were mental disorders, balance and movement coordination disorders, headache, general malaise, and reduced working ability. PES was recorded in 35 (28.2%) patients with meningoencephalitis and 14 (11.2%) patients with meningoencephalomyelitis. Permanent sequels were left over in 11 (17.1%) patients: spinal nerve paresis in five (4.0%), hearing impairment in six (5.6%), dysarthria in two (1.6%) patients, and severe mental disorder in one (0.8%) patient. In three patients we recorded simultaneous permanent spinal nerve paralysis and permanent deafness. During our longitudinal study three (2.5%) patients died. The study undoubtedly confirmed the presence of PES in our patients with TBE. Moderate and severe PES has a significant impact on the patient quality of life, demands patient adjustment, and increases expenses of long-term sick-leave and rehabilitation."

We now demonstrate that most examined Lyme disease spirochetes from North America and Europe contain genes encoding RevA proteins, some with extensive regions of conservation and others with moderate diversity. Line blot analyses using recombinant RevA from two diverse Lyme disease spirochetes of RevA and serum samples from culture-confirmed human Lyme disease patients from the United States (n = 46, mainly with early Lyme disease) and Germany (>500, with early and late manifestations of Lyme disease) were performed. The results indicated that a sizable proportion of patients produced antibodies that recognized recombinant RevA. Overall, RevA-based serological studies were less sensitive and less specific than other assay types, such as the VlsE-based C6 peptide assay. However, sera from patients in the initial stages of Lyme disease contained antibodies against RevA, demonstrating that this protein is expressed early in human infection. Thus, RevA may be a useful target for preventative or curative therapies."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia burgdorferi Rrp1 protein is a diguanylate cyclase that controls a regulon consisting of approximately 10% of the total genome. Because Rrp1 lacks a DNA-binding domain, its regulatory capability is most likely mediated through the production of bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). C-di-GMP binds to and activates the regulatory activity of proteins that harbor a PilZ domain. The occurrence of a PilZ domain within a protein is not in and of itself sufficient to convey c-di-GMP binding, as other structural aspects of the protein are important in the interaction. In this study, we have assessed the expression and c-di-GMP binding ability of the sole PilZ domain-containing protein of B. burgdorferi B31, PlzA. PlzA was determined to be upregulated by tick feeding and to be expressed during mammalian infection. The gene is highly conserved and present in all Borrelia species. Analyses of recombinant PlzA demonstrated its ability to bind c-di-GMP and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this interaction is highly specific and dependent on Arg residues contained within the PilZ domain. In summary, this study is the first to identify a c-di-GMP effector molecule in a spirochete and provides additional evidence for the existence of a complete c-di-GMP regulatory network in the Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi."

To survive in the human host borreliae need to evade the immune system. It is already well known that B. burgdorferi ss. and B. afzelii bind the complement (C) alternative pathway inhibitor factor H from serum using OspE and CRASP-1/Bba68 proteins to escape C attack. In the presence of natural antibodies and in chronic infections, when specific antibodies develop, borreliae have to protect themselves from antibody-induced classical pathway C attack. In this study we demonstrate binding of the classical pathway inhibitor, C4b-binding protein (C4bp), to three genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Binding was strongest to B. garinii, which has been found to be the weakest factor H binder. The bacteria bound both purified (125)I-labeled C4bp and C4bp from serum. Unlabeled C4bp competed for binding with (125)I-C4bp, whereas BSA had no effect. Binding was salt-sensitive and inhibited by C4b and partially by heparin. C4bp maintained its cofactor activity for factor I in cleaving C4b when bound to the bacterial surface. Ligand blotting analysis of whole cell lysates and fractionated outer cell membranes of the bacteria suggested one major receptor of approximately 43 kDa (P43) for C4bp in B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Binding of C4bp may thus allow Lyme disease borreliae to escape activation of the classical C pathway and allow chronic infections in humans even in the presence of specific antibodies."

A 15-year-old boy presented at the age of 9 with recurrent rather painless swelling of the right knee. Altogether four episodes lasting for 1-2 weeks each occurred over a period of 18 months before medical advice was sought. Physical examination revealed only a slightly limited range of motion. Living in an endemic area of borreliosis, he reported a tick bite 6 months prior to onset of his symptoms with erythema migrans and was treated for 10 days with amoxicillin. Serology revealed two positive unspecific bands in IgG immunoblot (p41 and 66) with slight positivity for ELISA. Ultrasound revealed synovial thickening and increased fluid. Despite the weak positive serology a diagnosis of lyme arthritis could not be excluded and intravenous antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was started. After two further relapses antiinflammatory therapy including intraarticular steroids were introduced with no long lasting effect. A chronical disease developed with alternate periods of swelling and almost complete remission. Ultrasound as well as MRI demonstrated ongoing signs of synovitis, therefore after further progression, a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed showing an inconspicuous knee joint. A second MRI showed focal suprapatellar enhancement and was followed by open arthrotomy revealing a histopathological proven synovial cavernous juxtaarticular hemangioma. To our knowledge, the differential diagnosis of lyme arthritis and synovial hemangioma has not yet been reported despite obvious clinical similarities. In conclusion, in children and adolescents synovial hemangioma has to be considered in differential diagnosis of recurrent knee swelling. Early diagnosis is important to prevent prolonged suffering from chronic joint swelling with probable joint damages, unnecessary treatment procedures and as well school and sports absenteeism."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, carried by Ixodes ticks, is one of the most significant human pathogens, causing Lyme disease. As there is no standardized PCR method for detection and identification of spirochaete DNA, we carried out a comparative analysis using a set of complementary primers for three regions in the genomic DNA of these bacteria (genes fla and rrs and the non-coding rrs-rrlA region). DNA extracted from 579 Ixodes ricinus ticks was subjected to nested PCR. DNA of the examined spirochaetes was detected in 43 (7.4 %) lysates when the fla gene was used as a molecular marker, in 7 (1.2 %) lysates when using primers complementary to the rrs gene, and in 12 (2.1 %) lysates using primers complementary to the non-coding rrs-rrlA sequence. RFLP analysis based on the fla gene helped identify species from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia valaisiana), detect co-infections, and also identify Borrelia miyamotoi. Therefore, the fla gene is the most sensitive and specific molecular marker for the detection and identification of Borrelia spirochaetes in I. ricinus."

We hypothesized that low levels of C3 are associated with the coincident occurrence of B. burgdorferi infection and glomerulonephritis in Bernese Mountain dogs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the serum concentration of C3 in Bernese Mountain dogs with and without antibodies against B. burgdorferi and to compare this concentration with that of healthy control dogs. Eighty-three clinically healthy Bernese Mountain dogs and 46 control dogs were included. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole cell sonicate as antigen. Results were confirmed using Western blot. C3 was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion test. Results were reported as the percentage concentration of C3 compared with that in pooled preserved canine serum (100% C3 concentration). Median C3 concentration was 128.5% in Bernese Mountain dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi, 133.5% in B. burgdorferi-negative Bernese Mountain dogs, 87.8% in positive control dogs, and 102.2% in negative control dogs. Within Bernese Mountain and control groups, C3 was lower in dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi compared with those without. Percentage concentration of C3 was higher in healthy Bernese Mountain dogs compared with control dogs. Low C3 concentration is not an explanation for the high prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections and glomerular disease in Bernese Mountain dogs."

		"abstract": "Among the various species of hard ticks, Ixodes ricinus is the most frequently found tick throughout Europe. As with other ixodid ticks, the developmental cycle runs through three stages. In each stage a blood meal is required in order to develop to the next stage. Ixodes ricinus has been found to feed on more than 300 different vertebrate species. Usually, larval ticks feed on small mammals such as mice and become infected with various microorganisms and viruses, of which some are substantial pathogens to humans. The pathogens remain in the tick during molting and are thus transstadially transmitted to the next developmental stage. Pathogens transmitted to humans are the agents of Lyme borreliosis, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, Rickettsia species, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, occasionally Francisella tularensis, and protozoal Babesia species. Within the scope of an EU project Ixodes ricinus ticks from all federal states of Austria were searched by means of PCR methods for bacterial pathogens such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichia spp., Francisella tularensis, Rickettsia spp., and protozoal Babesia. Additionally, the prevalence of Bartonella spp. in this tick species was also determined. Besides the singular detection of Coxiella burnetii and Francisella tularensis in one tick collection site the overall prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, borreliae, rickettsae and babesiae in Ixodes ricinus amounted to 15%, 14%, 6% and surprising 36% and 51%, respectively. Bartonellae were detected in about 7%."

		"abstract": "Antigenic variation plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of many infectious bacteria and protozoa including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. VlsE, a 35 kDa surface-exposed lipoprotein, undergoes antigenic variation during B. burgdorferi infection of mammalian hosts, and is believed to be a critical mechanism by which the spirochetes evade immune clearance. Random, segmental recombination between the expressed vlsE gene and adjacent vls silent cassettes generates a large number of different VlsE variants within the infected host. Although the occurrence and importance of vlsE sequence variation is well established, little is known about the biological mechanism of vlsE recombination. To identify factors important in antigenic variation and vlsE recombination, we screened transposon mutants of genes known to be involved in DNA recombination and repair for their effects on infectivity and vlsE recombination. Several mutants, including those in BB0023 (ruvA), BB0022 (ruvB), BB0797 (mutS), and BB0098 (mutS-II), showed reduced infectivity in immunocompetent C3H/HeN mice. Mutants in ruvA and ruvB exhibited greatly reduced rates of vlsE recombination in C3H/HeN mice, as determined by restriction fragment polymorphism (RFLP) screening and DNA sequence analysis. In severe combined immunodeficiency (C3H/scid) mice, the ruvA mutant retained full infectivity; however, all recovered clones retained the 'parental' vlsE sequence, consistent with low rates of vlsE recombination. These results suggest that the reduced infectivity of ruvA and ruvB mutants is the result of ineffective vlsE recombination and underscores the important role that vlsE recombination plays in immune evasion. Based on functional studies in other organisms, the RuvAB complex of B. burgdorferi may promote branch migration of Holliday junctions during vlsE recombination. Our findings are consistent with those in the accompanying article by Dresser et al., and together these studies provide the first examples of trans-acting factors involved in vlsE recombination."

Whereas B. burgdorferi was 30-fold more frequent than B. miyamotoi in skin biopsies and mice had higher densities of B. burgdorferi densities in the skin than in the blood, B. miyamotoi densities were higher in blood than skin. In a survey of host-seeking nymphs in 11 northern states, infection prevalences for B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi averaged approximately 0.20 and approximately 0.02, respectively.

Mice were treated with high or low doses of tigecycline, saline (negative-effect controls), or a previously published regimen of ceftriaxone (positive-effect controls). Infection status was assessed at 3 months after treatment by culture, quantitative ospA real-time PCR, and subcutaneous transplantation of joint and heart tissue into SCID mice. Tissues from all saline-treated mice were culture and ospA PCR positive, tissues from all antibiotic-treated mice were culture negative, and some of the tissues from most of the mice treated with antibiotics were ospA PCR positive, although the DNA marker load was markedly decreased compared to that in saline-treated mice. Antibiotic treatment during the early stage of infection appeared to be more effective than treatment that began during later stages of infection. The viability of noncultivable spirochetes in antibiotic-treated mice (demonstrable by PCR) was confirmed by transplantation of tissue allografts from treated mice into SCID mice, with dissemination of spirochetal DNA to multiple recipient tissues, and by xenodiagnosis, including acquisition by ticks, transmission by ticks to SCID mice, and survival through molting into nymphs and then into adults. Furthermore, PCR-positive heart base tissue from antibiotic-treated mice revealed RNA transcription of several B. burgdorferi genes. These results extended previous studies with ceftriaxone, indicating that antibiotic treatment is unable to clear persisting spirochetes, which remain viable and infectious, but are nondividing or slowly dividing."

Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include nearly 40 species of vector-borne spirochetes that are capable of infecting a wide range of mammalian hosts, causing Lyme disease and relapsing fever. Relapsing fever is associated with high-level bacteremia, as well as hematologic manifestations, such as thrombocytopenia (i.e., low platelet numbers) and anemia. To facilitate studies of genetic control of susceptibility to Borrelia hermsii infection, we performed a systematic analysis of the course of infection using immunocompetent and immunocompromised inbred strains of mice. Our analysis revealed that sensitivity to B. hermsii infections is genetically controlled. In addition, whereas the role of adaptive immunity to relapsing fever-causing spirochetes is well documented, we found that innate immunity contributes significantly to the reduction of bacterial burden. Similar to human infection, the progression of the disease in mice was associated with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Histological and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of infected tissues indicated that red blood cells (RBCs) were removed by tissue-resident macrophages, a process that could lead to anemia. Spirochetes in the spleen and liver were often visualized associated with RBCs, lending support to the hypothesis that direct interaction of B. hermsii spirochetes with RBCs leads to clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream by tissue phagocytes."

However, in Austria, the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis decreased dramatically since the introduction of a well-organized vaccination campaign against tick-borne encephalitis. The diagnosis of tick-borne encephalitis is based on clinical criteria and laboratory confirmation of infection. Other tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme borreliosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, should be considered in children with tick-borne encephalitis since endemic areas for all three diseases overlap."

For follow-up studies, serial sample pairs were evaluated from 25 patients with NB (n=56), 11 with B-CNS-I (n=25) and 14 with V-CNS-I (n=36). CSF-CXCL13 was significantly elevated in NB compared with other neurological diseases (p<0.001). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, 337 ng/g was determined as a cut-off with a sensitivity of 96.4% and a specificity of 96.9%. Of all the parameters investigated, CSF CXCL13 showed the fastest response to antibiotic therapy, decreasing significantly (p=0.008) within 1 week. In untreated patients, CSF CXCL13 was elevated in patients with a short duration of disease. Borrelia burgdorferi antibody index showed no significant (p=0.356) change over follow-up. The study confirms the relevance of CXCL13 as a diagnostic biomarker of NB and suggests that CSF CXCL13 in NB is linked to duration of disease and could be a marker of disease activity and response to antibiotic therapy."

In comparing the Salp15 protein of all four principal vector ticks of public health importance for the transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes, we find the 53 C-terminal amino acids to have a high degree of similarity.

		"abstract": "The canonical ATP-dependent protease Lon participates in an assortment of biological processes in bacteria, including the catalysis of damaged or senescent proteins and short-lived regulatory proteins. Borrelia spirochetes are unusual in that they code for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted through the blood feeding of Ixodes ticks. Previous work in our laboratory reported that B. burgdorferi lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure to blood in vitro, while lon-2 is not. Because blood induction of Lon-1 may be of importance in the regulation of virulence factors critical for spirochete transmission, the clarification of functional roles for these two proteases in B. burgdorferi was the object of this study. On the chromosome, lon-2 is immediately downstream of ATP-dependent proteases clpP and clpX, an arrangement identical to that of lon of Escherichia coli. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH(2)-terminal substrate binding domains that may reflect differences in substrate specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro but did not complement an E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. We conclude that B. burgdorferi Lons -1 and -2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its blood induction, and as a unique feature of the Borreliae, may be important in host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host."

		"abstract": "Arthritis is a prominent manifestation of Lyme disease, which is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Chronic Lyme arthritis persisting even after antibiotic treatment is linked to HLA-DRB1*0401 (DR4) and related alleles. In contrast, patients whose Lyme arthritis resolves within 3 months postinfection show an increased frequency of HLA-DRB1*1101 (DR11). The aim of this study was to analyze the underlying mechanism by which HLA-DR alleles confer genetic susceptibility or resistance to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. We generated DR11-transgenic (DR11-Tg) mice on a murine MHCII-/- background and compared their immune response to Bb antigens with the response of DR4-Tg mice after immunization with Bb outer surface protein A (OspA) or infection with live Bb. T cells from OspA-immunized and Bb-infected DR11-Tg mice had defective production of interferon-gamma as compared with those from DR4-Tg mice. In contrast, DR11-Tg mice developed higher titers of anti-OspA and anti-Bb antibodies, respectively, than did DR4-Tg mice. Consistent with this observation, we found that the Bb-infected DR11-Tg mice had a decreased spirochetal burden as compared with the DR4-Tg mice, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This study provides direct evidence that in the presence of HLA-DR11, the immune response against Bb antigens is directed toward a protective antibody response. In contrast, an inflammatory Th1 response is induced in the presence of DR4. These observations offer an explanation for the differential genetic susceptibility of DR4+ and DR11+ individuals to the development of chronic Lyme arthritis and, eventually, the progression to antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis."

This issue of Molecular Microbiology contains two molecular genetic studies that help to clarify the function of BB0647 and resolve longstanding controversies. Loss of BB0647 appears to have a pronounced effect on borrelial gene expression and, in one study, caused significant in vitro growth defects. BB0647 was also found to be essential for infection of the mammalian host but not the tick vector. Both Ouyang et al. and Hyde et al. also demonstrate, quite unexpectedly, that BB0647 is required for induction of RpoS, an alternative sigma factor that controls a cadre of B. burgdorferi genes, most notably ospC, which enable the spirochetes to establish mammalian infection following tick inoculation. There are still many unanswered questions regarding the precise physiological role of BB0647, the most important of which relate to its homologues Fur and PerR: to what extent does it regulate either the response to oxidative stress and/or transition metal uptake? The mechanism(s) whereby BB0647 interfaces with the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway also remains to be discerned. However, these two seminal papers establish BB0647 (BosR) as a central player in the molecular biology and physiology of B. burgdorferi as well as the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

At the 7th hour of meperidine PCA delivery, generalized tonic-clonic seizure was developed and successfully suppressed with antiepileptics and no neurologic sequel was occurred. The total meperidine consumption in the patient was quite lower than the recommended doses with PCA. Although Lyme disease might also cause seizure activities, the timing of the seizures was related with the accumulation of normeperidine which is the main metabolite of meperidine with central nervous system stimulant effect. The meperidine pain management on patients with Lyme syndrome should be reconsidered to avoid undesired effects.Keywords."

Data were analysed according to levels of evidence as suggested by EFNS. The following three criteria should be fulfilled for definite LNB, and two of them for possible LNB: (i) neurological symptoms; (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; (iii) Bb-specific antibodies produced intrathecally. PCR and CSF culture may be corroborative if symptom duration is <6 weeks, when Bb antibodies may be absent. PCR is otherwise not recommended. There is also not enough evidence to recommend the following tests for diagnostic purposes: microscope-based assays, chemokine CXCL13, antigen detection, immune complexes, lymphocyte transformation test, cyst formation, lymphocyte markers. Adult patients with definite or possible acute LNB (symptom duration <6 months) should be offered a single 14-day course of antibiotic treatment. Oral doxycycline (200 mg daily) and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 g daily) are equally effective in patients with symptoms confined to the peripheral nervous system, including meningitis (level A). Patients with CNS manifestations should be treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) for 14 days and late LNB (symptom duration >6 months) for 3 weeks (good practice points). Children should be treated as adults, except that doxycycline is contraindicated under 8 years of age (nine in some countries). If symptoms persist for more than 6 months after standard treatment, the condition is often termed post-Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). Antibiotic therapy has no impact on PLDS (level A)."

We performed a review of the data from 95 women with Lyme borreliosis during pregnancy, evaluated at the Center for Tick-borne Diseases, Budapest over the past 22 years. Treatment was administered parenterally to 66 (69.5%) women and orally to 19 (20%). Infection remained untreated in 10 (10.5%) pregnancies. Adverse outcomes were seen in 8/66 (12.1%) parentally treated women, 6/19 (31.6%) orally treated women, and 6/10 (60%) untreated women. In comparison to patients treated with antibiotics, untreated women had a significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome (odds ratio (OR) 7.61, p=0.004). While mothers treated orally had an increased chance (OR 3.35) of having an adverse outcome compared to those treated parenterally, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.052). Erythema migrans did not resolve by the end of the first antibiotic course in 17 patients. Adverse pregnancy outcome was more frequent among these 'slow responder' mothers (OR 2.69), but this was not statistically significant (p=0.1425) . Loss of the pregnancy (n=7) and cavernous hemangioma (n=4) were the most prevalent adverse outcomes in our series. The other complications were heterogeneous. Our results indicate that an untreated maternal Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. infection may be associated with an adverse outcome, although bacterial invasion of the fetus cannot be proven. It appears that a specific syndrome representing 'congenital Lyme borreliosis' is unlikely."

The average fold change of the 5 genes over normal expression, as determined by qPCR, was significantly elevated in skin biopsies from patients with CIDP in comparison to CMT1 or diabetic neuropathy, and similar to that seen in Lyme disease. The findings indicate the presence of inflammatory changes in the skin of patients with CIDP."

Although much is known about B. burgdorferi replication, the routes and mechanisms by which it disseminates within the tick remain unclear. To better understand this process, we imaged live, infectious B. burgdorferi expressing a stably integrated, constitutively expressed GFP reporter. Using isolated tick midguts and salivary glands, we observed B. burgdorferi progress through the feeding tick via what we believe to be a novel, biphasic mode of dissemination. In the first phase, replicating spirochetes, positioned at varying depths throughout the midgut at the onset of feeding, formed networks of nonmotile organisms that advanced toward the basolateral surface of the epithelium while adhering to differentiating, hypertrophying, and detaching epithelial cells. In the second phase of dissemination, the nonmotile spirochetes transitioned into motile organisms that penetrated the basement membrane and entered the hemocoel, then migrated to and entered the salivary glands. We designated the first phase of dissemination \"adherence-mediated migration\" and provided evidence that it involves the inhibition of spirochete motility by one or more diffusible factors elaborated by the feeding tick midgut. Our studies, which we believe are the first to relate the transmission dynamics of spirochetes to the complex morphological and developmental changes that the midgut and salivary glands undergo during engorgement, challenge the conventional viewpoint that dissemination of Lyme disease-causing spirochetes within ticks is exclusively motility driven."

		"abstract": "Traditionally, vaccines directly target a pathogen or microbial toxin. Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is a tick-borne illness for which a human vaccine is not currently available. B. burgdorferi binds a tick salivary protein, Salp15, during transmission from the vector, and this interaction facilitates infection of mice. We now show that Salp15 antiserum significantly protected mice from B. burgdorferi infection. Salp15 antiserum also markedly enhanced the protective capacity of antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens, such as OspA or OspC. Mice actively immunized with Salp15 were also significantly protected from tick-borne Borrelia. In vitro assays showed that Salp15 antiserum increased the clearance of Salp15-coated B. burgdorferi by phagocytes, suggesting a mechanism of action. Vaccination with a vector molecule that a microbe requires for infection of the mammalian host suggests a new strategy for the prevention of Lyme disease, and this paradigm may be applicable to numerous arthropod-borne pathogens of medical importance."

		"abstract": "Inflammation has long been implicated as a contributor to pathogenesis in many CNS illnesses, including Lyme neuroborreliosis. Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochete that causes Lyme disease and it is known to potently induce the production of inflammatory mediators in a variety of cells. In experiments where B. burgdorferi was co-cultured in vitro with primary microglia, we observed robust expression and release of IL-6 and IL-8, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP-1alpha), CCL4 (MIP-1beta) and CCL5 (RANTES), but we detected no induction of microglial apoptosis. In contrast, SH-SY5Y (SY) neuroblastoma cells co-cultured with B. burgdorferi expressed negligible amounts of inflammatory mediators and also remained resistant to apoptosis. When SY cells were co-cultured with microglia and B. burgdorferi, significant neuronal apoptosis consistently occurred. Confocal microscopy imaging of these cell cultures stained for apoptosis and with cell type-specific markers confirmed that it was predominantly the SY cells that were dying. Microarray analysis demonstrated an intense microglia-mediated inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi including up-regulation in gene transcripts for TLR-2 and NFkappabeta. Surprisingly, a pathway that exhibited profound changes in regard to inflammatory signaling was triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM1). Significant transcript alterations in essential p53 pathway genes also occurred in SY cells cultured in the presence of microglia and B. burgdorferi, which indicated a shift from cell survival to preparation for apoptosis when compared to SY cells cultured in the presence of B. burgdorferi alone. Taken together, these findings indicate that B. burgdorferi is not directly toxic to SY cells; rather, these cells become distressed and die in the inflammatory surroundings generated by microglia through a bystander effect. If, as we hypothesized, neuronal apoptosis is the key pathogenic event in Lyme neuroborreliosis, then targeting microglial responses may be a significant therapeutic approach for the treatment of this form of Lyme disease."

P66 is expressed by B. burgdorferi in the mammal, in laboratory media, and as the bacteria are acquired or transmitted by the tick, but is not expressed by the bacterium in unfed ticks. Attempts to reveal factors influencing expression revealed that P66 was expressed in all in vitro conditions investigated. Candidate regulators identified in a search of the B. burgdorferi genome for homologs to other bacterial transcription factors were cloned and introduced into E. coli carrying a p66 promoter-signal sequence-phoA (alkaline phosphatase, or AP) fusion. Three candidate transcription factors-two that decreased AP activity (Hbb and BB0527), and one that increased AP activity (BBA23)-were identified. BBA23 and BB0527 did not bind to the p66 promoter at physiologically relevant concentrations. In contrast, several promoter fragments, including p66, were bound by Hbb (BB0232), with slightly different affinities. Consistent with results from other laboratories, Hbb appears to recognize multiple DNA sequences. Changes in the expression of p66 and bb0232 in the tick at various points with respect to feeding on mice, along with the results of the reporter experiment in the surrogate host E. coli, are consistent with Hbb/BB0232 being involved in regulating p66 expression."

B. burgdorferi isolates from the United States induced macrophages to secrete significantly higher levels of interleukin (IL)-8, CCL3, CCL4, IL-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor than B. garinii or B. afzelii isolates. Consistent with this response in cultured macrophages, chemokine and cytokine levels in serum samples of patients from whom the isolates were obtained were significantly greater in B. burgdorferi-infected patients than in B. afzelii- or B. garinii-infected patients. These results demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that B. burgdorferi has greater inflammatory potential than B. afzelii and B. garinii, which may account in part for variations in the clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis."

We hypothesize that BosR serves as a global regulator in B. burgdorferi to modulate the oxidative stress response and adapt to mammalian hosts. To test this hypothesis, a bosR mutant in a low-passage B. burgdorferi isolate was constructed. The resulting bosR::kan(R) strain was altered when grown microaerobically or anaerobically suggesting that BosR is required for optimal replication under both growth conditions. The absence of BosR increased the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi to hydrogen peroxide and reduced the synthesis of Cdr and NapA, proteins important for cellular redox balance and the oxidative stress response, respectively, suggesting an important role for BosR in borrelial oxidative homeostasis. For the bosR mutant, the production of RpoS was abrogated and resulted in the loss of OspC and DbpA, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS regulatory cascade. Consistent with the linkage to RpoS, cells lacking bosR were non-infectious in the mouse model of infection. These results indicate that BosR is required for resistance to oxidative stressors and provides a regulatory response that is necessary for B. burgdorferi pathogenesis."

Thus far, a role for BosR in Bb metabolism, gene regulation or pathogenesis has not been determined, largely due to the heretofore inability to inactivate bosR in low-passage, infectious Bb isolates. Herein, we report the generation of the first bosR-deficient mutant in a virulent strain of Bb. Whereas the bosR mutant persisted normally in ticks, the mutant was unable to infect mice, indicating that BosR is essential for Bb infection of a mammalian host. Moreover, transcriptional profiling of the bosR mutant showed that a number of genes were either positively or negatively influenced by BosR deficiency, suggesting that BosR may function both as a global repressor and activator in Bb. Strikingly, our study showed that BosR controls the expression of two major virulence-associated Bb lipoproteins, OspC and DbpA, likely via an influence on the alternative sigma factor, RpoS. This study thus not only has elucidated another key virulence gene of Bb, but also provides new insights into a previously unknown layer of gene regulation governing RpoS in Bb."

We have identified in proteomic studies a protein that is encoded by the gene LIC10314 and expressed in virulent strain of L. interrogans serovar Pomona. This protein was predicted to be surface exposed by PSORT program and contains a p83/100 domain identified by BLAST analysis that is conserved in protein antigens of several strains of Borrelia and Treponema spp. The proteins containing this domain have been claimed antigen candidates for serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Thus, we have cloned the LIC10314 and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli BL21-SI strain by using the expression vector pAE. The recombinant protein tagged with N-terminal hexahistidine was purified by metal-charged chromatography and characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy. This protein is conserved among several species of pathogenic Leptospira and absent in the saprophytic strain L. biflexa. We confirm by liquid-phase immunofluorescence assays with living organisms that this protein is most likely a new surface leptospiral protein. The ability of the protein to mediate attachment to ECM components was evaluated by binding assays. The leptospiral protein encoded by LIC10314, named Lsa63 (Leptospiral surface adhesin of 63kDa), binds strongly to laminin and collagen IV in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion. In addition, Lsa63 is probably expressed during infection since it was recognized by antibodies of serum samples of confirmed-leptospirosis patients in convalescent phase of the disease. Altogether, the data suggests that this novel identified surface protein may be involved in leptospiral pathogenesis."

Using chemical tools, we deconvoluted the intracellular hemoglobinolytic cascade in the tick Ixodes ricinus, a vector of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. In tick gut tissue, a network of peptidases was demonstrated through imaging with specific activity-based probes and activity profiling with peptidic substrates and inhibitors. This peptidase network is induced upon blood feeding and degrades hemoglobin at acidic pH. Selective inhibitors were applied to dissect the roles of the individual peptidases and to determine the peptidase-specific cleavage map of the hemoglobin molecule. The degradation pathway is initiated by endopeptidases of aspartic and cysteine class (cathepsin D supported by cathepsin L and legumain) and is continued by cysteine amino- and carboxy-dipeptidases (cathepsins C and B). The identified enzymes are potential targets to developing novel anti-tick vaccines."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, adapts to unique host environments as a consequence of its complex life cycle that spans both arthropod and mammalian species. In this regard, B. burgdorferi must adapt to various environmental signals, pHs, temperatures, and O(2) and CO(2) levels to establish infectious foci. We hypothesize that the BosR protein functions as a global regulator that is required for both borrelial oxidative homeostasis and pathogenesis. To assess the role of BosR in B. burgdorferi, we constructed an IPTG (isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-regulated bosR strain. The selective decrease of bosR resulted in a change in growth when cells were cultured either anaerobically or microaerobically; however, a distinct growth defect was observed for anaerobically grown B. burgdorferi relative to the growth attenuation observed for microaerobically grown B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi cells in which BosR levels were reduced were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and produced lower levels of NapA (Dps) and SodA, proteins involved in the oxidative stress response. In addition, the levels of OspC and DbpA were also induced coincident with increased BosR levels, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the RpoS regulatory cascade, which is known to modulate virulence gene expression in B. burgdorferi. Taken together, these results indicate that BosR is involved in the resistance of B. burgdorferi to oxidative stressors and affects the expression of genes, either directly or indirectly, whose products are important in borrelial pathogenesis."

Up to three distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) may be expressed by serum-resistant B. spielmanii, each exhibiting an affinity for CFH and/or CFHL1. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the 15-kDa CRASPs of B. spielmanii, members of the polymorphic Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family, that bind two distinct host complement regulators, CFH and factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1), but not CFHL1. CFH bound to the B. spielmanii CRASPs maintained cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation. Three naturally occurring alleles of this protein bound CFH and CFHR1 while a fourth natural allele could not. Comparative sequence analysis of these protein alleles identified a single amino acid, histidine-79, as playing a significant role in CFH/CFHR1 binding, with substitution by an arginine completely abrogating ligand binding. The mutation of His-79 to Arg did not inhibit binding of plasminogen, another known ligand of this group of borrelial outer-surface proteins."

The purified peak had a molecular weight of 5.3kDa by MALDI/TOF-MS and its amino acid sequence, determined by Edman degradation was PDxGxPxxVKAGRxPxxSI. A BLASTP search revealed that the protein is a putative 5.3kDa secreted protein (AAM93656) from I. scapularis. The predicted protein is composed of 69 amino acids with no conserved domain motifs. Purified ISAMP was found to have antimicrobial activities against bacteria. Gene expression studies were carried out to observe ISAMP expression in different tick tissues. RT-PCR results indicated that the gene was expressed in hemocytes, fat body and salivary gland but virtually no expression was observed in the midgut. ISAMP is only similar to other Ixodid tick proteins, thus it is a member of a unique family."

		"abstract": "Analysis of borrelia isolates collected from ticks, birds, and rodents from the southeastern United States revealed the presence of well-established populations of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia bissettii, Borrelia carolinensis, and Borrelia sp. nov. Multilocus sequence analysis of five genomic loci from seven samples representing Borrelia sp. nov. isolated from nymphal Ixodes minor collected in South Carolina showed their close relatedness to California strains known as genomospecies 1 and separation from any other known species of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex. One nucleotide difference in the size of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region, one substitution in 16S rRNA gene signature nucleotides, and silent nucleotide substitutions in sequences of the gene encoding flagellin and the gene p66 clearly separate Borrelia sp. nov. isolates from South Carolina into two subgroups. The sequences of isolates of each subgroup share the same restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region and contain unique signature nucleotides in the 16S rRNA gene. We propose that seven Borrelia sp. nov. isolates from South Carolina and two California isolates designated as genomospecies 1 comprise a single species, which we name Borrelia americana sp. nov. The currently recognized geographic distribution of B. americana is South Carolina and California. All strains are associated with Ixodes pacificus or Ixodes minor and their rodent and bird hosts."

		"abstract": "The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are known modulators of innate immune cell function; however, their contributions to adaptive immunity are relatively unknown. We investigated the roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the humoral immune response to infection with the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. We report that in vitro, murine B cells constitutively expressed COX-1 and up-regulated expression of both COX-1 and COX-2 as well as their products PGE(2), PGF(2alpha), and thromboxane B(2) and their receptors following stimulation with B. burgdorferi or anti-CD40. In vitro inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2 in murine B cells resulted in decreased eicosanoid production and altered Ab production. Importantly, infection of mice lacking COX-1, but not COX-2, activity resulted in a defect in Ig class-switching and a lack of Borrelia-specific IgG production. This defect correlated with decreased germinal center formation and IL-6 and IL-17 production, and it could be partially recovered by restoration of IL-6, but fully recovered by IL-17. Furthermore, sera from COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice were dramatically less effective in killing B. burgdorferi, but borreliacidal activity was restored in COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice administered IL-17. We conclude that IL-17 plays a role in Ab production and Ig class-switching in response to infection and that COX-1 is a critical, previously unrecognized regulator of this response."

		"abstract": "Persistence of tissue spirochetes of Borrelia burgdorferi as helices and round bodies (RBs) explains many erythema-Lyme disease symptoms. Spirochete RBs (reproductive propagules also called coccoid bodies, globular bodies, spherical bodies, granules, cysts, L-forms, sphaeroplasts, or vesicles) are induced by environmental conditions unfavorable for growth. Viable, they grow, move and reversibly convert into motile helices. Reversible pleiomorphy was recorded in at least six spirochete genera (>12 species). Penicillin solution is one unfavorable condition that induces RBs. This antibiotic that inhibits bacterial cell wall synthesis cures neither the second \"Great Imitator\" (Lyme borreliosis) nor the first: syphilis. Molecular-microscopic techniques, in principle, can detect in animals (insects, ticks, and mammals, including patients) helices and RBs of live spirochetes. Genome sequences of B. burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum spirochetes show absence of >75% of genes in comparison with their free-living relatives. Irreversible integration of spirochetes at behavioral, metabolic, gene product and genetic levels into animal tissue has been documented. Irreversible integration of spirochetes may severely impair immunological response such that they persist undetected in tissue. We report in vitro inhibition and destruction of B. burgdorferi (helices, RBs = \"cysts\") by the antibiotic Tigecycline (TG; Wyeth), a glycylcycline protein-synthesis inhibitor (of both 30S and 70S ribosome subunits). Studies of the pleiomorphic life history stages in response to TG of both B. burgdorferi and Treponema pallidum in vivo and in vitro are strongly encouraged."

		"abstract": "Use of topical insect repellent is an important component in prophylaxis of arthropod bite vector borne diseases. Topical insect repellent are used in a three part management regimen, along with impregnated clothing and mosquito netting. Parental training for efficacious and secure use of repellents for their children is essential part of a successful strategy to combat Lyme borreliosis, dengue fever, Chikungunya, West Nile virus infection and malaria, amongst children, according to local epidemiological risks. Rational repellent prescription for a child must take into account age, active substance concentration, topical substance tolerance, nature and surface of the skin to protect, number of daily applications, and the length of use in a benefit-risk ratio assessment perspective. The 4 currently repellents recommended by Whopes (Who) for their long lasting efficacy and patient tolerance are: 1) Citriodiol (PMD), 2) DEET, 3) Icaridine (KB3023), and 4) IR3535. In field trials the minimum required concentration of each four of these agents to be effective for 3 hours against most arthropods is 20% (in cream, roll-on or spray vehicle). Described side effects of these agents are mild, being limited to local irritative dermatitis and allergy. The risk of severe side effects has been related to DEET misused and neurotoxicity. The international recommendations concerning utilization of topical repellent amongst children for prophylaxis of arthropod borne diseases is concerning short term usage (several weeks). But the use of repellent is sub chronic or chronic amongst the majority of children living in subtropical regions where these vector borne diseases are endemic. And toxicity of topical repellent when used sub-chronically and chronically is not well studied in pediatric age groups. Taking into account these considerations, the current recommendations of the French Group of Tropical Paediatrics are to teach the parents of children who live in arthropod vector disease endemic regions to use topical insect repellent on their children with the recommended age related frequency in the following way: the use of topical repellent in infants above 6 months, once daily. Only in exceptional circumstances of severe arthropod exposure risk, their brief use in nursing infants as young as 2 months is acceptable, however with never more than 1 application daily. From ages 1 to 12 years, 2 applications daily may be safely used; 3 applications daily after 12 years old through adulthood."

Nalp3 has been identified as a key NLR for IL-1beta production and has been shown to have a particular role in gout.

It is paramount for the practicing orthopedic surgeon to have an appreciation for the medical pathology of common axonal neuropathies to properly diagnose, treat, and refer a patient with altered sensation in the upper extremity. The prevalence of diabetes in the United States is 10%, and roughly 20% of diabetic patients have peripheral neuropathy. In addition to diabetes, 32% of heavy alcohol users present with polyneuropathy. With advancements in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinicians may see the long-term effects of the virus manifested as axonal neuropathies and extreme allodynia. In some regions of the world, Hansen's disease usurps diabetes as the most common cause of polyneuropathy. Based on patient demographics and social habits, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, and syphilis can all manifest as polyneuropathies. Understanding the common medical causes of neuropathy will aid the orthopedic surgeon in differentiating simple compression neuropathies from diseases mimicking or confounding them."

Clinical and diagnostic features were obtained by retrospective chart review; follow-up information and outcome were obtained prospectively. The spectrum of conditions responsible for cerebral vasculitis included seven patients with Behçet syndrome and one case each of giant cell arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome, respectively. Vasculitis secondary to systemic diseases included two patients with systemic lupus erythematodes, one with sarcoidosis and one with ANA-positive systemic vasculitis. Two patients suffered from infectious angiitis caused by borreliosis and syphilis. The mean age at onset of cerebral symptoms was 41.38 years. The most frequent clinical symptoms were headache, gait disturbances and unilateral numbness. None of the patients with Behçet syndrome experienced any ischemic event, which was a significant difference compared with the other patients (P = 0.011). Gadolinium-enhancing lesions were significantly more frequent in Behçet syndrome compared to the other types of vasculitis (P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between vasculitis patients with or without Behçet syndrome regarding outcome parameters. The differential diagnosis of conditions responsible for cerebral vasculitis includes a wide spectrum of diseases. Clinical features and the course of cerebral vasculitis are highly variable. The enigma of cerebral vasculitis will only be solved by implementing large, prospective, multicenter databases."

In this paper we explore the contribution of Ixodes scapularis ticks to the pathogenicity of Borrelia burgdorferi in mice. Previously we demonstrated that an isolate of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (designated N40), passaged 75 times in vitro (N40-75), was infectious but was no longer able to cause arthritis and carditis in C3H mice. We now show that N40-75 spirochetes can readily colonize I. scapularis and multiply during tick engorgement. Remarkably, tick-transmitted N40-75 spirochetes cause disease in mice. N40-75 spirochetes isolated from these animals also retained their pathogenicity when subsequently administered to mice via syringe inoculation. Array analysis revealed that several genes associated with virulence, including bba25, bba65, bba66, bbj09, and bbk32, had higher expression levels in the tick-passaged N40-75 spirochete. These data suggest that transmission of a high-passage attenuated isolate of B. burgdorferi by the arthropod vector results in the generation of spirochetes that have enhanced pathogenesis in mice."

Several of these differentially expressed lipoproteins have been shown to play important roles in the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. The BBA05 protein is a previously identified putative lipoprotein (P55 or S1 antigen) that elicits antibody responses in mammals. Recent microarray analyses indicate that the BBA05 gene is differentially expressed by many environmental factors, including temperature. However, the role of the BBA05 protein in the life cycle of B. burgdorferi has not been elucidated. Here we show that expression of the BBA05 gene was exclusively induced in feeding nymphal ticks during the spirochetal transmission from ticks to mammals. Upon generating a BBA05 mutant in an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi, we showed that the BBA05 mutant remained capable of establishing infection in mice, being acquired by ticks, persisting through tick molting, and reinfecting new mammalian hosts. These results indicate that, despite being a highly conserved and regulated antigen, the BBA05 protein has a nonessential role in the transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi, at least in the animal model."

Selection is hard to observe directly but can be inferred from molecular sequence variation. For protein-coding nucleotide sequences, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (omega) distinguishes neutrally evolving sequences (omega = 1) from those subjected to purifying (omega < 1) or positive Darwinian (omega > 1) selection. We show that current models used to estimate omega are substantially biased by naturally occurring sequence compositions. We present a novel model that weights substitutions by conditional nucleotide frequencies and which escapes these artifacts. Applying it to the genomes of pathogens causing malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease gave significant discrepancies in estimates with approximately 10-30% of genes affected. Our work has substantial implications for how vaccine targets are chosen and for studying the molecular basis of adaptive evolution."

Since the Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is attracting attentions to tick bites more than ever in Turkey, the patients with tick bites are followed up more cautiously and have been referred to central hospitals. In this study 4 patients who were referred to our center with prediagnosis of CCHF but later appeared to be Lyme cases, were presented. All of the cases were women, age ranging between 25-67 years old. The patients were from areas where there is high risk of CCHF. CCHF were ruled out in these patients by agent specific polymerase chain reaction and IgM results. All of the patients were clinically diagnosed as Lyme disease since they had lesions compatible with erythema migrans. B. burgdorferi total antibodies investigated by ELISA (Zeus Scientific Inc., USA) were found positive in all patients. Since Western blot method could not be performed, positive serologic results have not be confirmed. However, the diagnosis of Lyme disease was done according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria and all of the cases have recovered following treatment with antibiotics (cefuroxime axetil or sulbactam ampicillin or amoxicillin clavulanic acid). When the increase in the incidence of arthropod-borne infections in our country is considered, it should be noted that tick-bite cases should also be evaluated in terms of Lyme disease besides CCHF. Differential diagnosis of these infections is of critical value since early appropriate therapy is important to prevent the development of serious complications in both of the disease settings."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, a multisystemic disorder characterized by inflammation. Using global transcriptional profiling, we characterized the response of human PBMCs exposed to B. burgdorferi in an ex vivo coculture system. The expression profiles induced by B. burgdorferi were marked by the intense up-regulation of IFN-responsive transcripts and transcripts involved in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Transcript levels of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and IRF7, and protein concentrations of IFN-alpha, were significantly elevated relative to those in unstimulated PBMCs. The induction of IFN-alpha was completely dependent upon phagocytosis of B. burgdorferi. Addition of a soluble type I IFN receptor, B18R, did not abolish the induction of IFN-inducible genes, indicating that B. burgdorferi directly elicits enhanced expression of these genes independently of type I IFN feedback signaling. Inhibitors of either TLR7 or TLR9 significantly reduced B. burgdorferi-stimulated IFN-alpha protein expression and transcription of IFN-induced genes. Simultaneous inhibition of both TLR7 and TLR9 completely abrogated IFN-alpha induction. The IFN-alpha-producing populations in PBMCs were identified as plasmacytoid dendritic and CD14(+)CD11c(+) cells. These results reveal a TLR7/9-dependent signaling pathway used by human PBMCs to initiate a type I IFN response to the extracellular bacterium B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Factors potentially contributing to the lower incidence of Lyme borreliosis (LB) in the far-western than in the northeastern United States include tick host-seeking behavior resulting in fewer human tick encounters, lower densities of Borrelia burgdorferi-infected vector ticks in peridomestic environments, and genetic variation among B. burgdorferi spirochetes to which humans are exposed. We determined the population structure of B. burgdorferi in over 200 infected nymphs of the primary bridging vector to humans, Ixodes pacificus, collected in Mendocino County, CA. This was accomplished by sequence typing the spirochete lipoprotein ospC and the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer (IGS). Thirteen ospC alleles belonging to 12 genotypes were found in California, and the two most abundant, ospC genotypes H3 and E3, have not been detected in ticks in the Northeast. The most prevalent ospC and IGS biallelic profile in the population, found in about 22% of ticks, was a new B. burgdorferi strain defined by ospC genotype H3. Eight of the most common ospC genotypes in the northeastern United States, including genotypes I and K that are associated with disseminated human infections, were absent in Mendocino County nymphs. ospC H3 was associated with hardwood-dominated habitats where western gray squirrels, the reservoir host, are commonly infected with LB spirochetes. The differences in B. burgdorferi population structure in California ticks compared to the Northeast emphasize the need for a greater understanding of the genetic diversity of spirochetes infecting California LB patients."

Lyme borreliosis is considered an over diagnosed disease. The term \"Lyme nephritis\" was introduced for dogs with characteristic renal lesions and typical clinical signs, in which antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi were found. Different studies have been aimed at showing a relation between renal disease and B. burgdorferi infection; however, this was not possible until now. Reasons for the uncertainty of the effects of B. burgdorferi in the dog are the high prevalence of circulating antibodies, the unspecific clinical picture and the inaccuracy of serologic tests."

		"abstract": "Disparities in health outcomes across communities are a central concern in public health and epidemiology. Health disparities research often links differences in health outcomes to other social factors like income. Choropleth maps of health outcome rates show the geographical distribution of health outcomes. This paper illustrates the use of cumulative frequency map legends for visualizing how the health events are distributed in relation to social characteristics of community populations. The approach uses two graphs in the cumulative frequency legend to highlight the difference between the raw count of the health events and the raw count of the social characteristic like low income in the geographical areas of the map. The approach is applied to mapping publicly available data on low birth weight by town in Connecticut and Lyme disease incidence by town in Connecticut in relation to income. The steps involved in creating these legends are described in detail so that health analysts can adopt this approach. The different health problems, low birth weight and Lyme disease, have different cumulative frequency signatures. Graphing poverty population on the cumulative frequency legends revealed that the poverty population is distributed differently with respect to the two different health problems mapped here. Cumulative frequency legends can be useful supplements for choropleth maps. These legends can be constructed using readily available software. They contain all of the information found in standard choropleth map legends, and they can be used with any choropleth map classification scheme. Cumulative frequency legends effectively communicate the proportion of areas, the proportion of health events, and/or the proportion of the denominator population in which the health events occurred that falls within each class interval. They illuminate the context of disease through graphing associations with other variables."

We show that the BBK07 gene is expressed at extremely low levels in vitro and in ticks but is dramatically induced by spirochetes once introduced into the host and is highly expressed throughout mammalian infection. In contrast, the expression of BBK12, a paralog of BBK07 with 87% amino acid identity, although expressed in vitro, remained undetectable in vivo throughout murine infection and in ticks. BBK07 is localized in the outer membrane, and the amino-terminal domain of the antigen is exposed on the microbial surface. A truncated BBK07 protein representing the amino-terminal domain is able to effectively detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi, both in experimentally infected mice and in humans. Further characterization of the immunodominant antigens of B. burgdorferi, such as BBK07, could contribute to the development of novel serodiagnostic markers for detection of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Prescribed fire was investigated as a method for controlling ixodid and argasid ticks in chaparral habitats in northern California. Two experimental and two adjacent control plots within a wildlife preserve were monitored for 1 yr postburn. Ticks were collected by flagging vegetation, by CO2-baited pitfall trap, and by live-trapping rodents. Twice as many rodents were caught at control sites compared with burn sites and no dusky-footed woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes Baird, were found in the treatment sites postburn. This species is known to be a reservoir of the agents of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum Dumler, Barbet, Bekker, Dasch, Palmer, Ray, Rikihisa, Rurangirwa. Six ixodid tick species were removed from rodents (Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls, Ixodes jellisoni Cooley & Kohls, Ixodes spinipalpis Hadwen & Nuttall, Ixodes woodi Bishopp, Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, and Dermacentor parumapertus Neumann), two of which transmit bacterial zoonotic agents to people in the far-western United States. There was no decrease in number of ticks per animal trapped at either burn site compared with controls; in fact, the mean number of immature I. pacificus per rodent was significantly higher at one burn site than its control site. Soil refugia may protect ticks from fire-induced mortality; the argasid tick Ornithodoros coriaceus Koch, which lives in soil, was unaffected by the prescribed fire as were I. pacificus and D. occidentalis buried in packets 2.5 cm below ground. We conclude that although prescribed fires in chaparral habitats may diminish local rodent abundance, it does not decrease tick loads on rodents. Furthermore, burning chaparral does not result in a decreased abundance of adult ixodid ticks on vegetation and apparently does not affect argasid or ixodid ticks that are sheltered within soil refugia."

Here we found isolates and DNAs belonging to the Borrelia turcica and unknown Borrelia species from imported reptiles and their ectoparasites. The Borrelia strains were isolated from blood and multiple organs of exotic tortoises, and were experimentally infectious to captive-bred tortoises. These findings suggest that these tortoises may be a candidate as the reservoir host of the Borrelia species. In this study, the Borrelia strains were also isolated from and/or detected in hard-bodied ticks, Amblyomma ticks and Hyalomma ticks. In some of these ticks, immunofluorescence imaging analysis revealed that the Borrelia had also invaded into the tick salivary glands. Accordingly, these ticks were expected to be a potential vector of the Borrelia species. Sequencing analyses of both housekeeping genes (flaB gene, gyrB gene and 16S rDNA gene) and 23S rRNA gene-16S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region revealed that these Borrelia strains formed a monophyletic group that was independent from two other Borrelia groups, Lyme disease Borrelia and relapsing fever Borrelia. From these results, the novel group of Borrelia comprises the third major group of arthropod-transmitted borreliae identified to date."

Sixty-two APS patients and 123 controls (20 syphilis, 33 Lyme disease, 30 HCV infection and cryoglobulinemia, 40 healthy subjects) were studied. Using the 99(th) percentile cutoff, the sensitivity and specificity of EliA aCL IgG, aCL IgM, anti-beta2-GPI IgG, and anti-beta2-GPI IgM were 69.4% and 81.9%, 64.5% and 86.7%, 64.5% and 98.8%, and 53.2% and 92.8%, respectively. Using the Sydney criteria cutoff (>40 GPL/MPL units), sensitivity and specificity of EliA aCL IgG and aCL IgM were 45.2% and 98.8%, and 35.5% and 97.5%, respectively. The best diagnostic efficiency was obtained combining the aCL tests (>40 GPL/MPL units) with the anti-beta2-GPI tests (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 90.4%). The area under the ROC curves for EliA, Orgentec, and Inova methods were 0.870, 0.940, and 0.850 for aCL IgG; 0.820, 0.820, and 0.820 for aCL IgM; 0.910, 0.960, and 0.920 for anti-beta2-GPI IgG; 0.840, 0.840, and 0.820 for anti-beta2-GPI IgM, respectively. Finally, the overall agreement between EliA assays and the other two ELISA methods ranged from moderate (anti-beta2-GPI IgG EliA versus Orgentec: Cohen's k = 0.426) to good (anti-beta2-GPI IgM EliA vs. Inova: k = 0.841). In conclusion, newly developed EliA methods for antiphospholipid antibody detection perform similarly to other ELISA assays and represent a useful tool for APS laboratory diagnosis in daily practice."

Microarray analysis of in vivo B. burgdorferi gene expression in murine skin showed that several genes were altered in TLR1/2-deficient animals compared with wild-type mice. For example, expression of bbe21 (a gene involved in B. burgdorferi lp25 plasmid maintenance) and bb0665 (a gene encoding a glycosyl transferase) were higher in TLR1/2-deficient mice than in control animals. In contrast, messenger RNA levels for bb0731 (a spoJ-like gene) and bba74 (a gene encoding a periplasmic protein) were lower in TLR1/2-deficient mice than in wild-type animals. The expression profiles of some of these genes were altered similarly in B. burgdorferi-infected ticks fed on control or TLR1/2-deficient mice. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis supported the microarray analysis and suggested that spirochete gene expression is altered by the milieu created by specific host TLRs, both in the murine host and in the arthropod vector."

An analysis of bb0323 expression in vivo showed variable transcription throughout the spirochete infection cycle, with elevated expression during tick-mouse transmission. Deletion of bb0323 in infectious B. burgdorferi did not affect microbial survival in vitro, despite considerable alterations in growth kinetics and cell morphology. The bb0323 mutants were unable to infect either mice or ticks and were quickly eliminated from immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts and the vector within the first few days after inoculation. Chromosomal complementation of the mutant with native bb0323 and phenotypic analysis in vivo indicated the substantial restoration of spirochete virulence and persistence throughout the mouse-tick infection cycle. The BB0323 protein may serve an indispensable physiological function that is more pronounced during microbial persistence and transitions between the host and the vector in vivo. Strategies to interfere with BB0323 function may interrupt the infectious cycle of spirochetes."

Serological testing was positive for Lyme disease. Parenteral ceftriaxone therapy was commenced. The patient's nerve paralysis showed complete recovery on the seventh day of antibiotic treatment; this was confirmed by videolaryngoscopy. Recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis is an extremely rare complication of neuroborreliosis associated with Lyme disease. In patients with recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis in whom the clinical history is uncertain and the usual diagnostic methods give negative results, screening with anti-borrelia immunoglobulin M is suggested."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, alters its gene expression in response to highly disparate environmental signals encountered in its hosts. Among the relatively few regulators of adaptive gene expression present in the borrelial genome is an open reading frame (ORF), BB0184, annotated as CsrA (carbon storage regulator A). CsrA, in several bacterial species, has been characterized as a small RNA binding protein that functions as a global regulator affecting mRNA stability or levels of translation of multiple ORFs. Consistent with known functions of CsrA, overexpression of CsrA from B. burgdorferi (CsrABb) in Escherichia coli resulted in reduced accumulation of glycogen. We determined that csrABb is part of the flgK motility operon and that the synthesis of CsrABb was increased when B. burgdorferi was propagated under fed-tick conditions. Overexpression of CsrABb in B. burgdorferi strain B31 (ML23, lp25-negative clonal isolate) resulted in a clone, designated ES25, which exhibited alterations in colony morphology and a significant reduction in the levels of FlaB. Several lipoproteins previously characterized as playing a role in infectivity were also altered in ES25. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA revealed significant differences in the transcriptional levels of ospC in ES25, while there were no such differences in the levels of other transcripts, suggesting posttranscriptional regulation of expression of these latter genes. These observations indicate that CsrABb plays a role in the regulation of expression of pathophysiological determinants of B. burgdorferi, and further characterization of CsrABb will help in better understanding of the regulators of gene expression in B. burgdorferi."

All ticks were collected manually with white cloth, from the grassland and searching for the hosts followed by detection of pathogens, with PCR. 1313 ticks identified, belonged to 1 family, 4 geniuses and 7 species in the three surveyed areas, with Dermacentor nuttallia distributed in the Ceke, Mandula and Manzhouli bordering ports. 69.08% of the total species were discovered at Port Ceke, with Rhipicephalus pumilio as the predominant one, which accounted for 74.86%. 5 kinds of tick-borne disease pathogens were detected from ticks in these three bordering ports while only Coxiella burnetii was found at the Port Ceke. In these three ports, the average infection rates of Lyme disease borrelia, Human babesia microti, Spotted fever group Rickettsia, Coxiella burnetii, Ehrlichiosis were 15.08%, 3.35%, 1.98%, 1.07%, 0.99% respectively. The positive rate of tick infected with Borrelia burgdorferi were 13.56%,22.88%,5.00% in the 3 bordering ports, respectively with significant differences. The positive rates of Babesia microti and Spotted fever group Rickettsia infections were also significantly different among these areas. The natural infection rates of the above mentioned five kinds of tick-borne pathogens were different in the Ports Ceke, Mandula and Manzhouli."

In the United States, the one-step C6 antibody test system based on the invariable domain IR6 of the VlsE molecule has been established as a successful diagnostic tool for testing canine samples. However, only a limited set of data are available regarding the antigenicity of the C6 peptides in an experimental murine model and sensitivity of the test regarding European Borrelia species. In order to investigate antibody reactions induced by these spirochetes, a total of 142 C3H/HeN mice were inoculated with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto N40, B. garinii PBi, two isolates of B. afzelii, B. spielmanii A14S, B. valaisiana Rio6, B. valaisiana VS116, or B. lusitaniae. Infection of the mice was documented utilizing tissue culture and PCR. The IR6 sequences of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31, B. garinii IP90, and two B. afzelii ACAI strains have been used to synthesize and test additional C6 peptides. Compared to the well-established two-tiered test system, the results indicate that single C6 peptides derived from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii can be used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based technique to detect murine antibodies induced by either agent. Little is known about the prevalence or pathogenicity of the B. afzelii strains in mammalian hosts, but our experimental data indicate differences in the C6 peptide test sensitivity for the detection of antibodies induced by different strains or isolates of B. afzelii."

Using a mechanistic model we investigated how transmission of the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, by Ixodes scapularis ticks amongst highly efficient reservoir mice is affected by varying the abundance of a less efficient reservoir host. Simulations indicated either amplification or dilution may occur, with the outcome depending precisely on mechanisms of competition, host contact rates with ticks, and acquired host resistance to ticks. Quantifying these mechanisms will be crucial to predicting how biodiversity affects Lyme disease risk."

		"abstract": "The distributional area of the tick Ixodes ricinus (L.), the primary European vector to humans of Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) and tick-borne encephalitis virus, appears to be increasing in Sweden. It is therefore important to determine which environmental factors are most useful to assess risk of human exposure to this tick and its associated pathogens. The geographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden was analysed with respect to vegetation zones and climate. The northern limit of I. ricinus and B. burgdorferi s.l. in Sweden corresponds roughly to the northern limit of the southern boreal vegetation zone, and is characterized climatically by snow cover for a mean duration of 150 days and a vegetation period averaging 170 days. The zoogeographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden can be classified as southerly-central, with the centre of the distribution south of the Limes Norrlandicus. Ixodes ricinus nymphs from 13 localities in different parts of Sweden were examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and found to be infected with Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii. Tick sampling localities were characterized on the basis of the density of Borrelia-infected I. ricinus nymphs, presence of specific mammals, dominant vegetation and climate. Densities of I. ricinus nymphs and Borrelia-infected nymphs were significantly correlated, and nymphal density can thus serve as a general indicator of risk for exposure to Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes. Analysis of data from this and other studies suggests that high densities of Borrelia-infected nymphs typically occur in coastal, broadleaf vegetation and in mixed deciduous/spruce vegetation in southern Sweden. Ixodes ricinus populations consistently infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. can occur in: (a) biotopes with shrews, rodents, hares and birds; (b) biotopes with shrews, rodents, hares, deer and birds, and (c) island locations where the varying hare (Lepus timidus) is the only mammalian tick host."

The differential diagnosis includes multiple well-known diseases including herpes, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis, Lyme disease, and others. However, clinician should be aware of emerging infectious agents as potential causes of systemic illness and also intraocular inflammation. Air travel, immigration, and globalization of business have overturned traditional pattern of geographic distribution of infectious diseases, and therefore one should work locally but think globally. This review recapitulates the systemic and ocular manifestations of several emergent infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist including Rickettsioses, West Nile virus infection, Rift valley fever, Dengue fever, and Chikungunya. Retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement have been associated with these emergent infectious diseases. The diagnosis of any of these infections is usually based on pattern of uveitis, systemic symptoms and signs, and specific epidemiological data and confirmed by detection of specific antibody in serum. A systematic ocular examination, showing fairly typical fundus findings, may help establish an early clinical diagnosis, which allows prompt, appropriate management."

		"abstract": "Since its first description in coastal Connecticut in 1976, both the incidence of Lyme disease and the geographic extent of endemic areas in the US have increased dramatically. The rapid expansion of Lyme disease into its current distribution in the eastern half of the US has been due to the range expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, upon which the causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi is dependent for transmission to humans. In this study, we examined the phylogeographic population structure of B. burgdorferi throughout the range of I. scapularis-borne Lyme disease using multilocus sequence typing based on bacterial housekeeping genes. We show that B. burgdorferi populations from the Northeast and Midwest are genetically distinct, but phylogenetically related. Our findings provide strong evidence of prehistoric population size expansion and east-to-west radiation of descendent clones from founding sequence types in the Northeast. Estimates of the time scale of divergence of northeastern and midwestern populations suggest that B. burgdorferi was present in these regions of North America many thousands of years before European settlements. We conclude that B. burgdorferi populations have recently reemerged independently out of separate relict foci, where they have persisted since precolonial times."

This inflammatory context could potentiate glial and neuronal apoptosis. We inoculated live B. burgdorferi into the cisterna magna of rhesus macaques and examined the inflammatory changes induced in the central nervous system (CNS), and dorsal root nerves and ganglia (DRG). ELISA of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed elevated IL-6, IL-8, CCL2, and CXCL13 as early as one week post-inoculation, accompanied by primarily lymphocytic and monocytic pleocytosis. In contrast, onset of the acquired immune response, evidenced by anti-B. burgdorferi C6 serum antibodies, was first detectable after 3 weeks post-inoculation. CSF cell pellets and CNS tissues were culture-positive for B. burgdorferi. Histopathology revealed signs of acute LNB: severe multifocal leptomeningitis, radiculitis, and DRG inflammatory lesions. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy detected B. burgdorferi antigen in the CNS and DRG. IL-6 was observed in astrocytes and neurons in the spinal cord, and in neurons in the DRG of infected animals. CCL2 and CXCL13 were found in microglia as well as in endothelial cells, macrophages and T cells. Importantly, the DRG of infected animals showed significant satellite cell and neuronal apoptosis. Our results support the notion that innate responses of glia to B. burgdorferi initiate/mediate the inflammation seen in acute LNB, and show that neuronal apoptosis occurs in this context."

B. burgdorferi adheres to host extracellular matrix components, including laminin. The results of our studies indicate that BmpA and its three paralogous proteins, BmpB, BmpC, and BmpD, all bind to mammalian laminin. BmpA did not bind mammalian type I or type IV collagens or fibronectin. BmpA-directed antibodies significantly inhibited the adherence of live B. burgdorferi to laminin. The laminin-binding domain of BmpA was mapped to the carboxy-terminal 80 amino acids. Solubilized collagen inhibited BmpA-laminin binding, suggesting interactions through the collagen-binding domains of laminin. These results, together with previous data, indicate that BmpA and its paralogs are targets for the development of preventative and curative therapies for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi lipoprotein Lp6.6 is a differentially produced spirochete antigen. An assessment of lp6.6 expression covering representative stages of the infectious cycle of spirochetes demonstrates that the gene is solely expressed during pathogen persistence in ticks. Deletion of lp6.6 in infectious B. burgdorferi did not influence in vitro growth, or its ability to persist and induce inflammation in mice, migrate to larval or nymphal ticks or survive through the larval-nymphal molt. However, Lp6.6-deficient spirochetes displayed significant impairment in their ability to transmit from infected ticks to naïve mice, which was restored upon genetic complementation of the mutant with a wild-type copy of lp6.6, establishing that Lp6.6 plays a role in pathogen transmission from ticks to mammals. Lp6.6 is a subsurface, yet highly abundant, outer membrane antigen. Two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE coupled with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis and protein cross-linking studies independently shows that Lp6.6 exists in multiple protein complexes in the outer membrane. We speculate that the function of Lp6.6 is connected to the physiological processes of these membrane complexes. Further characterization of differentially produced membrane antigens and associated protein complexes will likely aid in our understanding of the molecular details of B. burgdorferi persistence and transmission through a complex enzootic cycle."

These motors are rotary nanomachines that use the electrochemical potential from ion gradients. The motor can spin in both directions with specific proteins regulating the direction in response to chemotactic stimuli. Here we investigated the structure of flagellar motors of Borrelia spirochetes, the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans. We revealed the structure of the motor complex at 4.6-nm resolution by sub-volume averaging of cryo-electron tomograms and subsequently imposing rotational symmetry. This allowed direct visualisation of individual motor components, the connection between the stator and the peptidoglycan as well as filamentous linkers between the stator and the rod. Two different motor assemblies seem to co-exist at a single bacterial pole. While most motors were completely assembled, a smaller fraction appeared to lack part of the C-ring, which plays a role in protein export and switching the directionality of rotation. Our data suggest a novel mechanism that bacteria may use to control the direction of movement."

Instead, psychological factors likely exacerbate the persistent diffuse symptoms or \"Chronic Multisymptom Illness\" (CMI) incorrectly ascribed to an ongoing chronic infection with B. burgdorferi. The objective of this study was to assess the medical and psychiatric status of such patients and compare these findings to those from patients without CMI. There were 240 consecutive patients who underwent medical evaluation and were screened for clinical disorders (eg, depression and anxiety) with diagnoses confirmed by structured clinical interviews at an academic Lyme disease referral center in New Jersey. Personality disorders, catastrophizing, and negative and positive affect also were evaluated, and all factors were compared between groups and with functional outcomes. Of our sample, 60.4% had symptoms that could not be explained by current Lyme disease or another medical condition other than CMI. After adjusting for age and sex, clinical disorders were more common in CMI than in the comparison group (P <.001, odds ratio 3.54, 95% confidence interval, 1.97-6.55), but personality disorders were not significantly more common. CMI patients had higher negative affect, lower positive affect, and a greater tendency to catastrophize pain (P <.001) than did the comparison group. Except for personality disorders, all psychological factors were related to worse functioning. Our explanatory model based on these factors was confirmed. Psychiatric comorbidity and other psychological factors are prominent in the presentation and outcome of some patients who inaccurately ascribe longstanding symptoms to \"chronic Lyme disease.\""

		"abstract": "Vectors of infectious diseases are generally thought to be regulated by abiotic conditions such as climate or the availability of specific hosts or habitats. In this study we tested whether blacklegged ticks, the vectors of Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis and babesiosis can be regulated by the species of vertebrate hosts on which they obligately feed. By subjecting field-caught hosts to parasitism by larval blacklegged ticks, we found that some host species (e.g. opossums, squirrels) that are abundantly parasitized in nature kill 83-96% of the ticks that attempt to attach and feed, while other species are more permissive of tick feeding. Given natural tick burdens we document on these hosts, we show that some hosts can kill thousands of ticks per hectare. These results indicate that the abundance of tick vectors can be regulated by the identity of the hosts upon which these vectors feed. By simulating the removal of hosts from intact communities using empirical models, we show that the loss of biodiversity may exacerbate disease risk by increasing both vector numbers and vector infection rates with a zoonotic pathogen."

		"abstract": "The impact of climate change on vector-borne infectious diseases is currently controversial. In Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK. Theories for this include climate change and increasing host abundance. This study aimed to test how I. ricinus tick abundance might be influenced by climate change in Scotland by using altitudinal gradients as a proxy, while also taking into account the effects of hosts, vegetation and weather effects. It was predicted that tick abundance would be higher at lower altitudes (i.e. warmer climates) and increase with host abundance. Surveys were conducted on nine hills in Scotland, all of open moorland habitat. Tick abundance was positively associated with deer abundance, but even after taking this into account, there was a strong negative association of ticks with altitude. This was probably a real climate effect, with temperature (and humidity, i.e. saturation deficit) most likely playing an important role. It could be inferred that ticks may become more abundant at higher altitudes in response to climate warming. This has potential implications for pathogen prevalence such as louping ill virus if tick numbers increase at elevations where competent transmission hosts (red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus and mountain hares Lepus timidus) occur in higher numbers."

Two key enzymes in purine salvage pathways are IMP dehydrogenase (GuaB) and GMP synthase (GuaA), encoded by the guaB and guaA genes, respectively. While these genes are typically found on the chromosome in most bacterial pathogens, the guaAB operon of Borrelia burgdorferi is present on plasmid cp26, which also harbors a number of genes critical for B. burgdorferi viability. Using molecular genetics and an experimental model of the tick-mouse infection cycle, we demonstrate that the enzymatic activities encoded by the guaAB operon are essential for B. burgdorferi mouse infectivity and provide a growth advantage to spirochetes in the tick. These data indicate that the GuaA and GuaB proteins are critical for the survival of B. burgdorferi in the infection cycle and highlight a potential difference in the requirements for purine salvage in the disparate mammalian and tick environments."

Ticks were collected from vegetation in areas treated with the \"4-Poster\" device and from control areas over a 6-year period in five geographically diverse study locations in the Northeastern United States and tested for infection with two known agents of human disease, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and for a novel relapsing fever-group spirochete related to Borrelia miyamotoi. Overall, 38.2% of adults and 12.5% of nymphs were infected with B. burgdorferi; 8.5% of adults and 4.2% of nymphs were infected with A. phagocytophilum; and 1.9% of adults and 0.8% of nymphs were infected with B. miyamotoi. In most cases, treatment with the 4-Poster device was not associated with changes in the prevalence of infection with any of these three microorganisms among nymphal or adult ticks. However, the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi, and consequently the entomologic risk for Lyme disease, was reduced overall by 68% in treated areas compared to control areas among the five study sites at the end of the study. The frequency of bacterial coinfections in ticks was generally equal to the product of the proportion of ticks infected with a single bacterium, indicating that enzootic maintenance of these pathogens is independent. We conclude that controlling ticks on deer by self-application of acaricide results in an overall decrease in the human risk for exposure to these three bacterial agents, which is due solely to a reduction in tick density."

Although reductions in the abundance of all life-stages of Ixodes scapularis were the measured outcomes, this study focused on metrics associated with I. scapularis nymphal tick densities as this measure has consistently proven to directly correlate with human risk of acquiring Lyme disease. Since independent tick sampling schemes were undertaken at each of the five environmentally distinct study locations, a meta-analytic approach permitted estimation of a single true control-effect size for each treatment year of the NEATCP. The control-effect is expressed as the annual percent I. scapularis nymphal control most consistent with meta-analysis data for each treatment year. Our meta-analyses indicate that by the sixth treatment year, the NEATCP effectively reduced the relative density of I. scapularis nymphs by 71% on the 5.14 km(2) treatment sites, corresponding to a 71% lower relative entomologic risk index for acquiring Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "From 1998-2002 twenty-five deer self-treatment devices (4-Posters), using 2% amitraz, were operated at three locations in Maryland to determine their effectiveness in controlling blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, and lone star ticks, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Each treatment site was approximately 518 ha and paired with a similar site lacking 4-Posters. Locations varied in deer density, tick abundance, and land use. Flagging for host-seeking ticks showed declines in tick populations at all treatment sites compared to control sites by the third year. By 2002, control of I. scapularis nymphs attributable to the 4-Poster intervention at the three sites was 69.0%, 75.8%, and 80%. Control of A. americanum nymphs at the two sites where they occurred was 99.5% and 95.3%. In 2003, the first posttreatment year, control of I. scapularis remained around 2001-2002 levels, but by 2004, an upward trend in nymphal numbers was detectable. Populations of A. americanum showed no increase posttreatment. These results demonstrate that control of these tick species is locally possible with 4-Poster intervention."

Corn consumption and acaricide levels for each device were monitored weekly during each treatment season to assess the degree of deer use. The efficacy of acaricide treatment was determined by comparing relative blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) densities in the 4-Poster treatment site to a separate, similar-sized nontreatment area. The tendency of white-tailed deer to use the 4-Poster was variable temporally, and appeared to be largely dependent on the availability of alternative food sources. Total corn consumption was nearly fourfold lower during large oak masting years when compared with no/low mast years. Moreover, habitat characteristics, such as the presence of maintained hay lands consisting of alfalfa and clover, also appeared to influence the frequency and amount of 4-Poster use. After 2 years of adequate treatment (nearly 12,000 kg of corn consumed), we achieved nearly 50% control of nymphal blacklegged ticks within the treatment site compared with tick abundance levels in the nontreated area. Moreover, that level of tick control was maintained for 1 year after removal of the 4-Poster devices but began to wane 2 years after treatment ended."

		"abstract": "The efficacy of topically treating white-tailed deer with an acaricide was evaluated in a Lyme disease-endemic community of southern New York State. Twenty-four 4-Poster feeders were placed in a 5.2 km(2) treatment area in Bedford, NY, while a site in Lewisboro, NY, 4.8 km distant, served as control. Treatment periods ran from 15 September to 15 December each fall from 1997 to 2001, and from 15 March to 15 May each spring from 1998 to 2002. Corn consumption averaged 15,779 kg in fall sessions and 9054 kg in spring sessions, and a mean of 89.6% of deer in the study area showed evidence of using the feeders. Deer densities, estimated by aerial snow counts, averaged 22 and 28 deer per km(2) in Bedford and Lewisboro, respectively, over a 3-year period. Significant reductions in tick numbers on deer captured in the treatment area were noted in fall 1999 compared to deer captured at the control site. Drag sampling for nymphal host-seeking ticks indicated 63.6% control in 2001, which dropped to 54.8% the following year, but reached 80% in 2003. Higher-than-normal acorn production in 2001 that likely caused a drop in deer visitation to the feeders may have reduced efficacy against larval ticks in 2002. The 4-Poster effectively reduced the density of Ixodes scapularis, though the level of control is dependent on environmental factors that affect feeding behavior of white-tailed deer."

As part of a 5-year project from 1997 to 2002, 21-24 of the 4-Posters were distributed at residential sites in Old Lyme, CT, in a core treatment area of approximately 5.2 km(2) in fall 1997. The 4-Posters were active October to mid-December and March into May, corresponding to the peak periods of activity for adult Ixodes scapularis in this particular area. Corn consumption ranged from 361 to 4789 kg/month for October and November and 696-3130 kg/month during April. Usage of 4-Posters by deer generally was high (>90%), except during acorn masts in fall 1998 and 2001. Amitraz was applied by rollers at the estimated rate of 1.3 g active ingredient/ha/year. The abundance of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs declined significantly (p < 0.001) in the core treatment area, as compared to a control community in Old Saybrook, CT, through 2004, over the project period from 1998 to 2003, from 9.3/100m(2) to 0.97/100m(2), rising to 1.90/100m(2) in 2004. From 1999 through 2003, there were 46.1%, 49.6%, 63.4%, 64.6%, and 70.2% reductions, respectively, in the nymphal tick population in comparison with the untreated community and initial tick abundance in 1998. Control of I. scapularis adults declined to only 19.1% in 2004; 2 years after the treatment of deer was discontinued. Differences in nymphal tick abundance between the control and core treatment area were significant in 1999 (p = 0.042) and highly significant in 2001 (p < 0.001) and 2002 (p = 0.002). The passive topical application to deer of the acaricide amitraz resulted in a significant decrease in the population of free-living I. scapularis nymphs in the treated core in Connecticut."

Cultivation of different Borrelia spp. from 12 erythema migrans biopsies, from 2 blood, one liquor and one placenta sample in BSK-H medium was successful. Adapted conventional methods targeting 16S rRNA and OspA genes for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and partial sequencing of these genes together with microscopical examinations of the blood smears provided a direct detection of the B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi, B. garinii, B. valaisiana and B. bissettii in the skin, B. garinii in the blood, placenta and liquor in 24 (36.3 %) patients, and A. phagocytophilum in 10 (15 %) patients with erythema migrans. Positive indirect IgM immunofluorescence against Anaplasma sp. was obtained in 7 cases, specific IgG antibodies were detected in 12 patients. Three women suffering from erythema migrans in the first trimester had positive PCR for Anaplasma and/or for Borrelia in the blood and two of them, later, in the placenta. Interpretation of laboratory data can bring important contribution to establishing the role of Anaplasma sp. in erythema migrans and forming the principle of precaution with laboratory diagnosis during pregnancy which always should be reflected in the resistance of Anaplasma sp. toward penicillins."

We followed patients treated for neuroborreliosis prospectively, and assessed outcome by a composite clinical score. The impact on outcome of clinical, demographic and laboratory factors were analyzed by univariate analyses and logistic regression. Out of 85 patients 41 (48%) had remaining complaints; 14 had objective findings and 27 subjective symptoms. Remaining complaints were associated with pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks (OR = 4.062, P = 0.044), high pre-treatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count (OR = 1.005, P = 0.001), and female gender (OR = 3.218, P = 0.025). Presence of CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) was not analyzed in the logistic regression model due to many missing observations, but was found to be more frequent both pre-treatment (P = 0.004) and after 12 months (P = 0.015) among patients with remaining complaints as compared to patients with complete recovery. Further evaluation showed that objective remaining findings, and not subjective symptoms, were associated with pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks. No difference in outcome was observed between patients treated with IV ceftriaxone and patients treated with oral doxycycline. Remaining complaints are common after neuroborreliosis. The majority of the complaints are subjective. Pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks, high pre-treatment CSF cell count, and female gender seem to be risk factors for remaining complaints. Presence of CSF OCBs may also predict a non-favorable outcome, but this should be further studied. Whether subjective and objective complaints are associated with different risk factors is also an issue for future studies."

Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence."

Uveitis was found in 693 patients: 335 men (48.3%) and 358 women (51.7%). The mean age for the first presentation was 31.7 +/- 18.3 years. Unilateral (73.4%), acute (68.3%), posterior (35.9%) and non-granulomatous (90.6%) were the most common types of uveitis found in the sample. Toxoplasmosis was the most frequent cause in this study followed in order by idiopathic and toxocariasis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada, Behçet's disease, sarcoidosis and white dot syndromes were less common. Some causes such as systemic lupus erythematosus and tuberculosis were extremely rare. Presumed ocular histoplasmosis, onchocerciasis and Lyme disease were absent. The results of this study provide the first report of clinical patterns for uveitis in Colombia. This study will enhance awareness of uveitis, and data should assist in the development of public health policies in our population for the improvement of patient outcomes."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever has the highest incidence of any bacterial disease in Africa and a massive epidemic potential due to current political turmoil in the Horn of Africa. This review focuses on recent advances in diagnostics, molecular biology and host-pathogen interactions. Complete relapsing fever genomes have recently been published, and the first site-specific genetic knockout complementation has been performed. Relapsing fever has gone from being a neglected disease to garnering interest in aspects such as tissue invasion, membrane biochemistry and complement evasion. Relapsing fever symptoms are variable, and the disease is commonly misdiagnosed as, for example, malaria. Although relapsing fever is considered a transient disease, it persists as a residual infection in the brain, which can be reactivated on immunosuppression. Therefore, single-dose antibiotic treatment should be avoided. Instead, treatment should cover a longer period, similar to the recommended regime for Lyme disease. Relapsing fever is a common cause of pregnancy complications such as intrauterine growth retardation and placental damage with spirochaetes crossing the maternal-foetal barrier, resulting in congenital infection. Although relapsing fever remains a big problem, recently described host-pathogen interactions, diagnostics and molecular biology advances such as completed genome sequences and the dawn of genetic tools have brought relapsing fever research into the 21st century."

The goals of this study were to assess the ligand binding capability of CspZ orthologs derived from an extensive panel of human Lyme disease isolates and to further define the molecular basis of the interaction between FH and CspZ. While most B. burgdorferi CspZ orthologs analyzed bound FH, specific, naturally occurring polymorphisms, most of which clustered in a specific loop domain of CspZ, prevented FH binding in some orthologs. Sequence analyses also revealed the existence of CspZ phyletic groups that correlate with FH binding and with the relationships inferred from ribosomal spacer types (RSTs). CspZ type 1 (RST1) and type 3 (RST3) strains bind FH, while CspZ type 2 (RST2) strains do not. Antibody responses to CspZ were also assessed. Anti-CspZ antibodies were detected in mice by week 2 of infection, indicating that there was expression during early-stage infection. Analyses of sera collected from infected mice suggested that CspZ production continued over the course of long-term infection as the antibody titer increased over time. While antibody to CspZ was detected in several human Lyme disease serum samples, the response was not universal, and the titers were generally low. Vaccination studies with mice demonstrated that while CspZ is immunogenic, it does not elicit an antibody that is protective or that inhibits dissemination. The data presented here provide significant new insight into the interaction between CspZ and FH and suggest that there is a correlation between CspZ production and dissemination. However, in spite of its possible contributory role in pathogenesis, the immunological analyses indicated that CspZ is likely to have limited potential as a diagnostic marker and vaccine candidate for Lyme disease."

As a complement regulatory subunit, fH serves as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. fH binding by Borrelia has been correlated with pathogenesis as well as with host diversity. Here we show the differential binding of borrelial proteins to fH from human and animal sera. Affinity ligand binding experiments, 2-D electrophoresis, and protein identification and peptide de novo sequencing based on mass spectrometry, revealed novel fH putative binding proteins of Lyme- and relapsing fever Borrelia. An OspA serotype-associated differential human and animal fH binding by B. garinii was also observed, which could be related with the ability of some strains from serotypes 4 and 7 to invade non-nervous system tissues. Also, the variable affinity of binding proteins expressed by different Borrelia to animal fH correlated with their host selectivity. The novel animal and human putative fH binding proteins (FHBPs) in this study underscore the importance of evasion of complement in the pathogenesis of Borrelia infections."

In two centres, 26 patients with BFP were identified by CSF and serological criteria. The control group (patients with IFP) consisted of 59 patients from one of the centres in whom BFP was excluded by CSF examination. AFP patients of both centres are routinely questioned about taste disorders according to the hospitals' standards. A taste disorder was found in 46% of the IFP and 31% of the BFP cases (not significant). About one-third of the BFP patients complained of radicular or back pain.

A total of eight tick species were identified: Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Dermacentor nitens, Amblyomma cajennense, Amblyomma oblongoguttatum, Amblyomma ovale, Amblyomma parvum and Amblyomma tigrinum. The last four species were described for the first time in this region. Although human parasitism by ticks is frequently described in Goiatins, no ticks collected from humans were analyzed.

		"abstract": "Despite resolution of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease after antibiotic treatment, a minority of patients have fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and/or difficulties with concentration or short-term memory of uncertain etiology; these are called post-Lyme disease symptoms or, in more severe cases, post-Lyme disease syndrome or \"chronic Lyme disease.\" Several recent studies in which Borrelia burgdorferi-infected animals were treated with antibiotic therapy have demonstrated the presence of PCR positivity for B. burgdorferi DNA in the absence of culture positivity. In mice that were treated with antibiotic therapy, residual spirochetes could be taken up by ticks during a blood meal and could be transmitted to SCID mice. These spirochetes are attenuated; their presence is not associated with either inflammation or disease. In this review the methodology and findings of these studies are critically analyzed, and the significance of the results with regard to human Lyme disease is evaluated, with special emphasis on whether these studies provide useful insights into post-Lyme disease syndrome. A serious methodological concern is the failure to consider the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic properties of the antibiotic in choosing the dosage regimen used. We conclude that there is no scientific evidence to support the hypothesis that such spirochetes, should they exist in humans, are the cause of post-Lyme disease syndrome."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne zoonosis in North America, is caused by the spirochetal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. The telomere resolvase encoded by this organism (ResT) promotes the formation of covalently closed hairpin ends on the linear DNA molecules of B. burgdorferi through a two-step transesterification. ResT is essential for survival and is therefore an attractive target for the development of highly specific antiborrelial drugs. To identify ResT inhibitors, a novel fluorescence-based high-throughput assay was developed and used to screen a library of 27,520 small-molecule drug-like compounds. Six confirmed inhibitors of ResT, with 50% inhibitory concentrations between 2 and 10 muM, were identified. The inhibitors were characterized further and were grouped into three distinct classes based on their inhibitory features. The high-throughput screening assay developed in this paper, along with the six inhibitory compounds identified, provides a starting point for the future development of novel antiborrelial drugs as well as small-molecule inhibitors that will be helpful for the further dissection of the reaction mechanism."

A 32-month prospective age- and neighborhood-matched case-control study was conducted in Connecticut to evaluate the effects of peridomestic prevention measures on risk of Lyme disease. The study was conducted in 24 disease-endemic Connecticut communities from 2005 to 2007. Subjects were interviewed by telephone using a questionnaire designed to elicit disease-prevention measures during the month prior to the case onset of erythema migrans. Data were analyzed in 2008 by conditional logistic regression. Potential confounders, such as occupational/recreational exposures, were examined. Between April 2005 and November 2007, interviews were conducted with 364 participants with Lyme disease, and 349 (96%) were matched with a suitable control. Checking for ticks within 36 hours of spending time in the yard at home was protective against Lyme disease (OR=0.55; 95% CI=0.32, 0.94). Bathing within 2 hours after spending time in the yard was also protective (OR=0.42; 95% CI=0.23, 0.78). Fencing of any type or height in the yard, whether it was contiguous or not, was protective (OR=0.54; 95% CI=0.33, 0.90). No other landscape modifications or features were significantly protective against Lyme disease. The results of this study suggest that practical activities such as checking for ticks and bathing after spending time in the yard may reduce the risk of Lyme disease in regions where peridomestic risk is high. Fencing did appear to protect against infection, but the mechanism of its protection is unclear."

Two pairs of nested PCR primers were used to amplify the gene encoding the Osp-A protein of B. burgdorfer under standard PCR condition. In a two stage procedure, nested PCR yielded a positive reaction for five tested strains of B. burgdorferi. None the strains including B. hermsii, E. coli and T. pallidum showed positive reaction when used as control strains in PCR. In conclusion, nested PCR showed acceptable specificity for rapid detection ofB. burgdorferi."

OspC induces a potent early immune response and is also one of the most diverse proteins in the Borrelia proteome. Yet, at least 70% of the amino acid sequence is conserved among all 21 known OspC types. We performed a series of comprehensive seroprofiling studies to select the OspC types that have the most cross-reactive immunodominant epitopes. We found that proteins belonging to seven OspC types detect antibodies from all three infected host species regardless of the OspC genotype of the infecting strain. Although no one OspC type identifies all seropositive human samples, combinations of as few as two OspC proteins identified all patients that had anti-OspC antibodies."

		"abstract": "In the wake of controversies surrounding the usefulness of PCR in the diagnostics of borreliosis, the aim of the presented study was to monitor the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in dogs with clinical borreliosis in the course of relevant treatment. The monitoring was based on detecting borrelia's DNA before- (study I), during- (study II), and after completion of the therapy (study III). In addition, to rule out possible coinfections, the dogs' blood was examined for the presence of anaplasma, babesia and rickettsia. Blood samples taken from 11 dogs, with clinically detected borreliosis, were used for obtaining DNA for PCR. Positive results of PCR, with primers complementary to the fla gene, indicating the presence of DNA of B. burgdorferi s.l., were noted, in study I, in the blood of 7 dogs (63.6% dogs), in study II in 3 dogs, while in study III all blood samples were negative. In 6 out of 7 PCR+, the first study was carried out during week 1. Therefore, the PCR method is useful for monitoring early canine infections with spirochetes B. burgdorferi s.l. In all positive samples, subjected to PCR-RFLP, it was the case of a single genospecies, i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Studies for the presence of DNA of Babesia sp., as well as DNA of Ricettsia helvetica, were negative in all samples. Anaplasma phagocytophilum DNA was detected in the blood of a single dog, and only in study I. The same dog also proved positive for the presence of borrelia DNA. Co-occurrence of both pathogens did not disturb the clinical picture of borreliosis, and the administered treatment was also effective for the mixed infection."

		"abstract": "The life transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi requires migration of spirochetes from tick's gut to its salivary glands during vertebrate's blood sucking, penetrating to the vertebrate's tissues and their colonization. A special feature of these bacteria, despite its relatively small genome, is the ability to adapt in different host environments. These unusual properties of borreliae are associated with large number of plasmids, which show a high variability as a result of recombination with each other. Changes in the synthesis of outer proteins are the first strategy of borreliae in avoiding the destructive effect of the host's immune system. Then, by colonizing tissues, they initiate production of Erp and CRASP proteins, which bind regulators and components of complement and repress the cytolytic effect of the host's serum. Some evidences indicate that the spirochetes use quorum sensing as a mechanism to control protein expression. B. burgdorferi probably utilizes a LuxS/autoinducer-2-dependent quorum sensing mechanism. However, it is not yet known how B. burgdorferi detect AI-2. Analysis of the results of expression studies of the luxS gene shows that the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon in B. burgdorferi are only fragmentarily known. Continuation of quorum sensing studies may be essential in improving the construction of vaccines as well as therapy of Lyme disease."

False-positive microbiologic results can lead to unnecessary antibiotic treatment, which even in genuine cases is sometimes unnecessarily prolonged. This review addresses new research on diagnosis, treatment, and eco-epidemiology. Recent research work in Europe since the last annual review has mostly dealt with diagnostic concepts. Improvement of serology has been achieved by use of multiple recombinant or peptide antigens, or of just the most frequently targeted antigen for detection of specific immunoglobulin G or immunoglobulin M antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. Concerning management of the disease, early work on the efficacy of oral treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis has been confirmed. Studies on the ecology of the vectors and pathogens have elucidated aspects of epidemiology. Widespread awareness of Lyme borreliosis in Europe continues to grow due to increasing numbers of medical publications, information on the Internet, and from the media and patient support groups. The emphasis in scientific and medical publications has been on improvements in laboratory diagnostics, confirmation of therapeutic protocols, and the ecology of the vectors and pathogens."

OspC type K strains, which are 16S-23S ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type 2 (RST2) strains, are most commonly recovered, but a higher percentage of OspC type A strains (RST1), the next most commonly recovered type, is detectable in blood. The goal of this study was to determine the B burgdorferi genotypes in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis. Joint fluid samples from 124 patients seen over a 30-year period were analyzed for OspC types by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, and for RSTs by nested PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. These results were correlated with clinical outcome. OspC and RST genotypes were identified in 49 of the 124 joint fluid samples (40%). In these 49 samples, OspC type K strains (RST2) were identified in 21 samples (43%), OspC type A strains (RST1) were identified in 11 samples (22%), and 8 other OspC types and all 3 RSTs were identified among the remaining 17 samples (35%). However, among the 17 patients who had been treated with antibiotics according to current guidelines, all 7 patients who were infected with RST1 strains had antibiotic-refractory arthritis, compared with 4 of 6 patients infected with RST2 strains and only 1 of 4 infected with RST3 strains (P = 0.03). Most of the B burgdorferi genotypes, particularly OspC type K (RST2), were identified in the joint fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis, and the genotype frequencies found in joints reflected those in EM skin lesions. However, RST1 strains were most frequent in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Our results help to further the understanding of the differential pathogenicity of strains of B burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most frequent tick-borne infectious disease in Europe. The discovery of the causative pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi in 1982 opened the way for the firm diagnosis of diseases in several clinical disciplines and for causal antibiotic therapy. At the same time, speculation regarding links between Borrelia infection and a variety of nonspecific symptoms and disorders resulted in overdiagnosis and overtreatment of suspected Lyme disease. The authors conducted a selective review of the literature, including various national and international guidelines. The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is present in approximately 5% to 35% of sheep ticks (Ixodes ricinus) in Germany, depending on the region. In contrast to North America, different genospecies are found in Europe. The most frequent clinical manifestation of Borrelia infection is erythema migrans, followed by neuroborreliosis, arthritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and lymphocytosis benigna cutis. Diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical symptoms, and in stages II and III by detection of Borrelia-specific antibodies. In adults erythema migrans is treated with doxycycline, in children with amoxicillin. The standard treatment of neuroborreliosis is third-generation cephalosporins. After appropriate antibiotic therapy, the outcome is favorable. In approximately 95% of cases neuroborreliosis is cured without long-term sequelae. When chronic borreliosis is suspected, other potential causes of the clinical syndrome must be painstakingly excluded."

In this paper four types of infections are reviewed, and the efficacy of preventive initiatives is discussed. The paper is based on literature retrieved from a non-systemic search in PubMed. Hepatitis B infection was more prevalent among orienteers before they were obliged to use protective clothing. In the 1980s, there was an increase of sudden unexpected death among young Swedish orienteers. Bartonella infection was later suggested as an underlying cause. No unexpected deaths have occurred among young orienteers after 1992 when specific advice was given regarding training and competitions. Orienteers do not seem to be affected by lyme borreliosis or tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) more often than others, but only two old studies have been performed. Orienteers may be at risk of acquiring infection from lyme borreliosis and TBE in Norway in the future, as the incidence of these contagions is increasing. Norwegian medical personnel should consider TBE vaccination of orienteers and others who wander in areas with a high prevalence of infected ticks."

		"abstract": "Linear genome stability requires specialized telomere replication and protection mechanisms. A common solution to this problem in non-eukaryotes is the formation of hairpin telomeres by telomere resolvases (also known as protelomerases). These enzymes perform a two-step transesterification on replication intermediates to generate hairpin telomeres using an active site similar to that of tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. Unlike phage telomere resolvases, the telomere resolvase from the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi (ResT) is a permissive enzyme that resolves several types of telomere in vitro. However, the ResT region and residues mediating permissive substrate usage have not been identified. The relapsing fever Borrelia hermsii ResT exhibits a more restricted substrate usage pattern than B. burgdorferi ResT and cannot efficiently resolve a Type 2 telomere. In this study, we determined that all relapsing fever ResTs process Type 2 telomeres inefficiently. Using a library of chimeric and mutant B. hermsii/B. burgdorferi ResTs, we mapped the determinants in B. burgdorferi ResT conferring the ability to resolve multiple Type 2 telomeres. Type 2 telomere resolution was dependent on a single proline in the ResT catalytic region that was conserved in all Lyme disease but not relapsing fever ResTs and that is part of a 2-amino acid insertion absent from phage telomere resolvase sequences. The identification of a permissive substrate usage determinant explains the ability of B. burgdorferi ResT to process the 19 unique telomeres found in its segmented genome and will aid further studies on the structure and function of this essential enzyme."

Data from all Highland samples tested during 2004-2006 were analysed according to result and patient's residence in relation to the eight fold Scottish Executive's urban/rural classification, and distance from woodland. In total, 1602 patients were tested for Lyme disease, 0.71% of the Highland population. From these, 104 (6.5%) were seropositive. There were more patients tested, and seropositive patients from rural than urban locations, 1113 vs 489, and 79 vs 25 respectively. There were also significantly more seropositive patients per patients tested from rural locations (chi2, p<0.0001). The number of patients tested and seropositive patients increased as the rural areas become more remote. The likelihood of being tested for Lyme disease also increased as the distance between a patient's residence and woodland decreased. The relative risk of being tested elevated by 74% for those patients living within 200 metres of woodland. Those living in the most rural areas of Highland and those living closest to woodland have an increased risk of being tested and having Lyme disease."

Several climate models predict a global warming of 1.4 degrees C up to 5.8 degrees C until the year 2100, and as climate-typical temperature barriers restrict the distribution of the vectors, especially arthropod-borne diseases are strongly influenced by the climate.

To determine if the population of patients with chronic Lyme disease differs from the populations of patients with either Lyme disease or post-Lyme disease syndrome by examining the gender of patients with these diagnoses. Data on gender were compiled in this cross-sectional study based on a systematic review of published studies of antibiotic treatment in United States patients with post-Lyme disease syndrome (n = 184) or chronic Lyme disease (n = 490), and on cases of adults with Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 2003 to 2005 (n = 43,282). Patients with chronic Lyme disease were significantly more likely to be female than were patients diagnosed with either Lyme disease (odds ratio [OR] 2.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.98-2.94, p < 0.0001) or with post-Lyme disease syndrome (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.62-3.34, p < 0.0001). Patients with chronic Lyme disease differ with regard to gender from those with either B. burgdorferi infection or post-Lyme disease syndrome. This finding suggests that illnesses with a female preponderance, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, or depression, may be misdiagnosed as chronic Lyme disease."

The study group consisted of 10 patients with chronic Lyme arthritis (age 18 - 74 y), 13 with rheumatoid arthritis (age 32 - 70 y) and 10 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (age 8 - 17 y). The control group consisted of 9 healthy volunteers (age 24 - 62 y). The activity of the exoglycosidases was determined with the p-nitrophenyl derivatives of sugars as substrates. A significant increase of the activity of all the exoglycosidases in serum and in synovial fluid of the patients with different forms of arthritis was found. The ratio of synovial fluid/serum activity of exoglycosidases was above 2.0 in LA but not in JIA and RA patients. As the main source of exoglycosidases in the joint is the synovial membrane, this result supports the appropriateness of therapeutic synovectomy in chronic Lyme arthritis with knee effusion. The serum activity of hexosaminidase may be used in monitoring the course of Lyme arthritis and the efficiency of treatment."

		"abstract": "Borrelia garinii, a causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in Europe and Asia, is naturally maintained in marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles, which primarily involve birds, including seabirds and migratory passerines. These bird groups associate with, correspondingly, Ixodes uriae and Ixodes ricinus ticks, of which the latter species may bite and transmit the infection to humans. Studies of the overlap between these two natural cycles of B. garinii have been limited, in part due to the absence of representative collections of this spirochete's samples, as well as of the lack of reliable measure of the genetic heterogeneity of its strains. As a prerequisite for understanding the epidemiological correlates of the complex maintenance of B. garinii, the present study sought to assess the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of this species' strains from its natural hosts and patients with Lyme borreliosis from subarctic Eurasia. We used sequence typing of the partial rrs-rrl intergenic spacer (IGS) of archived and prospective samples of B. garinii from I. uriae ticks collected predominantly on Commander Islands in North Pacific, as well as on the islands in northern Sweden and arctic Norway. We also typed B. garinii samples from patients with Lyme borreliosis and I. ricinus ticks infesting migratory birds in southern Sweden, or found questing in selected sites on the islands in the Baltic Sea and Lithuania. Fifty-two (68%) of 77 B. garinii samples representing wide geographical range and associated with I. ricinus and infection of humans contributed 12 (60%) of total 20 identified IGS variants. In contrast, the remaining 25 (32%) samples recovered from I. uriae ticks from a few islands accounted for as many as 10 (50%) IGS types, suggesting greater local diversity of B. garinii maintained by seabirds and their ticks. Two IGS variants of the spirochete in common for both tick species were found in I. ricinus larvae from migratory birds, an indication that B. garinii strains are exchanged between different ecological niches. Notably, B. garinii variants associated with I. uriae ticks were found in each of the six clusters, representing two phylogenetic lineages of this species identified among the studied samples. Our findings suggest that B. garinii in subarctic Eurasia comprises two partially overlapping populations with different levels of genetic heterogeneity, presumably, due to distinctive selective pressures on the spirochete in its marine and terrestrial enzootic cycles."

		"abstract": "Microbial pathogens have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for evasion of host innate and adaptive immunities. PFam54 is the largest paralogous gene family in the genomes of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease bacterium. One member of PFam54, the complement-regulator acquiring surface proteins 1 (BbCrasp-1), is able to abort the alternative pathway of complement activation via binding human complement-regulator factor H (FH). The gene coding for BbCRASP-1 exists in a tandem array of PFam54 genes in the B. burgdorferi genome, a result apparently of repeated gene duplications. To help elucidate the functions of the large number of PFam54 genes, we performed phylogenomic and structural analyses of the PFam54 gene array from ten B. burgdorferi genomes. Analyses based on gene tree, genome synteny, and structural models revealed rapid adaptive evolution of this array through gene duplication, gene loss, and functional diversification. Individual PFam54 genes, however, do not show high intra-population sequence polymorphisms as genes providing evasion from adaptive immunity generally do. PFam54 members able to bind human FH are not monophyletic, suggesting that human FH affinity, however strong, is an incidental rather than main function of these PFam54 proteins. The large number of PFam54 genes existing in any single B. burgdorferi genome may target different innate-immunity proteins of a single host species or the same immune protein of a variety of host species. Genetic variability of the PFam54 gene array suggests that universally present PFam54 lineages such as BBA64, BBA65, BBA66, and BBA73 may be better candidates for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines or drugs than strain-restricted lineages such as BbCRASP-1."

However, Borrelia aggregates remain poorly characterized, and their functional significance is unknown. Here we have characterized Borrelia aggregates using microscopy and flow cytometry. Borrelia aggregation was temperature, pH, and growth phase dependent. Environmental conditions (high temperature, low pH, and high cell density) favorable for aggregation were similar to the conditions that increased the expression of B. burgdoferi genes, such as outer surface protein C (ospC), that are regulated by the RpoN/RpoS sigma factors. Experiments were conducted to determine if there is a relationship between aggregation and gene regulation through the RpoN/RpoS pathway. ospC Transcript levels were similar between aggregates and free cells. Moreover, no differences were observed in aggregate formation when null mutants of rpoS, rpoN, or ospC were compared to wild-type spirochetes. These results indicated that, despite the similar external signals that promoted aggregation and the RpoN/RpoS pathway, the two processes were not linked at the molecular level. The methods developed here to study B. burgdorferi aggregates will be useful for further studies on spirochete aggregates."

Based on patterns of genetic structure previously found, we explicitly tested whether adults of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus pair according to their genetic relatedness. We sampled tick pairs from the vegetation in four natural populations and genotyped individual ticks at seven microsatellite loci. Based on this data, we observed highly significant assortative mating in two of the four locations, a pattern that could not be accounted for by a spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of related ticks. One explanation for these observations may be the existence of local host associations that develop independently in different populations. Assortative mating in I. ricinus will have clear consequences for its population dynamics and, through processes of adaptation and transmission, may significantly alter the epidemiological patterns of the pathogens it carries, including the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Future tests will now be required to examine the mechanisms leading to this pattern and its epidemiological consequences."

In this study, we reveal the mechanisms of SialoL immunomodulatory actions on the vertebrate host. LPS-induced maturation of dendritic cells from C57BL/6 mice was significantly reduced in the presence of SialoL. Although OVA degradation was not affected by the presence of SialoL in dendritic cell cultures, cathepsin S activity was partially inhibited, leading to an accumulation of a 10-kDa invariant chain intermediate in these cells. As a consequence, in vitro Ag-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation was inhibited in a time-dependent manner by SialoL, and further studies engaging cathepsin S(-/-) or cathepsin L(-/-) dendritic cells confirmed that the immunomodulatory actions of SialoL are mediated by inhibition of cathepsin S. Moreover, mice treated with SialoL displayed decreased early T cell expansion and recall response upon antigenic stimulation. Finally, SialoL administration during the immunization phase of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice significantly prevented disease symptoms, which was associated with impaired IFN-gamma and IL-17 production and specific T cell proliferation. These results illuminate the dual mechanism by which a human disease vector protein modulates vertebrate host immunity and reveals its potential in prevention of an autoimmune disease."

Eighteen of 214 ticks were PCR-positive for the fla and 16S rRNA genes and 15 for the ospA gene. Southern blotting with a fla probe and sequencing of ospA genes confirmed infection with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. These findings, together with reports of indigenous cases, fulfil the criteria that allow northeastern Mexico to be considered as a zone endemic for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Neurological manifestations of Lyme disease (or neuroborreliosis) occur variably and while it is clear that Borrelia burgdorferi can invade the nervous system, how it does so is not well understood. Pathogen penetration through the blood brain barrier (BBB) is often influenced by calcium signaling in the endothelial cells triggered by extracellular host-pathogen interactions. We examined the traversal of B. burgdorferi across the human BBB using in vitro model systems constructed of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) grown on Costar Transwell inserts. Pretreatment of the cell monolayers with BAPTA-AM (an intracellular calcium chelator) or phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 inhibited B. burgdorferi transmigration. By 5 h, BAPTA-AM significantly inhibited (82-99%; p <0.017) spirochete traversal of HBMEC compared to DMSO controls. Spirochete traversal was almost totally blocked (> or =99%; p <0.017) after pretreatment with the PLC-beta inhibitor U73122 as a result of barrier tightening based on electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). The data suggest a role for calcium signaling in CNS spirochete invasion through endothelial cell barriers."

From July, 1998 to November, 2000, a cross-sectional study was conducted in 333 patients with skin rash and fever. Paired blood samples were collected for identification of the pathogens. Only 193 samples which were negative for other pathogens (Parvovirus B19 Human, Herpesvirus 6 Human, Measles, Rubella, Dengue, Scarlet fever and Enterovirus), were tested for borreliosis by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Western-blotting. Other clinical, socioeconomic, demographic and climatic variables were studied. Prevalence of the disease was 6.2%(12/193). Of the variables studied, there was predominance in: <6 years old (83.2%); females (66.7%); being from the city of Franco da Rocha (58.3 %); and a summer/fall seasonality. The duration of care was 4 days. Signs and symptoms with statistical significance were itching; absence of lip notch and ocular pain; irritability and good clinical condition. Other clinical data presented were: pruritus (90%), irritability (80%) and fever (38 masculineC) (58.3%) with a duration of 1 to 3 days. Erythema was maculo-papular (40%), urticaria-like (25%) and scarlatiniform (16.7%), occurring predominately on the trunk (60%). There were no primary clinical evidences of Lyme-simile disease in the patients under study. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnosis as opposed to the laboratory diagnosis was zero. There was no initial clinical suspicion of the disease in the 10 cases studied and followed up for two years that showed no evidence of cardiologic or neurological complications. This is the first study of Lyme-simile in Brazilian children. Prevalence of Lyme-simile disease was low, and it was not remembered at the initial diagnosis of those with skin rash. However, practical knowledge is necessary, demanding increased medical attention."

Despite their importance, a robust strategy comparable with gene or protein array technology for comprehensively analyzing the eicosanoid metabolome has not been forthcoming. We have developed liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methodology that quantitatively and comprehensively analyzes the eicosanoid metabolome and utilized this approach to characterize eicosanoid production during experimental Lyme arthritis in mice infected with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Eicosanoids were extracted throughout infection from the joints of Lyme arthritis-resistant and -susceptible mice and subjected to lipidomic profiling. We identified temporal and quantitative differences between these mouse strains in the production of eicosanoids, which correlated with differences in arthritis development. The eicosanoid biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 has been implicated in the regulation of Lyme arthritis pathology, and subsequent lipidomic profiling of B. burgdorferi-infected COX-2(-/-) mice identified reductions not only in COX-2 products but, surprisingly, also significant off-target reductions in 5-lipoxygenase metabolites. Our results demonstrate the utility of a comprehensive lipidomic approach for identifying potential contributors to disease pathology and may facilitate the development of more precisely targeted treatment strategies."

		"abstract": "The contribution of the inflammasome to the development of immune responses and disease during infection with the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is not well defined. Host defense against the spirochete is severely impaired in mice deficient in the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88), which is required not only for Toll-like receptor-mediated responses but also for the production of the proforms of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-18. These cytokines are released in active forms after cleavage by the inflammasome-associated enzyme caspase 1. To investigate the contribution of the inflammasome to host defense against B. burgdorferi, we examined Lyme borreliosis in mice deficient in either caspase 1 or apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase recruitment domain (ASC), a molecule upstream of caspase 1 in the inflammasome signaling cascade. We found that caspase 1-deficient mice had a mild transient elevation in pathogen burden and a trend toward an increase in the prevalence of arthritis early in infection, but these differences resolved by day 14 postinfection. Caspase 1 deficiency had no effect on B. burgdorferi-induced humoral immunity, T-cell responses, or the abilities of macrophages to ingest and degrade spirochetes. The absence of the ASC protein had no effect on the control of the spirochete or the development of immune responses and disease. These findings reveal that the caspase 1 inflammasome is not critical to host defense against the extracellular pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The observation that Borrelia burgdorferi-induced arthritis is severe in C3H mice and milder in C57BL/6 (B6) mice has allowed a forward genetics approach for the identification of genetic elements that regulate the arthritis response. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) on five chromosomes (Chr) were identified previously in segregating crosses between C3H and B6 mice and collectively designated B. burgdorferi arthritis-associated (Bbaa) QTL. Reciprocal interval-specific congenic lines (ISCL) that encompass Bbaa1, Bbaa2-Bbaa3, Bbaa4, Bbaa6, and Bbaa12 on Chr 4, 5, 11, 12, and 1, respectively, have now been generated. Bidirectional transfer of the arthritis severity phenotype in association with Bbaa2-Bbaa3 and Bbaa4 was observed, and unidirectional transfer with the B6 allele of Bbaa6 was noted. These findings confirm the existence of polymorphic loci within Bbaa2-Bbaa3, Bbaa4, and Bbaa6 that regulate the severity of B. burgdorferi-induced arthritis. ISCL were used to assess the regulation of a previously identified interferon transcriptional profile associated with severe disease in C3H mice. The regulation of this transcriptional signature was found to be independent of penetrant Bbaa QTL, both in joint tissues and in isolated macrophages. These results clearly demonstrate the utility of forward genetics for the discovery of novel genes and pathways involved in the regulation of the severity of Lyme arthritis and predict the involvement of regulatory elements not evident from other experimental approaches."

		"abstract": "The mechanisms that determine bacterial shape are in many ways poorly understood. A prime example is the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi), which mechanically couples its motility organelles, helical flagella, to its rod-shaped cell body, producing a striking flat-wave morphology. A mathematical model is developed here that accounts for the elastic coupling of the flagella to the cell cylinder and shows that the flat-wave morphology is in fact a natural consequence of the geometrical and material properties of the components. Observations of purified periplasmic flagella show two flagellar conformations. The mathematical model suggests that the larger waveform flagellum is the more relevant for determining the shape of B. burgdorferi. Optical trapping experiments were used to measure directly the mechanical properties of these spirochetes. These results imply relative stiffnesses of the two components, which confirm the predictions of the model and show that the morphology of B. burgdorferi is completely determined by the elastic properties of the flagella and cell body. This approach is applicable to a variety of other structures in which the shape of the composite system is markedly different from that of the individual components, such as coiled-coil domains in proteins and the eukaryotic axoneme."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne infection in North America, is increasingly reported. When the characteristic rash, erythema migrans, is not recognized and treated, delayed manifestations of disseminated infection may occur. The accuracy of diagnosis and treatment of early Lyme disease in the community is unknown. A retrospective, consecutive case series of 165 patients presenting for possible early Lyme disease between August 1, 2002 and August 1, 2007 to a community-based Lyme referral practice in Maryland. All patients had acute symptoms of less than or equal to 12 weeks duration. Patients were categorized according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and data were collected on presenting history, physical findings, laboratory serology, prior diagnoses and prior treatments. The majority (61%) of patients in this case series were diagnosed with early Lyme disease. Of those diagnosed with early Lyme disease, 13% did not present with erythema migrans; of those not presenting with a rash, 54% had been previously misdiagnosed. Among those with a rash, the diagnosis of erythema migrans was initially missed in 23% of patients whose rash was subsequently confirmed. Of all patients previously misdiagnosed, 41% had received initial antibiotics likely to be ineffective against Lyme disease. For community physicians practicing in high-risk geographic areas, the diagnosis of Lyme disease remains a challenge. Failure to recognize erythema migrans or alternatively, viral-like presentations without a rash, can lead to missed or delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease, ineffective antibiotic treatment, and the potential for late manifestations."

Thirty-three participants completed a follow-up health survey; 14 reported at least one symptom; two had erythema migrans-like rash; eight sought medical evaluation for their symptoms.

We here demonstrate that uPAR is upregulated on murine and human leukocytes upon exposure to B. burgdorferi both in vitro as well as in vivo. Notably, B. burgdorferi-inoculated C57BL/6 uPAR knock-out mice harbored significantly higher Borrelia numbers compared to WT controls. This was associated with impaired phagocytotic capacity of B. burgdorferi by uPAR knock-out leukocytes in vitro. B. burgdorferi numbers in vivo, and phagocytotic capacity in vitro, were unaltered in uPA, tPA (low fibrinolytic activity) and PAI-1 (high fibrinolytic activity) knock-out mice compared to WT controls. Strikingly, in uPAR knock-out mice partially backcrossed to a B. burgdorferi susceptible C3H/HeN background, higher B. burgdorferi numbers were associated with more severe carditis and increased local TLR2 and IL-1beta mRNA expression. In conclusion, in B. burgdorferi infection, uPAR is required for phagocytosis and adequate eradication of the spirochete from the heart by a mechanism that is independent of binding of uPAR to uPA or its role in the fibrinolytic system."

LB is a zoonosis caused by Borrelia bacteria transmitted by Ixodes tick-bite. Because of the absence of a national registry, epidemiology of LB in France is not well known. Moreover, diagnosis of NB may be difficult because of the various clinical forms. Acute meningoradiculitis is the most common presentation, but pauci-symptomatic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular involvement, and rarely chronic encephalomyelitis are also described. The vector Ixodes ricinus (I. ricinus) is found throughout metropolitan France excepting border areas of the Mediterranean seaside and in regions with an altitude above 1500 meters. In France, the Borrelia infestation rate of Ixodes is 7% with wide disparity between administrative districts. Prospective work in 1999-2000 by 875 general practitioners participating in the \"Sentinel\" network established the estimated incidence of BL (9.4/100 000) and of NB (0.6/100 000) in France. Incidence is higher in certain regions: in Alsace, prospective work by 419 general practitioners and specialists in cooperation with the national surveillance agency (Institut national de veille sanitaire), estimated BL incidence at 86 to 200/100 000 inhabitants and NB at 10/100 000. Thus, although globally France is a country with a moderate risk for LB, some regions such as Limousin, Auvergne, Lorraine and Alsace, have a high risk of LB, comparable to countries in the northeastern Europe such as Germany and Sweden."

		"abstract": "This paper aims to construct a spatially-explicit model of Ixodes scapularis infection in the State of New York, USA, based on climate traits, high-resolution landscape features and patch-connectivity according to graph theory. The degree of risk for infection is calculated based on empirical data of host abundance, previous studies on host infectivity rates and tick preferences towards a given host. The outcome signifies what is called the \"recruitment of infection\", i.e. an index representing the abundance of infected ticks in a particular patch of vegetation. The results show that the I. scapularis recruitment of infection (IR) index is highly dependent upon a complex array of landscape fragmentation and the presence of key hosts. Neither faunal richness nor host density alone has any reasonable effect on the recruitment of infection. The experience of Lyme disease in the State of New York shows no clear relationship between the IR as calculated at the patch level and then summarized county by county and the rates of disease over the last eight years reported for these counties. However, areas characterized by low IR have consistently been associated with locations with low disease rates. Above all, the low levels of disease are related to minimal suitability due to the climate and negligible connection between patches. Social factors, mainly activities leading to an increased contact of humans with infective foci (which can be situated far from their homes), may lead to a high rates being reported from areas with high human densities rather than areas characterized by a high recruitment of infection. The spatial model developed here may be used to study the long-term changes in infective risk and tick recruitment as a result of humaninduced changes in the landscape."

Most recently, the battleground moved into the arena of clinical practice guidelines. Both camps in the \"Lyme Wars\"-the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS)-have published Lyme disease practice guidelines. The guidelines conflict regarding diagnosis and treatment. The state of Connecticut's Attorney General's office conducted an investigation, under antitrust laws, into the development and promulgation of IDSA's 2006 guidelines. In an unprecedented move, IDSA and the AG have entered into a legal agreement that necessitates a rethinking of the guidelines, requiring a new review panel reflecting balanced, conflict-of-interest-free perspectives on Lyme disease."

We studied the potential of modern microbiological assays to improve this poor situation. In a prospective study during 3 years, all children attending hospital with suspected CNS infection were examined using a wide collection of microbiological tests using samples from the cerebrospinal fluid, serum, nasal swabs and stool. Among 213 patients, 66 (31%) cases suggested CNS infection and specific aetiology was identified in 56 patients. Of these microbiologically confirmed cases, viral meningitis/encephalitis was diagnosed in 25 (45%), bacterial meningitis in 21 (38%) and neuroborreliosis in 9 (16%) cases while 1 child had fungal infection. In meningitis patients, the causative agent was identified in 85% (35/41) cases and in encephalitis in 75% (12/16). The most common bacteria were Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcous pneumonie and Neisseria meningitidis, while the most frequently detected viruses were enteroviruses and varicella zoster virus. In 75% to 85% of paediatric CNS infections, specific microbiological diagnosis was obtained with modern laboratory techniques. The results pose a basis for prudent approach to these potentially serious diseases."

		"abstract": "Data on the long-term outcome of B. burgdorferi infections in adult dogs are sparse. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether Bernese Mountain dogs with serological evidence of natural B. burgdorferi infection more often develop signs such as lameness, azotemia or proteinuria during a follow-up period of 2.5 to 3.0 years. Seropositive Bernese Mountain dogs were compared to seronegative Bernese Mountain dogs and to seropositive and seronegative control dogs of other breeds. Dogs included in a previous study on the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in Bernese Mountain dogs were re-evaluated. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole-cell sonicate as antigen and results were confirmed using a Western blot assay. Fifty-three Bernese Mountain dogs and 30 control dogs were re-evaluated. Re-evaluation was performed between 2.5 and 3.0 years (median 2.7 years) after the first assessment.The age of the dogs at the second evaluation ranged from 3 to 11 years (median 6 years). There were no significant differences with regard to poor general condition or lameness between the first and the second evaluation. At the first evaluation 22 (42%) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 11 (37%) of the control dogs were considered positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi. At the second evaluation 25 (47%) of the Bernese Mountain dogs and 12 (40%) of the control dogs were considered positive; 69% of the dogs showed the same serological result at both examinations and 31% were seroconverted or seroreverted. During the first examination, azotemia was diagnosed in 6 Bernese Mountain dogs and during the second examination in 11 Bernese Mountain dogs. No control dogs had azotemia in this study. In seropositive dogs there was no increase in lameness or signs of renal disease over time. It may be concluded that antibodies against B. burgdorferi determined by whole cell ELISA and confirmed by Western blot were neither associated with the development of lameness nor with signs of renal disease like azotemia or proteinuria in dogs observed over a period of 2.5 to 3.0 years."

		"abstract": "The extinction of species across the globe is accelerating, directly or indirectly due to human activities. Biological impoverishment, habitat fragmentation, climate change, increasing toxification, and the rapid global movement of people and other living organisms have worked synergistically to diminish ecosystem function. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of disease emergence, driven by human-induced environmental degradation, which poses a threat to the survival and health of biodiversity. The emerging discipline of conservation medicine addresses these concerns through the following entities: humans; global climate; habitat destruction and alteration; biodiversity, including wildlife populations; domestic animals; and pathogens, parasites and pollutants. Furthermore, conservation medicine focuses on explicit linkages between these entities. As a crisis discipline, the usefulness of conservation medicine ultimately will depend on its applicability to solving problems. The perspectives and scientific findings of conservation medicine provide input into biomedical education; and policy and management of ecosystems, habitats and imperiled species. A sentinel species is one that has presented itself, or has been selected, to provide insight into the state (health) of an ecosystem, based on user-defined (e.g., researchers, conservationists or policymakers) objectives (e.g., disease, parasites, toxics, climate change, habitat destruction), coupled with the utility and vulnerability of this species to the perceived stress. The scientific information generated by the sentinel species should empower stakeholders and decision-makers to take mitigative action or support predictive capabilities; the \"utility\" of the species selected should consider its value and relevance to conservationists and to society at large (e.g., education and outreach; social sciences). Wild canids may serve as excellent sentinel species of emerging canine vector-borne diseases. Several canine vector-borne diseases or antibodies to these pathogens have been identified in wild canids including visceral leishmaniosis, Lyme disease, heartworm, hepatozoonosis and anaplasmosis to name a few. These reports are relatively recent as they relate to wildlife-domestic animal interactions, globalisation, translocations, habitat fragmentation and climate change. These pathogens and their relationship to wild canids are described herein. Further research needs to be performed to elucidate the role of the 36 extant species of wild canids in the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases."

Diagnosis often has been made based on positive antibody titers in serum of dogs with neurological signs, but a high seroprevalence in dogs in at-risk populations makes diagnosis difficult. To determine if the neurological signs in dogs examined were caused by any of these bacteria. Fifty-four dogs presented to a board-certified neurologist. Prospective study. We divided dogs into 2 groups: those with inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) and those with neurological signs from other diseases. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from all dogs were analyzed. Dogs with inflammatory CNS diseases showed no serum antibodies against any of the agents. Among dogs with neurological signs from other diseases, 10.3% had serum antibodies for B. burgdorferi sl and 20.5% for A. phagocytophilum. All blood samples analyzed for bacterial deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and all CSF analyzed for antibodies and bacterial DNA for the 2 agents were negative. Based on this study, these bacteria are unlikely causes of neurologic disease in dogs and the presence of serum antibodies alone does not document or establish a definitive diagnosis of CNS disease caused by these organisms. Dogs that have neurologic disease and corresponding serum antibodies against these agents should have additional tests performed to assess for other potential etiologies of the signs."

		"abstract": "The development of a vaccine for Lyme disease was intensely pursued in the 1990s. However, citing a lack of demand, the first human Lyme disease vaccine was withdrawn from the market less than 5 years after its approval. The public's concerns about the vaccine's safety also likely contributed to the withdrawal of the vaccine. Nearly a decade later, no vaccine for human Lyme disease exists. The expansion of Lyme disease's endemic range, as well as the difficulty of diagnosing infection and the disease's steady increase in incidence in the face of proven preventative measures, make the pursuit of a Lyme disease vaccine a worthwhile endeavor. Many believe that the negative public perception of the Lyme disease vaccine will have tarnished any future endeavors towards its development. Importantly, many of the drawbacks of the Lyme disease vaccine were apparent or foreseeable prior to its approval. These pitfalls must be confronted before the construction of a new, effective and safe human Lyme disease vaccine."

To determine whether patients with a history of well-characterized Lyme disease and persistent cognitive deficit show abnormalities in global or topographic distributions of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) or cerebral metabolic rate (rCMR). Case-controlled study. A university medical center. A total of 35 patients and 17 healthy volunteers (controls). Patients had well-documented prior Lyme disease, a currently reactive IgG Western blot, prior treatment with at least 3 weeks of intravenous cephalosporin, and objective memory impairment. Patients with persistent Lyme encephalopathy were compared with age-, sex-, and education-matched controls. Fully quantified assessments of rCBF and rCMR for glucose were obtained while subjects were medication-free using positron emission tomography. The CBF was assessed in 2 resting room air conditions (without snorkel and with snorkel) and 1 challenge condition (room air enhanced with carbon dioxide, ie, hypercapnia). Statistical parametric mapping analyses revealed regional abnormalities in all rCBF and rCMR measurements that were consistent in location across imaging methods and primarily reflected hypoactivity. Deficits were noted in bilateral gray and white matter regions, primarily in the temporal, parietal, and limbic areas. Although diminished global hypercapnic CBF reactivity (P < .02) was suggestive of a component of vascular compromise, the close coupling between CBF and CMR suggests that the regional abnormalities are primarily metabolically driven. Patients did not differ from controls on global resting CBF and CMR measurements. Patients with persistent Lyme encephalopathy have objectively quantifiable topographic abnormalities in functional brain activity. These CBF and CMR reductions were observed in all measurement conditions. Future research should address whether this pattern is also seen in acute neurologic Lyme disease."

In 2006 the Connecticut Attorney General launched an antitrust investigation into the Lyme guidelines development process of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). In a recent settlement with IDSA, the Attorney General noted important commercial conflicts of interest and suppression of scientific evidence that had tainted the guidelines process. This paper explores two broad ethical themes that influenced the IDSA investigation. The first is the growing problem of conflicts of interest among guidelines developers, and the second is the increasing centralisation of medical decisions by insurance companies, which use treatment guidelines as a means of controlling the practices of individual doctors and denying treatment for patients. The implications of the first-ever antitrust investigation of medical guidelines and the proposed model to remediate the tainted IDSA guidelines process are also discussed."

Previous studies from our group showed that BBK32 is a virulence factor in experimental Lyme disease and located the Fn-binding region to residues 21-205 of the lipoprotein. Studies aimed at identifying interacting sites between BBK32 and Fn revealed an interaction between the MSCRAMM and the Fn F3 modules. Further analysis of this interaction showed that BBK32 can cause the aggregation of human plasma Fn in a similar concentration-dependent manner to that of anastellin, the superfibronectin (sFn) inducing agent. The resulting Fn aggregates are conformationally distinct from plasma Fn as indicated by a change in available thermolysin cleavage sites. Recombinant BBK32 and anastellin affect the structure of Fn matrices formed by cultured fibroblasts and inhibit endothelial cell proliferation similarly. Within BBK32, we have located the sFn-forming activity to a region between residues 160 and 175 which contains two sequence motifs that are also found in anastellin. Synthetic peptides mimicking these motifs induce Fn aggregation, whereas a peptide with a scrambled sequence motif was inactive, suggesting that these motifs represent the sFn-inducing sequence. We conclude that BBK32 induces the formation of Fn aggregates that are indistinguishable from those formed by anastellin. The results of this study provide evidence for how bacteria can target host proteins to manipulate host cell activities."

		"abstract": "We sought to identify predictive factors for Lyme carditis in children and to characterize the clinical course of these patients. We reviewed all cases of early disseminated Lyme disease presenting to our institution from January 1994 through July 2008, and summarized the presentation and course of those patients with carditis. A case-control study was used to identify predictive factors for carditis. Controls were patients with early disseminated Lyme disease without carditis. Of 207 children with early disseminated Lyme disease, 33 (16%) had carditis, 14 (42%) of whom had advanced heart block, including 9 (27%) with complete heart block. The median time to recovery of sinus rhythm in these 14 patients was 3 days (range: 1-7 days), and none required a permanent pacemaker. Four (12%) of 33 patients with carditis had depressed ventricular systolic function, 3 (9%) of whom required mechanical ventilation, temporary pacing, and inotropic support. Complete resolution of rhythm disturbances and myocardial dysfunction occurred in 24 (89%) of 27 patients for whom follow-up data were available. Most patients with carditis also had other systemic Lyme involvement. By using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that children >10 years of age, those with arthralgias, and those with cardiopulmonary symptoms were more likely to have carditis. The spectrum of presentation for children with Lyme carditis is broad, ranging from asymptomatic, first-degree heart block to fulminant myocarditis. Variable degrees of heart block are the most common manifestation and occasionally require temporary pacing. Transient myocardial dysfunction, although less common, can be life-threatening. Advanced heart block resolves within 1 week in most cases. In children with early disseminated Lyme disease, older age, arthralgias, and cardiopulmonary symptoms independently predict the presence of carditis."

		"abstract": "Lyme meningitis is difficult to differentiate from other causes of aseptic meningitis in Lyme disease-endemic regions. Parenteral antibiotics are indicated for Lyme meningitis but not viral causes of aseptic meningitis. A clinical prediction model was developed to distinguish Lyme meningitis from other causes of aseptic meningitis. Our objective was to prospectively validate this model. Children between 2 and 18 years of age presenting to Hasbro Children's Hospital from April through October of 2006 and 2007 were enrolled if a lumbar puncture for meningitis showed a cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count of >8 cells per microL. Cerebrospinal fluid was sent for Lyme antibody testing. The probability of Lyme meningitis was calculated by using the percentage of cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cells, duration of headache, and presence of cranial neuropathy by using the prediction model. Definite Lyme meningitis cases were defined as cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with (1) positive Lyme serology confirmed by immunoblot or (2) erythema migrans rash. Possible Lyme meningitis cases were defined as cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis with positive cerebrospinal fluid Lyme antibody. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios for definite and possible Lyme meningitis were determined by using 10% increments of calculated probability of Lyme meningitis. Fifty children were enrolled, including 14 children with definite Lyme meningitis, 6 with possible Lyme meningitis, and 30 with aseptic meningitis. A calculated probability of <10% for Lyme meningitis had a negative likelihood ratio of 0.006 for definite and possible Lyme meningitis cases. A calculated probability of >50% for Lyme meningitis had a positive likelihood ratio of 100 using these definitions. A clinical prediction model using the percentage of cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cells, headache duration, and presence of cranial neuropathy can differentiate children with Lyme meningitis from children with aseptic meningitis. Our findings suggest categories of low (<10%), indeterminate (10%-50%), and high (>50%) probability of Lyme meningitis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease-causing spirochete, can persistently infect its vertebrate hosts for years. B. burgdorferi is often found associated with host connective tissue, where it interacts with components of the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin. Some years ago, a borrelial surface protein, named BBK32, was identified as a fibronectin-binding protein. However, B. burgdorferi BBK32 mutants are still able to bind fibronectin, indicating that the spirochete possesses additional mechanisms for adherence to fibronectin. We now demonstrate that RevA, an unrelated B. burgdorferi outer surface protein, binds mammalian fibronectin in a saturable manner. Site-directed mutagenesis studies identified the amino terminus of the RevA protein as being required for adhesion to fibronectin. RevA bound to the amino-terminal region of fibronectin. RevA binding to fibronectin was not inhibited by salt or heparin, suggesting that adhesin-ligand interactions are primarily nonionic and occur through the non-heparin-binding regions of the fibronectin amino-terminal domains. revA genes are widely distributed among Lyme disease spirochetes, and the present studies determined that all RevA alleles tested bound fibronectin. In addition, RevB, a paralogous protein found in a subset of B. burgdorferi strains, also bound fibronectin. We also confirmed that RevA is produced during mammalian infection but not during colonization of vector ticks and determined that revA transcription is controlled through a mechanism distinct from that of BBK32."

Recently more and more reports of so called \"Post Lyme syndrome (PLS)\" have appeared. PLS is a new clinical, diagnostic and therapeutic problem connected with patients with a history of Lyme disease (with proper antibiotic treatment). The symptoms of Post Lyme Syndrome may be present throughout months or even years. These are: fatigue, widespread musculoskeletal pain, dysmnesia, concentration difficulties. Pathogenesis of PLS is unknown. It is suspected that main factors responsible for PLS are: slow regression of infection, its turning into chronic process and permanent destruction of tissues or induction of immunological response against B. burgdorferi. Diagnostic of PLS is difficult. Mostly results of serological examination are negative. In some cases antibodies titer is positive as a sign of past disease. So far there is no causative treatment of PLS. Antidepressants, painkillers and anti-inflammatory medicines are recommended."

Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately after the diagnosis has been established and is administered according to stage and symptoms of the disease.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the USA with the highest number of cases (27 444 patients) reported by CDC in the year 2007, representing an unprecedented 37% increase from the previous year. The haematogenous spread of Borrelia burgdorferi to various tissues results in multisystemic disease affecting the heart, joints, skin, musculoskeletal and nervous system of the patients. Although Lyme disease can be effectively treated with doxycycline, amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil, discovery of novel drugs will benefit the patients intolerant to these drugs and potentially those suffering from chronic Lyme disease that is refractory to these agents and to macrolides. In this study, we have explored 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase as a drug target for B. burgdorferi, which uniquely possesses three genes expressing homologous enzymes with two of these proteins apparently exported. The recombinant B. burgdorferi Bgp and Pfs proteins were first used for the kinetic analysis of enzymatic activity with both substrates and with four inhibitors. We then determined the antispirochaetal activity of these compounds using a novel technique. The method involved detection of the live-dead B. burgdorferi by fluorometric analysis after staining with a fluorescent nucleic acids stain mixture containing Hoechst 33342 and Sytox Green. Our results indicate that this method can be used for high-throughput screening of novel antimicrobials against bacteria. The inhibitors formycin A and 5'-p-nitrophenythioadenosine particularly affected B. burgdorferi adversely on prolonged treatment. On the basis of our analysis, we expect that structure-based modification of the inhibitors can be employed to develop highly effective novel antibiotics against Lyme spirochaetes."

Although LB is one of the best-studied vector-borne zoonoses, the annual incidence in North America and Europe leads other vector-borne diseases and continues to increase. What factors make the LB system so successful, and how can researchers hope to reduce disease risk - either through vaccinating humans or reducing the risk of contacting infected ticks in nature? Discoveries of molecular interactions involved in the transmission of LB spirochetes have accelerated recently, revealing complex interactions among the spirochete-tick-vertebrate triad. These interactions involve multiple, and often redundant, pathways that reflect the evolution of general and specific mechanisms by which the spirochetes survive and reproduce. Previous reviews have focused on the molecular interactions or population biology of the system. Here molecular interactions among the LB spirochete, its vector, and vertebrate hosts are reviewed in the context of natural maintenance cycles, which represent the ecological and evolutionary contexts that shape these interactions. This holistic system approach may help researchers develop additional testable hypotheses about transmission processes, interpret laboratory results, and guide development of future LB control measures and management."

The earliest indication of Lyme disease infection is usually erythema migrans. This large, typically macular erythema, often with a target-like pattern of concentric pale and red circles, gradually enlarges day by day, potentially reaching many centimeters in diameter. In a significant proportion of infected individuals, an acute disseminated phase leads to seeding elsewhere in the body. Up to 5% of patients develop cardiac involvement. In about 10% to 15% of patients, the nervous system becomes symptomatically involved. Current serologic diagnostic tools are quite useful, and standard treatment regimens are highly effective. Oral antimicrobials have been shown to be effective in European neuroborreliosis and presumably are equally potent in North American patients. Long-term antibiotic treatment does not provide any additional lasting improvement, but it is frequently associated with significant morbidity."

Having entered the host at the site of the tick bite, the spirochetes can initially cause a local inflammatory reaction, called erythema migrans. If left untreated, the Borrelia can disseminate in the second stage of the disease and invade the central nervous system, causing LNB. The diagnosis of LNB is based on a compatible clinical picture (meningitis, cranial neuritis or radiculoneuritis), lymphocytic pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antibody production. As the clinical picture of LNB may be unspecific, a lumbar puncture to analyze the CSF is usually mandatory for confirmation of the suspected diagnosis. The indications for a lumbar puncture and the limitations of the different diagnostic procedures are the main topics of this review. In addition, a short overview of the epidemiology and the therapeutic principles of LNB is given."

Most patients cured of Lyme disease remain seropositive for long periods, and no laboratory test allows one to differentiate between cured and active infection. The first step is to check that the patient fulfils the diagnostic criteria for Lyme disease and that the antibiotic regimen has been administered according to the current recommendations. In the case of persistent arthritis after a first course of antibiotics, it is generally recommended to give a second course of treatment with a different drug. Ceftriaxone should be administered intravenously for arthritis that did not respond to previous oral therapy with doxycycline or amoxicillin. Despite resolution of the objective manifestations of Lyme disease after antibiotic treatment, a small proportion of patients still complain of subjective musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, difficulties with concentration or short-term memory, or all these symptoms. Given the risk of serious adverse events and the lack of efficacy, a consensus has emerged that repeated courses of antibiotic therapy are not indicated for persistent subjective symptoms following Lyme disease. The patient should be thoroughly examined for medical conditions that could explain the symptoms. If a diagnosis is made for which no specific treatment can be proposed, emotional support and management of pain, fatigue and other symptoms is required."

For example, persistent positive IgG and/ or IgM antibody titers do not indicate treatment failure. Thus, repeated serologic testing is of very limited value for assessing therapy efficacy, and therefore not recommended in the follow-up of dermatoborrelioses patients. Since cultivation of the etiologic agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, and polymerase chain reaction are also inadequate for this purpose, the assessment of patients with cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in the follow-up rests primarily on the clinical picture."

Ticks should be removed as early as possible with fine tweezers, taking the tick's head with the forceps. Antibiotic prophylactic therapy after a tick bite is not generally recommended. Tick bites can potentially be prevented by covering the body as much as possible or by applying repellents to the body and permethrin to clothes. Tick bite areas should be inspected for 1 month.

Here, we examine tick-borne diseases other than Lyme disease that are found in Europe; namely: anaplasmosis, relapsing fever, tularemia, tick-borne encephalitis, tick-borne babesiosis and tick-borne rickettsiosis. Each disease is broken down into a description, epidemiology, signs and symptoms, diagnosis and treatment, providing clear overviews of each disease course and the interventions required. Furthermore, in the section concerning tick-borne rickettsiosis, a clear summary of the Rickettsia conorii complex and its role in the disease is provided."

Oral amoxicillin and doxycycline are first-line treatment options, though phenoxymethylpenicillin, cefuroxime axetil and azithromycin are alternative second-line options. Treatments for secondary and tertiary Lyme borreliosis are more poorly documented, and antibiotics are not always effective. This is due to the unique pathophysiology of late Lyme borreliosis, which involves not only bacterial infection, but also immunological response. Since there is no completely reliable method of diagnosis, it is difficult to choose the proper treatment and to evaluate treatment efficacy. However, numerous studies have shown that ceftriaxone and doxycycline are the 2 most efficient antibiotics, particularly in Lyme arthritis and in neuroborreliosis. In late Lyme borreliosis, these antibiotics are less efficient, and different treatment schemes with variations in dosage or duration did not produce convincing results."

A complete presentation of the disease is an extremely unusual oberservation, in which a skin lesion follows a tick bite, the lesion itself is followed by heart and nervous system involvement, and later on by arthritis; late involvement of the eye, nervous system, joints and skin may also occur. Information on the relative frequency of individual clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis is limited; however, the skin is most frequently involved and skin manifestations frequently represent clues for the diagnosis. The only sign that enables a reliable clinical diagnoisis of Lyme borreliosis is a typical erythema migrans. Laboratory confirmation of a borrelial infection is needed for all manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, with the exception of typical skin lesions."

This chapter summarizes the up-to-date knowledge about facts and factors important in the epidemiology of LB all over the world. Individual sections briefly describe geographic (latitudinal and altitudinal) distribution and incidence rates of LB in individual countries; seasonal distribution of the disease; effects of patients' age, sex, and profession; comparison of urban versus rural settings; weather-related effects on LB incidence; risk factors for LB acquisition by humans; and risk assessment. This chapter finishes by recommending a more thorough epidemiological surveillance for LB, including morbidity notification in some additional countries where it has not yet been fully implemented."

I. ricinus has a wide geographical distribution throughout Europe within the latitudes of 65 degrees and 39 degrees and from Portugal into Russia. Enzootic cycles in Europe involve at least 7 Borrelia species. Apparently, associations exist in nature between Borrelia species and hosts. B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto are associated with rodents, and B. garinii and B. valaisiana with birds. B. lusitaniae may be transmitted to ticks by some lizard species and birds. B. spielmanii appears to be associated with dormice and hedgehogs. Less strict associations also exist. Transmission of Borrelia infection by I. ricinus to their hosts, including humans, does not occur immediately when ticks attach to host skin. A delay is observed, which may depend on the Borrelia species infecting the tick. B. afzelii can be transmitted during the first 24 h, whereas B. burgdorferi needs 48 h of tick attachment before its transmission begins. Nothing is known about the other Borrelia species; however, success of transmission always increases with tick attachment duration. Therefore, careful visual examinations of the body for at least 2 successive days are recommended after visiting an endemic area."

Four of them are clearly pathogenic for humans: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. garinii and B. spielmanii. They can generate erythema migrans, an initial skin lesion, and can then spread deeply into the host to invade distant tissues, especially the nervous system, the joints or the skin. In humans, Borrelia pathogenicityseems to be linked with taxonomic position, but in vitro studies show the role of plasmids in B. burgdorferi s.l. pathogenesis. The inter- and intraspecies genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi s.l. evidences a clonal evolution of the chromosome, while plasmid genes are quite variable, suggesting their major role in Borrelia adaptability. The plasmid-encoded adhesins and vlse, crasps and osp genes determine invasiveness and host immune evasion of B. burgdorferi s.l., and select the bacterial host spectrum. The geographic distribution of B. burgdorferi s.l. is closely related to its vectors and competent hosts, and its development within these influences its diversity, taxonomy and pathogenesis, primarily via genetic lateral transfer."

Knowledge of components of tick saliva, now recognized as the central pillar in the tick's ability to complete its blood meal and the pathogen's differential ability to use particular hosts for transmission, has burgeoned with new molecular techniques. Functional studies have linked a few of them to saliva-assisted transmission of non-systemic infections between co-feeding ticks, the quantitative key to persistent cycles of the most significant tick-borne pathogen in Europe. Human activities, however, may be equally important in determining dynamic patterns of infection incidence in humans."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme arthritis, does not produce any exported proteases capable of degrading extracellular matrix despite the fact that it is able to disseminate from a skin insertion site to infect multiple organs. Prior studies have shown that B. burgdorferi induces the host protease, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), and suggested that the induction of MMP-9 may allow the organism to disseminate and produce local tissue destruction. We examined the role of MMP-9 in dissemination of B. burgdorferi and pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis. In a MMP-9(-/-) mouse model, MMP-9 was not required for the dissemination of the spirochete to distant sites. However, MMP-9(-/-) exhibited significantly decreased arthritis compared to wild-type mice. The decrease in arthritis was not due to an inability to control infection since the spirochete numbers in the joints were identical. Levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines were also similar in MMP-9(-/-) and wild-type mice. We examined whether decreased inflammation in MMP-9(-/-) mice may be the result of decreased production of neoattractants by MMP-9-dependent cleavage of collagen. MMP-9 cleavage of type I collagen results in increased monocyte chemoattraction. MMP-9 plays an important role in regulating inflammation in Lyme arthritis, potentially through the cleavage of type I collagen."

We described a simple and reliable method for detection of intrathecal borrelia antibody synthesis which is necessary for the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. We also developed and routinely apply the comparative immunoblot assay for the evaluation of serological progression and/or regression, which can help the clinicians to decide whether a serological reaction is resulted from a previous healed or an active borrelia infection. We studied the pregnancy outcome of borrelia infected mothers and provided that untreated borrelia infection is associated with higher chance of adverse pregnancy outcome."

Besides the classical manifestations of cutaneous borreliosis like erythema (chronicum) migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans evidence is growing that at least in part also other skin manifestations, especially morphea, lichen sclerosus and cases of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma are causally related to infections with Borrelia. Also granuloma annulare and interstitial granulomatous dermatitis might be partly caused by Borrelia burgdorferi or similar strains. There are also single reports of other skin manifestations to be associated with borrelial infections like cutaneous sarcoidosis, necrobiosis lipoidica and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma. In addition, as the modern chameleon of dermatology, cutaneous borreliosis, especially borrelial lymphocytoma, mimics other skin conditions, as has been shown for erythema annulare centrifugum or lymphocytic infiltration (Jessner Kanof) of the skin."

Enhanced awareness of the clinical presentation of Lyme disease allows inclusion of LNB in the imaging differential diagnosis of facial neuritis, multiple enhancing cranial nerves, enhancing noncompressive radiculitis, and pediatric leptomeningitis with white matter hyperintensities on MR imaging. The MR imaging white matter appearance of successfully treated LNB and multiple sclerosis display sufficient similarity to suggest a common autoimmune pathogenesis for both.

Persons in whom inflammatory arthritis had developed after Lyme disease vaccine (cases) were compared with 3 control groups: 1) inflammatory arthritis but not Lyme disease vaccine (arthritis controls), 2) Lyme disease vaccine but not inflammatory arthritis (vaccine controls), and 3) neither Lyme disease vaccine nor inflammatory arthritis (normal controls). HLA-DRB1 allele typing, Western blotting for Lyme antigen, and T cell reactivity testing were performed. Twenty-seven cases were matched with 162 controls (54 in each control group). Odds ratios (ORs) for the presence of 1 or 2 treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis alleles were 0.8 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.3-2.1), 1.6 (95% CI 0.5-4.4), and 1.75 (95% CI 0.6-5.3) in cases versus arthritis controls, vaccine controls, and normal controls, respectively. There were no significant differences in the frequency of DRB1 alleles. T cell response to OspA was similar between cases and vaccine controls, as measured using the stimulation index (OR 1.6 [95% CI 0.5-5.1]) or change in uptake of tritiated thymidine (counts per minute) (OR 0.7 [95% CI 0.2-2.3]), but cases were less likely to have IgG antibodies to OspA (OR 0.3 [95% CI 0.1-0.8]). Cases were sampled closer to the time of vaccination (median 3.59 years versus 5.48 years), and fewer cases had received 3 doses of vaccine (37% versus 93%). Treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis alleles were not found more commonly in persons who developed arthritis after Lyme disease vaccination, and immune responses to OspA were not significantly more common in arthritis cases. These results suggest that Lyme disease vaccine is not a major factor in the development of arthritis in these cases."

		"abstract": "The saliva of hematophagous arthropods contains potent anti-inflammatory and antihemostatic activities that promote acquisition of the blood meal and enhance infection with pathogens. We have shown that polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) treated with the saliva of the tick Ixodes scapularis have reduced expression of beta(2) integrins, impaired PMN adherence, and reduced killing of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Here we describe two Ixodes proteins that are induced upon tick feeding and expressed predominantly in the salivary glands. Using saliva harvested from ticks with reduced levels of ISL 929 and ISL 1373 through targeted RNA interference knockdown, as well as purified recombinant proteins, we show the effects of these proteins on downregulation of PMN integrins and inhibition of the production of O(2)(-) by PMN in vitro. Mice immunized with ISL 929/1373 had increased numbers of PMN at the site of tick attachment and a lower spirochete burden in the skin and joints 21 days after infection compared to control-immunized animals. Our results suggest that ISL 929 and ISL 1373 contribute to the inhibition of PMN functions shown previously with tick saliva and support important roles for these inhibitory proteins in the modulation of PMN function in vivo."

We report a new case in which a brother and a sister with a family history of consanguinity presented plasma cell panniculitis of long duration. A man and his sister, 38 and 28 years old respectively, presented thick hyperpigmented indurations of the trunk and thighs since puberty. Previous investigations did not lead to any definitive diagnosis. Deep cutaneous specimens taken from both patients exhibited indistinct histological features of plasma cell panniculitis. Morphea profunda is a deep-localized variant of scleroderma. The presence of predominant plasma cell infiltrate suggests a rare type of morphea profunda named plasma cell panniculitis. Subcutaneous plasma cell infiltrate has been described in many diseases such as lupus profundus and lymphoplasmocytic panniculitis of Lyme disease. The family history of consanguinity, similar age of onset and identical clinicopathological presentation suggest a genetic role in this disorder. This is the second report of plasma cell panniculitis in two siblings with a history of consanguinity."

The patient presented with seizures, subacute progressive hemispheric syndrome, and a tumourlike abnormality on MRI. Demyelinating disease was initially considered unlikely. Due to a rapidly evolving herniation syndrome hemicraniectomy was performed. Outcome was favourable with only very mild neurological deficits 6 weeks later. TDD should be considered as a differential diagnosis in tumour-like presentations, and appears to have distinctive neuroimaging features. In the advent of treatement failure from high dose corticosteroids and plasmapheresis and development of severe mass effect, decompressive hemicraniectomy is an important treatment option."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme disease (LD), an infectious disease occurring in North America, Europe, and Asia in different clinical stages. B. burgdorferi sensu lato encompasses at least 12 species, with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii being of highest clinical importance. Immunologic testing for LD as well as recent vaccination strategies exclusively refer to proteinaceous antigens. However, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto exhibits glycolipid antigens, including 6-O-acylated cholesteryl beta-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal), and first the data indicated that this compound may act as an immunogen. Here we investigated whether B. garinii and B. afzelii also possess this antigen, and whether antibodies directed against these compounds are abundant among patients suffering from different stages of LD. Gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy and NMR spectroscopy showed that both B. garinii and B. afzelii exhibit ACGal in high quantities. In contrast, B. hermsii causing relapsing fever features 6-O-acylated cholesteryl beta-D-glucopyranoside (ACGlc). Sera derived from patients diagnosed for LD contained antibodies against ACGal, with 80% of patients suffering from late stage disease exhibiting this feature. Antibodies reacted with ACGal from all three B. burgdorferi species tested, but not with ACGlc from B. hermsii. These data show that ACGal is present in all clinically important B. burgdorferi species, and that specific antibodies against this compound are frequently found during LD. ACGal may thus be an interesting tool for improving diagnostics as well as for novel vaccination strategies."

Nine patients with BL acquired in France and for whom skin samples were sent to the national reference centre laboratory between 1994 and 2007 were included in this retrospective study. Direct detection of Borrelia in skin samples was made by polymerase chain reaction targeting the fla gene. Culture was performed when technically possible, and identification of each species was made by hybridization of a fragment of the fla gene with a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides. Borrelia afzelii was identified in three cases, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in one case each. Culture was positive in only one case (B. garinii). Borrelia afzelii seems to be the predominant species of Borrelia responsible for BL in France, as already reported in other European countries."

We hypothesized that tetracyclines, in addition to their antimicrobial function, could exert control over the inflammation elicited by Borrelia burgdorferi. To model systemic effects, we used the human monocytic cell line THP-1; to model effects in the central nervous system, we used rhesus monkey brain astrocytes and microglia. Cells were stimulated with live or sonicated B. burgdorferi or with the lipoprotein outer surface protein A in the presence of increasing concentrations of doxycycline or minocycline. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 in a dose-dependent manner in all cell types. Microarray analyses of the effect of doxycycline on gene transcription in spirochete-stimulated monocytes revealed that the NFKB and CHUK (alias, IKKA) genes were down-regulated. Functionally, phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha and binding of NF-kappaB to target DNA were both reduced in these cells. Our results suggest that tetracyclines may have a dual therapeutic effect in Lyme disease."

No similar model has ever been proposed for European patients. The objective of our study was to develop a prediction model to differentiate LM from NLAM based on clinical and CSF biologic data. The medical charts of all children older than 2 years of age admitted to our hospital from 1996 through 2006 with a definite diagnosis of LM were analyzed and compared retrospectively with those having a diagnosis of NLAM. Chart review included the duration of symptoms, the presence of cranial neuropathy, and CSF analysis. A total of 93 patients were included (LM: 26 patients; NLAM: 67 patients) in the study. Patients with LM had statistically more frequent cranial neuropathy (73% vs. 4%), displayed a longer duration of symptoms before admission (8.8 vs. 1.8 days), had a higher CSF protein (71 vs. 38 mg/d), and had a lower percentage of neutrophil cells in the CSF (3.4% vs. 51%) than patients with NLAM. A predicted probability was derived from these 4 variables. At a cutoff point of >0.432, the model had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 92.3%, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%. We report the first European prediction model for LM. Owing to its high negative predictive value, this model may assist physicians in managing aseptic meningitis (AM) while awaiting serologic tests, especially in Lyme endemic regions."

In contrast to ALAT, which is mainly liver-specific, the ASAT is found in other organs as well, e.g. heart and skeletal muscle. At a mild elevation of these enzymes a reevaluation is recommended, however if an elevation persists and is suspicious for a liver disease, a specific work up is necessary. In this manuscript, we discuss often overlooked problems and provide a diagnostic algorithm for the workup of elevated liver enzymes."

Various organisms have been associated with stillbirth, including many bacteria, viruses, and protozoa. In developed countries, between 10% and 25% of stillbirths may be caused by an infection, whereas in developing countries, which have much higher stillbirth rates, the contribution of infection is much greater. In developed countries, ascending bacterial infection, both before and after membrane rupture, with organisms such as Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, and Ureaplasma urealyticum is usually the most common infectious cause of stillbirth. However, in areas where syphilis is prevalent, up to half of all stillbirths may be caused by this infection alone. Malaria may be an important cause of stillbirth in women infected for the first time in pregnancy. The two most important viral causes of stillbirth are parvovirus and Coxsackie virus, although a number of other viral infections appear to be causal. Toxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes, and the organisms that cause leptospirosis, Q fever, and Lyme disease have all been implicated as etiologic for stillbirth. In certain developing countries, the stillbirth rate is high and the infection-related component so great that achieving a substantial reduction in stillbirth should be possible by reducing maternal infections. However, because infection-related stillbirth is uncommon in developed countries, and because those that do occur are caused by a wide variety of organisms, reducing this etiologic component of stillbirth much further will be difficult."

		"abstract": "Zoonotic tick-borne diseases are an increasing health burden in Europe and there is speculation that this is partly due to climate change affecting vector biology and disease transmission. Data on the vector tick Ixodes ricinus suggest that an extension of its northern and altitude range has been accompanied by an increased prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis. Climate change may also be partly responsible for the change in distribution of Dermacentor reticulatus. Increased winter activity of I. ricinus is probably due to warmer winters and a retrospective study suggests that hotter summers will change the dynamics and pattern of seasonal activity, resulting in the bulk of the tick population becoming active in the latter part of the year. Climate suitability models predict that eight important tick species are likely to establish more northern permanent populations in a climate-warming scenario. However, the complex ecology and epidemiology of such tick-borne diseases as Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis make it difficult to implicate climate change as the main cause of their increasing prevalence. Climate change models are required that take account of the dynamic biological processes involved in vector abundance and pathogen transmission in order to predict future tick-borne disease scenarios."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis ticks transmit a number of human pathogens, including the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. I. scapularis suppresses host immunity in the skin to promote feeding and systemically skew T-helper (Th)-cell differentiation toward Th2 cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Although components of tick saliva are known to influence Th-cell polarization, the mechanism whereby tick feeding in the skin modulates regional and systemic Th-cell responses is unknown. In this study, the role of the epidermal Langerhans cell (LC) subset of skin dendritic cells in tick-mediated Th1/Th2-cell immunomodulation was assessed. Mice deficient in LCs (Langerin-DTA mice) exhibited enhanced lymph node (LN) concanavalin A (ConA)-induced Th1 responses after tick infestation in comparison to results for uninfested Langerin-DTA or wild-type (WT) mice, whereas effects on Th2-cell production of interleukin 4 were more variable. Nonetheless, the altered T-cell response did not impact tick feeding or refeeding. Gamma interferon production by ConA-stimulated LN cells of both WT and LC-deficient mice was enhanced by as much as fourfold after B. burgdorferi-infected-tick feeding, indicating that immunomodulatory effects of tick saliva were not able to attenuate the Th1 immune responses induced by this pathogen. Taken together, these findings show a requirement for LCs in the tick-mediated attenuation of Th1 responses in regional lymph nodes but not in the spleens of mice and show that the presence of a pathogen can overcome the Th1-inhibitory effects of tick feeding on the host."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes in the genus Borrelia are responsible for tick-borne relapsing fever and Lyme disease. Borrelia-tick interactions are highly specific as each species of Borrelia is only transmitted by one or a few closely related species of ticks. Borrelia colonize the gut or salivary glands of ticks. Several Borrelia genes required for tick colonization or transmission have been identified. Borrelia genes required for transmission are induced by a pathway controlled by the alternate sigma factors RpoN (?54) and RpoS (?S). A protein in the gut of I. scapularis ticks that functions as a receptor for B. burgdorferi has been identified. In addition, Ixodes tick saliva has proteins that alter host hemostasis and immunity, and some of these salivary proteins directly interact with Borrelia to facilitate transmission and host infection, whereas others appear to assist Borrelia indirectly by suppressing host defense mechanisms. The exciting discoveries on Borrelia-tick interactions are also being translated into novel preventive measures such as transmission blocking vaccines."

The increased number and presence of ticks in the environment pose a significant health risk to people and many domestic animals including dogs, cats, and horses. This study characterized the distribution and expansion of I. scapularis and Bb and identified areas of increased risk of LD transmission in Indiana using geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial analysis. A cross-sectional sampling was performed for 3 consecutive years (2005-2007). A total of 3,412 harvested white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were searched for ticks at Department of Natural Resources manned deer check-in stations. Hunters were asked for verbal permission to search the deer and to indicate on a road atlas where the deer was killed. All deer points were digitized into a GIS database. Identification of clustering in space and time for these organisms was performed using geostatistical software. Multiple spatial clusters of I. scapularis-infested deer were identified in western Indiana. B. burgdorferi was isolated from tick pools in 11 counties. In addition to the I. scapularis clusters, one spatial cluster of Bb-infected ticks was identified. Our current survey results and cluster analysis indicate that the western geographic regions of Indiana should be considered by the healthcare community to be at increased risk of LD compared with the rest of Indiana."

This data can provide information relevant to human infection. In total, blood samples from 296 dogs and 118 engorged ticks were examined. Samples were tested for A. phagocytophilum using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, nested PCR, and direct sequencing of the 16S rDNA, and for B. burgdorferi s. l. using PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer. In addition, blood samples were screened for antibodies to these bacteria. Ten (3.4%) dogs were PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum. Morulae of A. phagocytophilum in granulocytes were found in two of these dogs. Nine of the PCR-positive dogs had clinical signs related to anaplasmosis. Statistically significant differences in the PCR detection rates were found between breeds and between symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs. Infection with Borrelia garinii was detected by PCR in a dog with meningoencephalitis. DNA of A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi s. l. (B. garinii or Borrelia afzelii) was detected in 8.5% and 6.8% of ticks, respectively. Immunoglobulin (Ig) G seropositivity to A. phagocytophilum was 26%. Significant differences were found with respect to breed and gender. IgM and IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi s. l. were detected in 2.4% and 10.3% of dogs, respectively. Our findings suggest that the exposure to B. burgdorferi s. l. exists in dogs in the Czech Republic, and exposure to A. phagocytophilum is common."

		"abstract": "The severity, length of illness, and cost of chronic Lyme disease (CLD) have been well described. A number of oral, intravenous, and intramuscular antibiotics have been prescribed for CLD. Surprisingly few antibiotic schedules prescribed for the treatment of CLD have been evaluated in randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs). Physicians have increasingly turned to clinical treatment guideline (CPG) panels to judge the mixed results of the evidence. Two CPG panels have looked at the evidence only to reach opposite conclusions: (1) antibiotic therapy for CLD is not effective and (2) antibiotic therapy for CLD is effective. Physicians have been advised by guideline developers to use clinical discretion in diagnosing and treating CLD. Nevertheless, many health insurers - relying exclusively upon only one CPG - have a policy of automatically denying antibiotics to CLD patients regardless of the specifics of each case or the recommendations of the patient's physician. This paper examined the eight limitations of the evidence used to conclude that antibiotics therapy for CLD is not effective in forming the following hypothesis: insufficient evidence to deny antibiotic treatment to CLD patients. There are eight limitations that support the hypothesis: (1) the power of the evidence is inadequate to draw definite conclusions, (2) the evidence is too heterogeneous to make strong recommendations, (3) the risk to an individual of facing a long-term debilitating illness has not been considered, (4) the risk to society of a growing chronically ill population has not been considered, (5) treatment delay has not been considered as a confounder, (6) co-infections have not been considered as a confounder, (7) the design of RCTs did not address the range of treatment options in an actual practice, and (8) the findings cannot be generalized to actual practice. This hypothesis suggests that physicians should consider the limitations of the evidence before denying antibiotic treatment for CLD. Physicians who deny antibiotic treatment to CLD patients might inform their patients that there are some clinicians who disagree with that position, and then offer to refer them for a second opinion to a doctor who could potentially present a different point of view. The hypothesis also suggests that health care insurers should consider the limitations of the evidence before adopting policies that routinely deny antibiotic treatment for CLD patients and should expand coverage of CLD to include clinical discretion for specific clinical situations."

Expression analysis of spirochete genes encoding potential membrane proteins showed that surface-located membrane protein 1 (lmp1) transcripts were expressed at high levels in the infected murine heart, especially during early stages of infection. Mice and humans with diagnosed Lyme borreliosis also developed antibodies against Lmp1. Deletion of lmp1 severely impaired the pathogen's ability to persist in diverse murine tissues including the heart, and to induce disease, which was restored upon chromosomal complementation of the mutant with the lmp1 gene. Lmp1 performs an immune-related rather than a metabolic function, as its deletion did not affect microbial persistence in immunodeficient mice, but significantly decreased spirochete resistance to the borreliacidal effects of anti-B. burgdorferi sera in a complement-independent manner. These data demonstrate the existence of a virulence factor that helps the pathogen evade host-acquired immune defense and establish persistent infection in mammals."

The number and activation kinetics of iNKT cells vary greatly among different strains of mice. We now report the role of the iNKT cell response in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease using C57BL/6 mice, a strain with optimal iNKT cell activation that is resistant to the development of spirochetal-induced inflammation. During experimental infection of B6 mice with B. burgdorferi, iNKT cells localize to the inflamed heart where they are activated by CD1d-expressing macrophages. Activation of iNKT cells in vivo results in the production of IFN-gamma, which we demonstrate ameliorates the severity of murine Lyme carditis by at least two mechanisms. First, IFN-gamma enhances the recognition of B. burgdorferi by macrophages, leading to increased phagocytosis of the spirochete. Second, IFN-gamma activation of macrophages increases the surface expression of CD1d, thereby facilitating further iNKT activation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that in the resistant background, B6, iNKT cells modulate the severity of murine Lyme carditis through the action of IFN-gamma, which appears to self-renew through a positive feedback loop during infection."

A medical chart review was conducted of children </=18 years of age with monoarticular arthritis who underwent arthrocentesis in a pediatric emergency department located in the northeast United States. Patients were classified into 3 categories of arthritis: septic, Lyme, or nonseptic non-Lyme arthritis. Historical, clinical, and laboratory data were compared to identify distinguishing features of Lyme arthritis. One hundred seventy-nine patients were studied: 46 (26%) patients with septic arthritis, 55 (31%) patients with Lyme arthritis, and 78 (43%) patients with nonseptic non-Lyme arthritis. Compared with those with septic arthritis, patients with Lyme disease were more likely to have a tick-bite history, knee involvement, and less likely to have a history of fever or elevated temperature at triage. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, joint white blood cell count, and joint neutrophil percentage were also statistically lower. In comparison to nonseptic non-Lyme arthritis, knee involvement and tick-bite history were predictors of Lyme. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, joint white blood cell count, and joint neutrophil percentage were also statistically different. Multivariate analysis comparing Lyme to septic arthritis demonstrated fever history and elevated C-reactive protein level to be negative predictors of Lyme arthritis and knee involvement to be a positive predictor (model sensitivity: 88%; specificity: 82%). Lyme arthritis shares features with both septic and nonseptic non-Lyme arthritis. This overlap prevents the creation of a clinically useful predictive model for Lyme arthritis. In endemic areas, Lyme testing should be performed on all patients presenting with acute monoarticular arthritis."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is of significant public health importance as a vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis. The timing of seasonal activity of each immature I. scapularis life stage relative to the next is critical for the maintenance of B. burgdorferi because larvae must feed after an infected nymph to efficiently acquire the infection from reservoir hosts. Recent studies have shown that some strains of B. burgdorferi do not persist in the primary reservoir host for more than a few weeks, thereby shortening the window of opportunity between nymphal and larval feeding that sustains their enzootic maintenance. We tested the hypothesis that climate is predictive of geographic variation in the seasonal activity of I. scapularis, which in turn differentially influences the distribution of B. burgdorferi genotypes within the geographic range of I. scapularis. We analyzed the relationships between climate, seasonal activity of I. scapularis, and B. burgdorferi genotype frequency in 30 geographically diverse sites in the northeastern and midwestern United States. We found that the magnitude of the difference between summer and winter daily temperature maximums was positively correlated with the degree of seasonal synchrony of the two immature stages of I. scapularis. Genotyping revealed an enrichment of 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism sequence type 1 strains relative to others at sites with lower seasonal synchrony. We conclude that climate-associated variability in the timing of I. scapularis host seeking contributes to geographic heterogeneities in the frequencies of B. burgdorferi genotypes, with potential consequences for Lyme borreliosis morbidity."

One way that biodiversity loss threatens human health is by exacerbating risk and incidence of infectious diseases. This paper briefly reviews two zoonotic diseases--West Nile virus (WNV) illness and Lyme disease (LD)--in which high diversity in the community of vertebrate hosts for arthropod vectors strongly reduces human risk. In both cases, the primary reservoirs for the pathogen are species that dominate in human-impacted, low-diversity communities. As a result, the generalist vectors responsible for transmitting the pathogens to humans have relatively high feeding rates on these reservoirs, leading to high infection prevalence in mosquito (for WNV) and tick (for LD) vectors. In contrast, where native vertebrate diversity is high, mosquito and tick vectors evidently feed from a wider variety of hosts, most of which are poor reservoirs for the pathogens, resulting in lower infection prevalence. Protection of humans against exposure to zoonotic pathogens should be added to the list of utilitarian functions provided by high biodiversity."

Sera from 233 patients from areas of Scotland with low and high prevalence for Lyme borreliosis were tested by western blots prepared from reference strain antigen (B burgdorferi sensu stricto) and mixed antigen (B burgdorferi sensu stricto and B afzelii). Results were scored using original and revised criteria, and results were compared. The mixed antigen produced significantly more bands than the reference antigen. Using the original interpretation criteria the mixed antigen produced more positive results than the reference antigen (90 versus 85). When the revised criteria were applied to the mixed antigen there were 14 more patients with positive results than with the reference antigen (99 versus 85); this difference was significant. Although 22 patients were positive with the mixed antigen and revised criteria, but negative/equivocal with the reference antigen, eight patients who were positive with reference antigen remained negative with the mixed antigen. The positive predictive value of the two antigen preparations was the same (96%). The negative predictive value of the mixed antigen with revised criteria was higher than the reference antigen (96% versus 88%), but the specificity was similar (97% versus 98%). The mixed antigen and revised interpretation criteria have been successfully incorporated into the routine diagnostic testing service, increasing the sensitivity of the in-house IgG western blot test for Scottish patients."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, affects a large number of people in both the USA and Europe. The mouse is a natural host for this spirochete and is widely used as a model system to study Lyme pathogenesis mechanisms. Since disease manifestations often depend upon the spirochete burden in a particular tissue, it is critical to accurately measure the bacterial number in infected tissues. The current methods either lack sensitivity and specificity (SYBR Green), or require independent analysis of samples in parallel to quantitate host and bacterial DNA (TaqMan). We have developed a novel molecular beacon-based convenient multiplex real-time quantitative PCR assay to identify and detect small numbers of B. burgdorferi in infected mouse tissues. We show here that molecular beacons are effective, sensitive and specific probes for detecting and estimating wide-ranging numbers of B. burgdorferi in the presence of mouse DNA. In our assays, the spirochete recA and the mouse nidogen gene amplicons were detected simultaneously using molecular beacons labeled with different fluorophores. We further validated the application of these probes by quantifying the wild-type strain and bgp-defective mutant of B. burgdorferi. The bgp-defective mutant shows a ten-fold reduction in the level of spirochetes present in various tissues. The high sensitivity and specificity of molecular beacons makes them superior probes for the detection of small numbers of B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, the use of molecular beacons can be expanded for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multiple pathogens in the infected hosts, including humans, and in the arthropod vectors."

Treatment of impetigo in children requires consideration of concomitant diseases, the specific pathogen as well as local resistance patterns. Recently retapamulin has been released as a new antibiotic for topical use in impetigo contagiosa. Perianal streptococcal disease has been underdiagnosed and is an important differential diagnosis of perianal skin disease in children. Diagnosis is made by culturing group A beta-hemolytic streptococci; a 2-week course of oral penicillin represents the treatment of choice."

To establish infection, Bb must acquire essential nutrients, including transition metals, from its mammalian and tick hosts. Thus far, no metal transporter has been identified in Bb. Here, we report the identification of the first metal transporter, BmtA (BB0219), in Bb. BmtA-deficient mutants of virulent Bb were readily generated, and the mutants grew slightly slower than wild-type Bb in vitro. However, BmtA mutants were sensitive to the chelating actions of EDTA, suggesting a role for BmtA in metal utilization. Intracellular accumulation of manganese (Mn) was substantially diminished in the bmtA mutant, indicating that BmtA was operative in Mn uptake. Given that BmtA lacks homology to any known Mn transporter, we postulate that BmtA is part of a novel mechanism for Mn acquisition by a bacterial pathogen. BmtA also was essential to the infectious life cycle of Bb in ticks and mammals, thereby qualifying BmtA as a new borrelial virulence factor. In addition, the bmtA mutant was sensitive to treatment with t-butyl hydroperoxide, implying that BmtA, and thus Mn, is important to Bb for detoxifying reactive oxygen species, including those potentially liberated by immune effector cells during the innate immune response. Our discovery of the first molecule involved in metal transport in Bb provides a foundation for further elucidating metal homeostasis in this important human pathogen, which may lead to new strategies for thwarting Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Facial neuropathy, or seventh cranial neuropathy, is the most common cranial neuropathy. The anatomy of the facial nerve is rather complex for a cranial nerve, with a long intracranial course, in which the nerve takes three bends (or genu). Electrodiagnosis can be helpful in prognosis, but not before several days. Imaging is rarely indicated in Bell's palsy, but is often abnormal nonetheless, and can be very useful in other causes of facial neuropathy. The clinical presentation is of unilateral facial weakness of upper and lower face, hyperacusis, dysgeusia, and disordered lacrimation and salivation. Many different disease processes can result in facial neuropathy, but 70% of cases are idiopathic, or as it is best known, Bell's palsy. Ramsay Hunt syndrome, defined as facial neuropathy with herpes zoster oticus, is another common cause. Steroids given acutely are beneficial in improving outcome in Bell's palsy, and antiviral therapy seems helpful in more severe cases. Antiviral therapy is definitely helpful in Ramsay Hunt disease when given within 3 days of onset. Antibiotics are helpful in Lyme facial neuropathy, which has a very good prognosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease Borrelia can infect humans and animals for months to years, despite the presence of an active host immune response. The vls antigenic variation system, which expresses the surface-exposed lipoprotein VlsE, plays a major role in B. burgdorferi immune evasion. Gene conversion between vls silent cassettes and the vlsE expression site occurs at high frequency during mammalian infection, resulting in sequence variation in the VlsE product. In this study, we examined vlsE sequence variation in B. burgdorferi B31 during mouse infection by analyzing 1,399 clones isolated from bladder, heart, joint, ear, and skin tissues of mice infected for 4 to 365 days. The median number of codon changes increased progressively in C3H/HeN mice from 4 to 28 days post infection, and no clones retained the parental vlsE sequence at 28 days. In contrast, the decrease in the number of clones with the parental vlsE sequence and the increase in the number of sequence changes occurred more gradually in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Clones containing a stop codon were isolated, indicating that continuous expression of full-length VlsE is not required for survival in vivo; also, these clones continued to undergo vlsE recombination. Analysis of clones with apparent single recombination events indicated that recombinations into vlsE are nonselective with regard to the silent cassette utilized, as well as the length and location of the recombination event. Sequence changes as small as one base pair were common. Fifteen percent of recovered vlsE variants contained \"template-independent\" sequence changes, which clustered in the variable regions of vlsE. We hypothesize that the increased frequency and complexity of vlsE sequence changes observed in clones recovered from immunocompetent mice (as compared with SCID mice) is due to rapid clearance of relatively invariant clones by variable region-specific anti-VlsE antibody responses."

		"abstract": "Two-component systems (TCS) are universal among bacteria and play critical roles in gene regulation. Our understanding of the contributions of TCS in the biology of the Borrelia is just now beginning to develop. Borrelia burgdorferi, a causative agent of Lyme disease, harbours a TCS comprised of open reading frames (ORFs) BB0419 and BB0420. BB0419 encodes a response regulator designated Rrp1, and BB0420 encodes a hybrid histidine kinase-response regulator designated Hpk1. Rrp1, which contains a conserved GGDEF domain, undergoes phosphorylation and produces the secondary messenger, cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP), a critical signaling molecule in numerous organisms. However, the regulatory role of the Rrp1-Hpk1 TCS and c-di-GMP signaling in Borrelia biology are unexplored. In this study, the distribution, conservation, expression and potential global regulatory capability of Rrp1 were assessed. rrp1 was found to be universal and highly conserved among isolates, co-transcribed with hpk1, constitutively expressed during in vitro cultivation, and significantly upregulated upon tick feeding. Allelic exchange replacement and microarray analyses revealed that the Rrp1 regulon consists of a large number of genes encoded by the core Borrelia genome (linear chromosome, linear plasmid 54 and circular plasmid 26) that encode for proteins involved in central metabolic processes and virulence mechanisms including immune evasion."

Cryo-electron tomography was used to investigate structural features of three species, B. burgdorferi, B. garinii and B. afzelii, known to cause different clinical manifestations in humans. All three organisms revealed an overall similar architecture and showed different numbers of periplasmic flagellar filaments, polar periplasmic void regions, vesicles budding from the outer membrane sheath, which was covered by an amorphous slime layer. The latter was shown to be distinct in its density when comparing the three human-pathogenic Lyme disease spirochetes and Borrelia hermsii, a species causing relapsing fever. Tomograms of dividing bacteria revealed vesicles near the site of division and new basal bodies that were attached at each end of newly establishing cytoplasmic cylinder poles, while periplasmic flagellar filaments still passed the impending site of division. Two different kinds of cytoplasmic filaments showed similarities to MreB or FtsZ filaments of other bacteria. The similar and distinct structural features of Borrelia and the previously investigated pathogenic and non-pathogenic Treponema species emphasize the importance of further studying phylogenetically distant spirochetes."

Orthologs of EbfC are encoded by a wide range of bacterial species, so characterization of the borrelial protein has implications that span the eubacterial kingdom. The present work defines the DNA sequence required for high-affinity binding by EbfC to be the 4 bp broken palindrome GTnAC, where 'n' can be any nucleotide. Two high-affinity EbfC-binding sites are located immediately 5' of B. burgdorferi erp transcriptional promoters, and binding of EbfC was found to alter the conformation of erp promoter DNA. Consensus EbfC-binding sites are abundantly distributed throughout the B. burgdorferi genome, occurring approximately once every 1 kb. These and other features of EbfC suggest that this small protein and its orthologs may represent a distinctive type of bacterial nucleoid-associated protein. EbfC was shown to bind DNA as a homodimer, and site-directed mutagenesis studies indicated that EbfC and its orthologs appear to bind DNA via a novel alpha-helical 'tweezer'-like structure."

Patients with chronic medical disorders often have fewer hours of sleep and less restorative sleep compared to healthy individuals, and this poor sleep may worsen the subjective symptoms of the disorder. Individuals with lung disease often have disturbed sleep related to oxygen desaturations, coughing, or dyspnea. Both obstructive lung disease and restrictive lung diseases are associated with poor quality sleep. Awakenings from sleep are common in untreated or undertreated asthma, and cause sleep disruption. Gastroesophageal reflux is a major cause of disrupted sleep due to awakenings from heartburn, dyspepsia, acid brash, coughing, or choking. Patients with chronic renal disease commonly have sleep complaints often due to insomnia, insufficient sleep, sleep apnea, or restless legs syndrome. Complaints related to sleep are very common in patients with fibromyalgia and other causes of chronic pain. Sleep disruption increases the sensation of pain and decreases quality of life. Patients with infectious diseases, including acute viral illnesses, HIV-related disease, and Lyme disease, may have significant problems with insomnia and hypersomnolence. Women with menopause have from insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome, or fibromyalgia. Patients with cancer or receiving cancer therapy are often bothered by insomnia or other sleep disturbances that affect quality of life and daytime energy. The objective of this article is to review frequently encountered medical conditions and examine their impact on sleep, and to review frequent sleep-related problems associated with these common medical conditions."

Borrelia lonestari, transmitted by the tick Amblyomma americanum L., may be associated with a related syndrome, southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). Borrelia lonestari sequences, reported primarily in the southeastern states, have also been detected in ticks in northern states. It has been suggested that migratory birds may have a role in the spread of Lyme disease spirochetes. This study evaluated both migratory waterfowl and nonmigratory wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris, Eastern wild turkey) for B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari DNA sequences. A total of 389 avian blood samples (163 migratory birds representing six species, 125 wild turkeys harvested in habitats shared with migratory birds, 101 wild turkeys residing more distant from migratory flyways) were extracted, amplified, and probed to determine Borrelia presence and species identity. Ninety-one samples were positive for Borrelia spp. Among migratory birds and turkeys collected near migration routes, B. burgdorferi predominated. Among turkeys residing further away from flyways, detection of B. lonestari was more common. All A. americanum ticks collected from these areas were negative for Borrelia DNA; no I. scapularis were found. To our knowledge, this represents the first documentation of B. lonestari among any birds."

The prevalence of Lyme borreliosis is estimated to be 20-100 cases per 100,000 persons in the United States and 100-155 cases per 100,000 persons in Europe [ 1 , 2 ]. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [ 2 , 3 ]. The course of clinical manifestations is thought to occur in 3 stages: early, disseminated, and chronic [ 2 , 4 ]. Lyme borreliosis can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, and the frequency of these manifestations among cases of Lyme disease involving systemic manifestations is approximately 1% [ 5 ]."

The spirochete burden in bladder tissue (a site of spirochete persistence) was documented by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immune responses were analyzed. In C3H/HeJ mice, three B. burgdorferi isolates and two of the three B. garinii isolates induced severe arthritis and swelling. Previous designation as invasive or noninvasive B. garinii, or RNA spacer type of B. burgdorferi did not determine arthritis severity induced by isolates. Compared with the other five isolates, the B. garinii PBi isolate induced significantly less arthritis, a lower humoral immune response, and persisted at a much lower level in bladder tissue. However, B. garinii PBi isolates induced similar Borrelia antigen-specific inflammatory T cell responses from the local draining lymph node. Thus, diverse B. burgdorferi and B. garinii isolates were highly arthritogenic in immune competent mice."

However, the DNA of Borrelia valaisiana, Borrelia lusitaniae, Borrelia spielmanii and Borrelia bissettii has already been detected in samples of human origin, or the spirochetes were isolated from the patients with symptoms of LB. Molecular analysis of 12 selected serum samples collected in the regional hospital confirmed the presence of B. bissettii DNA in cases of single and multiple infection in patients with symptomatic borreliosis or chronic borrelial infection. The presence of B. bissettii as a single strain in patients provides strong support of the fact that B. bissettii might be a causative agent of the disease. After the first isolation of B. bissettii from the samples of human origin in Slovenia, following the detection of this species in cardiac valve tissue of the patient with endocarditis and aortic valve stenosis in the Czech Republic, here we present additional molecular data supporting the involvement of B. bissettii in LB in Europe."

Zoonoses such as Lyme borreliosis, tularemia, and tick-borne rickettsioses can emerge in previously nonendemic areas when circumstances favorable to their maintenance and transmission arise. Tick-borne zoonosis can be prevented by implementation and adoption of an integrated program to reduce the likelihood of tick bites on pets and their owners."

They possess unusual, highly segmented genomes composed mostly of linear replicons with covalently closed hairpin telomeres. The telomeres are formed from inverted repeat replicated telomere junctions (rTels) by the telomere resolvase, ResT. ResT uses a reaction mechanism with similarities to that employed by the type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. Here, we report that the relationship of ResT to the tyrosine recombinases extends to the ability to synapse-replicated telomeres and to catalyse the formation of a Holliday junction. We also report that ResT can use asymmetrized substrates that mimic the properties of a recombination site for a tyrosine recombinase, to form Holliday junctions. We propose a model for how this explains the origin of genome linearity in the genus Borrelia."

		"abstract": "This review article summarizes the ectoparasitic diseases likely to be seen by a Western dermatologist. The article aims to cover both endemic diseases and those likely to present in the returning traveler. Tungiasis is due to the gravid sand flea (Tunga penetrans) embedding into the stratum corneum of a human host. As the flea is a ground dweller, lesions are usually present on the feet and are classically periungual. The sand flea is eventually shed spontaneously but to reduce the infection risk, early surgical removal is recommended. Infestation by the Diptera species of fly causes myiasis, which may be primary, secondary, or accidental. The botfly (Dermatobia hominis) is one of the causes of primary myiasis covered in this article. Traditionally, botfly larvae are forced to partially emerge by occluding the breathing apparatus, following which manual extraction can occur. Alternatively, the larvae can be surgically removed. The common bed bug (Cimex lectularius) has experienced a resurgence over the past 10 years. Bites are typically arranged in clusters or a linear fashion and vary from urticated wheals to hemorrhagic blisters. Treatment is symptomatic with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. In addition, bed bugs need to be eradicated from furniture and soft furnishings. Ticks are part of the Arachnid class of joint-legged animals and can transmit a variety of infections. This article briefly discusses Mediterranean spotted fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme disease as well as describing tick avoidance measures. Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei var hominis) is highly contagious and widely distributed around the world. It is common in the returning traveler and can require a high index of suspicion to diagnose. The treatment of choice in the US, UK, and Australia is permethrin 5% dermal cream, applied on two occasions, 1 week apart."

The lumen of myocardial capillaries was founded mostly filled with detritus and fibrin precipitate, between them several bacterial fragments were identified. The electron-microscopic characteristics of the microorganisms in this specimen, revealing irregularly coiled appearance and consistent thickness of 0.2 μm, correspond to the spiral-like structure of Lyme disease borrelia. The presence of fibrin deposits on the capillary endothelium and necrosis of myocardiocytes, suggests that the cardiopathy in our patient was represent borrelia-mediated damage of the heart microcirculation."

		"abstract": "When taking their blood meal on the mammalian host, ticks transfer a multitude of different proteins from their saliva into the host. Some of these proteins are hijacked by pathogens for their own purposes. Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, is critically dependent on the presence of the tick protein Salp15 when infecting the host. Similarly, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which causes anaplasmosis, needs Salp16, a homologue of Salp15, to get transferred from the host into the tick. Here we analyzed whether adaptive evolution has shaped the Salp15 protein family. Using site-specific estimates of K(A)/K(S) ratios, we identified different positions within the Salp15 protein family which have undergone a phase of positive selection. Additionally, we analyzed the B. burgdorferi protein interacting with Salp15, OspC. Again, sites showing signs of positive selection were identified, although they are more likely a result of the antigenic features of OspC than of the influence of Salp15. The identification of probably functionally relevant sites in the Salp15 family might direct the detailed experimental analysis of their interaction with human and bacterial proteins."

While the percent positive test results varied by agent in different regions of the United States, with D. immitis antigen and antibodies to E. canis more commonly identified in dogs from the South (3.9% and 1.3%, respectively), and antibody to B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum found more frequently in dogs from the upper Midwest and Northeast (4.0-6.7% and 5.5-11.6%, respectively), evidence of at least one agent was found in dogs from every state considered. Furthermore, each organism also appeared to occur in endemic foci within larger areas of relatively low prevalence. Relocation of infected or previously exposed dogs from endemic regions likely accounts for some of the unexpected geographic distribution seen, although local transmission in previously under-recognized areas of endemicity could also be occurring. Although data were only available from the 48 contiguous states (Alaska and Hawaii were not included), taken together, our results suggest that these disease agents may be present over a wider geographic area, and thus pose greater animal and public health risks, than is currently recognized. Dogs can serve as sentinels to identify the presence of vector-borne disease agents of both veterinary and public health significance."

The influence of the feeding of uninfected nymphs on the proliferation and distribution of intradermally inoculated spirochetes was compared with the effect of co-inoculated saliva or salivary gland extract (SGE), respectively. Spirochete loads in murine tissues were evaluated using real-time q-PCR. SGE induced significantly increased spirochete numbers in the skin on the days 4 and 6 post-infection (p.i.). On the other hand, decreased bacterial load in the heart of SGE-treated mice was demonstrated in comparison with control animals. The inoculation of tick saliva increased spirochete load in the urinary bladder on day 6 p.i., while the number of spirochetes in the heart declined on day 6 p.i. The feeding of I. ricinus nymphs raised the spirochete load in the bladder on the days 4 and 6 p.i. On day 6, the number of spirochetes found in the heart was significantly lower than in controls. The prevalence of spirochetes in ticks infected by feeding on mice was more than 10 times higher when the mice were infected with the mixture of spirochetes and saliva or SGE, in comparison with spirochetes alone. The presence of SGE in the infectious inoculum increased the spirochete burden per tick from 0 to almost 28,000. Taken together, these results show a very early effect of tick saliva on the proliferation and distribution of Borrelia spirochetes in the host, probably due to the effect of saliva on the host innate immunity mechanisms."

A single patient reported erythema chronicum migrans after a tick bite. Examination of the cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytosis and protein elevation in 3 patients. Serological tests for Lyme disease were positive in the serum in all 4 patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid in 2 patients. Antibiotic therapy ensured a favorable outcome in all 4 cases. Two patients achieved a full recovery within 6 months. Parsonage-Turner syndrome should be added to the list of manifestations of neuroborreliosis. Serological tests for Lyme disease should be performed routinely in patients with Parsonage-Turner syndrome."

We have now examined these immunologic markers in patients with chronic Lyme disease compared to appropriate disease controls. The study population consisted of 29 healthy controls, 445 patients with chronic Lyme disease, 11 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and six patients with AIDS. The Lyme disease patients were divided according to predominant musculoskeletal symptoms (324 patients) or predominant neurologic symptoms (121 patients). C3a and C4a levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. All patients with chronic Lyme disease and AIDS had normal C3a levels compared to controls, whereas patients with SLE had significantly increased levels of this marker. Patients with predominant musculoskeletal symptoms of Lyme disease and AIDS patients had significantly increased levels of C4a compared to either controls, patients with predominant neurologic symptoms of Lyme disease or SLE patients. Response to antibiotic therapy in chronic Lyme disease was associated with a significant decrease in the C4a level, whereas lack of response was associated with a significant increase in this marker. In contrast, AIDS patients had persistently increased C4a levels despite antiretroviral therapy. Lyme patients with positive single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scans had significantly lower C4a levels compared to Lyme patients with normal SPECT scan results. Patients with predominant musculoskeletal symptoms of Lyme disease have normal C3a and increased C4a levels. This pattern differs from the increase in both markers seen in acute Lyme disease, and C4a changes correlate with the response to therapy in chronic Lyme disease. C4a appears to be a valuable immunologic marker in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi exploits multiple strategies to evade host immune responses. One central immune escape mechanism is the inactivation of the host complement attack by acquisition host complement regulators FHL-1 and factor H via complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (BbCRASPs). The BbCRASP-1 protein is the first bacterial factor H/FHL-1-binding protein for which the atomic structure has been solved. Previously, 3 regions including the C terminus were identified as putative contact sites for the two complement regulators by the pepspot analysis. Based on the crystallographic structure an in vitro mutagenesis approach was conducted to identify amino acid residues which are relevant for FHL-1 and factor H binding by exchanging single or multiple residues in region 1 and the C-terminally located region 3. Single changes at 4 positions in region 1 either reduced (Lys136, Lys141, Glu147) or completely eliminated (Leu146) binding of both complement regulators. Substitutions clustered within the C-terminal region decreased (Glu234, Lys238, Tyr239, Lys241, Asp244, Thr245) or abolished binding (Lys240, Asp242, Leu246) of both complement regulators. Mapping the mutations onto the atomic structure of BbCRASP-1 reveals that, in contrast to earlier assumption, the C-terminal mutations act indirectly on FHL-1 and factor H binding, whilst the region 1 mutations map the site of direct complement regulator interaction. The elucidation of BbCRASP-1 structure - function may allow development of novel therapeutic strategies against Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Despite a now codified antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, a significant proportion of patients treated according to recommendations complain of persistent signs and symptoms. The pathophysiological mechanisms which underlie this syndrome of post-treatment chronic systemic illness remain unclear. For some physicians post-treatment symptoms indicate a persistent infection requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy. For others, there is no benefit from antimicrobial therapy. The difficulty of assessment encountered in studies is significant because many symptoms are subjective. We think that the term \"chronic Lyme disease\" is not appropriate and should be replaced by chronic \"tick associated poly-organic syndrome\" (TAPOS). This open-label prospective study was made on a group of 100 patients having followed a medical treatment for a chronic TAPOS and to evaluate their evolution under prolonged antibiotic treatment. The medical management was found to be effective for symptoms, especially for patients with a high probability of chronic TAPOS (NEJM score). Patients with post tick-bite symptoms, which often worsens their quality of life, deserve particular attention. This study had methodological limitations but could help in terms of feasibility, choice of inclusion criteria, and design of follow-up for a future randomized, double blind study to test for an optimal management of TAPOS."

		"abstract": "The genome of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi contains about a dozen linear DNA molecules that carry covalently closed hairpin telomeres as a specialized mechanism for dealing with the end-replication problem. The hairpin telomeres are generated from replicative intermediates through a two-step transesterification promoted by the telomere resolvase ResT. Although the genome of B. burgdorferi has been sequenced, the sequence of most telomeres has remained unknown because of difficulties in recovering and completely sequencing the covalently closed hairpin ends. In this study we report a new approach for the direct sequencing Borrelia telomeres and report the sequence, characterization, and in vitro reaction properties of 19 unique telomeres. Surprisingly, a variation of greater than 160-fold in the initial reaction rates of in vitro ResT-mediated telomere resolution was observed between the most active and least active telomeres. Moreover, three of the hairpin telomeres were completely inactive in vitro, but their in vivo functionality was demonstrated. Our results provide important new information on the structure and function of the B. burgdorferi telomeres and suggest the possibility that factors besides the telomere resolvase ResT may influence the reaction in vivo and rescue those telomeres that are not functional in vitro with ResT alone."

Serum samples were evaluated for specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi by use of 3 serologic assays. Ticks from dogs were subjected to PCR assays for detection of pathogens. Of 353 serum samples from dogs in 18 counties in 2005, only 2 (0.6%) contained western blot analysis-confirmed antibodies against B burgdorferi. Ten of 13 dogs with I scapularis were from clinics within or immediately adjacent to the known tick invasion zone. Six of 18 I scapularis and 12 of 60 noncompetent vector ticks were infected with B burgdorferi. No ticks were infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and 3 were infected with Babesia spp. Serosurvey in dogs was found to be ineffective in tracking early invasion dynamics of I scapularis in this area. Tick chemoprophylaxis likely reduces serosurvey sensitivity in dogs. Ticks infected with B burgdorferi were more common and widely dispersed than seropositive dogs. In areas of low tick density, use of dogs as a source of ticks is preferable to serosurvey for surveillance of emerging Lyme disease. By retaining ticks from dogs for identification and pathogen testing, veterinarians can play an important role in early detection in areas with increasing risk of Lyme disease."

Clinical picture is diverse, borreliosis can affect skin, nervous system, musculoskeletal system and heart.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the level of neopterin in serum and cerebrospinal fluid in borreliosis and correlate it with the symptoms, markers of inflammation in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and serological tests against Borrelia burgdorferi. We have enrolled in the study 39 patients treated for Lyme borreliosis. The level of neopterin in serum was assessed in all patients, among patient with suspicion of neuroborreliosis (n = 33) we assessed the level of neopterin, protein, glucose and chlorium in CSF. The level of neopterin in CSF was lower among patients who were treated due to presence of erithema migrans in their past regarding patients who had never had erithema migrans (p = 0.008). The level of neopterin in CSF was higher (6.6 nmol/l) in patients with the presence of inflammation in CSF versus patients with no changes in CSF (3.8 mmol/l; p = 0.019). There was no correlation between neopterin in serum or CSF and Westernblot test. Patients with neuroborreliosis who had lymphocytic meningitis had higher level of neopterin in CSF. We suggest the role of neopterin in pathogenesis on neuroborreliosis. Neopterin as a marker of cytotoxic lymphocytes T activities can be useful in borreliosis diagnosis but more studies regarding this problem should be done."

To understand this protective response, we characterized splenic and peritoneal B cell compartments during infection using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. In the spleen, early after infection, Borrelia crocidurae, a relapsing fever species, induced a striking loss of marginal zone (MZ) B cells from the MZ, while Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, induced the expansion of this subset. At the same time, no significant changes were observed in follicular B cells in response to either species of Borrelia. In the peritoneal cavity, a further loss was demonstrated early in response to B. crocidurae in the B1b, B1c, and B2 cell subsets, but B1a cells were not significantly altered. The loss of B1c and B2 cells was sustained through subsequent peaks of spirochetemia, suggesting these subsets may be important in resolving relapsing episodes. In contrast, an early and significant increase in peritoneal B1a, B1b, and B1c cells, but not B2 cells, occurred in response to B. burgdorferi. Later in the course of infection, both species of Borrelia induced the selective expansion of peritoneal B1b cells, suggesting that B1b cells may participate in long-lasting immunity to Lyme and relapsing fever spirochetes. Our data demonstrate that different Borrelia can activate the same B cell subsets in distinct ways and they each elicit a complex interplay of MZ and multiple peritoneal B cell subsets in the early response to infection."

The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a complete (third degree) heart block with a bradycardic ventricular escape rhythm. The patient reported having had an rash on his right lower leg six weeks previously. After spreading centrifugally it had turned pale in its centre, then regressed and finally disappeared. After having been supplied with a temporary pacemaker in a county hospital the patient was transferred to our hospital. The ECG showed pacemaker stimulation of the ventricle at about 60 beats/min. Without this stimulation the complete atrioventricular block persisted. Coronary heart disease was excluded by angiography and levocardiography revealed normal systolic left ventricular function. Serological findings were a positive titre of IgG-antibodies against Borrelia while the IgM titre was negative. The heart block disappeared under antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxon within eight days, after first changing to transitory second and first-degree atrioventricular block, and the pacemaker was removed. The patient did not develop any neurological symptoms. Cardiac involvement in Lyme disease can be the only manifestation of borreliosis. Possible reversibility under antibiotic therapy is an important aspect of diagnosis. In spite of atypical serology the combination of history, symptoms and serological findings will lead to the diagnosis Lyme disease."

During the postbreeding period (July to September 2005), 1,080 passerine birds infested by 2,240 Ixodes ricinus subadult ticks were examined. Borrelia garinii was detected in 22.2% of the ticks, Borrelia valaisiana was detected in 12.8% of the ticks, Borrelia afzelii was detected in 1.6% of the ticks, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in 0.3% of the ticks. After analysis of infections in which the blood meal volume and the stage of the ticks were considered, we concluded that Eurasian blackbirds (Turdus merula), song thrushes (Turdus philomelos), and great tits (Parus major) are capable of transmitting B. garinii; that juvenile blackbirds and song thrushes are prominent reservoirs for B. garinii spirochetes; that some other passerine birds investigated play minor roles in transmitting B. garinii; and that the presence B. afzelii in ticks results from infection in a former stage. Thus, while B. garinii transmission is associated with only a few passerine bird species, these birds have the potential to distribute millions of Lyme disease spirochetes between urban areas."

The vaccinated dogs produced high titers of anti-OspA and anti-OspC borreliacidal antibodies, including borreliacidal antibodies specific for an epitope within the last seven amino acids at the OspC carboxy terminus (termed OspC7) that was conserved among pathogenic Borrelia genospecies. In addition, spirochetes were eliminated from the infected ticks that fed on the bacterin recipients, B. burgdorferi was not isolated from the skin or joints, and antibody responses associated specifically with canine infection with B. burgdorferi were not produced. In contrast, B. burgdorferi was recovered from engorged ticks that fed on 13 (87%) placebo-vaccinated dogs (P<0.0001), skin biopsy specimens from 14 (93%) dogs (P<0.0001), and joint tissue specimens from 8 (53%) dogs (P=0.0022). In addition, 14 (93%) dogs developed specific antibody responses against B. burgdorferi proteins, including 11 (73%) with C6 peptide antibodies (P<0.0001). Moreover, 10 (67%) dogs developed Lyme disease-associated joint abnormalities (P<0.0001), including 4 (27%) dogs that developed joint stiffness or lameness and 6 (40%) that developed chronic joint inflammation (synovitis). The results therefore confirmed that the bacterin provided a high level of protection against Lyme disease shortly after immunization."

We inactivated the gene encoding for superoxide dismutase A (sodA, bb0153), an enzyme mediating the dismutation of superoxide anions and examined the in vitro and in vivo phenotype of the mutant. There were no significant differences in the in vitro growth characteristics of the sodA mutant compared with the control strains. Microscopic analysis of viability of spirochaetes revealed greater percentage of cell death upon treatment of sodA mutant with superoxide generators compared with its controls. Infectivity analysis in C3H/HeN mice following intradermal needle inoculation of 10(3) or 10(5) spirochaetes per mouse revealed complete attenuation of infectivity for the sodA mutant compared with control strains at 21 days post infection. The sodA mutant was more susceptible to the effects of activated macrophages and neutrophils, suggesting that its in vivo phenotype is partly due to the killing effects of activated immune cells. These studies indicate that SodA plays an important role in combating oxidative stress and is essential for the colonization and dissemination of B. burgdorferi in the murine model of Lyme disease."

Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that bb0666 along with two other genes (bb0665 and bb0667) are cotranscribed with the motility and chemotaxis genes. This newly identified operon is termed as pami. Sequence and primer extension analyses showed that pami was regulated by a sigma(70)-like promoter, which is designated as P(ami). Transcriptional analysis using a gene encoding green fluorescence protein as a reporter demonstrated that P(ami) functions in both Escherichia coli and B. burgdorferi. Genetic studies showed that the Deltabb0666 mutant grows in long chains of unseparated cells, whose phenotype is similar to its counterparts in E. coli. Taken together, these results demonstrate that bb0666 is a homolog of MurNac-LAAs that contributes to the cell division of B. burgdorferi."

A causative role of Borrelia burgdorferi infection has been controversially discussed, but no conclusive solution has yet been achieved. Intrigued by 3 young patients with severe Borrelia-associated morphea and high-titer antinuclear antibodies, we retrospectively examined the relationship between Borrelia exposure, serologic autoimmune phenomena and age at disease onset in morphea patients. In 90 morphea patients the presence of Borrelia-specific serum antibodies was correlated to the age at disease onset and the presence and titers of antinuclear antibodies. Patients with active Borrelia infection or high-titer antinuclear antibodies due to systemic sclerosis or lupus erythematosus served as controls. We observed a statistically highly significant association between morphea, serologic evidence of Borrelia infection, and high-titer antinuclear antibodies when disease onset was in childhood or adolescence. Because pathogenic Borrelia species may vary in different geographic regions the relevance of Borrelia infection in morphea induction may show regional variations. B burgdorferi infection may be relevant for the induction of a distinct autoimmune type of scleroderma; it may be called \"Borrelia-associated early onset morphea\" and is characterized by the combination of disease onset at younger age, infection with B burgdorferi, and evident autoimmune phenomena as reflected by high-titer antinuclear antibodies. As exemplified by the case reports, it may take a particularly severe course and require treatment of both infection and skin inflammation."

		"abstract": "Persistent Lyme Disease Symptoms (PLDS) have included fatigue, headaches, poor concentration and memory, lightheadedness, joint pain, and mood disturbances. Evidence-based guidelines committees disagree over the severity of PLDS. The 2004 International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) concluded that PLDS are severe. The 2006 Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines committee concluded that PLDS are nothing more than the \"aches and pains of daily living\" and an ad hoc International Lyme group concluded that PLDS are \"symptoms common in persons who have never had Lyme disease.\" Clinical trials validate the severity of persistent Lyme disease symptoms. There are 22 standardized instruments used to measure the severity of PLDS among the four published National Institutes of Health (NIH) sponsored double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). VALIDATING THE HYPOTHESIS: All four NIH sponsored RCTs validate the severity of PLDS. PLDS are as severe as symptoms seen in other serious chronic illnesses, and result in a quality of life lower than for the general population as determined by 22 standardized measures of QOL, including fatigue, pain, role function, psychopathology, and cognition. None of the four RCTs support the IDSA hypothesis that PLDS are nothing more than \"the aches and pains of daily living\" nor the ad hoc International Lyme group conclusion that PLDS are \"symptoms common in persons who have never had Lyme disease.\" If the QOL of life for these patients is as poor as for patients with other serious chronic diseases, their symptoms need to be addressed by their doctors. Studies differ as to the precise cause of PLDS, the most effective treatments, and whether a cure is possible. But the fact that there is disagreement is not a license for physicians to ignore or turn away patients complaining of PLDS, or to dismiss their symptoms as purely psychosomatic. For physicians, the goal or purpose of treating PLDS should be the same as their purpose in treating other chronic illnesses that result in a poor QOL: vigorous pursuit of a cure, and where a cure proves impossible, amelioration of patients' symptoms and suffering. Even if this hypothesis fails to be apply to more than a fraction of the total Lyme disease population, this still represents a significant number of patients, and these findings could address a neglected aspect of caring for patients with Lyme disease."

This methodology offers a new means for studying the native architecture of bacteria by eliminating the chemical fixing, dehydration, and staining steps of conventional electron microscopy. Using electron cryotomography, we noted that membrane blebs formed at the ends of the cells. These blebs may be precursors to vesicles that are released from cells grown in vivo and in vitro. We found that the periplasmic space of B. burgdorferi was quite narrow (16.0 nm) compared to those of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, in the vicinity of the periplasmic flagella, this space was considerably wider (42.3 nm). In contrast to previous results, the periplasmic flagella did not form a bundle but rather formed a tight-fitting ribbon that wraps around the protoplasmic cell cylinder in a right-handed sense. We show how the ribbon configuration of the assembled periplasmic flagella is more advantageous than a bundle for both swimming and forming the flat-wave morphology. Previous results indicate that B. burgdorferi motility is dependent on the rotation of the periplasmic flagella in generating backward-moving waves along the length of the cell. This swimming requires that the rotation of the flagella exerts force on the cell cylinder. Accordingly, a ribbon is more beneficial than a bundle, as this configuration allows each periplasmic flagellum to have direct contact with the cell cylinder in order to exert that force, and it minimizes interference between the rotating filaments."

Bound plasminogen is converted to the serine protease plasmin and thereby may facilitate the bacterium's dissemination throughout the host by degrading extracellular matrix. In this work, we demonstrate plasminogen binding by three highly similar borrelial outer surface proteins, ErpP, ErpA, and ErpC, all of which are expressed during mammalian infection. Extensive characterization of ErpP demonstrated that this protein bound in a dose-dependent manner to lysine binding site I of plasminogen. Removal of three lysine residues from the carboxy terminus of ErpP significantly reduced binding of plasminogen, and the presence of a lysine analog, epsilon-aminocaproic acid, inhibited the ErpP-plasminogen interaction, thus strongly pointing to a primary role for lysine residues in plasminogen binding. Ionic interactions are not required in ErpP binding of plasminogen, as addition of excess NaCl or the polyanion heparin did not have any significant effect on binding. Plasminogen bound to ErpP could be converted to the active enzyme, plasmin. The three plasminogen-binding Erp proteins can also bind the host complement regulator factor H. Plasminogen and factor H bound simultaneously and did not compete for binding to ErpP, indicating separate binding sites for both host ligands and the ability of the borrelial surface proteins to bind both host proteins."

The goal of this article is 4-fold: (i) to detail LD infection and pathology, (ii) to review prevalent diagnostic methods, emphasizing inherent problems, (iii) to introduce the usage of in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) in clinical diagnostics and (iv) to underscore the relevance of a novel comprehensive LD diagnostic approach to practitioners of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).

Here, we determined the primary structure of alpha(2)-macroglobulin from the hard tick Ixodes ricinus (IrAM) by sequencing of overlapping PCR products. Predicted disulfide and glycosylation patterns, post-translational cleavage and alternative splicing within its 'bait region' demonstrate that IrAM is closely related to the alpha(2)-macroglobulin from the soft tick Ornithodoros moubata. The IrAM message is expressed in all tick developmental stages and tissues, except for the gut, and the protein was detected to be mainly present in the hemolymph. Silencing of IrAM by dsRNA interference markedly reduced the phagocytosis of a potential pathogen, Chryseobacterium indologenes, by tick hemocytes both in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, phagocytosis of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi or a commensal bacteria Staphylococcus xylosus was not affected by the IrAM knock-down. Similar results were obtained upon deactivation of all thioester proteins in tick hemolymph by methylamine. We have further demonstrated that phagocytosis of C. indologenes is dependent on an active metalloprotease secreted by the bacteria. These data indicate that interaction of tick alpha(2)-macroglobulin with a protease of an invading pathogen is linked with cellular immune response."

		"abstract": "Bernese Mountain dogs (BMDs) are prone to develop a familial glomerulonephropathy and a pathogenic role of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in this disease has been suspected. Glomerular disease in many affected dogs is clinically inapparent and proteinuria is found incidentally. In this study, urine protein excretion was evaluated in 122 clinically healthy BMDs and 55 controls. The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi in BMDs was 57%, compared to 16% in controls. There were no significant differences in the occurrence of positive dipstick results, microalbuminuria, urine protein-to-urine creatinine ratio or abnormal urine protein pattern (determined by sodium dodecyl sulphate agarose gel electrophoresis) between BMDs and controls and BMDs with and without antibodies against B. burgdorferi. It was concluded that antibodies against B. burgdorferi are not associated with proteinuria as an early sign of renal disease in BMDs."

One of the most prominent clinical manifestations is the development of chronic Lyme arthritis. Months after Bb infection, approximately 60% of untreated Lyme patients experience intermittent arthritic attacks that may last for years. The use of the CD28(-/-) mouse in Bb infection has helped to shed light into the mechanisms that govern this inflammatory process, which seems to be tightly regulated. In this current review, the effect of immunoregulation, as well as CD28 deficiency in the development of chronic Lyme arthritis is discussed."

Coinfection of humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and ticks with both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum appears to be common, yet the pathologic mechanisms and ecology remain poorly understood compared with single-agent infection. We compiled available literature describing experimental and naturally occurring coinfection with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in I. ricinus-complex ticks and host species, including wildlife, humans, livestock, and pets; calculated odds ratios for coinfection risks; evaluated the hypotheses that odds ratios for coinfection differ significantly between different tick life stages, ticks and vertebrate hosts, and reservoir and nonreservoir hosts; and finally, calculated the predicted coinfection prevalence based on the probability of each pathogen alone and compared this to the reported coinfection prevalence. Sixty-one manuscripts referenced coinfection or coexposure between these pathogens, with prevalence estimates for coinfection up to 67% in vertebrates and 28% in ticks. Of 61 different reports of coinfection or coexposure, 18 had odds ratios for coinfection significantly higher than 1. The combined odds ratios for coinfection in vertebrates and ticks were 1.9 and 1.28, respectively, with statistically significant variability among host and tick species in odds ratios. The overall predicted coexposure prevalence for vertebrates was 3.1% compared with an observed 8.9% prevalence. Odds ratios were not significantly different among classes of vertebrate hosts, species of ticks, stages of ticks, or ticks compared with hosts. We confirm a considerable level of coinfection and coexposure with these pathogens, although not predictably across host or tick species or geographical region."

		"abstract": "The duration of tick feeding is an important indicator to evaluate the risk of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato transmission, which increases considerably with the blood meal duration. This blood meal duration may be estimated from scutal index, the ratio between body length (idiosoma) and scutum width. For the estimation of blood meal duration in Ixodes ricinus, nymphal and adult female ticks were detached at predetermined intervals (24, 48, 72, and 96h) from laboratory mice and rabbits and their scutal index calculated. From this, non-linear regression equations were developed to determine the duration of attachment for nymphal and adult female I. ricinus ticks. As part of an epidemiological study addressing the risk of subclinical (seroconversion) and clinical infections after a tick bite in the Neuchâtel area (Switzerland) over 3 years (2003-2005), duration of tick attachment and anatomical site of bites collected on participants as well as seasonal distribution of tick bites were studied. Tick attachment duration was estimated in all ticks collected during this study (n=261). Nymphs were attached for a mean (+/- standard error, SE) of 31.6h (+/-2.6) and females for a mean (+/-SE) of 29.6h (+/-3.2). Most nymphs were removed after 24h of blood meal whereas most females were removed before 24h. Legs were the major anatomical sites of bites for women (40.7%), men (44.4%), and almost all age classes. Only children <10 years old were bitten more frequently on the head (41.2%) and on the neck (38.5%) than participants >10 years. The majority of tick bites were recorded from May to July during the 3 years. Attachment sites can influence the discovery of ticks, hence the duration of the tick bite. A detailed body examination after each outing in forest and an early withdrawal of an attached tick is an effective way to prevent Lyme borreliosis."

In most textbooks it is assigned to the incoherent conglomeration of figurate or gyrate erythemas. To re-evaluate a large cohort of patients with EAC and to assess the evidence for infection with Borrelia. We retrospectively investigated 90 cases with the diagnosis of EAC. Haematoxylin and eosin sections were re-examined and diagnoses were specified; these were then confirmed by clinicopathological correlation. Infection with Borrelia was assessed by focus-floating microscopy and by a Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Besides a miscellaneous group of annular disorders at times confused with EAC such as urticaria, leucocytoclastic vasculitis and psoriasis (20 of 90; 22%), EAC appeared to serve as a collective term for three main clinicopathological reaction patterns: (i) (tumid) lupus erythematosus (29 of 90; 32%), (ii) spongiotic dermatitides (25 of 90; 28%) and (iii) pseudolymphoma (16 of 90; 18%). In 13 of 16 (81%) cases with a pseudolymphomatous reaction pattern spirochaetes stained positive but were negative in other reaction patterns of EAC as well as in negative controls. These findings were confirmed by a Borrelia-specific PCR which was positive in two of three (67%) of these pseudolymphomatous EAC cases but was negative in all other variants of EAC (none of five) as well as 20 controls. We conclude that 'EAC' is a clinical reaction pattern that does not represent a specific clinicopathological entity and should lead to consideration of mainly lupus erythematosus, dermatitis and, in some cases, cutaneous Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spielmanii, one of the etiological agents of Lyme disease found in Europe, evades host complement-mediated killing by recruitment of the immune regulators factor H and FHL-1 from human serum. Serum-resistant and intermediate serum-resistant isolates express up to 3 distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) that bind factor H and/or FHL-1. The present study describes identification and functional characterization of BsCRASP-1 as the dominant factor H and FHL-1 binding protein of B. spielmanii. BsCRASP-1 is a 27.7kDa outer surface lipoprotein, which after processing has a predicted mass of 24.9kDa. BsCRASP-1 is encoded by a single copy gene, cspA, that maps to a linear plasmid of approximately 55kb. Ligand affinity blot techniques revealed that both native and recombinant BsCRASP-1 from different isolates can strongly bind FHL-1, but only weakly factor H. Deletion mutants of recombinant BsCRASP-1 were generated and a high-affinity binding site for factor H and FHL-1 was mapped to its carboxy-terminal 10-amino-acid residue domain. Similarly, the dominant binding site of factor H and FHL-1 was localized to short consensus repeats (SCRs) 5-7. Factor H and FHL-1 maintained cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation when bound to full-length BsCRASP-1 but not to a deletion mutant lacking the carboxy-terminal 10-amino-acid residue domain. In conclusion, BsCRASP-1 binds the host immune regulators factor H and FHL-1, and is suggested to represent a key molecule of B. spielmanii for complement resistance. Thus, BsCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. spielmanii and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

He had papillitis and an exudative subretinal macular lesion OD. Treatment was started with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone; a week later, IV methylprednisolone was administered with a tapering dose of oral steroids thereafter. Three months later, VA had improved to 3/60 OD. Patient 2: 38-year-old healthy female presenting with reduced left-eye vision (6/24) 6 weeks after a tick bite. She also suffered from erythema migrans and arthralgias. She had left-eye papillitis, macular haemorrhages and vascular sheathing. Treatment was started with IV ceftriaxone. One month later, there was profound loss of vision with development of CNVM. Treatment was declined by the patient and eventually retinal fibrosis developed. Inflammatory CNVM has not been described previously in the setting of ocular Lyme borreliosis. We herein describe the occurrence of inflammatory CNVM in two patients whose diagnosis with Lyme disease was clinically based--both were sero-negative. Visual outcome in the two patients was profoundly impaired because of the ensuing macular scar."

A total of 2832 host-seeking Ixodes ricinus (2660 nymphs and 172 adults) were collected, with maximal abundance in June and a minor second increase in abundance in August. The spatial and temporal variation in tick abundance was closely related to the air temperature, relative humidity, soil water content and specific vegetation type. Increases in tick abundances in individual habitats were most likely caused by climate change and/or anthropogenic interventions such as increased numbers of wild boar, a host of I. ricinus. When combined with data from previous investigations a correlation of plant communities with six semi-qualitative tick abundance categories (ranging from 'no ticks' to 'very high tick abundance') was revealed, and GIS analysis indicated that 56.5% of the 'Siebengebirge' is made up of plant communities belonging to the three highest tick abundance categories. Therefore, the risk of visitors in the 'Siebengebirge' of being exposed to tick bites and being infected by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato had increased."

The first mosquito to be sequenced was Anopheles gambiae, the vector for Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Further mosquitoes have followed: Aedes aegypti (yellow fever and dengue fever vector) and Culex pipiens (lymphatic filariasis and West Nile fever). Species that are currently in sequencing include the body louse Pediculus humanus (Typhus vector), the triatomine Rhodnius prolixus (Chagas disease vector) and the tick Ixodes scapularis (Lyme disease vector). The motivations for sequencing vector genomes are to further understand vector biology, with an eye on developing new control strategies (for example novel chemical attractants or repellents) or understanding the limitations of current strategies (for example the mechanism of insecticide resistance); to analyse the mechanisms driving their evolution; and to perform an exhaustive analysis of the gene repertory. The proliferation of genomic data creates the need for efficient and accessible storage. We present VectorBase, a genomic resource centre that is both involved in the annotation of vector genomes and act as a portal for access to the genomic information (http://www.vectorbase.org)."
