		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a vector-borne infectious disease affecting especially skin, nervous system, heart and joints. In the early stage of borrelia infection, asymptomatic course is possible. The causative agent, the spirochete Borrelia, is carried to the human body by tick. The bacteriological culture from blood, joint fluid or cerebrospinal fluid is very difficult. The laboratory diagnosis depends mainly on serological assays (ELISA, Western blot) and on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The treatment is based on antibiotic therapy - penicillin's and cephalosporins. The period of therapy depends on clinical form of borreliosis. Early tick removing is the best borreliosis prophylaxis."

		"abstract": "Complete atrioventricular block is a serious disorder, since patients may be asymptomatic. However, it is an important risk for sudden cardiac death. A 48-year old male patient was admitted to the coronary care unit, due to recurring substernal chest pain. It was followed by fatigue, weakness and confusion, it lasted more than half an hour and occurred twice. Loss of consciousness did not occur. The patient had a tick bite two months earlier. Physical examination was unremarkable, except for low heart rate (50/minute) electrocardiogram showed a complete atrioventricular block with narrow QRS complexes and good ventricular function. Elevation of ST segment was observed in the inferior ECG leads, with reciprocal ST depression in precordial leads; it was highly suspicious for acute myocardial infarction, but markers of myocardial necrosis (Troponin, Creatine kinase-MB) were normal. The chest pain recurred without evolutive changes in the electrocardiogram or increase in markers of myocardial necrosis. Tests for Lyme disease were negative, too. The cause of atrioventricular conduction disturbance was found by transthoracic echocardiography. A giant tumor was found in the right atrium and right ventricle. Further examinations excluded its secondary cause and the patient was sent to surgery. The tumor was inoperable and bled excessively. Although permanent pacing was performed, the patient died suddenly after dismisal. We can conclude that a giant primary tumor of the heart can be asymptomatic for a long time causing complete atrioventricular block, and in this case it clinically presented as acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiographic examination was the main diagnostic tool in our case."

C. psittaci was detected only in cloacal swabs; 6 birds (6.6 %) from four species were found to be positive. The PCR products were sequenced and the sequences were compared phylogenetically with the gene sequences of 14 Chlamydophila strains retrieved from nucleotide databases; although the sequenced DNA was only 110 bp long, all obtained sequences created a new cluster with sublines branching from a position close to the periphery of the genus. All tested samples appear distinct within the known species and were most similar to C. felis or C. abortis."

To determine whether B. garinii is present in seabird ticks on the Atlantic Coast of North America, we examined 261 I. uriae ticks by polyclonal antiborrelial fluorescent antibody. Ten of 61 ticks from Gull Island, Newfoundland, were positive for borreliae by this screen.

Meanwhile, results may reveal hard to interpret, especially when are tries to specify the time of the beginning of an infection. The results require in the majority of the cases to be compared on two subsequent serum samples, to observe a possible increase in antibodies level.

Using schistosomiasis as an example, we propose a conceptual model simulating the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious diseases. We base the model on the knowledge of the interrelationship among the source, media, and the hosts of the disease. With the endemics data of schistosomiasis in Xichang, China, we demonstrate that the conceptual model is feasible; we introduce how remote sensing and geographic information systems techniques can be used in support of spatio-temporal modeling; we compare the different effects caused to the entire population when selecting different groups of people for schistosomiasis control. Our work illustrates the importance of such a modeling tool in supporting spatial decisions. Our modeling method can be directly applied to such infectious diseases as the plague, lyme disease, and hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. The application of remote sensing and geographic information systems can shed light on the modeling of other infectious disease and invasive species studies."

Both had acute inflammatory back pain, resistant to the usual analgesic treatment. Both patients responded negatively to questions about tick bites and erythema migrans. Laboratory tests revealed an inflammatory process in only one patient. Lyme disease was confirmed by lymphocytic meningitis and serological tests positive for Borrelia in blood (both cases) and cerebrospinal fluid (one case). Antibiotic treatment led to the disappearance of pain and the normalization of laboratory tests. Inflammatory back pain, even without radiculitis, may be related to Lyme disease in endemic areas."

In total, 113 birds were collected, 50 (44.2%) of which were found to be infested by 361 ixodid ticks representing three species: the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus, n=248), the rabbit tick (Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, n=112), and one American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). Year-round the prevalence of all ticks combined was unrelated to the age or sex of turkeys, and the prevalence of infestation by I. pacificus (35.4%) was significantly higher than it was for either H. leporispalustris (14.2%) or D. variabilis (0.9%). The proportion of the two prevalent tick species differed significantly by life stage with 86.3% of the I. pacificus and 82.1% of the H. leporispalustris enumerated being nymphs and larvae, respectively. Three species of lice were collected, including the chicken body louse Menacanthus stramineus (12.5% of total), Chelopistes meleagridis (37.5% of total), and Oxylipeurus polytrapezius (50% of total). The records for all three ticks are the first ever from wild turkeys, and those for the lice are the first from this host in the far-western United States. Wild turkeys potentially were exposed to the feeding activities of I. pacificus nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. as 15% of host-seeking nymphs (n=200) collected in woodlands used by turkeys as roosting or foraging areas were infected mainly with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). However, only one (1%) of 90 turkey blood specimens tested by PCR contained B. burgdorferi s.s., and four in vitro, complement-protein assays demonstrated that domestic turkey serum is moderately bacteriolytic for this spirochete. Taken together, these findings indicate that wild turkeys are important avian hosts of I. pacificus nymphs, but they appear to be inconsequential hosts of B. burgdorferi s.l."

		"abstract": "Serum samples were obtained from white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in tick-infested areas of Connecticut during the period 2001 through 2003 and analyzed for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti. Emphasis was placed on the evaluations of highly specific recombinant VlsE or protein (p) 44 antigens of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, respectively, in a newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as well as testing sera with whole-cell antigens by conventional ELISA or indirect fluorescent antibody staining methods. Of the 414 mouse sera analyzed, 310 (75%) had antibodies to whole-cell B. burgdorferi, whereas 157 (38%) were positive to the VlsE antigen. The latter nearly equaled the overall antibody prevalence rate (37%) computed when sera were tested separately with the p44 antigen. Mice were exposed to these pathogens and B. microti (antibody prevalence = 25%) in extreme northern Connecticut as well as the southern coastal areas of the state, thus indicating further geographic expansion of these infections. Fifty-three (13%) sera from widely separated sites had antibodies to all three pathogens. With expression and immunological recognition of VlsE and p44 antigens in P. leucopus, separate incorporation of these fusion proteins in an ELISA was very helpful in confirming past or current infections and in identifying specific foci for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum."

		"abstract": "Forest products were tested to see if they functioned as a barrier to nymphal Ixodes scapularis. These products could potentially be used to define a border between high density and low density tick zones on residential properties in Lyme disease endemic regions of North America. Common home and garden items were also tested. Three wood products effectively acted as barriers to nymphal I. scapularis: Alaska Yellow Cedar sawdust, Alaska Yellow Cedar woodchips, and cellulose. These three products were then weathered to determine how long they remained active. Cellulose and Alaska Yellow Cedar woodchips lost their activity almost immediately (within three days); in contrast, Alaska Yellow Cedar sawdust impeded crossing by nymphal ticks for up to one month. Creating barriers at the woods-lawn interface may someday play a role in integrated campaigns to prevent Lyme disease but will not serve as a stand-alone measure to block transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes."

Nymphs were sampled between May and July from the wooded edge around 51 and 47 residential properties in 2002 and 2003, respectively. Nymphs were collected from all residences sampled. Tick densities, infection rates, and densities of infected nymphs were all significantly higher around homes reporting Lyme disease histories in 2003, while only infection rates were significantly higher in 2002. However, densities of infected nymphs did not significantly predict the probability of Lyme disease at a residence (by logistic regression) in either year. There were no significant differences in entomologic risk factors between homes with state-confirmed Lyme disease histories and homes with self-reported cases (not reported to the state health department). Therefore, although entomologic risk factors tended to be higher at residences with cases of Lyme disease, entomological indices, in the absence of human behavior measures, were not useful predictors of Lyme disease at the scale of individual residences in a tick-endemic community."

		"abstract": "The north part of Croatia, especially the Koprivnica-Krizevci County is a well known endemic area of several tick-transmitted diseases including tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis and tularemia. Each summer numerous patients develop a nonspecific febrile illness after tick bite, etiology of which is sometimes never established. The aim of this prospective study was to determine whether the infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum was associated with febrile illnesses occurring after tick bite. The epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and diagnostic procedures in patients suffering from confirmed and probable anaplasmosis are presented. A prospective study to assess the potential ehrlichial etiology of febrile illnesses after tick bite was conducted at the Department of Infectious Disease, General Hospital, Koprivnica, Croatia, during the period from January 1998 to August 2004. The study included patients of all age groups with acute febrile illness (temperature higher than 38 degrees C) manifesting within 30 days of a tick bite, in whom a recent infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum was established serologically by seroconversion or at least 4-fold increase in antibody titer to anaplasma antigen (defined as confirmed cases of anaplasmosis), or by the presence of positive IFA titer > or = 1: 256 in acute and convalescent phase serum samples without demonstrating a 4-fold titer change (defined as probable cases of anaplasmosis), and with no alternative explanation for the acute febrile illness. Thorough medical histories were collected, physical examinations performed, and several laboratory tests carried out. Giemsa-stained peripheral blood smears were examined by high microscopy for the presence of ehrlichial morulae within leukocytes. Acute and convalescent phase serum samples were tested by use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for the presence of specific IgG antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum antigen. At the same time all serum samples were tested for other tick borne agents including tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Serological tests were performed at the Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Oral consent was obtained from all patients enrolled in the study. Of 132 patients included in the study during the 7-year period, eight (6%) patients were diagnosed with anaplasmosis, without any additional diagnosis, and were included in the analysis. Three patients fulfilled the case definition criteria for confirmed anaplasmosis, while five had probable anaplasmosis (three men and five women aged 17-43). Clinically, the disease presented as a nonspecific, flu-like febrile illness with leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and moderately elevated aminotransferases. Intracytoplasmic morulae were not seen in leukocytes in blood smears. Specific antimicrobial therapy was administered in four patients. All patients recovered rapidly and no long-term consequences were found during the one-year follow-up. We report on the first patients meeting the case definition criteria for confirmed and probable anaplasmosis. The frequency and new concepts in the disease were analyzed."

		"abstract": "Peripheral facial palsy is one of the most frequent neurological symptoms. In two thirds of the cases the cause is unknown, this is called \"idiopathic peripheral facial palsy or Bell's palsy\", but several different diseases have to be considered in the differential diagnosis. In this paper we reviewed the case histories of 110 patients treated for \"peripheral facial palsy\" in the Department of Neurology, Semmelweis University, Budapest in a five year period, 2000-2004. We studied the age, gender distribution, seasonal occurrence, comorbidities, sidedness, symptoms, circumstances of referral to the hospital, the initial diagnoses and therapeutic options. We also discuss the probable causes and consequences of diagnostic failures. the proportion of males and females was equal. There was no considerable difference between sexes regarding age-distribution. Of the 110 patients 106 was diagnosed with idiopathic Bell's palsy, three cases with otic herpes zoster and one patient with Lyme disease. In our material, peripheral facial palsy was significantly more frequent in the cold period of late autumn, winter, and early spring. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were more frequent than in the general population. 74% of the patients were admitted within two days from the onset of the symptoms. In 37% preliminary diagnosis was unavailable. In 15% cerebrovascular insult was the first, incorrect diagnosis, the correct diagnosis of \"Bell's palsy\" was provided only in 16%. The probable causes of diagnostic failures may be the misleading symptoms and accompanying conditions. We examined the different therapies applied and reviewed the literature in this topic. We conclude that intravenous corticosteroid treatment in the early stage of the disease is the therapy of choice."

In addition, we aimed to analyse sources of information and the risk of being bitten more than once. 53 kindergartens (25 forest kindergartens, 28 regular kindergartens) in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany participated in this study and protective parental behaviour was recorded. In a prospective cohort study, the numbers of tick bites and cases of borreliosis were recorded monthly (March to October 2004) using a questionnaire. The influence of preventive measures was estimated using multivariate log-binomial regression. Altogether, 1707 children of 'forest kindergartens' (506 children) and regular kindergartens (1201 children) were included. Parental protective behaviour was significantly better in forest kindergartens compared to regular kindergartens. There were no substantial differences between effect estimates after stratification for parental protective behaviour. For children attending a 'forest kindergarten, the adjusted risk ratio of being tick bitten was 2.6 (3.3-3.0) which was only slightly different from the unadjusted risk, ratio. Although protective parental behaviour in 'forest kindergarten' children was significantly better compared to regular kindergarten, children in forest kindergartens are at a considerable risk of tick bites and borreliosis. Implementing effective preventive measures against borreliosis represents a public health challenge."

They were examined by dark field microscopy for the presence of spirochetes. The motile spirochetes were observed in 4.2 % of all species of investigated mosquitoes. One spirochetal strain out of the 8 isolation attempts (BRZ14) was obtained (cultivation rate was 12.5 %) and the spirochetal strain was then successfully cultivated and identified using PCR for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., and subsequently with the RFLP as genomospecies Borrelia afzelii. This strain was derived from overwintering Culex (Culex) pipiens biotype molestus female mosquitoe.

Ticks were collected from dogs presented for medical examination in veterinary clinics in different parts of Warsaw. All of 590 tick specimens found on dogs belonged to the family Ixodidae (hard ticks). The majority (64.6 %) of the collected ticks were identified as Dermacentor reticulatus--vector of Babesia canis. The other tick species found on examined dogs was Ixodes ricinus. The male to female ratio was more than 3 times higher in D. reticulatus than in I. ricinus."

DNA in peripheral blood. A total of 61.7 %, 53.9 %, 62.2 %, and 59.4 % of the examined patients' sera showed positive or borderline results in the serologic tests IgM-ELISA, IgG-ELISA, IgM-immunoblot, and IgG immunoblot, respectively. The results of the tests IgM-ELISA and IgM-immunoblot were significantly correlated (p < 0.001). A higher degree of the correlation (p < 0.000001) was found at the comparison of results obtained with IgG-ELISA and IgG-immunoblot. The correlation between the positive findings in the IgM-ELISA and detection with IgM-immunoblot the diagnostically important B. burgdorferi s.l. OspC surface protein was relatively low but statistically significant (0.01 < p < 0.05). Much higher correlation was found between the positive findings in the IgG-ELISA and detection with IgG-immunoblot other diagnostically important B. burgdorferi s.l. antigen, the VlsE protein (p < 0.000001). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA was found by PCR in 20 out 180 examined blood samples (11.1 %). No correlation was found to exist between the PCR results and the results of any of the serologic tests for detection of anti B. burgdorferi s.l. antibodies of IgM class. PCR results correlated significantly at a relatively low level (0.01 < p < 0.05) with the results of IgG-ELISA, but not with the results of IgG-immunoblot with regard to total reactions (0.2 < p < 0.1). By contrast, a distinctly significant correlation was found between the PCR results and detection of the VlsE protein with IgG-immunoblot (0.001 < p < 0.01). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that antibodies of IgG class are the most reliable marker in laboratory diagnostics of Lyme borreliosis, in particular those directed against VlsE surface protein of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato."

A group of 1,813 I. ricinus ticks from 6 districts were examined for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (B.b.s.l.) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Another group of 438 I. ricinus ticks collected from 4 districts were examined for the presence of B.b.s.l. by culture on BSKH liquid medium confirmed by PCR, and for the presence of Borrelia spp. by dark field microscopy (DFM). Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii) were determined by nested-PCR in 113 ticks lysates showing presence of B.b.s.l. (in PCR or in culture and PCR). 5.4 % of I. ricinus ticks examined by PCR showed the presence of B.b.s.l. DNA. The infection rate was highest in females (12.1 %), lower in males (6.0 %) and the lowest in nymphs (1.7 %) (p < 0.001). The minimum infection rate of I. ricinus ticks with B.b.s.l. determined by culture was 3.4 %, whereas the minimum infection rate of ticks with motile spirochetes morphologically resembling Borrelia spp., determined by DFM, amounted to 11.2 %. The presence of all 3 Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies under investigation was found in ticks collected from 5 out of 6 examined districts. In 81.4 % of infected ticks only single infection with 1 genospecies was observed, while coinfections with 2 or 3 genospecies were detected respectively in 16.8 % and 1.8 % of infected ticks. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was the dominant genospecies in all examined tick stages and districts, both in single infections and in coinfections, and found in a total of 62.8 % of I. ricinus ticks infected with B.b.s.l.

However, the results also highlight that even related host species, such as the wild rodents Apodemus flavicollis and Clethrionomys glareolus that share the same habitat, can show quite different dynamics of tick infestation. We provide evidence that the woodland populations of A. flavicollis and C. glareolus are more frequently infested with larvae than nymphs, and more frequently with both stages than M. arvalis in the neighbouring open fallow lands. The prevalence of infestation with larvae varied from 92 % for A. flavicollis, and 76 % for C. glareolus to 37 % for M. arvalis. Other factors, such as population age structure and sex, were also shown to impact on tick densities on hosts at particular times of the year and hence on the zoonotic risk. Moreover, particular species of rodents from different habitats, A. flavicollis (woodlands) and Microtus arvalis (fallow lands) carry infected immature I. ricinus ticks more frequently than C. glareolus voles (woodlands). Thus, the relative contribution of each species to the cumulative reservoir competence differs among species living in the woodland habitats and in relation to voles living in the fallow lands. It follows, therefore, that any factor which reduces the relative density of A. flavicollis in comparison to other hosts in the wild rodent community, will reduce also the risk of human exposure to Lyme borreliosis spirochetes."

BBA74, a Borrelia burgdorferi plasmid-encoded protein, was proposed to be an integral outer membrane protein with putative porin function and designated as a 28-kDa outer membrane-spanning porin (Oms28). In this study, the biophysical properties of BBA74 and its subcellular localization were investigated. BBA74 is posttranslationally modified by signal peptidase I cleavage to a mature 25-kDa protein. The secondary structure of BBA74 as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy consists of at least 78% alpha-helix with little beta-sheet structure. BBA74 in intact B. burgdorferi cells was insensitive to proteinase K digestion, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that BBA74 was not exposed on the cell surface. Triton X-114 extraction of outer membrane vesicle preparations indicated that BBA74 is not an integral membrane protein. Taken together, the data indicate that BBA74 is a periplasmic, outer membrane-associated protein that lacks properties typically associated with porins."

Several small mammal hosts; Peromyscus leucopus, Tamias striatus, Microtus pennsylvanicus, and Blarina spp. can serve as reservoirs in an enzootic cycle of Lyme disease. The primary reservoir in the northeast United States is the white-footed mouse, P. leucopus. The infection prevalence of this reservoir as well as the roles of potential secondary reservoirs has not been established in southern Maryland, a region of low to moderate Borrelia infection in humans. Intensive trapping at 96 locations throughout the western Coastal Plains of Maryland was conducted and we found that 31.6% of P. leucopus were infected with B. burgdorferi. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that only B. burgdorferi sensu stricto circulated in southern Maryland. Feral house mice and voles also were infected and may serve as secondary hosts. Peromyscus gender, age and month of capture were significantly associated with infection status. Larval I. scapularis were the dominant ectoparasite collected from captured rodents even though host seeking A. americanum and D. variabilis were collected in greater numbers across the sampling region. Our findings illustrate that the enzootic cycle of LD is maintained in the western Coastal Plains region of southern Maryland between I. scapularis and P. leucopus as the dominant reservoir."

In order to assess the situation in Slovakia ticks were collected from a total of 3057 mist-netted, ringed and released passerine birds in two locations at 500 m (in 2001) and 1000 m (in 2003) above sea level in the Bukovské Vrchy Hills, part of the Carpathian region in the north-east of Slovakia. A total of 75 birds of 16 species were infested with subadult ticks of Ixodes ricinus species (prevalence of parasitization 5%). Sixty-two larvae from 31 birds of 9 species and 80 nymphs from 52 birds of 15 species were found. The highest intensity of parasitization was observed on blackbirds Turdus merula, song thrushes T. philomelos and dunnocks Prunella modularis. Six Ixodes ricinus adult ticks were found on humans working with birds, and one I. ricinus female tick on their dog. In ticks, the presence of Rickettsia sp., Coxiella burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and members of the Anaplasmataceae and Piroplasmidae, were investigated by polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequence analysis. Rickettsia sp. was found in 1 nymph from the European robin Erithacus rubecula, in 3 adult ticks (1 male, 2 females) from humans and in the tick from the dog. The closely related Ehrlichia- like species \"Schotti variant\" was detected in 1 nymph from the song thrush. Borrelia afzelii was identified in 1 male and B. garinii in 1 female tick collected on humans. Ixodes ricinus was found to be the vector of a wide spectrum of tick-borne pathogens in a mountainous area of the Carpathians. Because of the low yield of ticks and pathogens the importance of birds as reservoir hosts is still poorly understood."

The assessment used climate scenarios from two regional climate models for a range of future time periods. The annual heat-related death rates in Lisbon may increase from between 5.4 and 6 per 100,000 in 1980-1998 to between 8.5 and 12.1 by the 2020s and to a maximum of 29.5 by the 2050s, if no adaptations occur. The projected warmer and more variable weather may result in better dispersion of nitrogen dioxide levels in winter, whereas the higher temperatures may reduce air quality during the warmer months by increasing tropospheric ozone levels. We estimated the future risk of zoonoses using ecologic scenarios to describe future changes in vectors and parasites. Malaria and schistosomiasis, which are currently not endemic in Portugal, are more sensitive to the introduction of infected vectors than to temperature changes. Higher temperatures may increase the transmission risk of zoonoses that are currently endemic to Portugal, such as leishmaniasis, Lyme disease, and Mediterranean spotted fever."

The role of a Dps homologue encoded by Borrelia in spirochaete survival was assessed. Dps-deficient spirochaetes were infectious in mice via needle-inoculation at the dose of 10(5) spirochaetes. Larval ticks successfully acquired Dps-deficient spirochaetes via a blood meal on mice. However, after extended periods within unfed nymphs, the Dps-deficient spirochaetes failed to be transmitted to a new host when nymphs fed. Our data suggest that Dps functions to protect the spirochaetes during dormancy in unfed ticks, and in its absence, the spirochaetes become susceptible during tick feeding. dps is differentially expressed in vivo- low in mice and high in ticks - but constitutively expressed in vitro, showing little change during growth or in response to oxidative stress. Borrelia Dps forms a dodecameric complex capable of sequestering iron. The Dps-deficient spirochaetes showed no defect in starvation and oxidative stress assays, perhaps due to the lack of iron in spirochaetes grown in vitro. Dps is critical for spirochaete persistence within ticks, and strategies to interfere with Dps could potentially reduce Borrelia populations in nature and thereby influence the incidence of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Measuring the chemotactic response of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial species that causes Lyme disease, is relatively more difficult than measuring that of other bacteria. Because these spirochetes have long generation times, enumerating cells that swim up a capillary tube containing an attractant by using colony counts is impractical. Furthermore, direct counts with a Petroff-Hausser chamber is problematic, as this method has a low throughput and necessitates a high cell density; the latter can lead to misinterpretation of results when assaying for specific attractants. Only rabbit serum and tick saliva have been reported to be chemoattractants for B. burgdorferi. These complex biological mixtures are limited in their utility for studying chemotaxis on a molecular level. Here we present a modified capillary tube chemotaxis assay for B. burgdorferi that enumerates cells by flow cytometry. Initial studies identified N-acetylglucosamine as a chemoattractant. The assay was then optimized with respect to cell concentration, incubation time, motility buffer composition, and growth phase. Besides N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, glucosamine dimers (chitosan), glutamate, and glucose also elicited significant chemoattractant responses, although the response obtained with glucose was weak and variable. Serine and glycine were nonchemotactic. To further validate and to exploit the use of this assay, a previously described nonchemotactic cheA2 mutant was shown to be nonchemotactic by this assay; it also regained the wild-type phenotype when complemented in trans. This is the first report that identifies specific chemical attractants for B. burgdorferi and the use of flow cytometry for spirochete enumeration. The method should also be useful for assaying chemotaxis for other slow-growing prokaryotic species and in specific environments in nature."

Virtually all included an erythema migrans (EM) rash that appeared at body sites that differed from those of the initial rash, no subjects produced detectable levels of specific antibody between sequential episodes, all episodes occurred a year or more after the initial EM episode, and all occurred during late spring and early summer. People experiencing recurrent episodes tended to have frequent contact with vector ticks. Prompt administration of standard antibiotic therapy for early Lyme disease reliably eliminates persistent infection and prevents relapse."

Nested PCR was performed to amplify 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer of B. burgdorferi. Positive products were analysed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), specimens showing unique RFLP profile were sequenced and analysed. 1336 Ixodes persulcatus, 144 Dermacento silvarum, 144 Haemaphysalis concinna and 145 rodents of 9 species were collected from 16 sections of Da Xing-An Mountains Forest areas of China. Specific fragments were amplified from 293 I. persulcatus and 6 D. silvarum and 5 rodents of 4 species. B. burgdorferi was not detected in H. concinna. Among the positively tested I. persulcatus, 209 contained B. garinii genospecies and 45 contained B.afzelii genospecies based on RFLP. Moreover, B.garinii genospecies consisted of B. garinii 20047 and B. garinii NT29. 17 adult I. persulcatus were simultaneously infected with B. garinii 20047 and B. garinii NT29. Nine adult I. persulcatus were simultaneously infected with B. garinii 20047 and B. afzelii. Four adult I. persulcatus were simultaneously infected with B. garinii 20047 and B. garinii NT29 and B. afzelii. Two D. silvarum were infected with B. garinii 20047, 1 D. silvarum with B. garinii 20047, 2 D. silvarum with B. afzelii. 3 rodents were infected with B. garinii 20047 while 2 rodents were infected with B. garinii NT29. Mixed infection was not found in D. silvarum and rodents. In addition, nine I. persulcatus and one D. silvarum specimens showed unique RFLP pattern. Data from sequential analysis showed that they all belonged to B. garinii. PCR-SSCP profiles of 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer of B. burgdorferi in the positive specimens exceeded 36 types; B. garinii 20047 showed 16 types while B. garinii NT29 showing 11 types, B. afzelii showing 9 types. SSCP profiles of the specimens coinfected with multiple B. burgdorferi was relatively complex. The infection of B. burgdorferi was found in the ticks and rodents in Da Xing-An Mountains Forests areas. The infection rate of I. persulcatus was high. B. garinii was predominant genospecies, and the population of B. burgdorferi was heterogeneous in the area. Mixed infections of different B. burgdorferi genospecies in ticks were found. I. persulcatus and Clethrionomys rufocanus were possibly served as major vector and major host for B. burgdorferi, respectively, suggesting that further study is needed to confirm the coinfection in humans and animals in this region."

We also reviewed records of all ticks submitted for identification by the public in Monmouth County during 2001-2005. Relative abundance of the two species varied markedly among sites. Adult encounter frequencies for the two species were similar; however, A. americanum nymphs were encountered 3 times more frequently than I. scapularis nymphs. Of 435 ticks submitted by the public, 50.1 and 38.9% were I. scapularis and A. americanum, respectively. However, during May through August, the peak Lyme disease transmission season in New Jersey, significantly more submitted ticks were A. americanum (55.9%), compared with I. scapularis (34.1%). Polymerase chain reaction analysis of 94 1. scapularis and 103 A. americanum adults yielded infection prevalences of 31.9% for B. burgdorferi and 5.8% for B. lonestari, respectively. Although the infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis was considerably higher than the infection prevalence of B. lonestari in A. americanum, the higher encounter frequencies for A. americanum compared with I. scapularis observed in this and other studies may result in increased risk of acquiring exposure to A. americanum-transmitted pathogens. The potential public health implications of these results are discussed."

In fragmented New England woodlands, over-abundant white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman, overbrowse palatable species, allowing browse-resistant exotic-invasive species to replace native forest understory structures. We predicted there would be more ticks in plots dominated by exotic-invasive shrubs (such as Japanese barberry, Berberis thunbergii DC) than in plots dominated by native shrubs, ferns, or open understory. We assessed canopy composition and closure, tree basal area, litter composition, percentage of coverage and stem density of understory species, litter depth, soil moisture, and abundance of small mammals and white-tailed deer pellet groups. We used generalized linear mixed model analysis of covariance to determine the effect of understory structure on tick counts, controlling for continuous habitat and host covariates and adjusting for random spatial effects. There were twice as many adults and nearly twice as many nymphs in plots dominated by exotic-invasives than in plots dominated by native shrubs. Both adult and nymphal counts were lowest in open understory with coniferous litter. Adults were positively associated with increasing litter depth, medium soil moisture, and increasing abundance of white-footed deer mice, Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque, and deer pellet group counts. Nymphs were positively associated with increasing litter depth, moderately wet soil, and mice. We concluded that deer browse-resistant exotic-invasive understory vegetation presented an elevated risk of human exposure to the vector tick of Lyme disease."

Adult patients qualified for the study if they had nonspecific symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement for more than six months (but without overt clinical signs of the involvement), had positive serum borrelial antibody titers and/or erythema migrans prior to the onset of symptoms, had not been previously treated with antibiotics and did not have pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients were given either 100 mg of oral doxycycline twice daily for 4 weeks (23 patients) or 2 g of intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 2 weeks followed by 100 mg of doxycycline twice daily for another 2 weeks (23 patients). Clinical outcome was assessed during a 12-month follow-up period. Improvement in the frequency and/or the intensity of symptoms was reported by more than two-thirds of the 46 patients enrolled in the study. The two treatment regimens were found to be correspondingly effective. Photosensitivity reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms were noted more often among patients receiving doxycycline than in those receiving ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline proved to be much cheaper than with ceftriaxone. In patients with previously untreated chronic Lyme borreliosis with symptoms suggesting central nervous system involvement but without overt clinical signs of it, and without pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid, treatment with doxycycline is as effective as with ceftriaxone. Treatment with doxycycline is cheap and relatively safe, but gastrointestinal symptoms and photosensitivity reactions can be expected more often than with ceftriaxone."

Unfortunately these tests are not standardized and the results obtained with different assays may not be concordant. The aim of the present study was to compare two different serological tests, IFA and LIAISON, for detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato IgM and IgG antibody. We analyzed the serological immune response in 383 patients with different clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis and in 49 healthy blood donors. LIAISON detected IgM and IgG antibodies more often than IFA in all groups of patients except those with chronic Lyme borreliosis. The differences were significant for IgM and IgG antibodies in patients with solitary erythema migrans and in those with early disseminated Lyme borreliosis. There was no significant difference in the specificity of the two tests."

		"abstract": "This study concerns the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato as an indicator of previous borrelial infection among hunters, a group of occupationally exposed persons. In order to define associated risk factors and preparing data for future comparisons, a study was performed in the eight districts of Burgenland, the most eastern state of Austria. Blood samples of 1214 men (median age 51 years, range 18 to 89 years) and 39 women (median age 44 years, range 21 to 69 years) were collected during autumn 2002 and winter 2003. Demographic data regarding age, sex, profession, residence, duration of employment (hunters), hunting-ground, animals in the environment, and history of tick bite were obtained by a questionnaire. A two-step testing strategy was used in which sera were screened for antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato by a commercially available recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotest Anti-Borrelia IgG ELISA; Biotest AG, Dreieich, Germany). Reactive sera were then subjected to immuno blot testing (recomBlot Borrelia; Mikrogen, Munich, Germany) for confirmation of specificity. A total of 673 (54%) sera tested positive for IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato: 663 (55%) men and 10 (26%) women. Seropositivity was clearly related to age and duration of hunting activity; it was 33% among persons younger than 29 years and 83% in those older than 70 years. Further, there was also a difference in the distribution of seroprevalence within the districts; the highest was found in hunters from the most southern district of Burgenland, Jennersdorf, (69%) and the lowest was noticed in the most northern district, Neusiedl (39%). We found an overall seroprevalence of 54% in asymptomatic hunters of Burgenland. Infectious risk exists in the entire state but the prevalence rate differs in the various districts indicating a variable risk which peaks in the south. The nearly linear increase of seroprevalence with age and duration of hunting activity reflects repeated tick exposure."

It was shown recently that expression of BbCRASP-1 directly correlates with serum resistance of B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates. In the present study we have elucidated the putative potential of other members of the gbb54 paralogous family, including orthologs ZSA66, ZSA69, ZSA70, ZSA71, ZSA72 and ZSA73 of the European B. burgdorferi s.s. strain ZS7, to bind human FHL-1 and factor H. In spite of their overall similarity in protein sequence, between 47% and 67%, and the fact that the C-terminal region of ZSA69 shows 70% similarity with BbCRASP-1, none of the orthologous proteins was able to bind human FHL-1 and/or factor H. BbCRASP-1 is the only member of the paralogous gene family gbb54 that binds to human complement regulators, supporting the notion that BbCRASP-1 plays a critical role in evasion of complement by B. burgdorferi s.s. and thus may be helpful in the development of novel therapeutic strategies against Lyme borreliosis."

Our laboratory is studying the response of mammalian hosts to borrelia infection in RF and LD. For this, we use mice and non-human primates infected with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain N40 (N40) and the Oz1 strain of Borrelia turicatae (Bt), agents of LD and RF in North America, respectively. Our results have revealed that outbred non-human primates are significantly less susceptible than outbred mice to persistent infection with N40. In contrast, the majority of mice inoculated with the RF agent B. turicatae clear the infection, with the notable exception of residual brain or blood infection in up to 25% of cases. Little if any tissue injury occurs in immunocompetent animals with either LD or RF. In contrast, impairment of specific antibody production results in significant tissue injury, most notably in the heart, in both LD and RF. The inflammatory infiltrate is rich in plasma cells, activated macrophages and T cells, and there is significant deposition of antibody and complement, including membrane attack complex, in inflamed tissues and spirochetes. Significant loss of cardiomyocytes with apoptosis and caspase activation was observed in the heart of immunosuppressed non-human primates infected with N40 and in B cell-deficient mice infected with B. turicatae. Unlike the heart, the brain of B cell-deficient mice infected with B. turicatae showed prominent microglial activation but no detectable tissue injury. Tissues from immunosuppressed non-human primates infected with N40 produce large amounts of immunoglobulin and the B cell chemokine CXCL13, both of which significantly correlate with the spirochetal load. We conclude that the main response of mammalian hosts in LD and RF is the production of specific antibody to clear the infection. Failure of this response leads to persistent infection, which can lead to tissue injury, most notably in the heart."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis), is well-adapted to maintain a natural cycle of alternately infecting vertebrates and blood-sucking ticks. During this cycle, B. burgdorferi interacts with a broad spectrum of vertebrate and arthropod tissues, acquires nutrients in diverse environments and evades killing by vertebrate and tick immune systems. The bacterium also senses when situations occur that necessitate transmission between hosts, such as when an infected tick is taking a blood meal from a potential host. To accurately accomplish the requirements necessary for survival in nature, B. burgdorferi must be keenly aware of its surroundings and respond accordingly. In this review, we trace studies performed to elucidate regulatory mechanisms employed by B. burgdorferi to control gene expression, and the development of models or \"paradigms\" to explain experimental results. Through comparisons of five borrelial gene families, it is readily apparent that each is controlled through a distinct mechanism. Furthermore, those results indicate that current models of interpreting in vitro data cannot accurately predict all aspects of B. burgdorferi environmental sensing and gene regulation in vivo."

		"abstract": "Hematogenous dissemination has long been considered an important pathogenetic event in Lyme borreliosis but has been hard to document and characterize due to insensitive blood culture methods. In a series of recent investigations involving adult patients from the United States with erythema migrans, it was concluded that plasma was a better source of culture material than serum or whole blood, and yield correlated directly with the volume of material cultured. The rate of recovery of Borrelia burgdorferi from 9 mL of plasma exceeded 40%. Both the genotype of the strain of B. burgdorferi introduced by the tick and host factors, such as having a first episode of Lyme borreliosis and being more than 55 years of age, appear to affect the risk of hematogenous dissemination. Although the majority of spirochetemic patients are symptomatic, spirochetemia can be a subclinical event. In summary, hematogenous dissemination is a common and important feature of early Lyme borreliosis in the United States. The high rate, early onset and prolonged duration of risk of spirochetemia probably explain why untreated patients with erythema migrans may develop objective clinical manifestations at a distant anatomic site."

The clinical picture of Lyme borreliosis in Croatia is dominated by erythema migrans, followed by neurological manifestations. The diversified clinical picture is consistent with reports from other European countries, as is the isolation of Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii, which are causally related to these forms of the disease.

Since 1999, this disease is considered a notifiable disease (DDO) in Portugal, but only a few cases are reported each year, which does not allow consistent analysis of risk factors and the impact on public health. In this study the authors analyse the data available at the Centre for Vectors and Infectious Diseases Research (CEVDI) laboratory, at the Instituto Nacional de Saude Dr. Ricardo Jorge (National Institute of Health, INSA) during the past 15 years (1990-2004) and evaluate them against the registry of national reported cases (1999-2004). Serological tests were the basis for laboratory diagnosis. Data on year of diagnosis, sex, age, geographical origin and clinical signs are available for 628 well documented Portuguese positive cases. The number of cases per year varied between 2 and 78, with the highest number of cases reported in 1997. Of the positive cases, 53.5% were female and the age group most affected was 35-44 years old. Neuroborreliosis was the most common clinical manifestation (37.3%). Human cases were detected in 17 of the 20 regions of Portugal, and the highest number of laboratory confirmed cases were from the Lisbon district. The comparison of the number of notified cases and the number of positive cases confirmed by our laboratory show that Lyme borreliosis is clearly an underreported disease. Due to the scattered distribution of the positive cases and the low prevalence of the tick species Ixodes ricinus, the most effective prevention measure for Lyme borreliosis in Portugal is education of the risk groups on how to prevent tick bites."

While there is currently no vaccine available, prevention of tick bite is the most effective prophylaxis."

The incidence of tick-borne encephalitis is clearly increasing since 2004. The vaccination of persons living or residing temporally in risk areas is now routinely recommended. Although eradicated in wild mammals since 1996, rabies still constitutes a threat through bats and illegally imported pets. The epidemiology of echinococcosis is influenced by the increase in fox populations in urban areas. This could result in a higher prevalence of the disease in dogs and thus a higher risk of exposure for humans."

Accordingly, macrophage responses to B. burgdorferi challenge may differ between mouse strains. Bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected ex vivo with clonal B. burgdorferi strain N40. Interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) production were higher in macrophages from resistant C57Bl/6 mice than in macrophages from susceptible C3H/HeJ mice. However, TNF-alpha production was observed in lower concentrations in C3H/HeJ (toll-like receptor-4(-/-)) macrophages than in C3H/FeJ (TLR4(+/+)) macrophages, suggesting that TLR4 might contribute to the response to B. burgdorferi. A higher cytokine response to B. burgdorferi was associated with cell death in macrophages from resistant C57Bl/6 mice. Understanding variability in the response of macrophages to B. burgdorferi may contribute to understanding Lyme arthritis."

Ticks removed from humans and animals are routinely tested by diagnostic laboratories to determine if they are infected with these bacteria. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of 2 commonly used methods, direct fluorescent antibody staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the detection of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes scapularis ticks. One hundred and twenty-seven adult I. scapularis ticks collected in Connecticut, a Lyme disease endemic area, were tested, and results were compared. Results showed 24.8% ticks tested positive for Borrelia spp. by fluorescent antibody testing and 32.5% ticks were positive for B. burgdorferi by real-time PCR testing. When ticks were grouped into categories by level of engorgement (unengorged, partially engorged, and fully engorged), 95% of unengorged ticks, 90.5% of partially engorged, and 86.8% of engorged ticks tested were in agreement. Ten of the 127 ticks examined were too dehydrated to be tested by the fluorescent antibody technique; half of these tested positive by PCR. Real-time PCR appears to be the better of these 2 methods for the diagnosis of this bacterial infection in I. scapularis ticks."

Coming back to Poland, dogs often bring in non-native species of ticks as well as pathogens transmitted by them. Tick-borne diseases can result from infection with bacteria, viruses and parasitic protozoa. In this review we present most important tick-transmitted diseases which may occur in dogs in Poland."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne rickettsiae in the genera Ehrlichia and Anaplasma are intracellular bacteria that infect wild and domestic mammals and, more recently, man. The increased desire of humans for recreational activities outdoors has increased the exposure to potential human pathogens that previously cycled almost exclusively within natural, nonhuman enzootic hosts. Anaplasma phagocytophilum causes an acute, nonspecific febrile illness of humans previously known as human granulocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HGE) and now called human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis (HGA). The first patient to have recognized HGA was hospitalized at St Mary's Hospital in Duluth, Minnesota, USA in 1990. However, the clinical and laboratory presentation of this infection remained undefined until 1994, when Bakken and collaborators published their experience with 12 patients who had HGA. By the end of December 2004, at least 2,871 cases of HGA had been reported from 13 U.S. states to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A limited number of laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported from countries in Europe, including Austria, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden. Ixodes persulcatus-complex ticks are the arthropod hosts for Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, and are also the arthropod hosts for A. phagocytophilum. Most cases of HGA have been contracted in geographic regions that are endemic for Lyme borreliosis. Male patients outnumber female patients by a factor of 3 to 1 and as many as 75% of patients with HGA have had a tick bite prior to their illness. Seroepidemiologic studies have demonstrated that HGA for the most part is a mild or even asymptomatic illness. However, older individuals and patients who are immunocompromised by natural disease processes or medications may develop an acute, influenza-like illness characterized by high fever, rigors, generalized myalgias, and severe headache. Local skin reactions at the site of the tick bite have not been described, and nonspecific skin rashes have been reported only occasionally. Anaplasmosis is associated with variable but suggestive changes in routine laboratory test parameters. Most patients develop transient reductions in total leukocyte and platelet concentrations. Relative granulocytosis accompanied by a left shift and lymphopenia during the first week of illness has been reported frequently. Serum hepatic transaminase concentrations usually increase two- to fourfold, and inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rise during the acute phase. Abnormal laboratory findings may return toward normal range for patients who have been ill for more than 7 days, which may obfuscate the clinical decision making. Characteristic clusters of bacteria (morulae) are observed in the cytoplasm of peripheral blood granulocytes in 20% to 80% of infected patients during the acute phase of illness. The clinical diagnosis may be confirmed retrospectively by specific laboratory tests, which include positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identification of A. phagocytophilum in culture of acute-phase blood, or the detection of specific antibodies to A. phagocytophilum in convalescent serum. Virtually all patients have developed serum antibodies to A. phagocytophilum after completion of antibiotic therapy, and demonstration of seroconversion by indirect immunofluorescent antibody testing of acute-phase and convalescent-phase serum samples is currently the most sensitive and specific tool for laboratory confirmation of HGA. Treatment with doxycycline usually results in rapid improvement and cure. Most patients with HGA have made an uneventful recovery even without specific antibiotic therapy. However, delayed diagnosis in older and immunocompromised patients may place those individuals at risk for an adverse outcome, including death. Thus, prompt institution of antibiotic therapy is advocated for any patient who is suspected to have HGA and for all patients who have confirmed HGA."

In the 1-year study, 79 patients were enrolled and 30 (38%) received a diagnosis of TBD: 24 (30%) with Lyme disease and 5 (6%) with HGE. Our findings indicate the presence of HGA in northeastern Italy; so, since co-infection with Lyme disease appeared to be frequent, physicians assessing patients after a tick bite should consider HGA in the diagnosis."

		"abstract": "The murine model of Lyme disease provides a unique opportunity to study the localized host response to similar stimulus, Borrelia burgdorferi, in the joints of mice destined to develop severe arthritis (C3H) or mild disease (C57BL/6). Pathways associated with the response to infection and the development of Lyme arthritis were identified by global gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide microarrays. A robust induction of IFN-responsive genes was observed in severely arthritic C3H mice at 1 wk of infection, which was absent from mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, infected C57BL/6 mice displayed a novel expression profile characterized by genes involved in epidermal differentiation and wound repair, which were decreased in the joints of C3H mice. These expression patterns were associated with disease state rather than inherent differences between C3H and C57BL/6 mice, because C57BL/6-IL-10(-/-) mice infected with B. burgdorferi develop more severe arthritis than C57BL/6 mice and displayed an early gene expression profile similar to C3H mice. Gene expression profiles at 2 and 4 wk postinfection revealed a common response of all strains that was likely to be important for the host defense to B. burgdorferi and mediated by NF-kappaB-dependent signaling. The gene expression profiles identified in this study add to the current understanding of the host response to B. burgdorferi and identify two novel pathways that may be involved in regulating the severity of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Numerous infectious diseases caused by bacteria or viruses persist in developed and developing countries due to ongoing transmission among wildlife reservoir species. Such diseases become the target of control and management programmes in cases where they represent a threat to public health (for example rabies, sylvatic plague, Lyme disease), or livestock production (for example bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, pseudorabies), or where they threaten the survival of endangered animal populations. In the majority of cases, lethal control operations are neither economically feasible nor publicly supported as a practical means for disease management. Prophylactic vaccination has emerged over the last 15 years as an alternative control strategy for wildlife diseases, mainly driven by the success of widescale oral rabies vaccination programmes for meso-carnivores in North America and Northern Europe. Different methods have been trialled for the effective delivery of wildlife vaccines in the field, however oral vaccination remains the most widely used approach. Successful implementation of an oral wildlife vaccine is dependent on a combination of three components: an efficacious immunogen, a suitable delivery vehicle, and a species-specific bait. This review outlines the major wildlife disease problems for which oral vaccination is currently under consideration as a disease management tool, and also focuses on the technological challenges that face wildlife vaccine development. The major conclusion is that attenuated or recombinant live microbes represent the most widely-used vaccines that can be delivered by the oral route; this in turn places major emphasis on effective delivery systems (to maintain vaccine viability), and on selective baiting systems, as the keys to wildlife vaccine success. Oral vaccination is a valuable adjunct or alternative strategy to culling for the control of diseases which persist in wildlife reservoirs."

B. burgdorferi isolates taken from infected humans can be categorized into specific genetic subtypes (designated RST1, -2, and -3) by restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the 16S to 23S rRNA spacer sequence. Many of these, usually categorized as RST2, retain only segments of the linear plasmid lp28-1, which encodes VlsE. The VlsE genetic region is retained, but altered expression of this molecule could affect diagnosis by the C6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples from patients infected with each of the three genotypes and from mice infected with three RST2 isolates were tested with the C6 ELISA. Such isolates elicited marked C6 responses in infected mice. The sensitivity of C6 antibody detection in patients infected with RST2 spirochetes was statistically indistinguishable from detection of RST1 and RST3 infections. These findings demonstrate that diagnosis by C6 ELISA remains effective for infection with all B. burgdorferi genotypes, including those with incomplete lp28-1 plasmids."

Analogous programmed systems of antigenic variation occur in African trypanosomes and Plasmodium falciparum. In these examples, switch rates to individual variants differ over a wide range. We studied how B. hermsii determines switch rates in two experimental infections: one where variants were identified by specific antisera and one based on identification by DNA sequence. Unexpressed loci of variant antigens copy into a single expression site at rates determined by extragenic features of silent loci rather than similarity between coding sequences of variants at silent sites and the single expression site. Two elements, in particular, determine switch rates. One set of elements overlaps the 5' ends of the expressed gene and the silent loci; greater sequence identity between elements was associated with a higher switch rate. The second set of elements flanks the expression site on the 3' side and occurs at variable distances downstream from silent loci; the nearer an element to a silent locus, the greater the switch rate of that locus into the expression site. In combination, these two features of the genome provide a simple mechanism to modulate switch rate whereby silent loci form a hierarchy of switch rates into the expression site. Although the switching hierarchy causes changes in individual cells that are stochastic, ordering of variants within hosts is semipredictable."

		"abstract": "Lyme arthritis, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, can be recurrent or prolonged, whereas Lyme carditis is mostly nonrecurring. A prominent difference between arthritis and carditis is the differential representation of phagocytes in these lesions: polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are more prevalent in the joint, and macrophages predominate in the heart lesion. We have previously shown differential efficiency of B. burgdorferi clearance by PMN and macrophages, and we now investigate whether these functional differences at the cellular level may contribute to the observed differences in organ-specific pathogenesis. When we infected mice lacking the neutrophil chemokine receptor (CXCR2(-/-) mice) with spirochetes, we detected fewer PMN in joints and less-severe arthritis. Here we have investigated the effects of the absence of the macrophage chemokine receptor CCR2 on the development and resolution of Lyme carditis in resistant (C57BL/6J [B6]) and sensitive (C3H/HeJ [C3H]) strains of mice. In B6 CCR2(-/-) mice, although inflammation in hearts is mild, we detected an increased burden of B. burgdorferi compared to that in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting reduced clearance in the absence of macrophages. In contrast, C3H CCR2(-/-) mice have severe inflammation but a decreased B. burgdorferi burden compared to that in WT C3H mice both at peak disease and during resolution. Histopathologic examination of infected hearts revealed that infected C3H CCR2(-/-) animals have an increased presence of PMN, suggesting compensatory mechanisms of B. burgdorferi clearance in the hearts of infected C3H CCR2(-/-) mice. The more efficient clearance of B. burgdorferi from hearts by CCR2(-/-) versus WT C3H mice suggests a natural defect in the recruitment or function of macrophages in C3H mice, which may contribute to the sensitivity of this strain to B. burgdorferi infection."

Criteria for such a diagnosis were: history of tick exposure, lameness, neurological signs, nephropathy, lethargy, anorexia, and fever. A total of 302 samples comprising EDTA blood, urine, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue (skin, synovial membrane, kidney) from 98 dogs (26 with arthritis, 46 with neurological signs, 21 with nephropathy, 5 with non-specific symptoms) were collected and examined. Moreover, 55 healthy dogs (group B) and 236 dogs with symptoms or injuries unlikely to be associated with borreliosis (group C) were included in this study. Blood serum samples collected from all individuals (n=389) were analysed by ELISA. Twenty-one (21%) out of 98 dogs from group A, 4 (7%) out of 55 from group B and 15 (6%) out of 236 dogs from group C were positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The seroprevalences between groups A, B and C differed significantly. None of the corresponding samples investigated by PCR and culture were positive for spirochetal DNA or viable spirochetes. Borrelia afzelii was grown from one EDTA-blood sample but the corresponding blood serum sample remained antibody-negative. Consequently, the etiologic role of B. afzelii in this case is unclear. In approximately 40% of the presumptive canine borreliosis cases, other lesions have been found to be responsible for clinical signs. This study affirms that a definitive diagnosis of canine borreliosis cannot be made by clinical symptoms and serology based on a single consultation. Moreover, this study clearly revealed that the diagnostic sensitivity is enhanced by a thorough consideration and exclusion of other diseases."

		"abstract": "The etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, must adapt to the distinct environments of its arthropod vector and mammalian host during its complex life cycle. B. burgdorferi alters gene expression and protein synthesis in response to temperature, pH, and other uncharacterized environmental factors. The hypothesis tested in this study is that dissolved gases, including CO(2), serve as a signal for B. burgdorferi to alter protein production and gene expression. In this study we focused on characterization of in vitro anaerobic (5% CO(2), 3% H(2), 0.087 ppm O(2)) and microaerophilic (1% CO(2), 3.48 ppm O(2)) growth conditions and how they modulate protein synthesis and gene expression in B. burgdorferi. Higher levels of several immunoreactive proteins, including BosR, NapA, DbpA, OspC, BBK32, and RpoS, were synthesized under anaerobic conditions. Previous studies demonstrated that lower levels of NapA were produced when microaerophilic cultures were purged with nitrogen gas to displace oxygen and CO(2). In this study we identified CO(2) as a factor contributing to the observed change in NapA synthesis. Specifically, a reduction in the level of dissolved CO(2), independent of O(2) levels, resulted in reduced NapA synthesis. BosR, DbpA, OspC, and RpoS synthesis was also decreased with the displacement of CO(2). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the levels of the dbpA, ospC, and BBK32 transcripts are increased in the presence of CO(2), indicating that these putative borrelial virulence determinants are regulated at the transcriptional level. Thus, dissolved CO(2) may be an additional cue for borrelial host adaptation and gene regulation."

This article reviews the common causes of acute monarthritis in the adult, including the presentation, as well as guidelines for rapid and efficient diagnosis and management. Common causes include infections (bacterial/Lyme/mycobacterial/viral), microcrystalline disease (gout/pseudogout), and traumatic and reactive arthropathy.

Primary care physicians, as a result of these long-term relationships, have been endowed with a unique responsibility to the health of their patients. By the very nature of their practice, primary care physicians do not have the resources to treat emergent life-threatening conditions. They must, however, be able to diagnose these potentially life-threatening conditions and be able to stabilize and appropriately refer a patient for urgent evaluation by specialists or emergency physicians. There are many types of emergencies encountered in the outpatient setting, ranging from cardiac to toxicologic. As important as recognizing signs and symptoms of cardiac ischemia is the ability to recognize potentially life-threatening dermatologic disorders or dermatologic manifestations of life-threatening systemic diseases."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is capable of persistently infecting a variety of hosts despite eliciting potent innate and adaptive immune responses. Preliminary studies indicated that IL-10-deficient (IL-10(-/-)) mice exhibit up to 10-fold greater clearance of B. burgdorferi from target tissues compared with wild-type mice, establishing IL-10 as the only cytokine currently known to have such a significant effect on spirochetal clearance. To further delineate these IL-10-mediated immune effects, kinetic studies indicated that spirochete dissemination to target tissues is similar in both wild-type and IL-10(-/-) mouse strains, and that enhanced clearance of B. burgdorferi in IL-10(-/-) mice is correlated with increased B. burgdorferi-specific Ab as early as 2 wk postinfection. Immunoblot analysis indicated that Abs produced by infected IL-10(-/-) and wild-type mice recognize similar ranges of spirochetal Ags. Immune sera from IL-10(-/-) and wild-type mice also exhibited similar bactericidal activity in vitro, and passive transfer of these immune sera into B. burgdorferi-infected SCID mice caused similar reductions of bacterial numbers in target tissues. Infectious dose studies indicated that 8-fold more B. burgdorferi were needed to efficiently infect naive IL-10(-/-) mice, suggesting these animals possess higher innate barriers to infection. Moreover, macrophages derived from IL-10(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced proinflammatory responses to B. burgdorferi stimulation compared with wild-type controls, and these responses are not significantly affected by the presence of immune serum. These findings confirm that B. burgdorferi clearance by innate immune responses is more efficient in the absence of IL-10, and these activities are not directly related to increased levels of B. burgdorferi-specific Ab."

Previous phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that the bacterium formed a divergent lineage within the Rickettsiales (Alphaproteobacteria). Here, we present additional phylogenetic evidence, based on the gyrB gene sequence, that confirms the phylogenetic position of the bacterium. Based on these data, as well as electron microscopy (EM), in situ hybridization and other observations, we propose the name 'Candidatus Midichloria mitochondrii' for this bacterium. The symbiont appears to be ubiquitous in females of I. ricinus across the tick's distribution, while lower prevalence is observed in males (44%). Based on EM and in situ hybridization studies, the presence of 'Candidatus M. mitochondrii' in females appears to be restricted to ovarian cells. The bacterium was found to be localized both in the cytoplasm and in the intermembrane space of the mitochondria of ovarian cells. 'Candidatus M. mitochondrii' is the first bacterium to be identified that resides within animal mitochondria."

We report on a case that occurred at the Hospital General Universitario in Alicante, in which papilloedema was the initial symptom of POEMS syndrome. A 36-year-old female, with no relevant past history, who visited after suffering a left-side frontal oppressive headache for five days; onset was sudden, there was no concomitant nausea or vomiting, it did not get worse when Valsalva manoeuvres were performed and there were no other accompanying symptoms. The examination revealed nasal blurring in the visual field of the right eye and papilloedema in the left eye, hyperpigmentation of the skin on the face and upper chest area that respected creases in the skin, painful distal tactile hypaesthesia in the lower limbs and bilateral areflexia of Achilles' tendons and patellar hyperreflexia. After conducting a number of different complementary tests intracranial space-occupying lesions and intracranial hypotension were both ruled out and the patient was diagnosed with mixed-type sensory-motor chronic polyneuropathy in the upper limbs, and in the lower extremities with predominantly distal involvement, bilateral oedema of the papilla and skin photosensitivity. Two years later the patient had hepatomegaly, subclinical hypothyroidism and sclerodermiform alterations of the skin, which suggested a probable diagnosis of POEMS syndrome that was later confirmed by the presence of monoclonal component in blood and urine. Papilloedema is rarely seen as the initial symptom of POEMS syndrome, but it must be included in the differential diagnosis of this pathology due to the diagnostic and therapeutic implications it entails."

The current review summarizes the available data linking fibromyalgia to either infection or vaccination. Multiple infectious agents have been associated with the development of either full-blown fibromyalgia (e.g. hepatits C), or with symptom complexes extensively overlapping with that syndrome (e.g. chronic Lyme disease). The cases of Lyme disease, mycoplasma, hepatits C and HIV are detailed. Despite the described associations, no evidence is available demonstrating the utility of antibiotic or anti-viral treatment in the management of fibromyalgia. Possible mechanistic links between fibromyalgia and HIV are reviewed. Associations have been described between various vaccinations and symptom complexes including fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome. The case of Gulf War syndrome, a functional multisystem entity sharing many clinical characteristics with fibromyalgia is discussed, with emphasis on the possibility of association with administration of multiple vaccinations during deployment in the Persian Gulf and the interaction with stress and trauma. Based on this example a model is proposed, wherein vaccinations function as co-triggers for the development of functional disorders including fibromyalgia, in conjunction with additional contributing factors."

		"abstract": "The relatively low percent of patients affected with the cardiac form of Lyme borreliosis is difficult to diagnose, especially if the disease manifests itself in ways other than atrio-ventricular blockade. The advanced stage of Lyme carditis manifesting as dilated cardiomyopathy is a special case of this affliction. The authors of this report present clinical experience with an attempt to support the working hypothesis about involvement of Lyme borreliosis infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. The patients were clinically examined thoroughly with special attention to the cardiovascular system. In addition to the basic clinical methods, the following procedures have been employed: dynamic Holter's electrocardiography, exercise ECG test, coronarography, and myocardial biopsy. From laboratory methods pertaining to the detection of Borrelia, ELISA method, Western blot, PCR, electron microscopy and histopathological analysis were used. In all three cases, clinical and laboratory findings provided the evidence of the borreliosis infection involvement in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy."

		"abstract": "Neurological manifestations of Lyme disease are usually accompanied by inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the recruitment of activated T cells into the CSF compartment. In order to characterize the phenotype and identify target antigens of CSF-infiltrating T cells in early neuroborreliosis with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, we combined T-cell cloning, functional testing of T-cell responses with positional scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries, and biometric data analysis. We demonstrate that CD4+ gamma interferon-producing T cells specifically responding to Borrelia burgdorferi lysate were present in the CSF of a patient with acute Lyme encephalitis. Some T-cell clones recognized previously uncharacterized B. burgdorferi epitopes which show a specific enrichment for lysine, such as the heat shock-induced chaperone HSP90. Degenerate T-cell recognition that included T-cell responses to borrelia-specific and CNS-specific autoantigens derived from the myelin protein 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) could be demonstrated for one representative clone. Our results show that spirochetal antigen-specific and Th1-polarized CD4+ lymphocytes infiltrate the CSF during monophasic CNS symptoms of Lyme disease and demonstrate that cross-recognition of CNS antigens by B. burgdorferi-specific T cells is not restricted to chronic and treatment-resistant manifestations."

		"abstract": "Human infection by Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent for Lyme disease, can result in serious acute and late-term disorders including neuroborreliosis, a degenerative condition of the peripheral and central nervous systems. To examine the mechanisms involved in the cellular pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis, we investigated the ability of B. burgdorferi to attach to and/or invade a panel of human neuroglial and cortical neuronal cells. In all neural cells tested, we observed B. burgdorferi in association with the cell by confocal microscopy. Further analysis by differential immunofluorescent staining of external and internal organisms, and a gentamicin protection assay demonstrated an intracellular localization of B. burgdorferi. A non-infectious strain of B. burgdorferi was attenuated in its ability to associate with these neural cells, suggesting that a specific borrelial factor related to cellular infectivity was responsible for the association. Cytopathic effects were not observed following infection of these cell lines with B. burgdorferi, and internalized spirochetes were found to be viable. Invasion of neural cells by B. burgdorferi provides a putative mechanism for the organism to avoid the host's immune response while potentially causing functional damage to neural cells during infection of the CNS."

Epidemiologic review of the generalizability of two trials conducted by Klempner et al. This paper considers whether the study group was representative of the general chronic Lyme disease population. In their article in The New England Journal of Medicine, Klempner et al. failed to discuss the limitations of their clinical trials. This epidemiologic review argues that their results are not generalizable to the overall Lyme disease population. The treatment failure reported by the authors may be the result of enrolling patients who remained ill after an average of 4.7 years and an average of 3 previous courses of treatment. The poor outcome cited in these trials may be explained by having selected patients who had undergone delayed treatment or multiple treatments unsuccessfully. These selection factors were not addressed by the studies' authors, nor have they been discussed by reviewers. The trials have been over-interpreted by the NIH and widely publicized in a press release. The results have been extrapolated to other groups of Lyme disease patients by commentators, by a case discussant in an influential medical journal, and by health insurance companies to deny antibiotic treatment. The Klempner et al. trials are assumed to be internally valid based on a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design. However, this review argues that the trials have limited generalizability beyond the select group of patients with characteristics like those in the trial. Applying the findings to target populations with characteristics that differ from those included in these trials is inappropriate and may limit options for chronic Lyme disease patients who might benefit from antibiotic treatment."

Cohort study. Archived tissue samples from 58 dogs. A quantitative PCR assay was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections from the dogs. Results were compared with results of immunohistochemical staining, B burgdorferi serostatus, clinical signs, and necropsy findings. 38 dogs were classified as having positive or equivocal results for Lyme borreliosis, and 20 were classified as having negative results on the basis of clinical signs, serologic findings, and pathologic abnormalities. Borrelia burgdorferi DNA was amplified from tissue samples from only 4 (7%) dogs, all of which had been classified as having positive or equivocal results for Lyme borreliosis and had signs of presumptive Lyme nephritis. Results of PCR assays of renal tissue were positive for only 1 dog, and there was no agreement between results of immunohistochemical staining (ie, detection of B burgdorferi antigen) and results of the PCR assay (ie, detection of B burgdorferi DNA) for renal tissues. Results indicated that detection of B burgdorferi DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues is feasible, but that intact B burgdorferi DNA is rarely found in tissues from naturally infected dogs, even tissues from dogs with presumptive Lyme borreliosis. Further, findings support the contention that Lyme nephritis may be a sterile, immune complex disease."

		"abstract": "The pathogens that cause Lyme disease (LD), human anaplasmosis, and babesiosis can coexist in Ixodes ticks and cause human coinfections. Although the risk of human coinfection differs by geographic location, the true prevalence of coinfecting pathogens among Ixodes ticks remains largely unknown for the majority of geographic locations. The prevalence of dually infected Ixodes ticks appears highest among ticks from regions of North America and Europe where LD is endemic, with reported prevalences of < or =28%. In North America and Europe, the majority of tick-borne coinfections occur among humans with diagnosed LD. Humans coinfected with LD and babesiosis appear to have more intense, prolonged symptoms than those with LD alone. Coinfected persons can also manifest diverse, influenza-like symptoms, and abnormal laboratory test results are frequently observed. Coinfecting pathogens might alter the efficiency of transmission, cause cooperative or competitive pathogen interactions, and alter disease severity among hosts. No prospective studies to assess the immunologic effects of coinfection among humans have been conducted, but animal models demonstrate that certain coinfections can modulate the immune response. Clinicians should consider the likelihood of coinfection when pursuing laboratory testing or selecting therapy for patients with tick-borne illness."

During 2004, we collected I. pacificus nymphs from 78 woodland sites in ecologically diverse Mendocino County, which has a moderately high incidence of Lyme disease. Within this county, nymphal density was elevated in forested areas with a growing degree day range of 2,600-3,000 (10 degrees C base). Using a geographic information systems approach, we identified all areas in California sharing these environmental characteristics and thus projected to pose high acarologic risk of exposure to host-seeking nymphal ticks. Such areas were most commonly detected in the northwestern part of the state and along the Sierra Nevada foothills in the northeast, but the analysis also identified isolated areas with high acarologic risk in southern California. This mirrors the spatial distribution of endemic Lyme disease during 1993-2005; most cases occurred in counties to the northwest (58%) or northeast (26%), whereas fewer cases were reported from southern California (16%). Southern zip-codes from which Lyme disease cases had been reported were commonly located in close proximity to areas with high projected acarologic risk. Overall, Lyme disease incidence in zip code areas containing habitat with high projected acarologic risk was 10-fold higher than in zip code areas lacking such habitat and 27 times higher than for zip code areas without this habitat type within 50 km. A comparison of spatial Lyme disease incidence patterns based on county versus zip code units showed that calculating and displaying disease incidence at the zip code scale is a useful method to detect small, isolated areas with elevated disease risk that otherwise may go undetected."

According to North American studies, it can also present as a symmetric chronic polyneuropathy without ACA or other Lyme manifestations. Our purpose was to investigate the prevalence of B. burgdorferi antibodies in patients presenting with isolated chronic polyneuropathy (PN) in a European region with high incidence of Lyme disease. Sera from 209 PN patients and 247 healthy blood donors from Vest-Agder County, Norway, were examined. Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were detected in 43 (21%) PN patients and in 45 (18%) healthy blood donors (P = 0.553). The prevalence of B. burgdorferi antibodies was similar (P = 0.311) in cryptogenic PN (24/102, 24%) and PNs of identified etiologies (19/107, 18%). PN patients with B. burgdorferi antibodies had normal spinal fluid white cell count and they did not differ clinically or electrophysiologically from PN patients without antibodies. None of 20 antibody-positive PN patients responded to antimicrobial treatment. The study shows that, in Europe, chronic distal PN without ACA or other Lyme manifestations is very rarely caused by a B. burgdorferi infection."

		"abstract": "Three genetic markers of Borrelia burgdorferi have been associated with disseminated disease: the OspC type, the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer type (RST), and vlsE. Here, we modified previous methods so as to identify the three markers by PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism in parallel, analyzed B. burgdorferi isolates from erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions in 91 patients, and correlated the results with evidence of dissemination. OspC type A was found approximately twice as frequently in patients with disseminated disease, whereas type K was identified approximately twice as often in those without evidence of dissemination, but these trends were not statistically significant. The remaining seven types identified were found nearly equally in patients with or without evidence of dissemination. RST 1 strains were significantly associated with dissemination (P=0.03), whereas RST 2 and RST 3 strains tended to have an inverse association with this outcome. The vlsE gene was identified in all 91 cases, using primer sets specific for an N-terminal sequence of B. burgdorferi strain B31 (vlsEB31) or strain 297 (vlsE297), but neither marker was associated with dissemination. Specific combinations of the three genetic markers usually occurred together. OspC type A was always found with RST 1 and vlsEB31, type K was always identified with RST 2 and more often with vlsE297, and types E and I were almost always found with RST 3 and equally often with vlsEB31 and vlsE297. We conclude that B. burgdorferi strains vary in their capacity to disseminate, but almost all strains isolated from EM lesions sometimes caused disseminated disease."

		"abstract": "Fitness of tick-borne pathogens may be determined by the degree to which their infection dynamics in vertebrate hosts permits transmission cycles if infective and uninfected tick stages are active at different times of the year. To investigate this hypothesis we developed a simulation model that integrates the transmission pattern imposed by seasonally asynchronous nymphal and larval Ixodes scapularis ticks in northeastern North America, with a model of infection in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) reservoir hosts, using the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum as examples. In simulations, survival of microparasites, their sensitivity to reduced rodent and tick abundance, and to 'dilution' by a reservoir-incompetent host depended on traits that allowed (i) highly efficient transmission from acutely-infected hosts, (ii) long-lived acute or 'carrier' host infections, and/or (iii) transmission amongst co-feeding ticks. Minimum values for transmission efficiency to ticks, and duration of host infectivity, necessary for microparasite persistence, were always higher when nymphal and larval ticks were seasonally asynchronous than when these instars were synchronous. Thus, traits influencing duration of host infectivity, transmission efficiency to ticks and co-feeding transmission are likely to be dominant determinants of fitness in I. scapularis-borne microparasites in northeastern North America due to abiotic forcings influencing I. scapularis seasonality."

In ELISA, a mid-portion hydrophilic fragment reacted with LB patient sera. Of the 23 patients with culture- or PCR-positive erythema migrans (EM), 43 % at diagnosis and 52 % at convalescence were positive for at least one Borrelia species-specific variant BBK32 fragment antigen. In parallel ELISAs with BBK32 whole proteins from the three borrelial subspecies as antigens, 17 % at diagnosis and 26 % at convalescence were positive. These results suggest that BBK32 protein fragments may improve the early IgG serology of LB compared to the BBK32 whole protein."

The C6 Lyme enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to evaluate coded serum specimens from patients with STARI at two laboratory sites. The specimens tested at one site consisted of acute- and convalescent-phase samples that were obtained from nine STARI patients from Missouri and from one patient with documented Borrelia lonestari infection who acquired this infection in either North Carolina or Maryland. All of these samples were C6 negative. Seventy acute- or convalescent-phase specimens from 63 STARI patients from Missouri were C6 tested at the second site. All but one of these STARI specimens were also negative. In contrast, of nine acute- and nine convalescent-phase serum specimens obtained from culture-confirmed Lyme disease patients with EM from New York state, seven were C6 positive at the acute stage, and eight were positive at convalescence. The C6 test is negative in patients with STARI, providing further evidence that B. burgdorferi is not the etiologic agent of this disease."

Previously captured mice (1992-1997) from throughout New York state also were recruited into the study, providing a total of 3,664 Peromyscus from 107 sites in 31 counties. Infection with B. burgdorferi was determined by polymerase chain reaction testing of ear tissue, and rates were determined by species, counties, and regions of the state. B. burgdorferi was detected in 10 small mammal species captured during 1998-2000. Peromyscus captured from Dutchess County in the lower Hudson Valley had the highest infection rate of 21%. The next highest infection rates were in counties within the Capital District: Albany (18%), Rensselaer (17%), and Columbia (13%). From 4,792 small animals examined, we recovered 2,073 ticks representing six species from 414 individuals of 12 mammal species, including 1,839 I. scapularis collected from 315 Peromyscus trapped in five counties. I. scapularis were most often collected from animals trapped in Albany, Rensselear, and Dutchess counties. We used protein electrophoresis of salivary amylase to distinguish between P. leucopus and P. maniculatus species. I. scapularis burdens were 5.7 ticks per P. leucopus and 14.3 ticks per P. maniculatus."

Although progress has been made in the targeted mutagenesis of individual genes in infectious Borrelia burgdorferi, the roles of the vast majority of gene products in pathogenesis remain unresolved. In this study, we examined the feasibility of using transposon mutagenesis to identify infectivity-related factors in B. burgdorferi. The transformable, infectious strain 5A18 NP1 was transformed with the spirochete-adapted Himar1 transposon delivery vector pMarGent to create a small library of 33 insertion mutants. Single mouse inoculations followed by culture of four tissue sites and serology were used to screen the mutants for infectivity phenotypes. Mutants that appeared attenuated (culture positive at some sites) or noninfectious (negative at all sites) and contained the virulence-associated plasmids lp25 and lp28-1 were examined in more extensive animal studies. Three of these mutants (including those with insertions in the putative fliG-1-encoded flagellar motor switch protein and the guaB-encoded IMP dehydrogenase) were noninfectious, whereas four clones appeared to exhibit reduced infectivity. Serological reactivity in VlsE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays correlated with the assignment of mutants to the noninfectious or attenuated-infectivity groups. The results of this study indicate that random transposon mutagenesis of infectious B. burgdorferi is feasible and will be of value in studying the pathogenesis of Lyme disease Borrelia."

Ticks were detected in all 31 farms with a mean prevalence of 69%. 3218 out of 3453 collected ticks were Ixodes ricinus; 139 nymphs, 19 larvae and 77 damaged adult specimens could only be determined to the Genus level (Ixodes). The seasonal pattern revealed the highest frequencies of ticks in May/June and September. The intensity of tick infestation of positive animals was generally low. 76.5% of parasitized cattle had 1-6 ticks per day of investigation. Individual cattle showed up to 250 ticks per day. The percentage of infested animals in each herd varied within the period between 0-100%. The examination of serum samples by immunofluorescence technique (IFAT) revealed positive anti-Borrelia antibody titers (> or = 1:64) for 45.6% of the animals. The within-farm seroprevalence of borreliosis ranged from 20 to 100% in 27 of the 31 farms. A significant correlation could be detected between the number of ticks/cattle and the anti-Borrelia burgdorferi IgG-titer. By contrast, there was no significant correlation between the age of the animals and anti-Borrelia serum titers. For comparative reasons, 64 IFAT-positive serum samples were tested by Western blot techniques for the presence of antibodies cross-reacting with Borrelia garinii antigen. These analyses revealed that 69% of the samples reacted positively, 28% were unclear and 3% were negative. Examinations of the 287 serum samples for the presence of anti-Babesia divergens antibodies revealed one positive animal with a titer of 1:16."

		"abstract": "Arthritis is one of the hallmarks of late-stage Lyme disease. Previous studies have shown that infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, results in degradation of proteoglycans and collagen in cartilage. B burgdorferi do not appear to produce any exported proteases capable of digesting proteoglycans and collagen, but instead, induce and activate host proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which results in cartilage degradation. The role of aggrecanases in Lyme arthritis has not yet been determined. We therefore sought to delineate the contribution of aggrecanases to joint destruction in Lyme arthritis. We examined the expression patterns of aggrecanases 1 and 2 (ADAMTS 4 and 5, respectively) in B burgdorferi-infected primary human chondrocyte cell cultures, in synovial fluid samples from patients with active Lyme arthritis, and in the joints of mice by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting techniques. Bovine cartilage explants were used to determine the role of aggrecanases in B burgdorferi-induced cartilage degradation. ADAMTS-4, but not ADAMTS-5, was induced in human chondrocytes infected with B burgdorferi. The active forms of ADAMTS-4 were increased in synovial fluid samples from patients with active Lyme arthritis and were elevated in the joints of mice infected with B burgdorferi. Using cartilage explant models of Lyme arthritis, it appeared that the cleavage of aggrecan was predominantly mediated by \"aggrecanases\" rather than MMPs. The induction of ADAMTS-4 by B burgdorferi results in the cleavage of aggrecan, which may be an important first step that leads to permanent degradation of cartilage."

In contrast, positive DNA supercoiling is a by-product of cellular processes that involve helical unwinding or movement of DNA by a fixed translocase, and has generally been considered a necessary evil requiring removal. We now report the first evidence suggesting a physiological role for positive supercoiling; this occurs in telomere resolution in the related Lyme disease and relapsing fever Borrelia spirochetes. Telomere resolution is the process whereby covalently closed hairpin telomeres are generated from replicative intermediates by the telomere resolvase, ResT. We observe a 20-fold and greater stimulation of the reaction by positive supercoiling, which facilitates formation of a previously unobserved reaction intermediate. Our data suggest the possibility that the free energy of positive supercoiling, a resource with no previously described cellular function, may be harnessed and utilized as a regulator of post-replication events."

Sequence analyses have identified 21 well defined OspC phyletic groups or \"types\" (designated A-U). In this report we have mapped the linear epitopes presented by OspC types B, K, and D during human and murine infection and exploited these epitopes (along with the previously identified type A OspC linear epitopes) in the development of a recombinant, tetravalent, chimeric vaccinogen. The construct was found to be highly immunogenic in mice and the induced antibodies surface labeled in vitro cultivated spirochetes. Importantly, vaccination induced complement-dependent bactericidal antibodies against strains expressing each of the OspC types that were incorporated into the construct. These results suggest that an effective and broadly protective polyvalent OspC-based Lyme disease vaccine can be produced as a recombinant, chimeric protein."

Another member of the Lyme disease spirochete complex, Borrelia bissettii, is distributed widely throughout North America and a similar, if not identical, spirochete has been implicated as a human pathogen in southern Europe. To determine the susceptibility of S. occidentalis to B. bissettii, 6 naïve lizards were exposed to the feeding activities of Ixodes pacificus nymphs experimentally infected with this spirochete. None of the lizards developed spirochetemias detectable by polymerase chain reaction for up to 8 wk post-tick feeding, infected nymphs apparently lost their B. bissettii infections within 1-2 wk after engorgement, and xenodiagnostic L. pacificus larvae that co-fed alongside infected nymphs did not acquire and maintain spirochetes. In contrast, 3 of 4 naïve deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) exposed similarly to feeding by 1 or more B. bissettii-infected nymphs developed patent infections within 4 wk. These and previous findings suggest that the complement system of S. occidentalis typically destroys B. burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes present in tissues of attached and feeding I. pacificus nymphs, thereby potentially reducing the probability of transmission of these bacteria to humans or other animals by the resultant adult ticks."

LD manifests itself as a multisystem inflammatory disease that affects the skin in its early localized stage and spreads to the joints, nervous system, heart, and, to a lesser extent, other organ systems in its later disseminated stages. If diagnosed and treated early with appropriate antibiotics, LD is almost always readily cured. Developing a highly sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay could be very useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy and decreasing turnaround time for results. We report the development of a LightCycler TaqMan assay targeting the OspA gene for clinical detection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in various types of biologic samples. This assay was validated by testing a variety of clinical samples including cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, skin biopsies, and blood and culture isolates from skin biopsies. The TaqMan testing results were 100% concordant with previously reported results. Reference strains representing isolates from other geographic regions were also successfully amplified. The developed assay is robust, is highly sensitive and specific for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and is suitable for clinical detection of the bacterium in biologic samples."

To understand the events during spirochete transmission from feeding ticks to hosts, mRNA levels of selected B. afzelii genes (bbk32, dbpA, ospA, ospC and vlsE) were measured by quantitative real-time SYBR Green PCR. B. afzelii infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs fed on laboratory BALB/c mice for 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours. The mRNA levels of the constantly expressed flagellin gene were used for the relative quantification of selected genes. Differences in gene expression profiles were observed in unfed ticks and during tick feeding. mRNA levels of bbk32 and dbpA showed distinctive decreasing patterns during the first 24 hours post-attachment, while ospC and vlsE mRNA levels increased significantly during the feeding process. In contrast, ospA levels decreased for the 48 hours of tick feeding and slightly increased by 72 hours. More detailed and comprehensive studies on regulation of gene expression in different Borellia genospecies on the vector-host interface would aid to develop effective strategies in preventing pathogen transmission."

		"abstract": "It has been established that interleukin-10 (IL-10) inhibits inflammatory cytokines produced by macrophages in response to Borrelia burgdorferi or its lipoproteins. The mechanism by which IL-10 exerts this anti-inflammatory effect is still unknown. Recent findings indicate that suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are induced by cytokines and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated stimuli, and in turn they can down-regulate cytokine and TLR signaling in macrophages. Because it is known that SOCS are induced by IL-10 and that B. burgdorferi and its lipoproteins most likely interact via TLR2 or the heterodimers TLR2/1 and/or TLR2/6, we hypothesized that SOCS are induced by IL-10 and B. burgdorferi and its lipoproteins in macrophages and that SOCS may mediate the inhibition by IL-10 of concomitantly elicited cytokines. We report here that mouse J774 macrophages incubated with IL-10 and added B. burgdorferi spirochetes (freeze-thawed, live, or sonicated) or lipidated outer surface protein A (L-OspA) augmented their SOCS1/SOCS3 mRNA and protein expression, with SOCS3 being more abundant. Pam(3)Cys, a synthetic lipopeptide, also induced SOCS1/SOCS3 expression under these conditions, but unlipidated OspA was ineffective. Neither endogenous IL-10 nor the translation inhibitor cycloheximide blocked SOCS1/SOCS3 induction by B. burgdorferi and its lipoproteins, indicating that the expression of other genes is not required. This temporally correlated with the IL-10-mediated inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-18, and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Our data are evidence to suggest that expression of SOCS is part of the mechanism of IL-10-mediated inhibition of inflammatory cytokines elicited by B. burgdorferi and its lipoproteins."

		"abstract": "Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, results in a Th1 response and proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice deficient for MKK3, an upstream activator of p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, develop a lower Th1 response and exhibit an impaired ability to produce proinflammatory cytokines upon infection with the spirochete. We investigated the contribution of p38 MAP kinase activity in gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production in CD4+ T cells in response to specific antigen through T-cell receptor (TCR)- and interleukin-12 (IL-12)-mediated signals. The specific inhibition of p38 MAP kinase in T cells and the administration of a pharmacological inhibitor of the kinase during the course of infection with the spirochete resulted in reduced levels of IFN-gamma in the sera of infected mice. Our results also demonstrate that although p38 MAP kinase activity is not required for the differentiation of B. burgdorferi-specific CD4+ T cells, the production of IFN-gamma by Th1 effector cells is regulated by the kinase. Both TCR engagement and IL-12 induced the production of the Th1 cytokine through the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. Thus, the inhibition of this pathway in vitro resulted in decreased levels of IFN-gamma during restimulation of B. burgdorferi-specific T cells in response to anti-CD3 and IL-12 stimulation. These results clarify the specific contribution of the p38 MAP kinase in the overall immune response to the spirochete and its role in the effector function of B. burgdorferi-specific T cells."

The amplification products of positive ticks were sequenced, and phylogenetic analysis was conducted by PHYLIP software package. The infection rate of B. b. s. l was 36.0% in Ixodes persulcatus ticks and the SFGR was discovered in I. persulcatus ticks,with an infection rate of 2.0%. The coinfection rate of both agents was 2.0%. In 327 Dermacentor siltarum ticks, the positive rates of B. b. s. l and SFGR were 30.9% and 29.1% respectively. 55 ticks (16.8%) were coinfected with the two pathogens. The sequence analysis of B. b. s. l showed that the B. b. s. l in Jilin area, which were highly homologous, all belonged to B. garinii genotypes. The sequence analysis of SFGR positive products showed that the DNA secquence of the newly detected agent (JL-95) was close to the two previously described rickettsiae which were detected in I. ricinus from Slovakia (called IRS3 and IRS4). Phylogenetic relationships inferred from the comparison of these sequences with those of other genus Rickettsiae indicated that JL-95, IRS3 and IRS4 constituted a new rickettsial genotype and formed a separate cluster among the spotted fever group Rickettsiae. Coinfection of B. b. s. l and SFGR existed in Hunchun, Jilin province. The sequencing of specific fragment confirmed a new SFGR which was different from other rickettsiae known in China."

The specificity of MAb 16.22 was determined by Western blot reactivity using OspC derived from different Borrelia isolates which had varying amino acid sequences. Comparison of the OspC sequences and binding data suggested that MAb 16.22 binds to amino acids 133-147 of the OspC protein. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized a 15-amino acid peptide containing the target sequence and, using competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found that this peptide included the epitope of MAb 16.22. In addition, we determined that MAb 16.22 is able to kill of B. burgdorferi in a complement-independent fashion."

		"abstract": "Causative agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever, including Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia hermsii, respectively, are unusual among bacteria in that they possess a segmented genome with linear DNA molecules terminated by hairpin ends, known as telomeres. During replication, these telomeres are processed by the essential telomere resolvase, ResT, in a unique biochemical reaction known as telomere resolution. In this study, we report the identification of the B. hermsii resT gene through cross-species hybridization. Sequence comparison of the B. hermsii protein with the B. burgdorferi orthologue revealed 67% identity, including all the regions currently known to be crucial for telomere resolution. In vitro studies, however, indicated that B. hermsii ResT was unable to process a replicated B. burgdorferi type 2 telomere substrate. In contrast, in vivo cross-species complementation in which the native resT gene of B. burgdorferi was replaced with B. hermsii resT had no discernible effect, even though B. burgdorferi strain B31 carries at least two type 2 telomere ends. The B. burgdorferi ResT protein was also able to process two telomere spacing mutants in vivo that were unresolvable in vitro. The unexpected differential telomere processing in vivo versus in vitro by the two telomere resolvases suggests the presence of one or more accessory factors in vivo that are normally involved in the reaction. Our current results are also expected to facilitate further studies into ResT structure and function, including possible interaction with other Borrelia proteins."

A modified vaccination schedule was included in the study in an attempt to induce higher and therefore longer-lasting protective antibody levels during the first year of immunization. Following vaccination antibodies were monitored using ELISA and Western blotting. Serum samples were examined either with antigen preparations derived from either Borrelia burgdorferi s. s., B. garinii or B. afzelii lysates or separately with recombinant OspA derived from the three species. Regardless of the vaccine used the third vaccination induced significantly higher antibody levels. Further analyses of the sera with homologue and heterologue detection systems showed in vitro only a minor cross-reactivity of vaccinal antibodies towards antigens derived from heterologous Borrelia species in vitro and consequently only minimal cross-protection can be expected."

People who are repeatedly exposed to ticks may develop an immune response to tick salivary proteins. Despite this response, people usually are unaware of having been bitten, especially if they are not repeatedly exposed to ticks. In order to develop a laboratory marker of tick exposure that would be useful in understanding the epidemiology of tick-borne infection and the immune response to tick bite, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibody to a recombinant form of calreticulin protein found in the salivary glands of Ixodes scapularis, a member of a complex of Ixodes ticks that serve as the vectors for Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Using this assay, we tested sera obtained from C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice before and after experimental deer tick infestation. These mice developed antibody to Ixodes calreticulin antigen after infestation. We then used the same assay to test sera obtained from people before and after they experienced deer tick bite(s). People experiencing deer tick bite(s) developed Ixodes calreticulin-specific antibody responses that persisted for up to 17 months. This Ixodes recombinant calreticulin ELISA provides objective evidence of deer tick exposure in people."

B. burgdorferi was genetically modified to constitutively express OspC by introducing an extra ospC copy fused with the borrelial flagellar gene (flaB) promoter. Such a genetic modification did not reduce infectivity or pathogenicity in severe combined immunodeficiency mice but resulted in clearance of infection by passively transferred OspC antibody. Spirochetes with constitutive ospC expression were unable to establish chronic infections in immunocompetent mice unless they had undergone very destructive mutations in the introduced ospC copy. Two escape mutants were identified; one had all 7 bp deleted between the putative ribosome-binding site and the start codon, ATG, causing a failure in translational initiation, and the other mutant had an insertion of 2 bp between nucleotides 315 and 316, resulting in a nonsense mutation at codon 108. Thus, the ability of B. burgdorferi to repress ospC expression during mammalian infection allows the pathogen to avoid clearance and to preserve the integrity of the important gene for subsequent utilization during its enzootic life cycle."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, employs sophisticated means to survive in diverse mammalian hosts. Recent studies demonstrated that acquisition of complement regulators factor H and factor H-like protein-1 (FHL-1) allows spirochetes to resist complement-mediated killing. Serum-resistant B. burgdorferi express up to five distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) that bind factor H and/or FHL-1. In this study we have identified and characterized one of those B. burgdorferi proteins, named BbCRASP-2. BbCRASP-2 is distinct from the four previously identified factor H/FHL-1-binding CRASPs of B. burgdorferi strains. The single copy of the gene encoding BbCRASP-2, cspZ, is located on the linear plasmid lp28-3. BbCRASP-2 is highly divergent from the factor H/FHL-1-binding protein BbCRASP-1 and from members of the factor H-binding Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family. Peptide mapping analysis revealed that the factor H/FHL-1 binding site is discontinuous and it was found that C-terminal truncations abrogate factor H and FHL-1 binding. The predominant BbCRASP-2 binding site of both host complement regulators was mapped to the short consensus repeat 7 (SCR 7). Factor H and FHL-1 bound to BbCRASP-2 maintain cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation and accelerate the decay of the C3 convertase. Expression of BbCRASP-2 in serum-sensitive B. burgdorferi mutant B313 increased resistance to complement-mediated lysis. The characterization of BbCRASP-2 now provides a complete picture of the three diverse complement regulator-binding protein families of B. burgdorferi yielding new insights into the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Clinical and murine studies suggest that there is a differential pathogenicity of different genotypes of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease. Comparative genome hybridization was used to explore the relationship between different genotypes. The chromosomes of all studied isolates were highly conserved (>93%) with respect to both sequence and gene order. Plasmid sequences were substantially more diverse. Plasmids lp54, cp26, and cp32 were present in all tested isolates, and their sequences and gene order were conserved. The majority of linear plasmids showed variation both in terms of presence among different isolates and in terms of sequence and gene order. The data strongly imply that all B. burgdorferi clinical isolates contain linear plasmids related to each other, but the structure of these replicons may vary substantially from isolate to isolate. These alterations include deletions and presumed rearrangements that are likely to result in unique plasmid elements in many isolates. There is a strong correlation between complete genome hybridization profiles and other typing methods, which, in turn, also correlate to differences in pathogenicity. Because there is substantially less variation in the chromosomal and circular plasmid portions of the genome, the major differences in open reading frame content and genomic diversity among isolates are linear plasmid driven."

Previously defined foreign glycosphingolipids recognized by NKT cells are uniquely found in nonpathogenic sphingomonas bacteria.

The B. burgdorferi-derived, glycolipid-induced NKT cell proliferation and cytokine production and the antigenic potency of this glycolipid was dependent on acyl chain length and saturation. These data indicate that NKT cells recognize categories of glycolipids beyond those in sphingomonas and suggest that NKT cell responses driven by T cell receptor-mediated glycolipid recognition may provide protection against diverse pathogens."

Previous work including the genome analysis of B. burgdorferi B31 and B. garinii PBi suggested a highly variable plasmid part. The frequent occurrence of duplicated sequence stretches, the observed plasmid redundancy, as well as the mainly unknown function and variability of plasmid encoded genes rendered the relationships between plasmids within and between species largely unresolvable. To gain further insight into Borreliae genome properties we completed the plasmid sequences of B. garinii PBi, added the genome of a further species, B. afzelii PKo, to our analysis, and compared for both species the genomes of pathogenic and apathogenic strains. The core of all Bbsl genomes consists of the chromosome and two plasmids collinear between all species. We also found additional groups of plasmids, which share large parts of their sequences. This makes it very likely that these plasmids are relatively stable and share common ancestors before the diversification of Borrelia species. The analysis of the differences between B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo genomes of low and high passages revealed that the loss of infectivity is accompanied in both species by a loss of similar genetic material. Whereas B. garinii PBi suffered only from the break-off of a plasmid end, B. afzelii PKo lost more material, probably an entire plasmid. In both cases the vls gene locus encoding for variable surface proteins is affected. The complete genome sequences of a B. garinii and a B. afzelii strain facilitate further comparative studies within the genus Borrellia. Our study shows that loss of infectivity can be traced back to only one single event in B. garinii PBi: the loss of the vls cassettes possibly due to error prone gene conversion. Similar albeit extended losses in B. afzelii PKo support the hypothesis that infectivity of Borrelia species depends heavily on the evasion from the host response."

In 2005 case definitions were implemented in Poland to allow a better comparability of data within the country and with other European countries. LB is widespread in Poland. Studies of prevalence of infected ticks indicate that from 6 to 15% of I. ricinus ticks in different sites are infected with the spirochete. Data from seroepidemiologic studies and from routine surveillance (started in 1996) confirm that the disease is widespread in Poland, and its incidence is increasing. It has increased from 2.31 per 100,000 in 1999 to 11.55 in 2005. One reason of this increase is the improvement in diagnosis of the disease. There is a need to promote personal protection during outdoor activities and knowledge on LB symptoms, especially among populations at risk--forestry workers, farmers. TBE incidence is limited to two main foci--one in the Northeast of Poland bordering Baltic states endemic region, and the second on the South of Poland, neighbouring the Czech and Slovak republics. Seroepidemiologic data, supported by surveillance data, indicate that there are areas of particularly high TBEV activity. The mostly affected occupational groups are: unemployed, retired, students, and farmers. This is a reason to promote personal protection and prophylactic vaccination of both inhabitants of endemic regions and tourists visiting endemic regions."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multisystem disease that affects primarily skin, nervous system, heart and joins. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and spread by Ixodes ticks. Arthritis is a well-known manifestation of Lyme disease (LD). Joint symptoms associated with B. burgdorferi infection range from arthralgias, to brief attacks of arthritis, to chronic erosive synovitis. Arthritis may present as oligo- or monoarthritis and typically causes intermittent attacks of oligoarticular arthritis in a few large joints, especially the knee. A small percentage of patients may develop chronic arthritis. The diagnosis is usually based on the clinical picture, exposure in an endemic area, and detection of IgG antibody against B. burgdorferi by ELISA and Western blotting. Spirochetal DNA may be detected in joint fluid by PCR. Antibiotic treatment during early stages normally prevents development of late manifestations. Joint involvement is treated successfully with a 1-month course of doxycycline or ceftriaxone. However, about 10% of Lyme arthritis patients do not respond sufficiently to antibiotic treatment. If patients have persistent arthritis despite a second course of antibiotics with negative results of PCR testing, treatment with anti-inflammatory agents or arthroscopic synovectomy is possible. In this article, we discuss clinical features, diagnosis and treatment."

Neuroborreliosis plays a particular role among them, especially in endemic regions. Difficulties result from similarities of clinical symptoms and lack of specific diagnostic investigations. Diagnostic procedures in neuroborreliosis are mostly based on laboratory analyses and serologic examinations of serum and cerebrospinal fluid, in connection with a clinical picture and an epidemiological state. Since the year 2001, multiple sclerosis neurological diagnostic is based on the diagnostic criteria established under the auspices of The US National Multiple Sclerosis Society and International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies. Those recommendations regarding relapsing-remitting MS and primary progressing MS are discussed in this paper. Current knowledge of those diseases warrants cautiousness in the diagnostic of atypical cases."

Here, we present evidence that administration of anti-CD25 antibody at the time of challenge or at later intervals fails to enhance the development of severe destructive osteoarthropathy in Borrelia-vaccinated C57BL mice. However, Borrelia-vaccinated and -challenged mice receiving anti-CD25 antibody developed decreased borreliacidal antibody titers compared to vaccinated and challenged controls.

Just 3 years later, the manufacturer voluntarily withdrew its product from the market amidst media coverage, fears of vaccine side-effects, and declining sales.

However, the large number of parameters required by the corresponding statistical models often complicates detailed analysis. This study investigates the feasibility of a fully Bayesian hierarchical regression approach to the problem and identifies how it outperforms two more popular methods: crude rate estimates (CRE) and empirical Bayes standardization (EBS). In particular, we apply a fully Bayesian approach to the spatiotemporal analysis of Lyme disease incidence in New York state for the period 1990-2000. These results are compared with those obtained by CRE and EBS in Chen et al. (2005). We show that the fully Bayesian regression model not only gives more reliable estimates of disease rates than the other two approaches but also allows for tractable models that can accommodate more numerous sources of variation and unknown parameters."

Our data of 591 adult I. scapularis submissions collected from domestic animals (canines, felines, and equines) and humans during a 10-yr period (1993-2002) discloses a monthly questing activity in Ontario that peaks in May and October. The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmidt, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner was detected in 12.9% of I. scapularis adults collected from domestic hosts with no history of out-of-province travel or exposure at a Lyme disease endemic area. Fifty-three isolates of B. burgdorferi were confirmed positive with polymerase chain reaction by targeting the rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) gene. Using DNA sequencing of the ribosomal species-specific rrf (5S) -rrl (23S) intergenic spacer region, all isolates belong to the pathogenic genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 218- to 220-bp amplicon fragment exhibits six cluster patterns and, collectively, these isolates branch into four phylogenetic cluster groups for both untraveled, mammalian hosts and those with travel to the northeastern United States (New Jersey and New York). Four of five geographic regions in Ontario had strain variants consisting of three different genomic cluster groups. Overall, our molecular characterization of B. burgdorferi s.s. shows genetic heterogeneity within Ontario and displays a connecting link to common strains from Lyme disease endemic areas in the northeastern United States. Moreover, our findings of B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis reveal that people and domestic animals may be exposed to Lyme disease vector ticks, which have wide-ranging distribution in eastern and central Canada."

(Spirochaetales), but human disease has been associated only with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt & Brenner in the western United States. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of rrf-rrl amplicons from 124 tick and mammalian isolates from various habitats yielded 13 RFLP patterns. Of these patterns, six were patterns previously associated either with Borrelia bissettii Postic, Marti Ras, Lane, Hendson & Baranton or Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., and the remaining seven patterns belonged to diverse and previously uncharacterized Borrelia spp. Uncharacterized Borrelia spp. were cultured most frequently from Ixodes spinipalpis Hadwen & Nuttall and California kangaroo rats, Dipodomys californicus Merriam, inhabiting grasslands, and B. bissettii from I. spinipalpis and dusky-footed woodrats, Neotoma fuscipes Baird, associated with oak woodlands or chaparral. B. burgdorferi s.s. typically was isolated from host-seeking Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls collected in dense oak woodlands, woodland-grass, or redwood forests. Although some isolates of B. burgdorferi s.s. were cultured from woodrats, there was no clear association of this human pathogen with any vertebrate host. These findings, along with recent evidence indicating that the western gray squirrel, Sciurus griseus Ord, may be an important reservoir of B. burgdorferi s.s. in Californian oak woodlands, suggest that our earlier hypothesis implicating an enzootic cycle involving woodrats and I. spinipalpis is insufficient to account for observed patterns of infection in nature."

		"abstract": "To investigate the reservoir role of the lizard Psammodromus algirus for the Lyme disease spirochete, 199 lizards were trapped from April to October 2003 in El Jouza, northwestern Tunisia. In this site, the infection rate of free-living Ixodes ricinus (L.) by Borrelia was evaluated by immunofluorescence as 34.6% for adult ticks and 12.5% for nymphs. Eighty percent of P. algirus (117/146) captured during this study were infested by I. ricinus, the predominant tick species collected from lizards. The intensity of tick infestation of this host by larvae and nymphs ranged from 0.14 to 7.07 and from 1.5 to 6.58, respectively. These immature stages of I. ricinus were found on lizards in spring and the beginning of summer, with a peak of intensity during June (10.16 immature ticks by lizard). Tissue cultures from lizards and xenodiagnosis with larval I. ricinus were used to assess the infection and the ability, respectively, of infected lizards to transmit Borrelia to naive ticks. Seventeen percent of xenodiagnostic ticks (40/229) acquired B. lusitaniae while feeding on P. algirus. Therefore, we demonstrated the ability of the lizards to sustain Borrelia infection and to infect attached ticks, and we proved that P. algirus is a reservoir host competent to transmit B. lusitaniae."

		"abstract": "Although the causative agent of Lyme disease is definitively known to be the tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiology of chronic joint inflammation that ensues in a subset of patients remains less well understood. Persistence of arthritis after apparent eradication of the spirochete suggests an autoimmune reaction downstream of the original bacterial infection. We have generated recombinant Ab probes from synovial lesions within affected arthritic joints in an attempt to recapitulate disease-relevant Ag-binding specificities at the site of injury. Using this panel of intra-articular probes, as well as Ab fragments derived from patient peripheral blood, we have identified cytokeratin 10, present in synovial microvascular endothelium, as a target ligand and a putative autoantigen in chronic, antibiotic treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis. Furthermore, there is cross-reactivity between cytokeratin 10 and a prominent B. burgdorferi Ag, outer surface protein A. Release of the self protein in the context of inflammation-induced tissue injury and the resulting in situ response to it could set in motion a feed-forward loop, which amplifies the inflammatory process, thereby rendering it chronic and self-perpetuating, even in the absence of the inciting pathogen."

		"abstract": "In the north central and northeastern United States, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease (LD), is maintained in an enzootic cycle between the vector, Ixodes scapularis, and the primary reservoir host, Peromyscus leucopus. Genetic diversity of the pathogen based on sequencing of two plasmid-located genes, those for outer surface protein A (ospA) and outer surface protein C (ospC), has been examined in both tick and human specimens at local, regional, and worldwide population scales. Additionally, previous studies have only been conducted with tick or human specimens at the local population level in areas with high LD transmission rates. This study examined the genetic diversity of circulating borreliae in the reservoir population from a large region of the western coastal plains of southern Maryland, where moderate numbers of human LD cases are reported. Six ospA mobility classes, including two that were not previously described, and eight ospC groups were found among the P. leucopus samples. Twenty-five percent of all specimens were infected with more than one ospA or ospC variant. The frequency distribution of variants was homogeneous, both locally and spatially. The spirochete diversity found in Maryland was not as high as that observed among northern tick populations, yet similar genotypes were observed in both populations. These results also show that mice are important for maintaining Borrelia variants, even rare variants, and that reservoir populations should therefore be considered when assessing the diversity of B. burgdorferi."

DNA from 33 B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains reacted in the assay, whereas no reactivity was observed with DNA from four relapsing fever Borrelia spp., 11 unrelated spirochaetes, and 31 unrelated microorganisms. The quantitative sensitivity of the assay was 1-10 fg of Borrelia DNA and one to five cultured Borrelia spirochaetes. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens from 70 patients sent for routine testing for neuroborreliosis, and three CSF specimens containing B. garinii were also tested. Positive PCR results were obtained with all three culture-confirmed neuroborreliosis specimens, five of ten neuroborreliosis specimens with specific antibodies in CSF and pleocytosis, none of nine specimens from possible cases of early neuroborreliosis (antibodies in serum, CSF pleocytosis, no antibodies in CSF), one of 15 specimens from patients with active or past Lyme disease with neurological signs (antibodies in serum, no pleocytosis or antibodies in CSF), and none of 36 specimens from patients without Lyme borreliosis (no antibodies in serum or CSF). Overall, the real-time PCR assay enabled sensitive and specific detection of all B. burgdorferi sensu lato species tested. The PCR had a sensitivity of 50% in patients with neuroborreliosis. The main diagnostic role of the assay could be to confirm neuroborreliosis in patients for whom the diagnosis is doubtful."

Lymphocyte transformation tests (LTTs) have been applied to detect specific cellular immune reactivity, but their clinical application has been severely hampered by the poorly defined Borrelia antigens and nonstandardized LTT formats used. In this study, we describe the development and clinical relevance of a novel LTT using a validated format (MELISA) together with well-defined recombinant Borrelia-specific antigens. From an initial screening of 244 patients with suspected Borrelia infection or disease, 4 informative recombinant antigens were selected: OspC (Borrelia afzelii), p41-1 (Borrelia garinii), p41-2 (B. afzelii), and p100 (B. afzelii). Thereafter, 30 seronegative healthy controls were tested in LTT-MELISA(R) to determine specificity, 68 patients were tested in parallel to determine reproducibility, and 54 lymphocyte-reactive symptomatic patients were tested before and after antibiotic therapy to assess clinical relevance. Most (86.2%) of the 36.9% (90/244) LTT-MELISA positive patients were seropositive and showed symptoms of active LB. Specificity was 96.7% and reproducibility 92.6%. After therapy, most patients (90.7%) showed negative or markedly reduced lymphocyte reactivity correlating with clinical improvement. This novel LTT-MELISA assay appears to correlate with active LB and may have diagnostic relevance in confirming LB in clinically and serologically ambiguous cases."

This evaluation was conducted to assess (1) attitudes that affected employees' decisions to accept or decline the vaccine, (2) preventive behaviors among employees who received the vaccine, and (3) effectiveness of the educational modalities offered in improving knowledge of Lyme disease and Lyme disease vaccine. A total of 190 eligible employees were identified and were offered two educational modalities before deciding whether to receive the vaccine. The subsequent evaluation involved three telephone interviews, one pre-education and two posteducation-vaccination, to assess factors affecting the decision about vaccination and attitudes, behaviors, and knowledge among vaccine recipients (N=30) and nonrecipients (N=160). This evaluation indicated that the majority of vaccine recipients decided to receive the vaccine because of an anticipated risk of tick exposure. For employees who declined vaccination, many were concerned about the safety (64%), novelty (56%), or efficacy (48%) of the vaccine. Posteducation knowledge of Lyme disease vaccine significantly improved among those who attended an education session compared with those who did not and was retained 1 year later. The results suggest that when a vaccine-related disease-prevention program is undertaken, (1) attitudes about disease risks and vaccine risks influence decisions to accept vaccination, and (2) in-person education should be a mandatory element of the program."

		"abstract": "Recently, it has been reported that TLR2 on macrophages plays a unique role in the inflammatory response and host defense to infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) which is an etiologic agent of Lyme disease. Experimental studies show that PMNs also play an essential role in infection control by Bb. However, there is no available data about TLR2 expression on PMN in the course of Lyme disease. In the present study, TLR2 expression and production of IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as their natural regulators (sIL-1RII, IL-1Ra and sIL-6Ralpha, sgp130, resp) by PMN of peripheral blood in patients with Lyme disease were examined. For the purpose of comparison, the same activity of autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was estimated. An effect of rhIL-15 on TLR2 and cytokine secretion was also studied. Increased TLR2 expression in unstimulated neutrophils suggests an important role of these cells in mechanism recognition of B burgdorferi in patients with Lyme disease. The relationship between IL-1beta and IL-6 as well as their regulators by unstimulated PMN and PBMC, observed in the present study, may lead to enhanced IL-6- and to inhibition of IL-1beta-mediated reactions in this patient group. Changes in the TLR2 expression after rhIL-15 stimulation appear to have a favorable effect on mechanism recognition of Bb. The relations between IL-6 and its regulators (sIL-6Ralpha and sgp130) as well as between IL-1beta and its regulators (IL-1Ra and sIL-1RII) after rhIL-15 stimulation may lead to enhanced IL-1beta- and IL-6-mediated inflammatory reactions in the course of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "In the mouse model of Lyme borreliosis, the host immune response during infection with Borrelia burgdorferi results in the remission of carditis and arthritis, as well as global reduction of spirochete numbers in tissues, without elimination of infection. These events were recapitulated by passive transfer of immune serum from infected immunocompetent mice or T-cell-deficient mice to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Previous studies have shown that immune serum is reactive against arthritis-related protein (Arp) and that Arp antiserum induces arthritis remission. However, although immune serum from T-cell-deficient mice induced disease remission, it was not reactive against Arp, suggesting that antibody to another antigen may be responsible. T-cell-deficient mouse immune serum was reactive to decorin binding protein A (DbpA). Therefore, DbpA antiserum was tested to determine its ability to induce disease remission in SCID mice. Antisera to Arp or DbpA induced both carditis and arthritis remission but did not significantly reduce spirochete numbers in tissues, based upon quantitative flaB DNA analysis, nor did treatment affect RNA levels of several genes, including arp and dbpA. Immunohistochemical labeling of spirochetes in hearts and joints during disease remission induced by adoptive transfer of lymphocytes, passive transfer of immune serum, or passive transfer of DbpA antiserum revealed that such treatment resulted in elimination of spirochetes from heart base and synovium but not vascular walls, tendons, or ligaments. These results suggest that Arp and DbpA antibodies may be active as disease-resolving components in immune serum but antibody against other antigens may be involved in reductions of spirochetes in tissues."

The type of antibiotic applied and duration of treatment will depend on the stage and severity of the disease. Erythema migrans, Borrelia lymphocytoma, Lyme arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans are primarily treated orally. If neurological symptoms, severe Lyme carditis or eye manifestations are present, intravenous treatment is initially recommended. For oral therapy, doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime and, if intolerance is shown, azithromycin, are available. For intravenous treatment ceftriaxone, cefotaxime or penicillin G is employed. The overall prognosis for treated Lyme borreliosis is good. However, in particular when manifestations with substantial organic injury have persisted, incomplete healing must be expected. With the exception of erythema migrans, every manifestation should be subjected to a careful diagnostic work-up prior to the start of treatment, because premature antibiotic administration is not only associated with an elevated risk for the patient, but can also mask important diagnostic signs."

Often hours later, the tick scores the skin at the site it selects and then pushes its barbed hypostome into the tiny wound to anchor itself to its victim with the aid of a cement-like substance and the barbs. While it sucks up blood, Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes pass out of the tick's intestine into its salivary glands and thence into the host. It is therefore of decisive importance that the tick be removed with a special forceps as early as possible. The use of such substances as glue, alcohol or nail varnish to remove the tick must be discouraged. Currently, antibiotic prophylaxis, examination of the tick for the presence of B. burgdorferi, or serological follow-up tests are not recommended."

However, it is still unclear whether the pathogen itself is able to elicit such a sustained inflammatory response, or whether an aberrant immunological reaction of the host is the main driving force. Borrelia antigens, including lipoproteins, flagellin and DNA, are ligands of Toll-like receptors, and can thus elicit a strong stimulation of host cells, such as neutrophils, mononuclear cells and resident tissue cells. Understanding the molecular basis of the signalling events caused by Borrelia lipoproteins will lead to a greater understanding of inflammation in Lyme arthritis and, hopefully, new treatment strategies for chronic antibiotic-resistant disease."

A total of 1,120 immature Ixodes ricinus ticks were removed from 13,260 birds and assayed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Borrelia, followed by DNA sequencing for species and genotype identification. Distributions of ticks on birds were aggregated, presumably because of varying encounters with ticks along migratory routes. Lyme borreliosis spirochetes were detected in 160 (1.4%) ticks. Borrelia garinii was the most common species in PCR-positive samples and included genotypes associated with human infections. Infestation prevalence with infected ticks was 5 times greater among ground-foraging birds than other bird species, but the 2 groups were equally competent in transmitting Borrelia. Migratory passerine birds host epidemiologically important vector ticks and Borrelia species and vary in effectiveness as reservoirs on the basis of their feeding behavior."

We evaluated the regulation of paralogous gene family (pgf) 54 members in response to environmental cues and focused our efforts on determining the molecular mechanisms influencing bba66 expression. By qRT-PCR, bba65, bba66, bba71 and bba73 displayed regulation similar to ospC under mammalian-like conditions. Of the pgf 54 members, bba66 demonstrated the greatest and second greatest change in expression in response to pH or temperature shift respectively. Furthermore, Bb-infected mice and patients with early disseminated Lyme disease produced detectable antibodies to BBA66. A protein(s) active in Bb at pH 7 was able to interact with the bba66 upstream region and was specific as bba64 and ospC promoters were unable to out-compete for binding. bba66 promoter mapping revealed putative sigma70 and sigmaS consensus sequences, enabling us to narrow the protein binding site to a region within an imperfect inverted repeat upstream of the -35 region. Moreover, BBA66 production is associated with an infectious phenotype, and loss of either sigmaN or sigmaS resulted in loss of BBA66. Promoter-GFP fusion analysis indicated that the sigma70 and/or sigmaS consensus sequences alone were not sufficient to initiate transcription and a portion of the upstream inverted repeat was required. These results suggest a primary role for BBA66 in Bb transmission and infection."

Lyme disease spirochetes were more prevalent in sand lizards (Lacerta agilis) and common wall lizards (Podarcis muralis) than in small rodents. Although subadult ticks feeding on rodents acquired mainly B. afzelii, subadult ticks feeding on lizards became infected by B. lusitaniae. Genetic analysis confirmed that the spirochetes isolated from ticks feeding on lizards are members of the B. lusitaniae genospecies and resemble type strain PotiB2. At our central European study site, lizards, which were previously considered zooprophylactic for the agent of Lyme disease, appear to perpetuate B. lusitaniae."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is considered to be caused by Borrelia species of bacteria but slowly evidence is accumulating which suggests that Lyme disease is a far more complex condition than Borreliosis alone. This hypothesis suggests that it may be more appropriate to regard Lyme disease as a tick borne disease complex. Over recent years numerous different microbes have been found in ticks which are known to be zoonotic and can coinfect the human host. The hypothesis suggests that multiple coinfections are invariably present in the clinical syndromes associated with Lyme disease and it is suggested that these act synergistically in complex ways. It may be that patterns of coinfection and host factors are the main determinants of the variable clinical features of Lyme disease rather than Borrelia types. An analogy with a jigsaw puzzle is presented with pieces representing Borreliae, coinfections and host factors. It is suggested that many pieces of the puzzle are missing and our knowledge of how the pieces fit together is rudimentary. It is hoped that the hypothesis will help our understanding of this complex, enigmatic condition."

Within a month there was progression to peripheral facial paresis on the contra lateral side, prompting a diagnosis of Lyme disease. Her physical examination and chest x-ray did not reveal any clinical evidence of sarcoidosis. After failing to respond to an empiric trial of intravenous ceftriaxone for a presumptive diagnosis of Lyme disease, computed tomography scan of the chest was ordered which demonstrated bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopic biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient then made a complete recovery on steroid therapy.

The study group consisted of 20 patients with LA. Before and after antibiotic treatment, the serum levels of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII were measured immunoenzymatically using standard kits and the CRP level was measured by immunoturbidimetric method. Before treatment, the serum levels of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII were significantly higher than in control group and after treatment the concentrations of IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII decreased significantly, but the level of IL-18 and sIL-1RII still remained higher than in control group. The elevated serum level of CRP was detected only in 6 of 20 patients and in 5 of them it returned to the baseline after treatment. The results of our study suggest that IL-18, IL-1beta and sIL-1RII might be involved in the development of LA. CRP may be useful in differential diagnosis in patients with suspicion of Lyme arthritis."

We report here that B. garinii A218 causes a persisting infection in these mouse strains. Mice infected with intracutaneous inoculation of B. garinii at 4-5 weeks of age developed a disseminated infection and joint swelling within 2 weeks of inoculation and remained infected with joint symptoms until the end of follow-ups of up to 52 weeks. Treatment with ceftriaxone or ampicillin at 18 or 44 weeks of infection did not affect the joint swelling during the follow-ups of 19 and 8 weeks, respectively. However, B. garinii could not be cultured from any of the post mortem tissue samples of the treated mice, whereas the spirochete grew from samples of all untreated infected animals. Borrelia-specific IgG antibodies were detectable after 2 weeks of infection, and in late infection, all mice had high anti-borrelia IgG levels. Antibiotic treatment had no effect on antibody levels. Histology showed only slight changes in the joints of the infected mice with occasional lymphocyte infiltration, synovial proliferation and slight involvement of the Achilles' tendon. No difference was seen in the findings between ceftriaxone-treated and untreated mice. The results suggest that the presence of vegetative spirochetes is no prerequisite for persisting joint symptoms and elevated anti-borrelia IgG levels in these B. garinii-infected mice."

In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Dai et al. provide the most complete description to date of the vlp/vsp antigenic variation system of the relapsing fever spirochaete, Borrelia hermsii. This elaborate, plasmid-encoded system involves an expression site that can acquire either variable large protein (vlp) or variable small protein (vsp) surface lipoprotein genes from 59 different archival copies. The archival vlp and vsp genes are arranged in clusters on at least five different plasmids. Gene conversion occurs through recombination events at upstream homology sequences (UHS) found in each gene copy, and at downstream homology sequences (DHS) found periodically among the vlp/vsp archival genes. Previous studies have shown that antigenic variation in relapsing fever Borrelia not only permits the evasion of host antibody responses, but can also result in changes in neurotropism and other pathogenic properties. The vlsE antigenic variation locus of Lyme disease spirochaetes, although similar in sequence to the relapsing fever vlp genes, has evolved a completely different antigenic variation mechanism involving segmental recombination from a contiguous array of vls silent cassettes. These two systems thus appear to represent divergence from a common precursor followed by functional convergence to create two distinct antigenic variation processes."

Samples were collected each May in 2003, 2004 and 2005. Nymphal ticks were 3.4 times, 1.9 times and 1.2 times less frequent on cleared forest than on uncleared forest trails in the three respective years, whereas adult tick abundance was 27.2 times, 4.0 times and 2.2 times lower, respectively. The ticks were examined for borreliae by dark-field microscopy: prevalence of nymphal ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (12.6% to 20.0%) did not differ significantly between the cleared and uncleared trail during the 3 years. In conclusion, the habitat modification appeared to result in a decreased abundance of I. ricinus as well as a reduced frequency of infected ticks (and thus indirectly a lower potential risk of Lyme borreliosis), which lasted, however, for only 2 years. Eight cultures of borreliae isolated from the ticks were all identified as the 'ornithophilic' genomic species Borrelia garinii, possibly indicating a greater role of forest birds than that of forest rodents as the hosts of immature I. ricinus in the tick (and borrelial) colonization of the cleared part of the forest."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever is a rapidly progressive and severe septic disease caused by certain Borrelia spirochetes. The disease is divided into two forms, i.e., epidemic relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia recurrentis and transmitted by lice, and the endemic form, caused by several Borrelia species, such as B. duttonii, and transmitted by soft-bodied ticks. The spirochetes enter the bloodstream by the vector bite and live persistently in plasma even after the development of specific antibodies. This leads to fever relapses and high mortality and clearly indicates that the Borrelia organisms utilize effective immune evasion strategies. In this study, we show that the epidemic relapsing fever pathogen B. recurrentis and an endemic relapsing fever pathogen, B. duttonii, are serum resistant, i.e., resistant to complement in vitro. They acquire the host alternative complement pathway regulator factor H on their surfaces in a similar way to that of the less serum-resistant Lyme disease pathogen, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. More importantly, the relapsing fever spirochetes specifically bind host C4b-binding protein, a major regulator of the antibody-mediated classical complement pathway. Both complement regulators retained their functional activities when bound to the surfaces of the spirochetes. In conclusion, this is the first report of complement evasion by Borrelia recurrentis and B. duttonii and the first report showing capture of C4b-binding protein by spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, a global health concern, is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, B. afzelii, or B. garinii. The spirochete responsible for the disease in the United States is B. burgdorferi and is spread by the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. We utilized multiple two-dimensional gel techniques combined with proteomics to reveal the full humoral immune response of mice and Lyme patients to membrane-associated proteins isolated from Borrelia burgdorferi. Our studies indicated that a subset of immunogenic membrane-associated proteins (some new and some previously identified) was recognized by mice experimentally infected with Borrelia burgdorferi either by low-dose needle inoculation or by tick infestation. Moreover, the majority of these immunogenic membrane-associated proteins were recognized by sera from patients diagnosed with early-disseminated Lyme disease. These included RevA, ErpA, ErpP, DbpA, BmpA, FtsZ, ErpB, LA7, OppA I, OppA II, OppA IV, FlhF, BBA64, BBA66, and BB0323. Some immunogens (i.e., BBI36/38) were more reactive with sera from mice than Lyme patients, while additional membrane proteins (i.e., FlaB, P66, LA7, and Hsp90) were recognized more strongly with sera from patients diagnosed with early-localized, early-disseminated, or late (chronic)-stage Lyme disease. We were able to examine the humoral response in Lyme patients in a temporal fashion and to identify the majority of immunoreactive proteins as the disease progresses from early to late stages. This serologic proteome analysis enabled the identification of novel membrane-associated proteins that may serve as new diagnostic markers and, more importantly, as second-generation vaccine candidates for protection against Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi can persistently infect humans and other animals despite host active immune responses. This is facilitated, in part, by the vls locus, a complex system consisting of the vlsE expression site and an adjacent set of 11 to 15 silent vls cassettes. Segments of nonexpressed cassettes recombine with the vlsE region during infection of mammalian hosts, resulting in combinatorial antigenic variation of the VlsE outer surface protein. We now demonstrate that synthesis of VlsE is regulated during the natural mammal-tick infectious cycle, being activated in mammals but repressed during tick colonization. Examination of cultured B. burgdorferi cells indicated that the spirochete controls vlsE transcription levels in response to environmental cues. Analysis of PvlsE::gfp fusions in B. burgdorferi indicated that VlsE production is controlled at the level of transcriptional initiation, and regions of 5' DNA involved in the regulation were identified. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays detected qualitative and quantitative changes in patterns of protein-DNA complexes formed between the vlsE promoter and cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting the involvement of DNA-binding proteins in the regulation of vlsE, with at least one protein acting as a transcriptional activator."

We investigated the response of human brain microglial cells, glial progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, as well as peripheral blood monocytes to stimulation with B. burgdorferi. We used oligoarrays to detect changes in the expression of genes important for shaping adaptive and innate immune responses. We found that stimulation with B. burgdorferi lysate increased the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 1 and 2 in all cell types except neurons. However, despite similarities in global gene profiles of monocytes and microglia, only microglial cells responded to the stimulation with a robust increase in HLA-DR, HLA-DQ, and also coexpressed CD11-c, a dendritic cell marker. In contrast, a large number of HLA-related molecules were repressed at both the RNA and the protein levels in stimulated monocytes, whereas secretion of IL-10 and TNF-alpha was strongly induced. These results show that signaling through TLR1/2 in response to B. burgdorferi can elicit opposite immunoregulatory effects in blood and in brain immune cells, which could play a role in the different susceptibility of these compartments to infection."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever, an infection caused by Borrelia spirochetes, is generally considered a transient, self-limiting disease in humans. The present study reveals that murine infection by Borrelia duttonii can be reactivated after an extended time as a silent infection in the brain, with no bacteria appearing in the blood and spirochete load comparable to the numbers in an infected tick. The host cerebral gene expression pattern is indistinguishable from that of uninfected animals, indicating that persistent bacteria are not recognized by the immune system nor cause noticeable tissue damage. Silent infection can be reactivated by immunosuppression, inducing spirochetemia comparable to that of initial densities. B. duttonii has never been found in any host except man and the tick vector. We therefore propose the brain to be a possible natural reservoir of the spirochete. The view of relapsing fever as an acute disease should be extended to include in some cases prolonged persistence, a feature characteristic of the related spirochetal infections Lyme disease and syphilis."

Sensitivities for the detection of IgM and IgG with each test were: Dako IgM 64%; Dako IgG 53%; Serion IgM 89%; and Serion IgG 88%. The Immunetics assay makes no distinction between IgM and IgG antibodies and had a sensitivity of 91%. Specificity was calculated by testing a control group comprising 40 patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus infection, cytomegalovirus infection, syphilis or rheumatoid factor positivity. The specificities achieved for each test were: Dako IgM 78%; Dako IgG 100%; Serion IgM 52%; Serion IgG 92%; and Immunetics 92%. The discriminatory power between control and patient samples appeared highest for the Immunetics assay. Between-run variation was comparable for the five tests and did not exceed 13%. When the Immunetics assay was used as an initial screening test, with low-titre positive results confirmed by an immunoblot, a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 100% were achieved. To attain maximal sensitivity, the Serion IgM and IgG tests were also performed on samples with negative Immunetics results. All positive Serion IgM and IgG results were also confirmed by immunoblot. In conclusion, the Immunetics assay, based on a synthetic C6 peptide, can be used reliably as an initial screening test for the serodiagnosis of Lyme disease."

The cystatin presence in the saliva was verified both biochemically and immunologically. We named the protein sialostatin L because of its inhibitory action against cathepsin L. We also show that the proteases it targets, although limited in number, have a prominent role in the proteolytic cascades that take place in the extracellular and intracellular environment. As a result, sialostatin L displays an antiinflammatory role and inhibits proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Beyond unraveling another component accounting for the properties of tick saliva, contributing to feeding success and pathogen transmission, we describe a novel tool for studying the role of papain-like proteases in diverse biologic phenomena and a protein with numerous potential pharmaceutical applications."

In a 5-year follow-up study in southern Sweden, 31 of 708 individuals initially diagnosed with erythema migrans and treated with antibiotics were found to be reinfected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Although men and women were tick-bitten to the same extent, 27 of the 31 reinfected individuals were women, all of whom were over 44 years of age. The aim of this study was to determine whether this discrepancy in gender distribution could be a result of differences in immunological response. Twenty single-infected and 21 reinfected women and 18 single-infected and three reinfected men were included in the study. None of the participants showed any sign of an ongoing B. burgdorferi infection, and thus the habitual response was captured. Lymphocytes were separated from blood and stimulated with antigens. The secretion of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot-forming cell assay (ELISPOT) or Immulite. No difference was detected in cytokine secretion between single-infected and reinfected individuals. We also compared the immunological response in men and women, regardless of the number of B. burgdorferi infections. Women displayed a significantly higher spontaneous secretion of all cytokines measured. The ratios of IL-4:IFN-gamma and IL-10:TNF-alpha were significantly higher in women. Gender differences in immune reactivity might in part explain the higher incidence of reinfection in women. The higher IL-4:IFN-gamma and IL-10:TNF-alpha ratios seen in women indicate that postmenopausal women have T helper type 2 (Th2)-directed reactivity with impaired inflammatory responses which might inhibit the elimination of spirochetes."

It was found that the majority of genovariants of A. afzelii (with respect to 5S-23S) incorporated several different allele variants of gene p66, all allele variants being found in the two genogroups (VS461 and NT28) of the pathogenic agent."

		"abstract": "In Latvia and other endemic regions, a single tick bite has the potential to transmit both tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis. To analyse both the clinical features and differential diagnosis of combined tick-borne infection with TBE and Lyme borreliosis, in 51 patients with serological evidence, of whom 69% had tick bites. Biphasic fever suggestive of TBE occurred in 55% of the patients. Meningitis occurred in 92%, with painful radicular symptoms in 39%. Muscle weakness occurred in 41%; in 29% the flaccid paralysis was compatible with TBE. Only two patients presented with the bulbar palsy typical of TBE. Typical Lyme borreliosis facial palsy occurred in three patients. Typical TBE oculomotor disturbances occurred in two. Other features typical of Lyme borreliosis detected in our patients were distal peripheral neuropathy (n = 4), arthralgia (n = 9), local erythema 1-12 days after tick bite (n = 7) and erythema chronicum migrans (n = 1). Echocardiogram abnormalities occurred in 15. Patients with double infection with TBE and Lyme borreliosis fell into three main clinical groups: febrile illness, 3 (6%); meningitis, 15 (30%); central or peripheral neurological deficit (meningoencephalitis, meningomyelitis, meningoradiculitis and polyradiculoneuritis), 33 (65%). Systemic features pointing to Lyme borreliosis were found in 25 patients (49%); immunoglobulin (Ig)M antibodies to borreliosis were present in 18 of them. The clinical occurrence of both Lyme borreliosis and TBE vary after exposure to tick bite, and the neurological manifestations of each disorder vary widely, with considerable overlap. This observational study provides no evidence that co-infection produces unusual manifestations due to unpredicted interaction between the two diseases. Patients with tick exposure presenting with acute neurological symptoms in areas endemic for both Lyme borreliosis and TBE should be investigated for both conditions. The threshold for simultaneous treatment of both conditions should be low, given the possibility of co-occurrence and the difficulty in ascribing individual neurological manifestations to one condition or the other."

Two isogenic serotypes of Borrelia turicatae strain Oz1 differ in their Vsp sequences and in disease manifestations in infected mice: Vsp1 is associated with the selection of a neurological niche, while Vsp2 is associated with blood and skin infection. We report here crystal structures of the Vsp1 dimer at 2.7 and 2.2 A. The structures confirm that relapsing fever Vsp proteins share a common helical fold with OspCs of Lyme disease-causing Borrelia. The fold features an inner stem formed by highly conserved N and C termini and an outer \"dome\" formed by the variable central residues. Both Vsp1 and OspC structures possess small water-filled cavities, or pockets, that are lined largely by variable residues and are thus highly variable in shape. These features appear to signify tolerance of the Vsp-OspC fold for imperfect packing of residues at its antigenic surface. Structural comparison of Vsp1 with a homology model for Vsp2 suggests that observed differences in disease manifestation may arise in part from distinct differences in electrostatic surface properties; additional predicted positively charged surface patches on Vsp2 compared to Vsp1 may be sufficient to explain the relative propensity of Vsp2 to bind to acidic glycosaminoglycans."

		"abstract": "All examined isolates of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, naturally maintain numerous variants of a prophage family as circular cp32 episomes. Each cp32 carries a locus encoding one or two different Erp outer membrane, surface-exposed lipoproteins. Many of the Erp proteins bind a host complement regulator, factor H, which is hypothesized to protect the spirochete from complement-mediated killing. We now describe the isolation and characterization of a novel, chromosomally encoded protein, EbfC, that binds specific DNA sequences located immediately 5' of all erp loci. This is one of the first site-specific DNA-binding proteins to be identified in any spirochete. The location of the ebfC gene on the B. burgdorferi chromosome suggests that the cp32 prophages have evolved to use this bacterial host protein for their own benefit and that EbfC probably plays additional roles in the bacterium. A wide range of other bacteria encode homologs of EbfC, none of which have been well characterized, so demonstration that B. burgdorferi EbfC is a site-specific DNA-binding protein has broad implications across the eubacterial kingdom."

Ticks have been submitted from members of the public, veterinarians, and medical practitioners to provincial, federal, and university laboratories for identification, and the data have been collated and B. burgdorferi detected at the National Microbiology Laboratory. The locations of collection of 2,319 submitted I. scapularis were mapped, and we investigated potential risk factors for I. scapularis occurrence (in Quebec as a case study) by using regression analysis and spatial statistics. Ticks were submitted from all provinces east of Alberta, most from areas where resident I. scapularis populations are unknown. Most were adult ticks and were collected in spring and autumn. In southern Québec, risk factors for tick occurrence were lower latitude and remote-sensed indices for land cover with woodland. B. burgdorferi infection, identified by conventional and molecular methods, was detected in 12.5% of 1,816 ticks, including 10.1% of the 256 ticks that were collected from humans and tested. Our study suggests that B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis can be found over a wide geographic range in Canada, although most may be adventitious ticks carried from endemic areas in the United States and Canada by migrating birds. The risk of Lyme borreliosis in Canada may therefore be mostly low but more geographically widespread than previously suspected."

Sampling sites in the western part of the state (Buffalo County) and central region (Waushara, Waupaca, and Green Lake counties) were used. In Buffalo County, 5.6% of deer and 8.9% of ticks were infected. At Hartman Creek State Park (Waupaca County), 11.5% of ticks were infected, while the observed prevalence in deer from counties to the south of the park (Waushara and Green Lake) reached 19-26%. Based on 16S rRNA sequences, A. phagocytophilum strains associated and not associated with human infections were identified. Furthermore, two novel A. phagocytophilum variants were found in deer blood samples. Transmission of Lyme disease has been documented in both the Western and Central regions we sampled, and the presence of A. phagocytophilum in naturally occurring tick populations could present an additional risk of disease to humans that enter tick habitats."

Susceptibility to murine Lyme arthritis has been correlated with the production of several proinflammatory cytokines, especially IFN-gamma. To determine the role of IFN-mediated effector mechanisms in the development of Lyme borreliosis, we infected Stat1-deficient mice on both resistant (DBA), and susceptible (C3H) genetic backgrounds. Arthritis in Stat1(/) mice was similar to that of wild-type controls in both mouse strains. Spirochete loads in tissues were also unchanged in Stat1(/) mice. C3H Stat1(/) mice exhibited increased inflammation in the heart, whereas carditis was unchanged in DBA Stat1(/) mice. These results demonstrate that inhibition of macrophage activation and responses to IFN-gamma-mediated signaling do not alter the arthritis resistance or susceptibility phenotype; however, they do affect the severity of carditis in susceptible mouse strains."

A PCR test targeting the glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) gene was used to detect infection in the blood of suspected relapsing fever patients. The assay detected infection in all 19 patients from Israel who were spirochetemic by blood smear examination and in two additional patients with clinical relapsing fever who were negative by smear examination. Patients were positive by PCR of blood only at the febrile stage and not during the incubation period prior to the appearance of clinical symptoms. Of 52 tick-bitten subjects who were tested and followed-up after being bitten by ticks, 10 developed symptoms of relapsing fever and all became positive by PCR following an earlier negative test. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene supported by phylogenetic analysis indicated that infection was caused by B. persica or a closely related species. A phylogenetic analysis of the GlpQ sequence showed that it was different yet closely related to other relapsing fever Borrelia spp. present in the Old World. The GlpQ PCR was positive also with the relapsing fever spirochetes B. recurrentis and B. crocidure but not with the Lyme disease agent B. burgdorferi DNA. A second modified GlpQ PCR was able to discriminate between probable B. persica and B. recurrentis and B. crocidurae infection. This study describes the first molecular assay for the diagnosis of relapsing fever caused by B. persica."

It is not possible to control ticks in nature. Therefore the first step should be an effective prevention. In case of a bite the tick must be removed as soon as possible. Although Ixodes ricinus is more or less responsible for all health risks caused by ticks in Germany, further species like Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor marginatus and Argas reflexus must not be forgotten, as these ticks have appeared more frequently in the recent past and they can be vectors of several diseases as well.

Rat Kupffer cells were separated by perfusion of the liver with 0.05% collagenase, and purified by Percoll gradients. Purified Kupffer cells were tested in vitro with alive L. interogans and B. burgdorferi preparations. The production of ROS was determined by chemiluminescence, whereas iNOS protein expression was evaluated by Western blot assay using anti-iNOS antibodies. B. burgdorferi and to a less extent L. interrogans induced ROS production with a peak 35 min after infection. The chemiluminescence signal progressively diminished and was undetectable by 180 min of incubation. Leptospirae and borreliae induced an increased iNOS expression in Kupffer cells that peaked at 6 hours and was still evident 22 h after infection. Both genera of spirochetes induced ROS and iNOS production in rat Kupffer cells. Since the cause of liver damage both in leptospiral as well as in borrelial infections are still unknown, we suggest that leptospira and borrelia damage of the liver can be initially mediated by oxygen radicals, and is then maintained at least in part by nitric oxide."

We performed a retrospective study to assess the impact of immunosuppression on erythema migrans in 33 patients with a malignant or autoimmune disease, chronic infection, or immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplantation. Only patients with active disease status and/or current immunosuppressive therapy were included. Pre-treatment clinical parameters, such as presentation of the skin lesion and presence of extracutaneous signs and symptoms, the disease course during a median follow-up of 9 months after therapy and serum anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies before therapy and by the end of follow-up in the 33 immunosuppressed patients were statistically compared with 75 otherwise healthy patients with erythema migrans. The 75 control patients were matched for sex, age and antibiotic therapy. With the exception of the site of erythema migrans lesions, which were found more often on the trunk than on the legs in the immunosuppressed patients (vice versa in immunocompetent patients), we found no significant differences for all investigated parameters between the two groups. It appears that immunosuppression does not influence clinical presentation, response to therapy, or production of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies of patients with erythema migrans. It is thus not necessary to treat immunosuppressed patients with erythema migrans differently from immunocompetent patients."

Immun. 72:7147-7154, 2004). The absence of the linear plasmid lp56, which carries another putative restriction-modification gene, further enhanced transformation rates. The infectivity of these mutants was assessed previously in mice that were inoculated with needle and syringe and was found to be equivalent to that of wild-type spirochetes. Here we examined the infectivity of spirochetes to ticks after capillary inoculation of Ixodes scapularis nymphs and the subsequent spirochetal infectivity to mice via ticks by using B. burgdorferi B31 clonal isolates lacking lp56 and/or BBE02. The absence of lp56 (but not BBE02) correlated with a lower number of spirochetes in ticks after feeding on mice; this plasmid thus may play a role, albeit not an essential one, in supporting spirochetal survival in the feeding tick. Importantly, however, the absence of lp56 and BBE02 did not detectably influence infectivity to mice via ticks."

		"abstract": "This study demonstrates a strict temporal requirement for a virulence determinant of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi during a unique point in its natural infection cycle, which alternates between ticks and small mammals. OspC is a major surface protein produced by B. burgdorferi when infected ticks feed but whose synthesis decreases after transmission to a mammalian host. We have previously shown that spirochetes lacking OspC are competent to replicate in and migrate to the salivary glands of the tick vector but do not infect mice. Here we assessed the timing of the requirement for OspC by using an ospC mutant complemented with an unstable copy of the ospC gene and show that B. burgdorferi's requirement for OspC is specific to the mammal and limited to a critical early stage of mammalian infection. By using this unique system, we found that most bacterial reisolates from mice persistently infected with the initially complemented ospC mutant strain no longer carried the wild-type copy of ospC. Such spirochetes were acquired by feeding ticks and migrated to the tick salivary glands during subsequent feeding. Despite normal behavior in ticks, these ospC mutant spirochetes did not infect naive mice. ospC mutant spirochetes from persistently infected mice also failed to infect naive mice by tissue transplantation. We conclude that OspC is indispensable for establishing infection by B. burgdorferi in mammals but is not required at any other point of the mouse-tick infection cycle."

		"abstract": "We previously demonstrated that outer surface protein C (OspC) of Borrelia burgdorferi is essential for establishing mammalian infection. However, the role of OspC in mammalian infection is unknown. Here, we report experiments designed to distinguish between two models of OspC function in the mammalian host: (i) OspC fulfills an essential physiological role for growth and host adaptation or (ii) OspC provides a protective role for evasion of components of the innate immune response. We found that a B. burgdorferi ospC mutant, previously demonstrated to be noninfectious in both immunocompetent and SCID mice, could survive in the relatively immune-privileged environment of dialysis membrane chambers implanted within the peritoneum of a rat. The ospC mutant also adapts to the mammalian environment, as determined by the protein profiles of the chamber-cultivated spirochetes. Therefore, OspC does not appear to provide a physiological function for the survival of B. burgdorferi within the mammalian host. The second model, evasion of the innate immune system, was tested by assessing the infectivity of the ospC mutant in mice deficient for myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88). Recent studies have shown that B. burgdorferi is prevented from reaching high cell numbers in the mammalian host by MyD88-dependent signaling pathways. The ospC mutant was incapable of infecting MyD88-deficient mice, suggesting that the role of OspC cannot be related solely to evasion of MyD88-mediated innate immunity. These results reiterate the importance of OspC in mammalian infection and eliminate simple models of function for this enigmatic protein."

		"abstract": "BBK32, a fibronectin-binding protein of Borrelia burgdorferi, is one of many surface lipoproteins that are differentially expressed by the Lyme disease spirochete at various stages of its life cycle. The level of BBK32 expression in B. burgdorferi is highest during infection of the mammalian host and lowest in flat ticks. This temporal expression profile, along with its fibronectin-binding activity, strongly suggests that BBK32 may play an important role in Lyme pathogenesis in the host. To test this hypothesis, we constructed an isogenic BBK32 deletion mutant from wild-type B. burgdorferi B31 by replacing the BBK32 gene with a kanamycin resistance cassette through homologous recombination. We examined both the wild-type strain and the BBK32 deletion mutant extensively in the experimental mouse-tick model of the Borrelia life cycle. Our data indicated that B. burgdorferi lacking BBK32 retained full pathogenicity in mice, regardless of whether mice were infected artificially by syringe inoculation or naturally by tick bite. The loss of BBK32 expression in the mutant had no adverse effect on spirochete acquisition (mouse-to-tick) and transmission (tick-to-mouse) processes. These results suggest that additional B. burgdorferi proteins can complement the function of BBK32, fibronectin binding or otherwise, during the natural spirochete life cycle."

From 1997 to 2000, the mean per patient direct medical cost of early-stage LD decreased from $1,609 to $464 (p<0.05), and the mean per patient direct medical cost of late-stage LD decreased from $4,240 to $1,380 (p<0.05).

The outer surface protein C gene (ospC) showed the highest number (12) of major alleles (defined as alleles differing by 5% or more in nucleotide sequence) while other ORFs had only two to four major alleles. A non-recombining chromosomal marker, the rrs-rrlA ribosomal RNA spacer, was used to infer the intraspecific phylogeny among these B. burgdorferi isolates. We were thus able to analyze the multilocus genotypes in the context of a B. burgdorferi intraspecific phylogeny. Except for ospC, sequence variations at plasmid-borne loci showed broad inconsistency with the intraspecific phylogeny, supporting DNA exchanges mediated by plasmid transfers. The multilocus linkage frequently observed in B. burgdorferi populations is due more likely to a \"founder effect\" than to a lack of recombination. The exceptional phylogenetic consistency of ospC, in conjunction with its selectively maintained high intraspecific diversity, suggested a dominant role ospC plays in the initiation and maintenance of adaptive differentiation in B. burgdorferi."

There is strong evidence that different species of this group of genetically diverse spirochetes are involved in distinct clinical manifestations of the disease. In order to differentiate species within this bacterial complex, we developed a real-time-PCR protocol, which targets the hbb gene. We designed a fluorescein-labeled probe specific of a region of this gene harboring a polymorphism linked to species. An internally Red640 labeled primer allowed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer to occur. The sensitivity of this method was in the range of 10 bacteria per assay. After amplification, a melting curve was generated for genotyping. Analysis of these melting curves clearly allowed the distinction between the main European species of B. burgdorferi sl. One hundred seventy tick extracts were analysed by this hbb-based method and in parallel by amplification of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer and RFLP analyses. There was a good correlation between these two methods. We conclude that this hbb-based real-time-PCR is suitable for epidemiological studies on field-collected ticks, although rare mutations in the genomic sequence spanned by the probe could lead to misidentification."

		"abstract": "Here is hypothesized a truly revolutionary notion that rounded cystic forms of Borrelia burgdorferi are the root cause of the rounded structures called plaques in the Alzheimer brain. Rounded \"plaques' in high density in brain tissue are emblematic of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Plaques may be conceptualized as rounded \"pock mark-like\" areas of brain tissue injury. In this century, in brain tissue of AD, plaques are Amyloid Plaques according to the most up to date textbooks. In the last century, however, Dr. Alois Alzheimer did not require amyloid as the pathogenesis for either the disease or for the origin of its plaques. Surely, amyloid is an event in AD, but it may not be the primal cause of AD. Indeed in plaques, amyloid is regularly represented by the \"congophilic core\" structure which is so named because the waxy amyloid material binds the congo red stain and is congophilic. However an accepted subset of plaques in AD is devoid of a congophilic amyloid core region (these plaques \"cotton wool\" type plaques, lack a central congophilic core structure). Furthermore, there is \"plaque diversity\" in Alzheimer's; small, medium and large plaques parallel variable cystic diameters for Borrelia burgdorferi. Perturbations of AD plaque structure (i.e. young plaques devoid of a central core and older plaques with or without a central core structure) offer room for an alternate pathway for explanation of ontogeny of the plaque structures. If amyloid is not required to initiate all of the possible plaques in Alzheimer's, is it possible that amyloid just a by product of a more fundamental primal path to dementia? If a byproduct status is assigned to amyloid in the realm of plaque formation, then is amyloid also an epiphenomenon rather than a primary pathogenesis for Alzheimer's disease. In the \"anatomy is destiny\" model, cysts of borrelia are always round. Why then not accept roundness as a fundamental \"structure determines function\" argument for the answer to the mystery of why Alzheimer plaques are always round? Parataxis causality, a concept borrowed from philosophy, is the error that comes from linking two events, which occur contemporaneously or in close proximity to one another with a cause and effect relationship. Parataxis tells us that what appears to be cause and effect in the couplet \"amyloid plaque\" merely by a proximity relationship may be \"spurious causality\" which is a cognitive dead end."

We assessed the determinants of Lyme-disease risk (density and Borrelia burgdorferi-infection prevalence of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks) over 13 y on several field plots within eastern deciduous forests in the epicenter of US Lyme disease (Dutchess County, New York). We used a model comparison approach to simultaneously test the importance of ambient growing-season temperature, precipitation, two indices of deer (Odocoileus virginianus) abundance, and densities of white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and acorns (Quercus spp.), in both simple and multiple regression models, in predicting entomological risk. Indices of deer abundance had no predictive power, and precipitation in the current year and temperature in the prior year had only weak effects on entomological risk. The strongest predictors of a current year's risk were the prior year's abundance of mice and chipmunks and abundance of acorns 2 y previously. In no case did inclusion of deer or climate variables improve the predictive power of models based on rodents, acorns, or both. We conclude that interannual variation in entomological risk of exposure to Lyme disease is correlated positively with prior abundance of key hosts for the immature stages of the tick vector and with critical food resources for those hosts."

We tried to estimate the efficiency of diagnostic methods and treatment. We analyzed medical documentation of 300 patients with LD treated in our department between 1993-2001. The diagnosis was made according to Lyme Disease Foundation's criteria. Patients suffering from LD were divided into 3 groups according to stages of the disease. The most frequent manifestation of LD was erythema migrans (EM). The number of LD cases had increased during the observation time. The exposition to tick-bites was greater during summer and early autumn. The great number of patients with EM was observed at the same time. Cases of Lyme arthritis (LA), disseminated EM, Lyme carditis (LC) and neuroborreliosis represented the group number 2. LA, uveitis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) were diagnosed in the third group of patients. Serological markers of B. burgdorferi infection were found in about 50% of cases of EM and in each patient in group 2 and 3. Complete recovery after antibiotic therapy was observed in every case in early LD and partial one in the late stage."

Patients were randomly assigned to atovaquone suspension or placebo plus cholestyramine for 3 weeks, were crossed over for 3 weeks, and then received open-label atovaquone and cholestyramine for 6 weeks. Symptoms and VCS scores were recorded at baseline and after weeks 3, 6, 9, and 12. Improvements in symptoms and VCS deficits were observed only after at least 9 weeks of treatment. At week 12, 5 patients were asymptomatic, and 16 had a notable reduction in the number of symptoms. The entire cohort demonstrated significant increases in VCS scores. Adverse effects were rare. Patients coinfected with B burgdorferi and B microti derive measurable clinical benefit from prolonged treatment with atovaquone and cholestyramine. Longer-term combination therapy may be indicated."

The neurologic manifestations of the disease variably affect different areas of the neuroaxis, central or peripheral, and can present with early or late symptomatology, depending on the age group. Although the literature includes a wide range of neurologic abnormalities, the most frequent symptom reported in the pediatric population is headache, and the most common sign being facial palsy. An immunologic process with cross-reacting antibodies and antibodies directed against neuronal proteins may exist as the causative factor. Because of characteristic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings, CSF examination and serologic testing for Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent, should be performed in patients, particularly if a child, having been in an endemic area, presenting with an acute neurologic disorder of unexplained etiology. Treatment with antibiotics, if initiated early-on, is curative, especially in children. The pediatric population carries the highest risk for Lyme disease relative to other age groups. Younger patients tend to be more acutely affected, with involvement primarily of the central nervous system, exhibiting an inflammatory response in the CSF and signs/symptoms of aseptic meningitis and facial nerve palsy, whereas older patients present with features of peripheral nervous system pathology, tipically with a radiculopathy. Despite having a greater incidence of neuroborreliosis, the clinical course in most children is milder and shorter than that reported for adults."

		"abstract": "The spirochaetes that cause tick-borne relapsing fever and Lyme disease are closely related human pathogens, yet they differ significantly in their ecology and pathogenicity. Genome sequencing of two species of relapsing fever spirochaetes, Borrelia hermsii and Borrelia turicatae, identified a chromosomal open reading frame, designated bhpA, not present in the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi. The predicted amino acid sequence of bhpA was homologous with the HtrA serine proteases, which are involved with stress responses and virulence in other bacteria. B. hermsii produced an active serine protease that was recognized by BhpA antibodies and the recombinant BhpA protein-degraded beta-casein. bhpA was transcribed in vitro at all growth temperatures and transcription levels were slightly elevated at higher temperatures. These results correlated with the synthesis of BhpA during B. hermsii infection in mice. With the exception of Borrelia recurrentis, the bhpA gene, protein and enzymatic activity were found in all relapsing fever spirochaetes, but not in Lyme disease or related spirochaetes. Heterologous expression of bhpA in B. burgdorferi increased the spirochaete's resistance to both oxidative stress and killing by human neutrophils. Therefore, we propose that bhpA encodes a unique and functional serine protease in relapsing fever spirochaetes. This periplasmic enzyme may prevent the accumulation of proteins damaged by the innate immune response and contribute to the ability of the relapsing fever spirochaetes to achieve high cell densities in blood."

		"abstract": "Hepatitis B virus capsid-like particles (CLPs), icosahedral assemblies formed by 90 or 120 core protein dimers, hold promise as immune-enhancing vaccine carriers for heterologous antigens. Insertions into the immunodominant c/e1 B cell epitope, a surface-exposed loop, are especially immunogenic. However, display of whole proteins, desirable to induce multispecific and possibly neutralizing antibody responses, can be restrained by an unsuitable structure of the foreign protein and by its propensity to undergo homomeric interactions. Here we analyzed CLP formation by core fusions with two distinct variants of the dimeric outer surface lipoprotein C (OspC) of the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi. Although the topology of the termini in the OspC dimer does not match that of the insertion sites in the carrier dimer, both fusions, coreOspCa and coreOspCb, efficiently formed stable CLPs. Electron cryomicroscopy clearly revealed the surface disposition of the OspC domains, possibly with OspC dimerization occurring across different core protein dimers. In mice, both CLP preparations induced high-titered antibody responses against the homologous OspC variant, but with substantial cross-reactivity against the other variant. Importantly, both conferred protection to mice challenged with B. burgdorferi. These data show the principal applicability of hepatitis B virus CLPs for the display of dimeric proteins, demonstrate the presence in OspC of hitherto uncharacterized epitopes, and suggest that OspC, despite its genetic variability, may be a valid vaccine candidate."

		"abstract": "We used drag sampling to examine the geographical distribution patterns of ixodid ticks engaging in open (non-nidicolous) host-seeking behavior in dense woodland habitats of the climatically and ecologically diverse Mendocino County in north coastal California. The findings based on this sampling methodology reflect risk of human exposure to host-seeking ticks rather than the true distribution of the ticks. Drag sampling in 78 sites yielded 7,860 nymphal or adult Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls, 220 Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, 150 Ixodes spinipalpis Hadwen & Nuttall, 15 Hemaphysalis leporispalustris (Packard), 12 Ixodes angustus Neumann, 12 Ixodes auritulus Neumann, and a single Dermacentor variabilis (Say). I. pacificus, which is the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi to humans in California, occurred in all 78 sites examined. D. occidentalis, another tick species commonly biting humans in California, and H. leporispalustris typically were encountered in oak-associated woodlands in the central or eastern parts of the county. In contrast, three species of Ixodes ticks (I. angustus, I. auritulus, and I. spinipalpis) most commonly were found questing openly in woodlands with redwood present in the western part of the county. I. angustus and I. spinipalpis are occasional human biters and known experimental vectors of B. burgdorferi. Our study represents the first collection of large numbers of openly host-seeking I. spinipalpis ticks. Univariate tests of associations between presence of ticks (D. occidentalis, H. leporispalustris, I. angustus, I. auritulus, or I. spinipalpis) and environmental geographical information systems-remote sensing (GIS/ RS)-based data indicated that elevation, number of growing degree-days, and tasseled cap brightness, greenness, and wetness are especially useful predictors of presence of openly hostseeking ticks. Combinations of the above-mentioned GIS/RS-based data yielded significant logistic regression models for habitat suitability of host-seeking ticks for all five above-mentioned species. The model equations were used to create spatial surfaces of predicted presence of suitable habitat for openly host-seeking ticks in Mendocino County dense woodlands."

Climate change projections suggest a northward range expansion of I. scapularis this century, but it is unclear whether more northerly habitats are suitable for I. scapularis survival. In this study, we assessed the suitability of woodlands of the Lower Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Plain region for I. scapularis by comparing tick egg survival in four different woodlands. Woodlands where I. scapularis are established, and sand dune where I. scapularis do not survive, served as positive and negative control sites, respectively. At two woodland sites, egg survival was the same as at the positive control site, but at two of the sites survival was significantly less than either the positive control site, or one of the other test sites. Egg survival in all woodland sites was significantly higher than in the sand dune site. Ground level habitat classification discriminated among woodlands in which tick survival differed. The likelihood that I. scapularis populations could persist in the different habitats, as deduced using a population model of I. scapularis, was significantly associated with variations in Landsat 7 ETM+ data (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI] and Tasselled Cap indices). The NDVI index predicted habitat suitability at Long Point, Ontario, with high sensitivity but moderate specificity. Our study suggests that I. scapularis populations could establish in more northerly woodland types than those in which they currently exist. Suitable habitats may be detected by ground-level habitat classification, and remote-sensed data may assist this process."

These birds were found to have an infestation prevalence of 45%, a density of 1.7 ticks per bird, and an intensity of 3.8 ticks per infested bird. There was a significant difference in the I. pacificus infestations between canopy and ground-dwelling birds. Birds also demonstrated an overall infection with B. burgdorferi of 6.4% with significant difference between bird species. Amplification and subsequent sequencing of the 23s-5s rRNA intergenic spacer region of the Borrelia genome from one bird, a hermit thrush, Catharus guttatus (Nuttall), showed that the infection in this bird was caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto; the first such finding in a bird from the far west. Our results suggest that birds play a role in the distribution and maintenance of I. pacificus, and possibly of B. burgdoferi, at the Sutter Buttes, CA."

In 1995, there were statistically significant differences in the mean of greenness and wetness indices between sites classified as low and moderate tick abundance areas (P = 0.005 and P = 0.041, respectively). In 1997, there also were statistically significant differences in the mean of the greenness and wetness indices, but these differences were between the grouping of low/moderate tick abundance and the high tick abundance category (P = 0.023 and P = 0.015, respectively). The same indices from the 2002 image were not significant predictors of tick abundance. It may be that Landsat TM-derived indices can be used to predict nymphal blacklegged tick abundance in years (e.g., 1995 and 1997) when tick abundance is lower than average but not in years when it is higher (e.g., 2002). Thus, it seems unlikely that these remotely sensed indices will be very useful for modeling nonperidomestic Lyme disease risk over a large region in Rhode Island."

		"abstract": "The risk of Lyme disease for humans in the eastern United States is dependent on the density of host-seeking Ixodes scapularis Say nymphal stage ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Although many local and regional studies have estimated Lyme disease risk using these parameters, this is the first large-scale study using a standardized methodology. Density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs was measured by drag sampling of closed canopy deciduous forest habitats in 95 locations spaced among 2 degrees quadrants covering the entire United States east of the 100th meridian. Sampling was done in five standardized transects at each site and repeated three to six times during the summer of 2004. The total number of adults and nymphs of the seven tick species collected was 17,972, with 1,405 nymphal I. scapularis collected in 31 of the 95 sites. Peak global spatial autocorrelation values were found at the smallest lag distance (300 km) and decreased significantly after 1,000 km. Local auto-correlation statistics identified two significant high-density clusters around endemic areas in the northeast and upper Midwest and a low-density cluster in sites south of the 39th parallel, where only 21 nymphs were collected. Peak nymphal host-seeking density occurred earlier in the southern than in the most northern sites. Spatiotemporal density patterns will be combined with Borrelia prevalence data as part of a 4-yr survey to generate a nationwide spatial risk model for I. scapularis-borne Borrelia, which will improve targeting of disease prevention efforts."

To evaluate concentrations of soluble factors participating in regulation of apoptosis in the supernatants of the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of patients with chronic Lyme borreliosis. The study group consisted of 10 patients with chronic Lyme arthritis and the control group of 5 persons in whom Lyme borreliosis was excluded. In the supernatant of PBMC culture incubated with Borrelia burgdorferi antigens concentrations of potentially anti-apoptotic factors: soluble receptor for tumor necrosis factor alpha (sTNF-RI), soluble Fas (sFas) and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL), as well as the concentration of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), cytokine synthesized in the final stage of apoptosis, were measured by ELISA. Concentrations of sTNF-RI, sFas and sFasL, but also TGF-beta tended to be increased in the study group in comparison with nonstimulated PBMC and the control group. These data, although they should be considered preliminary because of the small size of the groups, suggest possible impairment of the apoptosis of lymphocytes in the chronic Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Ixodes pacificus nymphs are the primary vectors to humans of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, in California. We used a supervised classification model, based on remote sensing (RS) data from multi-seasonal Landsat TM 5 images, to identify the key habitat in Mendocino County where humans are exposed to I. pacificus nymphs (woodlands carpeted with leaf litter). The model, based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness, and wetness, separated the nymphal risk habitat (52.6% of the county) from other habitat types with > 93% user and producer accuracies. Next, we determined the density of questing nymphs in 62 woodland-leaf areas located throughout Mendocino County and created forward-stepwise regression models explaining the variation in nymphal density based on traits attainable by a lay-person in the field (e.g., tree species present, deer signs; r(2) = 0.43, P < 0.0001), or geographic information systems (GIS)/RS-based environmental data (r(2) = 0.50, P < 0.0001). The GIS/RS model, using July NDVI, November greenness, a coastal influence category, May solar insolation, November hours of sunlight, and dominant hydrologic grouping as input variables, was 22% more accurate in predicting nymphal density at 16 validation sites (r(2) = 0.72) than the field-derived data model (r(2) = 0.50). The habitat classification and GIS/RS models were combined to create a continuous nymphal density surface for the entirety of Mendocino County. This risk surface showed that 11.9% of the county was classified as habitat posing at least moderate risk of human exposure to nymphs (> 6.4 nymphs per 100 m(2)). Furthermore, high-risk areas (> 10.5 nymphs per 100 m(2); 1.7% of the county) tended to cluster in the central interior and most heavily populated region of Mendocino County, but were rare in the proximity of coastal population centers."

We present a mathematical model describing important ecologic interactions affecting the distribution and abundance of B. burgdorferi strains, marked by the allele at the outer surface protein C locus, in Ixodes scapularis ticks, the principal vector. The frequency of each strain in ticks can be explained by the vertebrate species composition, the density of each vertebrate species, the number of ticks that feed on individuals of each species, and the rate at which those ticks acquire different strains. The model results are consistent with empirical data collected in a major Lyme disease focus in New England. An applicable extension of these results would be to predict the proportion of ticks carrying human infectious strains of B. burgdorferi from disease host densities and thus predict the local risk of contracting Lyme disease."

All the patients had been treated with antibiotics and were free of disease within 3 to 6 months of follow-up. All the 15 patients who were found to be IgG positive at the time of enrollment and who were bled at least four times during the follow-up became IgG seronegative at 2 to 6 months posttreatment.

		"abstract": "The manifestations of Lyme disease, caused by Ixodes spp. tick-transmitted Borrelia burgdorferi, range from skin infection to bloodstream invasion into the heart, joints and nervous system. The febrile infection human granulocytic anaplasmosis is caused by a neutrophilic rickettsia called Anaplasma phagocytophilum, also transmitted by Ixodes ticks. Previous studies suggest that co-infection with A. phagocytophilum contributes to increased spirochetal loads and severity of Lyme disease. However, a common link between these tick-transmitted pathogens is dissemination into blood or tissues through blood vessels. Preliminary studies show that B. burgdorferi binds and passes through endothelial barriers in part mediated by host matrix metalloproteases. Since neutrophils infected by A. phagocytophilum are activated to release bioactive metalloproteases and chemokines, we examined the enhanced B. burgdorferi transmigration through vascular barriers with co-infection in vitro. To test whether endothelial transmigration is enhanced with co-infection, B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils were co-incubated with EA.hy926 cells (HUVEC-derived) and human brain microvascular endothelial cells in Transwell cultures. Transmigration of B. burgdorferi through endothelial cell barriers was determined and endothelial barrier integrity was measured by transendothelial electrical resistivity. More B. burgdorferi crossed both human BMEC and EA.hy926 cells in the presence of A. phagocytophilum-infected neutrophils than with uninfected neutrophils without affecting endothelial cell integrity. Such a mechanism may contribute to increased blood and tissue spirochete loads."

However, no special research has been carried out to consider the phenomenon thoroughly. The infection indices of the female taiga ticks, Ixodes persulcatus, infected with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were related to tick physiological age, an index that more precisely reflects tick physiological state than the time of tick collection in the field or the duration of tick survival under laboratory conditions. A novel quantitative technique of physiological age determination based on the evaluation of the ratios between sizes of the stable (scutum) and the changing (alloscutum) structures of the tick body was used. The age was estimated in accordance with the classical age-grade scale introduced by Balashov and a more fractional scale determined by the new technique. In total, 131 female ticks were examined for their infection and physiological age, 46 of which were infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. (mean infection rate 35.1%). The minimal intensity of infection was 0.4 bacterial cells per 100 fields of view whereas the maximal infection was 172 cells. There was no difference between the prevalence of infection in ticks of different physiological age. The intensity of infection obviously differed between ticks of different age groups in the scale introduced by Balashov but did not significantly differ between ticks of different age groups according to the fractional age-grade scale. The data concerning the relationships between Borrelia burgdorferi and unfed Ixodes ticks are considered."

		"abstract": "The purpose of this report is to offer a consensus opinion of ACVIM diplomates on the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Borrelia burgdorferi infections in dogs (canine Lyme disease). Clinical syndromes known to commonly be associated with canine Lyme disease include polyarthritis and glomerulopathy. Serological test results can be used to document exposure to B. burgdorferi but not prove illness. Although serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/indirect fluorescent antibody assay titers can stay positive for months to years after treatment, quantitative C6 peptide antibody paired tests need more study. Serological screening of healthy dogs is controversial because it can lead to overdiagnosis or overtreatment of normal dogs, most of which never develop Lyme disease. However, serological screening can provide seroprevalence and sentinel data and stimulate owner education about tick infections and control. Although it is unknown whether treatment of seropositive healthy dogs is beneficial, the consensus is that seropositive dogs should be evaluated for proteinuria and other coinfections and tick control prescribed. Tick control can include a product that repels or protects against tick attachment, thereby helping to prevent transmission of coinfections as well as Borrelia spp. Seropositive dogs with clinical abnormalities thought to arise from Lyme disease generally are treated with doxycycline (10 mg/kg q24h for 1 month). Proteinuric dogs might need longer treatment as well as medications and diets for protein-losing nephropathy. The ACVIM diplomates believe the use of Lyme vaccines still is controversial and most do not administer them. It is the consensus opinion that additional research is needed to study predictors of illness, \"Lyme nephropathy,\" and coinfections in Lyme endemic areas."

However, when stratified by antibiotic response, the frequencies of DRB1 alleles in the 71 patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis differed significantly from those in the 50 antibiotic-responsive patients (log likelihood test, P = 0.006; exact test, P = 0.008; effect size, Wn = 0.38). 7 of the 14 DRB molecules (DRB1*0401, 0101, 0404, 0405, DRB5*0101, DRB1*0402, and 0102) showed strong to weak binding of OspA163-175, whereas the other seven showed negligible or no binding of the peptide. Altogether, 79% of the antibiotic-refractory patients had at least one of the seven known OspA peptide-binding DR molecules compared with 46% of the antibiotic-responsive patients (odds ratio = 4.4; P < 0.001). We conclude that binding of a single spirochetal peptide to certain DRB molecules is a marker for antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis and might play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease."

The control group was composed of 20 healthy volunteers (health service employees) aged 25-65 (mean: 45 yr) with no detectable serum anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. We found that N-acetyl-beta-d-hexosaminidase (HEX) was significantly increased and beta-galactosidase and alpha-mannosidase also showed an increase in Lyme arthritis patients compared to healthy persons and normalised after treatment with doxycycline. Our results suggest that HEX is a sensitive enzymatic marker of Lyme arthritis and it may be used to monitor the course of the disease and the efficiency of treatment."

The standard curve of the assay was linear by semi-log plot over more than five orders of magnitude, and the detection limit of the assay was one thousandth of a single cell of B. burgdorferi. The minimum target level for detection using the RT-PCR assay for 16S RNA was 40-fold lower than the RT-PCR assay for messenger RNA of ospA, a highly expressed, plasmid-borne gene, and 1600-fold lower than the RT-PCR assay for messenger RNA of p66, a chromosome-borne gene of B. burgdorferi. The 16S rRNA assay was then applied in an experimental setting for monitoring the spirochetal load in B. burgdorferi-infected Ixodes scapularis ticks before and after they fed on Peromyscus leucopus mice immunized with recombinant OspA. Unfed infected ticks had a mean of 2,240 spirochetes per tick, and after feeding on non-immunized mice and engorgement, the mean number of spirochetes increased to 223,900 per tick. In contrast, there were either no or <or=7 spirochetes in ticks that had fed on OspA-immunized mice."

Although there is variation with respect to geography and tick vector, the clinical manifestations are similar, and treatment of these infections is identical. Ehrlichiosis can present with a spectrum of neurologic manifestations, ranging in severity from headache to meningoencephalitis. Treatment is straightforward if the diagnosis is suspected, but antibiotic therapy should not be delayed pending laboratory confirmation. Doxycycline, the treatment of choice for adults and children with suspected ehrlichiosis, has high bioavailability and can be administered orally in most cases. Therapy is typically continued at least 3 days after the last documented fever. Although there have been no studies specifically evaluating duration or dosing of doxycycline for Ehrlichia meningoencephalitis, anecdotal reports suggest 100 mg doxycycline administered twice daily is effective, despite limited penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid. Because doxycycline interacts with CYP3A4 enzymes, there is potential for drug interactions with a number of medications. In endemic areas, documentation of coinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, may require prolonging the duration of doxycycline therapy."

		"abstract": "Members of the ospE/ospF/elp lipoprotein gene families of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease agent, are transcriptionally upregulated in response to the influx of blood into the midgut of an infected tick. We recently have demonstrated that despite the high degree of similarity between the promoters of the ospF (P(ospF)) and ospE (P(ospE)) genes of B. burgdorferi strain 297, the differential expression of ospF is RpoS-dependent, while ospE is controlled by sigma(70). Herein we used wild-type and RpoS-deficient strains of B. burgdorferi and Escherichia coli to analyse transcriptional reporters consisting of a green fluorescent protein (gfp) gene fused to P(ospF), P(ospE), or two hybrid promoters in which the -10 regions of P(ospF) and P(ospE) were switched [P(ospF ) ((E - 10)) and P(ospE) ((F - 10)) respectively]. We found that the P(ospF)-10 region is both necessary and sufficient for RpoS-dependent recognition in B. burgdorferi, while sigma(70) specificity for P(ospE) is dependent on elements outside of the -10 region. In E. coli, sigma factor selectivity for these promoters was much more permissive, with expression of each being primarily due to sigma(70). Alignment of the sequences upstream of each of the ospE/ospF/elp genes from B. burgdorferi strains 297 and B31 revealed that two B31 ospF paralogues [erpK (BBM38) and erpL (BBO39)] have -10 regions virtually identical to that of P(ospF). Correspondingly, expression of gfp reporters based on the erpK and erpL promoters was RpoS-dependent. Thus, the sequence of the P(ospF)-10 region appears to serve as a motif for RpoS recognition, the first described for any B. burgdorferi promoter. Taken together, our data support the notion that B. burgdorferi utilizes sequence differences at the -10 region as one mechanism for maintaining the transcriptional integrity of RpoS-dependent and -independent genes activated at the onset of tick feeding."

Some are most effective against metabolically active B. burgdorferi. The abundant PMN cytoplasmic protein calprotectin, elevated 10- to 100-fold in inflammation, inhibits the growth of spirochetes through chelation of the essential cation, Zn. Since the action of some therapeutic antibiotics depends on bacterial division, we investigated the antibiotic sensitivities of spirochetes in calprotectin. In physiologic calprotectin, B. burgdorferi is not eliminated by therapeutic doses of penicillin G; in contrast, doxycycline is effective. Calprotectin may modify the clearance of spirochetes at sites of inflammation."

Innate immune cells recognize B. burgdorferi by Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that use the intracellular molecule MyD88 to mediate effector functions. To determine whether impaired TLR signaling enhances Ixodes scapularis acquisition of B. burgdorferi, we fed nymphs on wild-type (WT) and MyD88-/- mice previously infected with two clinical isolates of B. burgdorferi, BL206, a high-virulence strain, and B348, an attenuated strain. Seventy-three percent of the nymphs that fed on BL206-infected WT mice and 40% of the nymphs that fed on B348-infected WT mice acquired B. burgdorferi, whereas 100% of the nymphs that fed on MyD88-/- mice became infected, irrespective of B. burgdorferi strain. Ticks that acquired infection after feeding on MyD88-/- mice harbored more spirochetes than those that fed on WT mice, as assessed by quantitative PCR for B. burgdorferi DNA. Vector transmission of BL206 and B348 was also enhanced when MyD88-/- mice were the blood meal hosts, with the mean pathogen burden at the skin inoculation site significantly higher than levels in WT mice. These results show that the absence of MyD88 facilitates passage of both low- and high-infectivity B. burgdorferi strains between the tick vector and the mammal and enhances the infectivity of a low-infectivity B. burgdorferi strain."

The approach to diagnosing Lyme disease varies depending on the probability of disease (based on endemicity and clinical findings) and the stage at which the disease may be. In patients from endemic areas, Lyme disease may be diagnosed on clinical grounds alone in the presence of erythema migrans. These patients do not require serologic testing, although it may be considered according to patient preference. When the pretest probability is moderate (e.g., in a patient from a highly or moderately endemic area who has advanced manifestations of Lyme disease), serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach in which a positive or equivocal serology is followed by a more specific Western blot test. Samples drawn from patients within four weeks of disease onset are tested by Western blot technique for both immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G antibodies; samples drawn more than four weeks after disease onset are tested for immunoglobulin G only. Patients who show no objective signs of Lyme disease have a low probability of the disease, and serologic testing in this group should be kept to a minimum because of the high risk of false-positive results. When unexplained nonspecific systemic symptoms such as myalgia, fatigue, and paresthesias have persisted for a long time in a person from an endemic area, serologic testing should be performed with the complete two-step approach described above."

Verification showed that a large proportion of TBE cases (included in the official statistics of TBE morbidity) was accounted for by the so-called seronegative forms of the disease. Ixodid tick-borne borrelioses (ITBBs), or infections of the Lyme borreliosis group, which proved to be sympatric to TBE in Russia accounted for an even higher morbidity in past years. Some other tick-borne diseases were still unknown at that time. We analyzed 1062 case histories of patients with febrile diseases acquired through tick bites in the Udmurt Republic, Russia (one of the most hazardous regions with respect to TBE morbidity), recorded from 1965 to 1968, and 1509 similar cases recorded from 1983 to 1988. In the first period, 97 out of 684 cases (14.2%) included in the official statistics of TBE morbidity could be classified as ITBB according to modern case criteria. In the second period, 464 out of 1509 cases recorded as TBE (30.7%) were retrospectively diagnosed as ITBB. No specific diagnosis could be made in 7-17% of the total number of cases interpreted as 'tick-borne' diseases. A similar situation existed in other regions of Russia before 1996 and, as a consequence, the official parameters of annual TBE morbidity in different periods were overestimated by a factor of 1.2-1.6. Here, the long-term dynamics of TBE morbidity in Russia are presented as they appear according to official data and after correction with regard to estimations."

Moreover, we wished to determine whether the expression of T-cell activation markers reflects disease activity in multiple sclerosis (MS). Proportions of cerebrospinal fluid T-cells expressing the markers HLA-DR, CD25 and CD38 were determined in patients with MS (n = 40), acute viral meningomyeloradiculoneuritis (VID, n = 26), early neuroborreliosis (NB, n = 23) and non-inflammatory neurologic diseases (n = 51) by using flow cytometry. In relapsing-remitting MS, disease activity was assessed by clinical examination and magnetic resonance imaging. For each of the surface markers that were examined, significant differences in T cell proportions were found between patient groups. The proportion of HLA-DR+ T cells was higher and that of CD25+ T cells lower in NB compared with VID. These differences were attributable only to the early phase of the disease (< or = 6 days after symptom onset). Among MS patients, there was a trend for higher proportions of T cells expressing activation markers in patients with gadolinium-enhancing lesions. The decreased CD25 expression in NB may reflect immunomodulatory effects of B. burgdorferi facilitating persistent infection. Larger prospective studies of T-cell activation markers for ascertaining the association between cellular markers and clinical surrogates of disease activity in MS are warranted."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi adhesin DbpA (decorin-binding protein A) is a valuable antigen for serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis and a promising candidate for a vaccine. To investigate the heterogeneity of DbpA, we aligned DNA sequences of 83 different dbpA genes (37 from the database, where the majority of sequences belong to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and 46 were newly sequenced). Analysis of 25 sequences from the species B. burgdorferi s.s., 16 from B. afzelii, 40 from B. garinii, and two from the recently described human pathogenic genospecies A14S revealed five distinct DbpA groups. Group I comprises B. burgdorferi s.s. and group II B. afzelii. B. garinii is divided into groups III and IV, whereas A14S strains form group V. Formation of groups is mainly due to insertions of whole sequence sections. Comparison of dbpA sequences with ospC sequences from a subset of 59 strains revealed all kinds of cross-connections indicating processes of lateral gene transfer among strains. The extent of sequence identity within the dbpA genes decreases from the DNA (67%) to the amino acid (AA) level (44%) by about 23%, in contrast ospC sequence identities differed only by about 10%. This might be an indication that DbpA plays an important role in immune escape. Immunoblots using four recombinant DbpAs representing groups I-IV show that DbpA proteins are sensitive and specific antigens and complement one another in their reactivity. Part of the sera showed group-specific reactivity which could also be demonstrated with monoclonal antibodies."

		"abstract": "Febrile tick-borne diseases can be caused by different pathogens. The study objective was to prospectively determine the etiology of infection among adults exposed to tick bite and to detect acute human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), a recently emerging infection, in north-eastern Poland. We evaluated 68 patients (34 males and 34 females, mean age 44.2+/-15 years) who had fever within 4 weeks after a tick bite. Paired sera were tested for antibodies against tick-borne encephalitis virus, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Microscopic examination of EDTA whole blood and nested PCR targeting A. phagocytophilum 16S rDNA gene fragment were carried out at enrolment. Tick-borne infections were diagnosed in 57 individuals (84%). Sixty-four patients were hospitalised. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) was revealed in 49 cases; in 39 patients as a single infection, in three patients concurrent with erythema migrans or other Lyme borreliosis symptoms, in five patients concurrent with probable or possible Lyme borreliosis, and in two patients concurrent with A. phagocytophilum infection. Diagnosis of HGA was confirmed in one patient by PCR and in another one by seroconversion. In two further individuals, A. phagocytophilum infection was confirmed by immunofluorescence (antibody titers > or = 1:128), which, however, does not fulfil the ESCAR (European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Study Group on Coxiella, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, and Bartonella) criteria for HGA case definition. Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 16 patients; in six of them as a single infection. Both confirmed HGA cases and seropositive individuals had A. phagocytophilum infection concurrent either with Lyme borreliosis (two cases) or with TBE (two cases). The clinical course was severe in three and moderate to mild in the remaining TBE cases, as well as in all Lyme borreliosis and HGA cases. TBE was found the most prevalent disease among adults with febrile illnesses occurring after a tick bite in north-eastern Poland. Concurrent tick-borne infections were frequent with multiple pathogens involved. Two confirmed acute HGA cases (fulfilling the European case definition criteria defined by ESCAR) were detected for the first time in a prospective manner in Poland."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi produces Pfs and LuxS enzymes for breakdown of the toxic byproducts of methylation reactions, producing 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD), adenine, and homocysteine. DPD and its spontaneously rearranged derivatives constitute a class of bacterial pheromones named autoinducer-2 (AI-2). We describe that B. burgdorferi produces DPD during laboratory cultivation. Furthermore, addition of in vitro synthesized DPD to cultured B. burgdorferi resulted in altered expression levels of a specific set of bacterial proteins, among which is the outer surface lipoprotein VlsE. While a large number of bacteria utilize homocysteine, the other LuxS product, for synthesis of methionine as part of the activated-methyl cycle, B. burgdorferi was found to lack that ability. We propose that the main function of B. burgdorferi LuxS is to synthesize DPD and that the Lyme disease spirochete utilizes a form of DPD as a pheromone to control gene expression."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochaete transmitted to human hosts during feeding of infected Ixodes ticks, is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the most frequent vector-borne disease in Eurasia and North America. Sporadically Lyme disease develops into a chronic, multisystemic disorder. Serum-resistant B. burgdorferi strains bind complement factor H (FH) and FH-like protein 1 (FHL-1) on the spirochaete surface. This binding is dependent on the expression of proteins termed complement-regulator acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs). The atomic structure of BbCRASP-1, the key FHL-1/FH-binding protein of B. burgdorferi, has recently been determined. Our analysis indicates that its protein topology apparently evolved to provide a high affinity interaction site for FH/FHL-1 and leads to an atomic-level hypothesis for the functioning of BbCRASP-1. This work demonstrates that pathogens interact with complement regulators in ways that are distinct from the mechanisms used by the host and are thus obvious targets for drug design."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to humans and other vertebrate hosts through the bites of ixodid ticks. B. burgdorferi Erp (OspE-F related lipoprotein) family members are encoded on members of the 32 kb circular plasmid-like prophage family (cp32s). Many Erp proteins serve as receptors for the complement inhibitory factor H molecules of numerous vertebrate hosts, providing one mechanism by which the bacteria potentially evade the innate immune system. Indirect immunofluorescence analyses (IFA) have demonstrated that Erp expression is temporally regulated throughout the mammal-tick infectious cycle, indicating that Erp proteins perform an important role (or even roles) during mammalian infection. However, it was not previously known whether Erp proteins are continually produced by B. burgdorferi throughout the course of mammalian infection. To address this issue, quantitative RT-PCR (q-RT-PCR) was utilized to assess erp transcription levels by bacteria within numerous different tissues of both mice and non-human primates (NHPs) chronically infected with B. burgdorferi. Q-RT-PCR results obtained using both animal models indicated that while the majority of erp genes were detectably transcribed during chronic infection, differences in expression levels were noted. These data strongly suggest that Erp proteins contribute to B. burgdorferi persistence within chronically infected host tissues, perhaps by protecting the bacteria from complement-mediated killing."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans (EM) develops at the site of the tick bite in 77-90% of Lyme borreliosis (LB) patients and is therefore a common manifestation of early disease. Clinical treatment failures have been reported in early LB cases for almost every suitable antimicrobial agent. The exact risk of resistance to antibiotic treatment in patients with EM, however, is not known and there are few published cases of culture-proven treatment failure. Moreover, currently available diagnostic techniques cannot reliably discriminate between possible reinfection, true endogenous relapse and co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens. These drawbacks together with the phenomenon of resistance to therapy in individual patients undoubtedly contribute to the inconsistencies surrounding the optimal treatment regimens for LB and are often misinterpreted and misused to support prolonged antibiotic treatment regimens. The question for the underlying mechanisms of possible antimicrobial resistance in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato remains unresolved but a better understanding of such genetic or phenotypic mechanisms would be helpful for the treatment of LB and other spirochetal diseases. Investigations on this issue, at best, should start with borrelial isolates cultured from patients before the start of antibiotic therapy and again after the conclusion of treatment. This task, however, remains challenging insofar, as culture is rarely successful under routine laboratory conditions after antimicrobial therapy. Here, we review recent clinical and experimental data on treatment resistance in EM patients suggesting that, although rare, borrelial persistence does occur at the site of the infectious lesion after antibiotic treatment. Borrelial persistence, however, is unlikely to result from acquired resistance against antimicrobial agents that were used for initial specific chemotherapy."

Three of these bird species, the blackbird (Turdus merula), the song thrush (T. philomelos), and the bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula) harboured B. burgdorferi s.l. infected ticks. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the bird-feeding ticks was 25%. The majority of the ticks carried B. garinii (53%), followed by B. valaisiana (28%). In the same region, 256 questing ticks were collected to determine the local Borrelia genospecies diversity in I. ricinus. In all, 15.2% of the ticks which were found positive for B. burgdorferi s.l. contained B. valaisiana (45%) as the most frequent genospecies. The results of the present study indicate an important role of the blackbird and the song thrush in the natural cycle of B. burgdorferi s.l. in Thuringia."

The measurement of serum and CSF antibodies is not suitable for follow-up, because they frequently persist. Post-Lyme disease (PLD) syndrome is characterized by persistent complaints and symptoms after previous treatment for Lyme borreliosis, e.g., musculoskeletal or radicular pain, dysaesthesia, and neurocognitive symptoms that are often associated with fatigue.

The tentative diagnoses were predominantly confirmed by serology. Antibiotics (and anti-inflammatory agents) were mainly used for therapy.

In Ixodes ricinus nymphs, the main vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. in most parts of Europe, the transmission risk appears low to moderate within the first 24h of feeding but increases to >70% after only 36 h. In this study, the so-called scutal index, the ratio between tick abdominal length and scutum width, a very good measure of the level of tick engorgement, was investigated for its potential to assess the feeding duration of detached I. ricinus nymphs, thereby indicating the level of human infection risk with B. burgdorferi s.l. I. ricinus nymphs were allowed to feed in capsules on tick-naive Mongolian gerbils for 0, 12, 24, 36 h, or to repletion, in groups of up to 9 individuals. After tick removal, the scutal index of each tick (n=516) was determined using a stereomicroscope with an ocular micrometer. This was also possible, if the tick mouthparts were damaged. Although the scutal indices determined at 24 h versus 36 h post-attachment (a critical interval for B. burgdorferi transmission) differ significantly, there was some overlap between the two groups. However, by choosing a scutal index of 1.1 as a cut-off, it was possible to assign 93.2% of the ticks attached for 24h (n=310) to one group (low-risk group ticks) and 85.6% of those attached for 36 h (n=97) to the other (high-risk group ticks). This means that those people from whom I. ricinus nymphs with a scutal index >1.1 detached have a distinctly elevated risk of Borrelia infection and therefore more likely require medical attention."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis continues to increase in the United States. In 1991, when Lyme borreliosis first became a nationally reportable disease to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a total of 9470 cases were reported; in contrast, by 2002 a total of 23,763 cases were reported, >2.5x the total in 1991. Area-wide acaricides can be highly effective in killing nymphal Ixodes scapularis, with >95% of nymphs killed in studies using cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, or carbaryl. The majority of residents living in households within the area hyperendemic for Lyme borreliosis will not, however, consider the use of area-wide acaricides. A survey of communities in 4 states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York) demonstrated that <25% of the populace have used area-wide acaricides on their own property. In searching for alternative methods of reducing Lyme borreliosis risk, host-targeted methods have been proven to be effective. Newly developed methods include the use of acaricides applied to deer feeder stations. This method is called the 4-poster method and has been shown in trials to reduce populations of nymphal I. scapularis by 69%. In addition, rodent-targeted bait boxes containing fipronil have been shown to eliminate ticks on mice and negatively impact the population of questing I. scapularis and reduce the proportion of these ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Host eradication can also be utilized. On Monhegan Island, Maine, white-tailed deer were totally eradicated from the island from 1999 to 2000. By 2004, no immature I. scapularis could be found on rodents on Monhegan Island. Landscape management practices can also be utilized to reduce the risk of Lyme borreliosis as can personal protection procedures including regular tick checks. These practices have been nicely summarized in a new Tick Management Handbook produced by Dr. Kirby C. Stafford III with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Although there is no magic bullet available to completely eliminate the risk of Lyme borreliosis from large geographic areas, the use of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices holds the prospect for reducing and managing Lyme borreliosis risk in the future."

In comparison to dermatological, neurological and rheumatological manifestations, heart disease is quite rare. Atrioventricular heart block is nevertheless the most frequent cardiological manifestation. We hereby report the case of a patient with high degree heart block due to Lyme disease. We focus on the electrocardiographical evolution during antibiotic therapy, as well as on microbiological and diagnostic aspects. Lyme disease is a rare cause of conduction disturbances but it is treatable and potentially reversible."

We compared clinical and demographic variables in Bb seropositive and seronegative psychiatric patients and healthy controls. Nine hundred and twenty-six consecutive psychiatric patients were screened for antibodies to Bb and compared with 884 simultaneously recruited healthy subjects. Contrary to healthy controls, seropositive psychiatric patients were significantly younger than seronegative ones. None of the studied psychiatric diagnostic categories exhibited stronger association with seropositivity. There were no differences between seropositive and seronegative psychiatric patients in hospitalization length, proportion of previously hospitalized patients and proportion of subjects with family history of psychiatric disorders. These findings elaborate on potential association between Bb infection and psychiatric morbidity, but fail to identify any specific clinical 'signature' of Bb infection."

Lyme borreliosis evolves in two stages: a primary red skin lesion called erythema migrans; later on, invasive bacteria disseminate to distant sites inducing secondary manifestations (neuropathies, arthritis, carditis, late skin disorders). It has been previously suggested that the ospC gene could be associated with invasiveness in humans depending on its sequence. Here, we confirm the pattern of invasiveness, according to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B. b. ss) ospC group, using the mouse as an experimental host of B. b. ss. As it has been shown that the host plasminogen activation system is used by B. burgdorferi to disseminate throughout the host, we studied the interaction of plasminogen with OspC proteins from invasive and non-invasive groups of B. b. ss. Using two methods, ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrate that indeed OspC is a plasminogen-binding protein. Moreover, significant differences in binding affinity for plasminogen are correlated with different invasiveness patterns in mice. These results suggest that the correlation between ospC polymorphism and Borrelia invasiveness in humans is linked, at least in part, to differences in OspC affinity for plasminogen."

Recent molecular and genetic studies have confirmed that Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, is one of the most complex bacteria known to man. Affinity for multiple cell types and the presence of non-replicating forms of B. burgdorferi have contributed to persistent infection and failure of simple antibiotic regimens. The controversial clinical science of Lyme disease has impeded reliable diagnosis and effective treatment of this protean illness. Two major clinical hurdles are the absence of a therapeutic endpoint in treating Lyme disease and the presence of tick-borne coinfections that may complicate the course of the illness. New strategies for the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Lyme disease are urgently needed."

Polymerase chain reaction for the flagellin gene of Bb was used to study formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lesional skin biopsies from 83 patients with MF and 83 sex- and age-matched healthy controls with homolocalised cutaneous nevi. Borrelia burgdorferi-specific sequence was detected in 15 out of 83 skin samples of patients with MF (18.1%), but in none out of 83 matched healthy controls (P<0.0001). The Bb positivity rates detected in this study support a possible role for Bb in the aetiopathogenesis of MF in a population endemic for LD."

Deficiencies in TLR-2 or the shared TLR adapter molecule MyD88 have been shown to result in greatly increased bacterial burdens in mice. However, although in vitro studies have shown that the activation of TLR pathways by B. burgdorferi results in the release of inflammatory cytokines, studies in deficient mice have shown either no change or increased rather than decreased inflammation in infected animals. In this study, we looked at mechanisms to explain the increase in inflammation in the absence of MyD88. We found that MyD88-deficient mice infected with B. burgdorferi did not show increased inflammation at sites typically associated with Lyme disease (joints and heart). However, there was markedly increased inflammation in the muscles, kidneys, pancreas, and lungs of deficient animals. Muscle inflammation was typically seen perivascularly and perineuronally similar to that seen in infected humans. Chemotactic chemokines and cytokines were greatly increased in the muscle and kidneys of MyD88-deficient animals but not in the joints or heart tissue, suggesting that MyD88-independent pathways for recognizing B. burgdorferi and inducing these chemokines are present in the muscle and kidneys. Interleukin-18 signaling through MyD88 does not appear to play a role in either control of infection or inflammation."

The B. burgdorferi B31 theoretical proteome is comprised of 1623 proteins and has a mean pI of 8.36 and a median pI of 9.03 with 68% of the proteome possessing a pI >/=7.5. Separation of soluble proteins by IPG resulted in 205 individual spots and identification of 78 protein spots by MALDI-TOF MS. Separation by modified NEPHGE routinely resulted in approximately 185 soluble and 160 membrane protein spots with the identification of 88 individual protein spots combined by MALDI-TOF MS. Homologues to GroEL and aminopeptidase I were present in greater amounts in the membrane faction, with enolase at nearly equivalent amounts in the soluble and membrane fractions. Identification of proteins isolated and separated by such methods will enable future determination of proteome changes in membrane and soluble protein fractions as spirochetes adapt to their changing environments."

TLR4 stimulation had no effect on TLR2, TLR1, and TLR5 expression. Human monocytes stimulated with TLR5 ligands (including p37 or flaA, the minor protein from B. burgdorferi flagella) up-regulated TLR5. In addition, TLR2 stimulation rendered cells hyporesponsive to a TLR5 agonist. These results indicate that diverse stimuli can cause differential TLR expression, and we hypothesize that these changes may be useful for either the pathogen and/or the host."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, utilizes multiple adhesins to interact with both the arthropod vector and mammalian hosts it colonizes. One such adhesive molecule is a surface-exposed fibronectin-binding lipoprotein, designated BBK32. Previous characterization of BBK32-mediated fibronectin binding has been limited to biochemical analyses due to the difficulty in mutagenizing infectious isolates of B. burgdorferi. Here we report an alternative method to inactivate bbk32 via allelic exchange through use of a low-passage variant of B. burgdorferi strain B31 that is more readily transformed. The resulting mutant does not synthesize BBK32, exhibits reduced fibronectin binding in solid phase assays and manifests decreased interactions with mouse fibroblast cells relative to both the infectious parent and genetic complement. Furthermore, the bbk32 knockout was significantly attenuated in the murine model of Lyme disease, whereas a genetically complemented control was not, indicating that BBK32 is necessary for maximal B. burgdorferi infection in the mouse. To our knowledge this is the first mutational analysis of a surface exposed, functional borrelial lipoprotein adhesin whose activity is associated with the mammalian host environment. By analogy with other pathogens that utilize fibronectin binding as an important virulence determinant, the borrelial fibronectin-BBK32 interaction is likely to be important in B. burgdorferi-specific pathogenic mechanisms, particularly in the context of dissemination, secondary colonization and/or persistence."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spirochaetes are unique among diderm bacteria in their abundance of surface-displayed lipoproteins, some of which play important roles in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. To identify the lipoprotein-sorting signals in Borrelia burgdorferi, we generated chimeras between the outer surface lipoprotein OspA, the periplasmic oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein OppAIV and mRFP1, a monomeric red fluorescent reporter protein. Localization of OspA and OppAIV point mutants showed that Borrelia lipoproteins do not follow the '+2' sorting rule which targets lipoproteins to the cytoplasmic or outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria via the Lol pathway. Fusions of mRFP1 to short N-terminal lipopeptides of OspA, and surprisingly OppAIV, were targeted to the spirochaetal surface. Mutagenesis of the OspA N-terminus defined less than five N-terminal amino acids as the minimal secretion-facilitating signal. With the exception of negative charges, which can act as partial subsurface retention signals in certain peptide contexts, lipoprotein secretion occurs independent of N-terminal sequence. Together, these data indicate that Borrelia lipoproteins are targeted to the bacterial surface by default, but can be retained in the periplasm by sequence-specific signals."

		"abstract": "We showed previously that interleukin-17 (IL-17) plays a significant role in the induction of arthritis associated with Borrelia vaccination and challenge. Little information, however, is available about the chain of immunologic events that leads to the release of IL-17. The production of IL-17 has been linked to stimulation of memory cells by IL-15. Therefore, we hypothesized that IL-15 is involved in the induction of arthritis associated with Borrelia vaccination and infection of mice. Here we present evidence that treatment of Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected mice with anti-IL-15 antibody prevents swelling of the hind paws. More importantly, both anti-IL-15 antibody- and recombinant IL-15 receptor alpha-treated Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected mice were free of major histopathologic indications of arthritis, including hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and vilus formation of the synovium. Similarly, the synovial space and perisynovium were free of inflammatory cells. By contrast, the synovium of nontreated Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected mice had overt hyperplasia, hypertrophy, and vilus formation. Moreover, the synovial space and perisynovium were infiltrated with neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes. Finally, we show that recombinant IL-15 stimulates the release of IL-17 from lymph node cells obtained near the arthritic site. These results suggest that IL-15 plays a major role in orchestrating IL-17 induction of arthritis associated with Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected mice."

A qualitative, phenomenological study was conducted to investigate the experience of becoming diagnosed with Lyme disease. A purposive sample of 10 participants diagnosed with Lyme disease were interviewed and tape-recorded. Data saturation guided the size of the sample. The interviews were transcribed verbatim. Key words or phrases were extracted and clustered; clusters were interpreted into themes. Analyzed data were confirmed with the participants for trustworthiness and reliability. Six themes emerged from the interviews. Participants expressed feelings of frustration during the long road to diagnosis. They endured multiple diagnostic tests and were seen by numerous health care providers. Participants voiced financial stress. They expressed the need for self-advocacy and felt validation when a diagnosis was made. Despite the chronicity of their illness, the participants voiced a sense of hopefulness for their future. A deep understanding of the lived experience of becoming diagnosed with Lyme disease allows for nurses to prioritize health care interventions and strategize ways to implement quality improvement systems as clients enter the health care environment."

		"abstract": "Borrelia lonestari is considered a putative agent of southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) and is known to occur naturally only in lone star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus). We used a low passage isolate of B. lonestari (LS-1) to inoculate white-tailed deer, C3H mice, Holstein cattle, and beagles. Animals were monitored via examination of Giemsa and acridine orange stained blood smears, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test, and/or culture isolation. Spirochetes were visualized in blood smears of both deer on days post-inoculation (DPI) 6, 8, 12 and one deer on DPI 15. Whole blood collected from deer tested PCR positive starting on DPI 4 and remained positive as long as DPI 28. Both deer developed antibody titers of >64, with a maximum IFA titer of 1024. The organism was reisolated from the blood of both deer on DPI 6 and one deer on DPI 12. All isolation attempts from mice, calves, or dogs were negative, although one of seven mice was transiently PCR positive. Mice and dogs developed an IFA titer > or =64, while calves lacked a detectable antibody response. These preliminary experimental infection trials show that white-tailed deer are susceptible to infection with B. lonestari and develop a spirochetemia following needle-inoculation, while C3H mice, calves, and dogs do not. Results suggest that deer may serve as a vertebrate reservoir host. Tick transmission studies are needed to confirm that this organism can be maintained in a natural cycle involving deer and A. americanum."

Serum samples obtained from healthy, asymptomatic military dogs from 12 different areas in the Czech Republic were examined for IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). The total of 399 serum samples were tested by a whole-cell ELISA. Specific antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were detected in 26 cases (6.5%). In different localities, the seroprevalence varied from 0.0% to 28.6%. Two local isolated strains Br-75 (Borrelia afzelii) and Br-97 (Borrelia garinii) were used as antigens. A total of 22 (5.5%) were positive for antibodies to Borrelia afzelii and 19 (4.8%) were positive for antibodies to Borrelia garinii. Fifteen cases were positive for both antibodies. A significantly higher seroprevalence was found in younger dogs (1-3 years) than in older ones (p < 0.05). An analysis of seroprevalence by months of sampling showed no significant difference (p > 0.05)."

A 16S rRNA A1402G mutation, homologous to E. coli A1408, conferred >90-fold resistance to kanamycin and >240-fold resistance to gentamicin. Two mutations were identified in the gene for ribosomal protein S12, at a site homologous to E. coli residue Lys-87, in mutants selected in streptomycin. Substitutions at codon 88, K88R and K88E, conferred 7-fold resistance and 10-fold resistance, respectively, to streptomycin on B. burgdorferi. The 16S rRNA A1185G and C1186U mutations, associated with spectinomycin resistance, appeared in a population of B. burgdorferi parental strain B31 at a high frequency of 6 x 10(-6). These spectinomycin-resistant mutants successfully competed with the wild-type strain during 100 generations of coculture in vitro. The aminoglycoside-resistant mutants appeared at a frequency of 3 x 10(-9) to 1 x10(-7) in a population and were unable to compete with wild-type strain B31 after 100 generations. This is the first description of mutations in the B. burgdorferi ribosome that confer resistance to antibiotics. These results have implications for the evolution of antibiotic resistance, because the 16S rRNA mutations conferring spectinomycin resistance have no significant fitness cost in vitro, and for the development of new selectable markers."

In this study, 81 participants with rigorously diagnosed chronic Lyme disease were administered the newest revisions of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) and Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-III), and compared to 39 nonpatients. On the WAIS-III, Lyme disease participants had poorer Full Scale and Performance IQ's. At the subtest level, differences were restricted to Information and the Processing Speed subtests. On the WMS-III, Lyme disease participants performed more poorly on Auditory Immediate, Immediate, Auditory Delayed, Auditory Recognition Delayed, and General Memory indices. Among WMS-III subtests, however, differences were restricted to Logical Memory (immediate and delayed) and Family Pictures (delayed only), a Visual Memory subtest. Discriminant analyses suggest deficits in chronic Lyme are best characterized as a combination of memory difficulty and diminished processing speed. Deficits were modest, between one-third and two-thirds of a standard deviation, consistent with earlier studies. Depression severity had a weak relationship to processing speed, but little other association to test performance. Deficits in chronic Lyme disease are consistent with a subtle neuropathological process affecting multiple performance tasks, although further work is needed to definitively rule out nonspecific illness effects."

Comparisons of the several libraries led to identification of several significantly differentially expressed transcripts. Additionally, over 500 new predicted protein sequences are described, including several novel gene families unique to ticks; no function can be presently ascribed to most of these novel families. Among the housekeeping-associated transcripts, we highlight those enzymes associated with post translation modification of amino acids, particularly those forming sulfotyrosine, hydroxyproline, and carboxyl-glutamic acid. Results support the hypothesis that gene duplication, most possibly including genome duplications, is a major player in tick evolution."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease represents a complex response to Borrelia burgdorferi that involves both bacterial factors as well as host responses. This results in an inflammatory reaction at several sites, including the synovial lining of joints. Synovial tissues of inflamed joints contain cells expressing high levels of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL). Although Fas stimulation is typically associated with cell death, it can also transmit stimulatory signals to certain cell types. Among these are dendritic cells and macrophages, which are abundant in inflamed synovium. To better assess the role of FasL in the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis, we evaluated the response to B. burgdorferi infection in C3H/HeJgld mice that bear a nonfunctional mutation in FasL. Compared to wild-type C3H+/+ mice, C3Hgld mice had a similar bacterial burden and antibody response 2 weeks and 4 weeks following infection, but they manifested a significantly reduced Borrelia-specific cytokine response. In addition, C3Hgld mice developed a greatly reduced incidence and severity of arthritis. The findings document a contribution of FasL to the host inflammatory response to B. burgdorferi."

In the present study, we identified an orthologous thymidylate synthase gene in the relapsing fever (RF) agent Borrelia hermsii, located it in a 180-kb linear plasmid, and demonstrated its expression. The functions of the B. hermsii and B. burgdorferi thyX gene products were evaluated both in vivo, by complementation of a thymidylate synthase-deficient Escherichia coli mutant, and in vitro, by testing their activities after purification. The B. hermsii thyX gene complemented the thyA mutation in E. coli, and purified B. hermsii ThyX protein catalyzed the conversion of dTMP from dUMP. In contrast, the B. burgdorferi ThyX protein had only weakly detectable activity in vitro, and the B. burgdorferi thyX gene did not provide complementation in vivo. The lack of activity of B. burgdorferi's ThyX protein was associated with the substitution of a cysteine for a highly conserved arginine at position 91. The B. hermsii thyX locus was further distinguished by the downstream presence in the plasmid of orthologues of nrdI, nrdE, and nrdF, which encode the subunits of ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase and which are not present in the LB agents B. burgdorferi and Borrelia garinii. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the nrdIEF cluster of B. hermsii was acquired by horizontal gene transfer. These findings indicate that Borrelia spp. causing RF have a greater capability for de novo pyrimidine synthesis than those causing LB, thus providing a basis for some of the biological differences between the two groups of pathogens."

FcRn is a class I-related molecule that prolongs the half-life of serum IgG by preferentially binding IgG at low pH and inhibiting its degradation. Its role in protective immunity to infectious organisms is unknown. We investigated the function of FcRn in the murine model of Lyme arthritis, caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. We infected FcRn(-/-) and wild-type mice with B. burgdorferi and monitored the development of arthritis. Infected FcRn(-/-) mice demonstrated decreased serum levels of anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies and borreliacidal activity. Moreover, these mutant mice developed increased ankle swelling and joint histopathology following infection. Our data suggest that FcRn ameliorates murine Lyme arthritis by preventing the degradation of protective borreliacidal antibodies."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis are tick-borne diseases caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, respectively. Infection with A. phagocytophilum has been observed to induce immunosuppression and animal studies suggest that the bacteria might also have prolonged inhibitory effects on immune cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytokine secretion in patients exposed previously to A. phagocytophilum and currently infected with B. burgdorferi compared with patients infected with B. burgdorferi and seronegative for A. phagocytophilum. Eight patients with erythema migrans and antibodies against A. phagocytophilum, 15 patients with erythema migrans and negative A. phagocytophilum serology and 15 non-exposed healthy individuals were included in the study. Blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with Borrelia-antigen and the number of cytokine [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12, IL-13 and interferon (IFN)-gamma]-secreting cells was detected by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT). This study shows that patients with a previous exposure to A. phagocytophilum and a current infection with B. burgdorferi have a lower number of Borrelia-specific cells secreting IL-12 compared to Ap seronegative patients infected with B. burgdorferi (P < 0.001), indicating impairment in the ability to mount strong Th1-responses. We suggest that this mirrors a reduced Th1 response caused by A. phagocytophilum which could influence the outcome of the Borrelia infection and, speculatively, may also have implications in other conditions."

		"abstract": "The so-called \"forest kindergartens\" have been increasingly popular in Germany since the beginning of the 1990s. These are nurseries located in forested areas where children spend all-season full-time outdoors. Fifty-three kindergartens in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany participated in this study. In a prospective clinical cohort study, the child's personal data, history, protective parental habits concerning tick bites, number of tick bites, and cases of borreliosis were recorded monthly (March-October 2004) using a questionnaire. Altogether, 1,707 children of 25 \"forest kindergartens\" (506 children) and 28 conventional kindergartens (1,201 children) were included. The response rate was 75% in \"forest kindergartens\" and 65% in conventional kindergartens. In the \"forest kindergartens\", 1,503 tick bites especially on the trunk and on the head were found, whereas 502 tick bites were registered in conventional kindergartens. Sixteen cases of borreliosis were diagnosed (10 in \"forest kindergartens\", six in conventional kindergarten), most frequently manifesting as erythema migrans. Children attending a \"forest kindergarten\" have a 2.8 times increased risk of experiencing tick bites and a 4.6 times increased risk of suffering from borreliosis compared to conventional kindergarten in Germany, although protective parental behavior in \"forest kindergarten\" children was significantly better than that in conventional kindergarten."

		"abstract": "The aim of the study is to evaluate in vivo fluorescence imaging of experimental inflammatory joint disease by applying two different near-infrared (NIR) dyes in a model of Borrelia-induced Lyme arthritis. Forty mice, 20 with Lyme arthritis and 20 controls, were examined. Two nonspecific NIR carbocyanine dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and a hydrophilic carbocyanine derivative (1,1'-bis-[4-sulfobutyl] indotricarbocyanine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid diglucamide monosodium salt [SIDAG]), were administered intravenously at two doses. Fluorescence images were acquired before and during 120 seconds after injection of cyanine dyes. For both dyes, the area under the curve (AUC) was determined for the interval between 40 and 80 seconds after injection. In addition, the slope of the signal decrease was compared among animal groups. Results were compared with histological findings. The general temporal fluorescence intensity course for ICG was characterized by a rapid increase, with a peak at 40-50 seconds followed by a decrease; conversely for SIDAG, by a slow increase. AUC analysis for both dyes showed that the fluorescence signal differed significantly between controls and arthritic animals (P < .05). Within these groups, there were significant differences between the two doses investigated. ICG differed significantly between control and arthritic animals in the slope of the signal decrease for both doses investigated (P < .05). Histological examination showed early stages of inflammation in arthritic animals. NIR fluorescence imaging based on the pharmacokinetic behavior of ICG or SIDAG is a promising approach to detect inflammatory joint changes of experimental arthritis. Moreover, SIDAG is suited to differentiate inflammatory and noninflammatory joints 24 hours after dye application."

		"abstract": "Differentiating Lyme meningitis (LM) from other forms of aseptic meningitis (AM) in children is a common diagnostic dilemma in Lyme disease-endemic regions. Prior studies have compared clinical characteristics of patients with LM versus patients with documented enteroviral infections. No large studies have compared patients with LM to all patients presenting with AM and attempted to define a clinical prediction model. To create a statistical model to predict LM versus AM in children based on history, physical, and laboratory findings during the initial presentation of meningitis. Children older than 2 years presenting to the Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children between October 1999 and September 2004 were identified if both Lyme serology and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected during the same hospital encounter. Patients were considered to have Lyme disease only if they met Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (documented erythema migrans and/or positive Lyme serology). Patients were eligible for study inclusion if they had documented meningitis (CSF white blood cell count: >8 per mm3). Retrospective chart review abstracted duration of headache and cranial neuritis (papilledema or cranial nerve palsy) on physical examination and percent CSF mononuclear cells. Using logistic-regression analysis, the type of meningitis (LM versus AM) was simultaneously regressed on these 3 variables. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was performed and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated. A total of 175 children with meningitis were included in the final statistical model. Logistic-regression analysis included 27 patients with LM and 148 patients classified as having AM. Duration of headache, cranial neuritis, and percent CSF mononuclear cells independently predicted LM. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test revealed a good fit for the model, and the Nagelkerke R2 effect size demonstrated good predictive efficacy. Odds ratios based on the logistic-regression results were calculated for these variables. The final model was transformed into a clinical prediction model that allows practitioners to calculate the probability of a child having LM. Longer duration of headache, presence of cranial neuritis, and predominance of CSF mononuclear cells are predictive of LM in children presenting with meningitis in a Lyme disease-endemic region. The clinical prediction model can help guide the clinician about the need for parenteral antibiotics while awaiting serology results."

		"abstract": "Incidence of Lyme disease in the US continues to grow. Low-density development is also increasing in endemic regions, raising questions about the relationship between development pattern and disease. This study sought to model Lyme disease incidence rate using quantitative, practical metrics of regional landscape pattern. The objective was to progress towards the development of design guidelines that may help minimize known threats to human and environmental health. Ecological analysis was used to accommodate the integral landscape variables under study. Case data derived from passive surveillance reports across 12 counties in the US state of Maryland during 1996-2000; 2,137 cases were spatially referenced to residential addresses. Major roads were used to delineate 514 landscape analysis units from 0.002 to 580 km(2). The parameter that explained the most variation in incidence rate was the percentage of land-cover edge represented by the adjacency of forest and herbaceous cover [R(2) = 0.75; rate ratio = 1.34 (1.26-1.43); P < 0.0001]. Also highly significant was the percentage of the landscape in forest cover (cumulative R(2) = 0.82), which exhibited a quadratic relationship with incidence rate. Modelled relationships applied throughout the range of landscape sizes. Results begin to provide quantitative landscape design parameters for reducing casual peridomestic contact with tick and host habitat. The final model suggests that clustered forest and herbaceous cover, as opposed to high forest-herbaceous interspersion, would minimize Lyme disease risk in low-density residential areas. Higher-density development that precludes a large percentage of forest-herbaceous edge would also limit exposure."

Among the host components recognized by this spirochete are fibronectin and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Three surface-localized GAG-binding bacterial ligands, Bgp, DbpA, and DbpB, have been previously identified, but recent studies suggested that at least one additional GAG-binding ligand is expressed on the spirochetal surface when the spirochete is adapted to the mammalian host environment. BBK32 is a surface lipoprotein that is produced during infection and that has been shown to bind to fibronectin. In this study, we show that, when BBK32 was produced from a shuttle vector in an otherwise nonadherent high-passage B. burgdorferi strain, the protein localized on the bacterial surface and conferred attachment to fibronectin and to mammalian cell monolayers. In addition, the high-passage strain producing BBK32 bound to purified preparations of the GAGs dermatan sulfate and heparin, as well as to these GAGs on the surfaces of cultured mammalian cells. Recombinant BBK32 recognized purified heparin, indicating that the bacterial attachment to GAGs was due to direct binding by BBK32. This GAG-binding activity of BBK32 is apparently independent of fibronectin recognition, because exogenous heparin had no effect on BBK32-mediated bacterial binding to fibronectin."

Given the potential role(s) that these differentially up-regulated proteins may play in B. burgdorferi transmission and Lyme disease pathogenesis, much attention has recently been placed on identifying additional borrelial outer surface proteins. To identify uncharacterized B. burgdorferi outer surface proteins, we previously performed a comprehensive gene expression profiling analysis of temperature-shifted and mammalian host-adapted B. burgdorferi. The combined microarray analyses revealed that many genes encoding known and putative outer surface proteins are down-regulated in mammalian host-adapted B. burgdorferi. At the same time, however, several different genes encoding putative outer surface proteins were found to be up-regulated during the transmission and infection process. Among the putative outer surface proteins identified, biochemical and surface localization analyses confirmed that seven (Bb0405, Bb0689, BbA36, BbA64, BbA66, BbA69, and BbI42) are localized to the surface of B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis using serum from tick-infested baboons indicated that all seven outer surface proteins identified are immunogenic and that antibodies are generated against all seven during a natural infection. Specific antibodies generated against all seven of these surface proteins were found to be bactericidal against B. burgdorferi, indicating that these newly identified outer surface proteins are prime candidates for analysis as second-generation Lyme disease vaccinogens."

In this article we describe the underlying disease, clinical presentation and clinical course in six children with a sudden onset of paraarticular soft tissue masses or non-specific chronic pain. Ultrasound was the initial imaging method used in all cases; this was supplemented by MRI in three patients. Four children were diagnosed to be suffering from juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), one child from Lyme Arthritis, whereas in one child no underlying disease was identified. Well-demarcated hypoechogenic lesions without signs of perfusion extending from the shoulder (two patients), elbow (one patient), hip (one patient), knee (1) or ankle (one patient) far into the adjacent musculature were detected on ultrasonography. A direct connection to the joint was demonstrated in all cases. All synovial cysts in the five arthritic patients resolved rapidly with medical treatment for arthritis, whereas the cyst persisted in the non-JIA patient. Uncommon synovial cysts occur in particular as a complication of arthritis. Ultrasonography is the initial and follow-up imaging method of choice, which can be supplemented by MRI in unusual cases. Apart from treatment for arthritis, no specific therapeutic interventions were required in the present cases."

		"abstract": "Various infectious agents are associated with atherosclerosis. This analysis was performed to investigate relation between seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG and carotid atherosclerosis. The cross-sectional Study of Health in Pomerania was conducted in a general community living in a region with endemic Lyme disease. A random sample of 2483 individuals aged 45-79 years was available for the present analysis. Carotid atherosclerosis was sonographically assessed as intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery and as prevalent atherosclerotic plaques in the extracranial carotid arteries. IgG antibodies to Borrelia were determined by ELISA. IgG antibodies to Borrelia were found positive (> 10 IU/mL) in 108 subjects (4.3%). Persons with and without positive anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies differed with respect to carotid intima-media thickness values (0.863 +/- 0.017 mm versus 0.792 +/- 0.004 mm; p < 0.001) and prevalent carotid plaques (odds ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.53-4.61; p = 0.001), respectively. Seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG was also associated with both atherosclerotic endpoints when age, sex and further atherogenic risk factors and confounders were included in multivariable statistical models. In a region with endemic Lyme disease, seropositivity for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies is independently associated with atherosclerosis. Our findings add support to the hypothesis that exposure to infectious pathogens increases the atherosclerosis risk."

However, the latter might be absent in early stages of the disease. Now a recently discovered additional CSF marker-the cytokine CXCL13-was found to be positive in every initial CSF sample from patients with NB and therefore could be a valuable tool for early diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy. We report an unusual case of NB in a patient with a history of metastatic carcinoma of the prostate and unilateral polyradiculitis. While no intrathecal B.b.-specific antibody production could be demonstrated initially, the CSF CXCL13 level was high (>500 ng/g vs <1.7 ng/g in healthy controls). During the course of the disease, the antibody index turned positive (4.8) and the patient responded to antibiotic therapy, thus confirming the diagnosis. In this case, measuring CXCL13 in the CSF would have led to earlier diagnosis and treatment of NB."

		"abstract": "The interaction of resident tissue cells with migratory inflammatory cells is essential for the recruitment of immune effector cells to inflammatory sites. The sustained expression of adhesion molecules in the synovium of patients with chronic Lyme arthritis seems to contribute to this chronic inflammation. Whether cell adhesion molecules influence the early steps of Borreliosis is unclear. Therefore, we examined the expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1 and NCAM-1 in synovial cells exposed to two different Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains Geho and B31. The mRNA expression of ICAM-1, ICAM-2, VCAM-1 and NCAM-1 was not changed in synovial cells exposed to B31. Whereas ICAM-2 and VCAM-1 was upregulated, NCAM-1 mRNA was downregulated and ICAM-1 mRNA was unchanged by strain Geho. The ICAM-1 protein expression on the synovial cell surface was downregulated by both strains. Differential regulation of adhesion molecule mRNA, and subsequent high turnover or elevated shedding from the cell membrane may contribute to early pathogenesis in Lyme arthritis."

Vaccination of mice with outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi has been shown to both protect mice against B. burgdorferi infection and reduce carriage of the organism in feeding ticks. Here we report the development of a murine-targeted OspA vaccine utilizing Vaccinia virus to interrupt transmission of disease in the reservoir hosts, thus reducing incidence of human disease. Oral vaccination of mice with a single dose of Vaccinia expressing OspA resulted in high antibody titers to OspA, 100% protection of vaccinated mice from infection with B. burgdorferi, and significant clearance of B. burgdorferi from infected ticks fed on vaccinated animals. The results indicate the vaccine is effective and may provide a manner to reduce incidence of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "There is growing appreciation that resident brain cells can initiate and/or regulate inflammation after trauma or infection in the central nervous system (CNS). Recent studies from our laboratory have begun to shed light on the mechanisms by which astrocytes perceive bacterial challenges by demonstrating the functional expression of Toll-like receptors (TLR) in this cell type. In the present study, we demonstrate that astrocytes also express members of the novel nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) family of proteins that can serve as cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. We show that isolated cultures of murine astrocytes constitutively express robust levels of NOD2, a molecule that can recognize a minimal peptidoglycan motif. Expression of NOD2 is significantly upregulated after exposure to two disparate and clinically relevant bacterial pathogens of the CNS, Borrelia burgdorferi and Neisseria meningitidis. Similarly, NOD2 protein expression is elevated after exposure to specific bacterial ligands for TLRs. Importantly, we show that astrocytes express Rip2 kinase, an essential downstream effector molecule for NOD-mediated cell responses, and demonstrate that this expression is upregulated after bacterial challenge. Furthermore, we confirm the functional nature of NOD2 in astrocytes by demonstrating that a specific ligand for this receptor induces significant inflammatory cytokine production and augments immune responses induced by TLR ligation. Taken together, the present demonstration that astrocytes express functional NOD2 proteins may represent a potentially important mechanism by which this glial cell type initiates either protective host responses within the brain or the progression of damaging CNS inflammation."

		"abstract": "We used an Ixodes scapularis population model to investigate potential northward spread of the tick associated with climate change. Annual degree-days >0 degrees C limits for I. scapularis establishment, obtained from tick population model simulations, were mapped using temperatures projected for the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s by two Global Climate Models (the Canadian CGCM2 and the UK HadCM3) for two greenhouse gas emission scenario enforcings 'A2'and 'B2' of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Under scenario 'A2' using either climate model, the theoretical range for I. scapularis establishment moved northwards by approximately 200 km by the 2020s and 1000 km by the 2080s. Reductions in emissions (scenario 'B2') had little effect on projected range expansion up to the 2050s, but the range expansion projected to occur between the 2050s and 2080s was less than that under scenario 'A2'. When the tick population model was driven by projected annual temperature cycles (obtained using CGCM2 under scenario 'A2'), tick abundance almost doubled by the 2020s at the current northern limit of I. scapularis, suggesting that the threshold numbers of immigrating ticks needed to establish new populations will fall during the coming decades. The projected degrees of theoretical range expansion and increased tick survival by the 2020s, suggest that actual range expansion of I. scapularis may be detectable within the next two decades. Seasonal tick activity under climate change scenarios was consistent with maintenance of endemic cycles of the Lyme disease agent in newly established tick populations. The geographic range of I. scapularis-borne zoonoses may, therefore, expand significantly northwards as a consequence of climate change this century."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, a potentially debilitating human disease for which no vaccine is currently available. We developed an oral bait delivery system for an anti-B. burgdorferi vaccine based in OspA. Mice were immunized orally via gavage and bait feeding. Challenge was performed via Ixodes scapularis field nymphs carrying multiple B. burgdorferi strains. Vaccination protected 89% of the mice and the systemic immune response was skewed toward IgG2a/2b production. Moreover, this oral vaccine reduced the pathogen in the tick vector by eight-fold. We conclude that this oral vaccine induces a protective systemic immune response against a variety of infectious B. burgdorferi strains found in nature and therefore it can eliminate this zoonotic pathogen from its major host reservoirs. Because we observed elimination of the spirochete from the tick vector, a broad delivery of this oral vaccine to wildlife reservoirs is likely to disrupt the transmission cycle of this pathogen."
