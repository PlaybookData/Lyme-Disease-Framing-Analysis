		"abstract": "Multiple different recombinant and peptide antigens are now available for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (LD), but optimizing test utilization remains challenging. Since 1995 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended a 2-tiered serologic approach consisting of a first-tier whole-cell enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for polyvalent antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi followed by confirmation of positive or equivocal results by IgG and IgM immunoblots [standard 2-tiered (STT) approach]. Newer modified 2-tiered (MTT) approaches employ a second-tier EIA to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi rather than immunoblotting. We applied modern bioinformatic techniques to a large public database of recombinant and peptide antigen-based immunoassays to improve testing strategy. A retrospective CDC collection of 280 LD samples and 559 controls had been tested using the STT approach as well as kinetic-EIAs for VlsE1-IgG, C6-IgG, VlsE1-IgM, and pepC10-IgM antibodies. When used individually, the cutoff for each kinetic-EIA was set to generate 99% specificity. Utilizing logistic-likelihood regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) techniques we determined that VlsE1-IgG, C6-IgG, and pepC10-IgM antibodies each contributed significant diagnostic information; a single-tier diagnostic score (DS) was generated for each sample using a weighted linear combination of antibody levels to these 3 antigens. DS performance was then compared to the STT and to MTT models employing different combinations of kinetic-EIAs. After setting the DS cutoff to match STT specificity (99%), the DS was 22.5% more sensitive than the STT for early-acute-phase disease (95% CI: 11.8% to 32.2%), 16.0% more sensitive for early-convalescent-phase disease (95% CI: 7.2% to 24.7%), and equivalent for detection of disseminated infection. The DS was also significantly more sensitive for early-acute-phase LD than MTT models whose specificity met or exceeded 99%. Prospective validation of this single-tier diagnostic score for Lyme disease will require larger studies using a broader range of potential cross-reacting conditions."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused primarily by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States. Treatment of rodent pathogen reservoirs with an oral acaricide may suppress the production of infected host-seeking ticks posing a risk for human infection. A previous study showed that an oral fipronil bait effectively controlled larval Ixodes scapularis ticks on white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) up to 15 days post-bait exposure. The present study expands upon this finding by exposing group-housed white-footed mice to fipronil bait under simulated field conditions prior to tick infestation. Mice (n = 80) were housed in groups of 10 within large enclosures and offered a choice between fipronil bait within a commercial bait station and an alternative diet. The mice were assigned to two treatment groups and two control groups to undergo bait exposure durations of either 24 h (reduced) or 168 h (extended). Groups were further differentiated by the time point post-bait exposure when larval ticks were applied to mice within feeding capsules (reduced day 1, day 15; extended day 21, day 35). For 4 days post-tick introduction, attached larvae were observed by microscopy and replete larvae were recovered. Replete larvae were monitored for molting success. Plasma was collected from all treatment group mice to obtain fipronil plasma concentrations (CP). The fipronil bait (0.005% fipronil) was palatable and controlled larval ticks on white-footed mice when presented under simulated field conditions. Efficacy in preventing attached larvae from feeding to repletion was 100% (day 1), 89.0% (day 15), 85.8% (day 21), and 75.2% (day 35). When also considering molting success, the fipronil bait prevented 100% (day 1), 91.1% (day 15), 91.7% (day 21), and 82.5% (day 35) of larvae attaching to mice from molting. The mean CP per mouse was 191.5 ng/ml (day 1), 29.4 ng/ml (day 15), 10.6 ng/ml (day 21), and 1.0 ng/ml (day 35). The results suggest that fipronil bait will be consumed by white-footed mice in the presence of an alternative diet, and effectively control larval ticks on treated mice. A field trial is needed to confirm the results of this study. Low-dose fipronil bait may provide a cost-effective means of controlling blacklegged ticks to be integrated into tick management programs."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (also known as Lyme borreliosis) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with an estimated 476,000 cases per year. While historically, the long-term impact of Lyme disease on patients has been controversial, mounting evidence supports the idea that a substantial number of patients experience persistent symptoms following treatment. The research community has largely lacked the necessary funding to properly advance the scientific and clinical understanding of the disease, or to develop and evaluate innovative approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Given the many outstanding questions raised into the diagnosis, clinical presentation and treatment of Lyme disease, and the underlying molecular mechanisms that trigger persistent disease, there is an urgent need for more support. This review article summarizes progress over the past 5 years in our understanding of Lyme and tick-borne diseases in the United States and highlights remaining challenges."

Typical management for Lyme arthritis entails antibiotic therapy, while septic arthritis usually warrants operative debridement. During the period when Western Pennsylvania transitioned to a Lyme-endemic region, many children underwent operative intervention who were ultimately diagnosed with Lyme arthritis due to diagnostic ambiguity. We examined the impact of the operative intervention on pediatric Lyme arthritis outcomes. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients admitted to a tertiary care children's hospital who were diagnosed with Lyme arthritis from 2008 to 2018 using chart review. Inclusion criteria were positive Lyme serology by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition, clinical arthritis, and negative bacterial cultures. We recorded clinical presentation, laboratory data, details of hospitalization, costs, and outcomes after therapy to compare the impact of antibiotics alone (nonoperative group) versus antibiotics plus operative debridement (operative group). A total of 149 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 47 (32%) patients underwent orthopaedic intervention. Operative management was associated with increased length (3.17 vs. 1.40 d) and cost ($27,850 vs. $10,716) of admission. The clinical resolution was documented in 57/58 patients (98%) in the nonoperative group and 41/42 patients (98%) in the operative group. The median duration to resolution was 21 days for both groups. Operative management of pediatric patients with Lyme arthritis is associated with increased resource utilization and costs while being similarly efficacious to nonoperative management. As the US Lyme epidemic expands, improved diagnosis and management of acute undifferentiated arthritis may prevent unneeded operative intervention. Level III-retrospective cohort study."

		"abstract": "Dear Editor, Primary cutaneous diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leg-type (PCDLBCL-LT) is a rare and aggressive neoplasm. A timely diagnosis may prevent fatal outcomes; physicians should take this entity into consideration when assessing non-specific lesions on the lower limbs. We present a 69-year-old woman with a 1-month history of a firm plaque on her left leg. Physical examination revealed an asymptomatic, indurated, smooth, and erythematous plaque on the pretibial region of her left extremity (Figure 1, a). The rest of the physical examination was normal. Histological examination revealed cohesive sheets of a dense cell infiltrate in the dermis, composed of large round immunoblast-type cells with prominent nucleoli, and the presence of mitoses. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for CD20, Bcl2, and MUM1 (Figure 1, b-d). Additionally, c-MYC and Ki67 exhibited a 20% positivity; CD3 and CD10 were negative. The diagnosis of PCDLBCL-LT was established. Imaging and blood workup ruled out systemic involvement. Treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy was initiated, with complete tumor regression by the third cycle. The patient completed 6 cycles and has remained disease-free after 18 months. Primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas (CBCL) are lymphoproliferative disorders that appear on the skin without evidence of extracutaneous manifestations at the time of diagnosis (1). They represent 25 to 35% of all primary cutaneous lymphomas (2). In 2018, an updated version of the 2008 WHO-EORTC classification divided CBCLs into 5 subtypes: PCDLBCL-LT, primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (PCMZL), primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma (PCFCL), Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (EBVMCU), and intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (3). PCDLBCL-LT is the least common subtype, representing approximately 10% of all CBCLs and only 4% of all cutaneous lymphomas (2,3). Although the pathogenesis for most CBCLs is still unknown, positive serology for Lyme disease in a significant number of patients has been recognized as a probable etiologic association (4). PCDLBCL-LT is more frequent in women, and the mean age of presentation is 76 years. It usually presents as erythematous or bluish nodules, and up to 75% of the cases appears on one or both legs (1). Although infrequent, other locations have been reported, including the head, neck, trunk, and upper extremities (5). Workup should include a complete physical exam, skin biopsy, blood tests, and imaging (2,3). Histopathology shows a diffuse infiltrate in the dermis composed of large B-cells (centroblasts and/or immunoblasts) with extension to subcutaneous cellular tissue. These cells have round nuclei that are more than twice the size of normal lymphocytes, with prominent nucleoli. The immunophenotype of PCDLBCL-LT is CD20+, CD79a+, CD10-, and Bcl-6+/-, and strongly expresses Bcl-2, MUM1/IRF4, and FOX-P1 (1-3). Unlike the other indolent subtypes, PCDLBCL-LT is generally more aggressive with a poor prognosis. The 5-year disease survival rate is of approximately 50% (5). Management depends on the body surface area, location, and the patient's age and general health. To date, chemotherapy with R-CHOP remains the first line of therapy for PCDLBCL-LT, resulting in complete remission in up to 92% of cases (2). The prognostic characteristics of most PCDLBCL-LTs require timely and appropriate diagnosis and treatment."

		"abstract": "The detection of IgG/IgM antibodies is a crucial tool for the diagnosis of infectious diseases as they give specific information such as the stage of infection or when it approximately occurred. In this work, a linear cryogel array (LCA) technology is described for the detection of IgG and IgM antibodies, indicative of a borreliosis infection in human sera. The LCA consists of a transparent capillary filled with functionalized cryogel compartments. For the generation of these cryogel arrays, solutions containing a photo-copolymer and the appropriate antigens are sucked into a surface-modified glass capillary. The solution compartments are separated from each other through air pockets. After freezing the solutions, a photo-induced cross-linking process is performed, through which the solutions are transformed into cryogel compartments, covalently attached to the capillary walls. We show that the LCA technology allows the simultaneous detection of IgG and IgM antibodies via a sandwich immunoassay in sera from Borrelia-infected patients within 1 h for sample sizes of only 12 μL. A study with sera from 42 patients conducted with the LCAs and referenced - depending on the source of the sera - to a commercial line immunoassay and a chemiluminescent immunoassay, which are currently widely used for Lyme disease screening, demonstrates the diagnostic potential of the approach."

		"abstract": "Seldom in history does one get a 'front row seat'-with large-scale dynamic data-on how online news media narratives shift with a global pandemic. News media narratives matter because they shape societal perceptions and influence the core tent poles of our society, from the economy to elections. Given its importance-and with the benefit of hindsight-we provide a systematic framework to analyze news narratives of Covid-19, laying the groundwork to evaluate policy and risk communications. We leverage a 10-billion-word-database of online news, taken from over 7,000 English newspapers and magazines across 20 countries, culminating in 28 million articles. First, we track the volume of Covid-19 conversations across 20 countries from before to during the pandemic (Oct'19 to May'20). Second, we distill the phases of global pandemic narratives, and elucidate regional differences. To track the volume of Covid-19 narratives, we identified 10 target terms-Coronavirus, Covid-19, Covid, nCoV, SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan Virus, Virus, Disease, Epidemic, Pandemic-and tracked their combined monthly prevalence across eight months from October 2019 through May 2020. Globally, across 20 countries, we identified 18,042,855 descriptors of the target terms. Further, these descriptors were analysed with natural language processing models to generate the top five topics of Covid-19 that were labelled by two independent researchers. This process was repeated across six continents to distil regional topics. Our model found four phases of online news media narratives: Pre-pandemic, Early, Peak and Recovery. Pre-pandemic narratives (Oct'19-Dec'19) were divergent across regions with Africa focused on monkeypox, Asia on dengue fever, and North America on Lyme disease and AIDS. Early (Jan-Feb'20) and Peak Pandemic (Mar-May'20) evidenced a global convergence, reflecting the omnipresence of Covid-19. The brief transition from early to peak pandemic narratives underscored the pandemic's rapid spread. Emerging from the embers of the pandemic's peak were nascent recovery words that are regionally divergent-Oceania focused on hope and an uncertain future while North America centered on re-opening the economy and tackling discrimination. Practically, we presented a media barometer of Covid-19, and provided a framework to analyse the pandemic's impact on societal perceptions-laying the important groundwork for policy makers to evaluate policy communications, and design risk communication strategies."

		"abstract": "Primary care and frontline healthcare providers are often the first point of contact for patients experiencing tick-borne disease (TBD) but face challenges when recognizing and diagnosing these diseases. The specific aim of this study was to gain a qualitative understanding of frontline and primary care providers' knowledge and practices for identifying TBDs in patients. From fall 2018 to spring 2019, three focus groups were conducted with primary care providers practicing in a small-town community endemic to Lyme disease (LD) and with emerging incidence of additional TBDs. A follow up online survey was distributed to urgent and emergency care providers in the small-town community and an academic medical center within the referral network of the local clinical community in spring and summer 2019. Qualitative analysis of focus group data was performed following a grounded theory approach and survey responses were analyzed through the calculation of descriptive statistics. Fourteen clinicians from three primary care practices participated in focus groups, and 24 urgent and emergency care clinicians completed the survey questionnaire. Four overarching themes emerged from focus group data which were corroborated by survey data. Themes highlighted a moderate level of awareness on diagnosis and treatment of LD among participants and limited knowledge of diagnosis and treatment for two other regionally relevant TBDs, anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Providers described challenges and frustrations in counseling patients with strong preconceptions of LD diagnosis and treatment in the context of chronic infection. Providers desired additional point-of-care resources to facilitate patient education and correct misinformation on the diagnosis and treatment of TBDs. Through this small study, it appears that clinicians in the small-town and academic medical center settings are experiencing uncertainties related to TBD recognition, diagnosis, and patient communication. These findings can inform the development of point-of-care resources to aid in patient-provider communication regarding TBDs and inform the development of continuing medical education programs for frontline and primary care providers."

Single-centre retrospective case analysis of patients referred to the Infectious Diseases Unit at Austin Health - a tertiary health service in Heidelberg, Australia - between 2014 and 2020 for investigation and treatment of suspected Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks. Patients were included if they had debilitating symptoms suggested by either themselves or the referring clinician as being attributed to ticks. Twenty-nine Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks cases were included in the analysis. Other than Lyme disease (83%), the most common prior medical diagnoses were Epstein-Barr virus (38%), chronic fatigue syndrome (28%) and fibromyalgia (24%). Prior histories of anxiety (48%) and depression (41%) were common. The most frequently reported symptoms included fatigue (83%), headache (72%) and arthralgia (69%). National Association of Testing Authorities/Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia-accredited serology was not diagnostic of acute infective causes, including Lyme disease, in any patient. Of 25 cases with available data, 23 (92%) had previously been prescribed antimicrobials, with 53% reporting benefit from them. The most common diagnoses made by our hospital were chronic fatigue syndrome (31%), migraines (28%) and fibromyalgia (21%). Only one patient's symptoms were not accounted for by other diagnoses. This is the first case series of patients with Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks. They had high rates of other medically unexplained syndromes, and no evidence of acute Lyme disease, or any common organic disease process. Debilitating Symptom Complexes Attributed to Ticks remains medically unexplained, and may therefore be due to an as yet unidentified cause, or may be considered a medically unexplained syndrome similar to conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, which is the most common tick-borne human disease in Europe and North America. Currently, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on serological tests allowing indirect detection of anti-Borrelia antibodies produced by patients. Their main drawback is a lack of sensitivity in the early phase of disease and an incapacity to prove an active infection. Direct diagnostic tests are clearly needed. The objectives of this study were to produce tools allowing sensitive detection of potential circulating Borrelia antigens and to evaluate them in a mouse model. We focused on two potential early bacterial makers, the highly variable OspC protein and the conserved protein FlaB. High-affinity monoclonal antibodies were produced and used to establish various immunoassays and western blot detection. A very good limit of detection for OspC as low as 17 pg/mL of sample was achieved with SPIE-IA. In infected mice, we were able to measure OspC in plasma with a mean value of 10 ng/mL at 7 days post-inoculation. This result suggests that OspC could be a good blood marker for diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis and that the tools developed during this study could be very useful."

Informatics methods are needed to uncover seasonally varying infectious diseases that may be responsible for the increased birth month-dependent disease risk observed. We have developed a method to link seasonal infectious disease data from the USA to birth month dependent disease data from humans and canines. We also include seasonal air pollution and climate data to determine the seasonal factors most likely involved in the response. We test our method with osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer. We found the Lyme disease incidence was the most strongly correlated significant factor in explaining the birth month-osteosarcoma disease pattern (R=0.418, p=2.80X10-23), and this was true across all populations observed: canines, pediatric, and adult populations."

Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (B. burgdorferi s.l.)-the primary agent of Lyme borreliosis (LB)-is a quintessential member of this poorly understood phylum and the leading cause of tick-borne illness throughout most of the northern hemisphere. Despite its importance in human health, we lack a fundamental understanding of how B. burgdorferi s.l. is able to accomplish basic physiological tasks, such as DNA replication/segregation, and cell elongation or division. Recent advances in molecular tools to probe these essential cellular processes are great strides forward but require genetic manipulation. The latter is important since not all agents of LB are genetically tractable. Here, we describe a single method that is capable of fluorescently labeling B. burgdorferi s.l. proteins in different sub-cellular compartments. A comparative analysis of six different methods indicates that our optimized procedure outperforms all others and is the first to localize a cytoplasmic protein in B. burgdorferi s.l. by immunofluorescence. We contend that this strategy could be easily adapted to study the localization of any protein, in many Borrelia genospecies, information that will yield functional insights into the complex biology of this fascinating group of bacteria. In addition, it may provide new avenues of research in both in situ studies and in Lyme diagnostics."

In Florida, the primary competent mammalian host of Lyme disease is not present but instead has other small mammals and herpetofauna that I. scapularis can utilize. We investigated host-tick association for lizards, the abundance of ticks on lizards and the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl). To determine which lizard species I. scapularis associates with, we examined 11 native lizard species from historical herpetological specimens. We found that (294/5828) of the specimens had attached ticks. The most infested species were Plestiodon skinks (241/1228) and Ophisaurus glass lizards (25/572). These species were then targeted at six field sites across Florida and sampled from June to September 2020, using drift fence arrays, cover boards and fishing. We captured 125 lizards and collected 233 immature I. scapularis. DNA was extracted from ticks and lizard tissue samples, followed by PCR testing for Borrelia spp. Of the captured lizards, 69/125 were infested with immature I. scapularis. We did not detect Borrelia spp. from tick or lizard tissue samples. Overall, we found that lizards are commonly infested with I. scapularis. However, we did not detect Borrelia burgdorferi sl. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that lizards are poor reservoir species."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases emerge from increased interactions between humans, other animals, and infected ticks. The risk of acquiring a tick-borne infection varies across space and time, so knowledge of the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens in ticks can facilitate disease diagnosis in a specific area and the implementation of mitigation measures and awareness campaigns. Here we identify the occurrence and prevalence of several pathogens in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Wester Ross, Northwest Scotland, a region of high tourism and tick exposure, yet data-poor in terms of tick-borne pathogens. Questing I. ricinus nymphs (n = 2828) were collected from 26 sites in 2018 and 2019 and tested for the presence of tick-borne pathogens using PCR-based methods. Prevalence was compared with other regions of Scotland, England, Wales, and the Netherlands. Anaplasma phagocytophilum (4.7% prevalence), Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) (2.2%), Babesia from clade X (0.2%), Rickettsia helvetica (0.04%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (0.4%) were detected, but no Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi, or Babesia microti. Typing of A. phagocytophilum using a fragment of the GroEL gene identified the presence of both ecotype I and ecotype II. Genospecies identification of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. revealed B. afzelii (53% of infected nymphs), B. garinii (9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (7%), and B. valaisiana (31%). We found similar prevalence of A. phagocytophilum in Wester Ross as in the Netherlands, but higher than in other parts of Great Britain. We found lower B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence than in England or the Netherlands, and similar to some other Scottish studies. We found higher prevalence of B. valaisiana and lower prevalence of B. garinii than in other Scottish studies. We found S. ixodetis at much lower prevalence than in the Netherlands, and R. helvetica at much lower prevalence than in England and the Netherlands. As far as we know, this is the first description of S. ixodetis in Great Britain. The results are relevant for disease surveillance and management for public and veterinary health. The findings can also aid in designing targeted public health campaigns and in raising awareness among outdoor recreationists and professionals."

		"abstract": "Neoehrlichia mikurensis is an intracellular bacterium transmitted in Europe and Asia by ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. Interest in this bacterium has increased since it was demonstrated to be responsible for febrile syndromes in patients. To date, most clinical cases have been reported in northern Europe, but case series have also been described in central Europe and China. Notably, thrombotic events occurred during the course of the disease. We investigated the presence of N. mikurensis in 10,885 I. ricinus nymphs in two regions of France (Alsace and Brittany) collected between 2013 and 2020 and in 934 patients suspected of human granulocytic anaplasmosis in Alsace, an endemic area for Lyme borreliosis, using a specific PCR assay. N. mikurensis was detected in 5.42% of the ticks from Alsace, whereas only one (0.03%) tick was found to be positive in Brittany. Spatiotemporal disparities were also noticed within the Alsace region over the four collection sites investigated, and a significant increase in the prevalence of nymphs carrying N. mikurensis was also observed in the last three years of collection. Four out of 934 screened patients were found to be positive for N. mikurensis. Two had malignancies, and the other two were apparently immunocompetent. Superficial thrombosis was noticed in one patient, and long-lasting bacteremia was noted in another patient. These four patients are the first clinical cases of neoehrlichiosis described in France. We suggest including N. mikurensis in the differential diagnosis of post-tick bite febrile syndromes to treat patients and prevent the occurrence of thrombotic complications."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most reported tick-borne illness in North America. Lyme carditis (LC) is an early-disseminated manifestation of Lyme disease, most commonly presenting as symptomatic high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB) which resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy. However, long-term outcomes of treated LC have not previously been described. We present a series of 7 patients (median 28 years, 6 male) with serologically confirmed LC treated with a standard protocol developed at our center including antibiotics and pre-discharge stress test to assess AV node stability. At a mean follow-up of 20.8 months, all patients were asymptomatic, had resumed normal activities, and were free of conduction abnormalities. None required permanent pacing. Our study supports avoidance of permanent pacing for LC if conduction is stable at discharge."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi relies on uptake of essential nutrients from its host environments for survival and infection. Therefore, nutrient acquisition mechanisms constitute key virulence properties of the pathogen, yet these mechanisms remain largely unknown. In vivo expression technology applied to B. burgdorferi (BbIVET) during mammalian infection identified gene bb0562, which encodes a hypothetical protein comprised of a conserved domain of unknown function, DUF3996. DUF3996 is also found across adjacent encoded hypothetical proteins BB0563 and BB0564, suggesting the possibility that the three proteins could be functionally related. Deletion of bb0562, bb0563 and bb0564 individually and together demonstrated that bb0562 alone was important for optimal disseminated infection in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice by needle inoculation and tick bite transmission. Moreover, bb0562 promoted spirochete survival during the blood dissemination phase of infection. Gene bb0562 was also found to be important for spirochete growth in low serum media and the growth defect of Δbb0562 B. burgdorferi was rescued with the addition of various long chain fatty acids, particularly oleic acid. In mammals, fatty acids are primarily stored in fat droplets in the form of triglycerides. Strikingly, addition of glyceryl trioleate, the triglyceride form of oleic acid, to the low serum media did not rescue the growth defect of the mutant, suggesting bb0562 may be important for the release of fatty acids from triglycerides. Therefore, we searched for and identified two canonical GXSXG lipase motifs within BB0562, despite the lack of homology to known bacterial lipases. Purified BB0562 demonstrated lipolytic activity dependent on the catalytic serine residues within the two motifs. In sum, we have established that bb0562 is a novel nutritional virulence determinant, encoding a lipase that contributes to fatty acid scavenge for spirochete survival in environments deficient in free fatty acids including the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "Community science is increasingly utilized to track important vectors of companion animal disease, providing a scalable, cost-effective strategy for identifying new foci, changing phenology, and disease prevalence across wide geographies. We examined photographs of ticks found attached to predominately dogs and cats reported to a photograph-based tick surveillance program to identify potential areas for improvements in tick prevention education and risk intervention. We compared estimated days of tick attachment using a Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance, and a Pearson's chi-square analysis of variance on the number of submissions by host type submitted for each season. The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) was the most common species reported (39.8%). Tick photographs submitted were almost entirely adults (89.5%), and ticks found on companion animals exhibited an estimated median engorgement time of 2.5 days. Ixodes scapularis displayed the highest median engorgement of the top tick species found feeding on companion animals (χ2  = 98.96, p < 0.001). Ticks were spotted year-round; during spring and summer, ticks collected from pets represented 15.4 and 12.8% of all submissions, but increased to 28.5 and 35.2% during autumn and winter, respectively. Crowdsourced data reveal that mostly adult ticks are detected on pets, and they are found at a point in the blood-feeding process that puts pets at heightened risk for disease transmission. The increase in proportion of ticks found on pets during colder months may reveal a critical knowledge gap amongst pet owners regarding seasonal activity of I. scapularis, a vector of Lyme disease, providing an opportunity for prevention-education."

		"abstract": "Natural populations of pathogens and their hosts are engaged in an arms race in which the pathogens diversify to escape host immunity while the hosts evolve novel immunity. This co-evolutionary process poses a fundamental challenge to the development of broadly effective vaccines and diagnostics against a diversifying pathogen. Based on surveys of natural allele frequencies and experimental immunization of mice, we show high antigenic specificities of natural variants of the outer surface protein C (OspC), a dominant antigen of a Lyme Disease-causing bacterium (Borrelia burgdorferi). To overcome the challenge of OspC antigenic diversity to clinical development of preventive measures, we implemented a number of evolution-informed strategies to broaden OspC antigenic reactivity. In particular, the centroid algorithm-a genetic algorithm to generate sequences that minimize amino-acid differences with natural variants-generated synthetic OspC analogs with the greatest promise as diagnostic and vaccine candidates against diverse Lyme pathogen strains co-existing in the Northeast United States. Mechanistically, we propose a model of maximum antigen diversification (MAD) mediated by amino-acid variations distributed across the hypervariable regions on the OspC molecule. Under the MAD hypothesis, evolutionary centroids display broad cross-reactivity by occupying the central void in the antigenic space excavated by diversifying natural variants. In contrast to vaccine designs based on concatenated epitopes, the evolutionary algorithms generate analogs of natural antigens and are automated. The novel centroid algorithm and the evolutionary antigen designs based on consensus and ancestral sequences have broad implications for combating diversifying pathogens driven by pathogen-host co-evolution."

It is primarily transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex, similarly to borreliae causing Lyme borreliosis. Small rodents can serve as reservoir hosts. It is widespread in mild climate areas of the northern hemisphere, with constant low prevalence in ticks, in the range of units of percent. To date more than 200 human cases have been described including five cases of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients. Clinical features of illness are non-specific, characterized by fever, fatigue, chills, headaches, muscles and joint pains. It can be treated with antibiotics. The diagnostic approach includes mainly PCR and serological methods. This review summarizes current knowledge on B. miyamotoi with an emphasis on taxonomy, ecology of vectors and reservoir hosts, geographical distribution, diagnosis and treatment of the disease. The review also highlights the need for an accurate determination of the etiology of the disease and its differentiation from Lyme borreliosis and human granulocytic anaplasmosis."

The purpose of this case report of a 25-year-old woman presenting to the Departments of Orthodontics and Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery with extensive symptoms of temporomandibular disorder is to illustrate the delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease which was only made after extensive therapy of the temporomandibular joint. The specialist literature only reports a few cases of patients suffering from Lyme disease with TMJ manifestations. This case report and the relevant literature review aim to emphasize the importance of accurate request of medical history and differential diagnosis of acute TMJ arthritis and arthralgia. Early interdisciplinary diagnosis of Lyme disease and early antibiotic therapy are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary, sometimes invasive, therapies."

		"abstract": "As tick-borne disease incidence increases and pathogens expand into new areas, the need for effective tick management strategies is paramount. In this 5-yr study (2014-2018) conducted in south central Wisconsin, we assessed whether an integrated tick management approach, deployed during peak tick activity (May-August), was more effective at reducing black-legged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say (Ixodida: Ixodidae)), than individual interventions. Using a factorial design, invasive vegetation removal (Amur honeysuckle, Lonicera maackii Ruprecht (Dipsacales: Caprifoliaceae) and common buckthorn, Rhamnus cathartica Linnaeus (Rosales: Rhamnaceae)) was coupled with deployments of permethrin-treated cotton nesting materials (tick tubes) that target the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque (Rodentia: Cricetidae)). Results show that the probability of encountering a larval tick by drag sampling was unaffected by treatments at the cumulative 5-yr level. However, vegetation removal significantly reduced larval encounters in 2014, 2015, and 2018, by 33%, 57%, and 61% respectively, and reduced the density of questing nymphal (DON) ticks by 45% in 2015 compared to controls. Despite the limited effect on DON, vegetation removal significantly reduced the cumulative 5-yr density of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto infected nymphs (DIN) (70%) compared to controls as a result of decreased nymphal infection prevalence. Sites treated with tick tubes had lower DIN (66%) and DON (54%) across the study and nymphs were reduced every year following the initial year of deployment compared to controls. Combining treatments did not further reduce DIN or DONs. We conclude that long-term integration of tick tubes with invasive vegetation removal does not provide additional benefit over individual treatments alone."

		"abstract": "The high polymorphism of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes is generally considered to be a result of pathogen-mediated balancing selection. Such selection may operate in the form of heterozygote advantage, and/or through specific MHC allele-pathogen interactions. Specific MHC allele-pathogen interactions may promote polymorphism via negative frequency-dependent selection (NFDS), or selection that varies in time and/or space because of variability in the composition of the pathogen community (fluctuating selection; FS). In addition, divergent allele advantage (DAA) may act on top of these forms of balancing selection, explaining the high sequence divergence between MHC alleles. DAA has primarily been thought of as an extension of heterozygote advantage. However, DAA could also work in concert with NFDS though this is yet to be tested explicitly. To evaluate the importance of DAA in pathogen-mediated balancing selection, we surveyed allelic polymorphism of MHC class II DQB genes in wild bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and tested for associations between DQB haplotypes and infection by Borrelia afzelii, a tick-transmitted bacterium causing Lyme disease in humans. We found two significant associations between DQB haplotypes and infection status: one haplotype was associated with lower risk of infection (resistance), while another was associated with higher risk of infection (susceptibility). Interestingly, allelic divergence within individuals was higher for voles with the resistance haplotype compared to other voles. In contrast, allelic divergence was lower for voles with the susceptibility haplotype than other voles. The pattern of higher allelic divergence in individuals with the resistance haplotype is consistent with NFDS favouring divergent alleles in a natural population, hence selection where DAA works in concert with NFDS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is commonly diagnosed by serologic response to Borrelia burgdorferi and related species, but the relationship between serologic targets and clinical features is unknown. We developed a multi-antigen Luminex-based panel and evaluated IgG responses in 527 children 1 to 21 years of age assessed for Lyme disease across 4 Pedi Lyme Net emergency departments, including 127 Lyme cases defined by either an erythema migrans (EM) lesion or positive C6 enzyme immunoassay followed by immunoblot and 400 patients considered clinical mimics. Of 42 antigens tested, 26 elicited specific reactivity in Lyme patients, without marked age-dependent variation. Children with single EM lesions typically lacked Borrelia-specific IgG. By principal component analysis, children with early disseminated and late Lyme disease clustered separately from clinical mimics and also from each other. Neurological disease and arthritis exhibited distinct serologic responses, with OspC variants overrepresented in neurological disease and p100, BmpA, p58 and p45 overrepresented in arthritis. Machine learning identified a 3-antigen panel (VlsE_Bb, p41_Bb, OspC_Bafz) that distinguished Lyme disease from clinical mimics with a sensitivity of 86.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 80.3-92.1) and a specificity of 95.5% (95% CI 93.4-97.4). Sensitivity was much lower in early Lyme disease (38.5%, 95% CI 15.4-69.2). Interestingly, 17 children classified as Lyme mimics had a positive 3-antigen panel, suggesting that more comprehensive serologic analysis could help refine Lyme diagnosis. In conclusion, multiplex antigen panels provide a novel approach to understanding the immune response in Lyme disease, potentially helping to facilitate accurate diagnosis and to understand differences between clinical stages."

		"abstract": "Penile cancer is a rare cancer in Western countries, but is more common in parts of the developing world. Usually, it is associated with older uncircumcised men who have a long-term phymotic preputium. Here, we report a case of penile cancer in a circumcised patient, occurring 3 months after a tick bite on the head of the penis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that suggests a possible association between Lyme disease and occurrence of \"de novo\" penile cancer. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

		"abstract": "Purpose: Orofacial manifestations of Lyme disease can affect head and neck anatomical structures that are frequently examined by dental professionals. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the literature for types and frequencies of orofacial manifestations documented in populations in the United States (US) with Lyme disease.Methods: Four electronic databases (Dentistry and Oral Sciences, PubMed, Cinahl Plus, and Medline) were systematically searched during the summer of 2019 using keywords and MeSH terms to identify relevant studies. Search term alterations and synonyms were cross-checked using the US National Library of Medicine Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus. Full-text, English language studies were included if they reported on US populations with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed cases of Lyme disease. The review followed guidelines set forth in Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Quality was assessed with a modified version of the Cochrane Data Collection Form for Randomized Control Trials and Non-randomized Control Trials. Extracted data was organized by themes of manifestations and the frequencies were calculated.Results: An initial search extracted 217,381 articles; 43 met the inclusion criteria and were further reviewed for quality. Twelve articles published from 1992-2017 were deemed appropriate for inclusion. All were from non-dental journals and fewer than half (n=6) reported on Lyme disease endemic states. Eight incidences of orofacial manifestations within head/neck regions were documented in Lyme disease patients (n=951) and included: headache (39.5%), facial palsy (42.5%), temporomandibular joint arthralgia (42.0%), altered taste (11.0%), stiff neck (13.6%), sore throat (3.0%), neck pain/arthralgia (7.5%), and erythema migrans rash (5.2%).Conclusion: Eight orofacial manifestations of Lyme disease were revealed by this systematic review. Future research regarding the orofacial manifestations of Lyme disease is needed so this medical condition can be better understood by oral health care providers and result in improved health outcomes for infected patients."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the most common hard tick species in Europe and an important vector of pathogens of human and animal health concerns. The rise of high-throughput sequencing has facilitated the identification of many tick-borne pathogens and, more globally, of various microbiota members depending on the scale of concern. In this study, we aimed to assess the bacterial diversity of individual I. ricinus questing nymphs collected in France using high-throughput 16S gene metabarcoding. From 180 dragging-collected nymphs, we identified more than 700 bacterial genera, of which about 20 are abundantly represented (>1% of total reads). Together with 136 other genera assigned, they constitute a core internal microbiota in this study. We also identified 20 individuals carrying Borreliella. The most abundant species is B. afzelii, known to be one of the bacteria responsible for Lyme disease in Europe. Co-detection of up to four Borreliella genospecies within the same individual has also been retrieved. The detection and co-detection rate of Borreliella in I. ricinus nymphs is high and raises the question of interactions between these bacteria and the communities constituting the internal microbiota."

		"abstract": "Some subjective symptoms may be reported at all stages of Lyme borreliosis (LB) and may persist for several months after treatment. Nonspecific symptoms without any objective manifestation of LB are sometimes attributed by patients to a possible tick bite. The aim of our study was to explore the perceptions, representations, and experiences that these patients had of their disease and care paths. We performed a qualitative study through individual interviews (October 2017-May 2018), based on grounded theory, following the COREQ checklist. A balanced sample of patients with diverse profiles was recruited at consultations with general practitioners and infectious disease physicians. Twelve patients were interviewed. Data saturation was reached at the twelfth interview. For codes, 293 were identified, and classified into 5 themes: (1) the experience of disabling nonspecific symptoms, especially pain, causing confusion and fear, (2) long and difficult care paths for the majority of the patients, experienced as an obstacle course, (3) a break with the previous state of health, causing a negative impact on every sphere of the patient's life, (4) empowerment of the patients and the self-management of their disease, and (5) the strong expression of a desire for change, with better listening, greater recognition of the symptoms, and simpler care paths. This study allows for the understanding of a patient's behaviours and the obstacles encountered, the way they are perceived, and the necessary solutions. The patients' expectations identified here could help physicians better understand the doctor-patient relationship in these complex management situations, which would reduce the burden of the disease. The current development of specialised reference centres could help meet the patients' demands and those of family physicians."

We are investigating various European Borrelia spirochetes and their interactions at the atomic level using NMR. We report preparative scale recombinant expression of uniformly stable isotope enriched B. afzelii DbpA in Escherichia coli, its chromatographic purification, and solution NMR assignments of its backbone and sidechain 1H, 13C, and 15N atoms. This data was used to predict secondary structure propensity, which we compared to the North American B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and European B. garinii DbpA for which solution NMR structures had been determined previously. Backbone dynamics of DbpA from B. afzelii were elucidated from spin relaxation and heteronuclear NOE experiments. NMR-based secondary structure analysis together with the backbone dynamics characterization provided a first look into structural differences of B. afzelii DbpA compared to the North American species and will serve as the basis for further investigation of how these changes affect interactions with host components."

Due to the difficulty in reducing tick populations, awareness of tick bite prevention, proper tick removal, and knowledge of when to seek medical treatment are critical. However, outreach and extension programs are hampered by a lack of knowledge of what community members know about ticks. To address this limitation, we surveyed college students enrolled in three non-major Entomology courses at Oklahoma State University in 2018. Of the 483 students invited to take a survey, 224 (46.4%) students took both surveys. Pre-survey responses indicated lower levels of knowledge of tick biology compared to post-survey responses. For both pre- and post-survey respondents, \"ticks can jump\" and \"ticks reside up in trees\" received the fewest correct responses. A majority of survey respondents considered Lyme disease to be the predominant TBD in Oklahoma, although it is not established in Oklahoma. Supplemental education overcame these knowledge gaps, with the exception of knowledge of Lyme disease which was still considered to be the predominant TBD in the post-survey. Our results can be used to develop assessment tools to improve extension programs and enhance protection from TBDs."

The Mediterranean rim is generally described as unsuitable for the European vector, Ixodes ricinus. We conducted an epidemiological study to assess whether I. ricinus was present and study its infection status for tick-borne bacteria. Ticks originating from southeastern France were obtained from flagging sampling and removed from animals and tick-bitten patients. Species level identification used morphological keys and MALDI-TOF MS. Quantitative PCR and sequencing assays were used to detect and identify tick-associated bacteria (Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasmataceae, Bartonella, Coxiella burnetii) in each specimen. A total of 1232 ticks were collected in several localities. Among these, 863 were identified as I. ricinus (70%). Bacterial screening allowed identification of Lyme group Borrelia among I. ricinus ticks originating from various regional areas. Other emerging tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia miyamotoi and Rickettsia species were also detected. The Alpes-Maritimes region, part of the French Riviera, harbours I. ricinus ticks infected with Lyme group Borrelia and several other tick-borne bacterial agents. Clinicians and outdoor activity participants should be aware of the local Lyme borreliosis transmission risk."

The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin 'Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018' . In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Availability of highly parallelized immunoassays has renewed interest in the discovery of serology biomarkers for infectious diseases. Protein and peptide microarrays now provide a rapid, high-throughput platform for immunological testing and validation of potential antigens and B-cell epitopes. However, there is still a need for tools to prioritize and select relevant probes when designing these arrays. In this work we describe a computational method called APRANK (Antigenic Protein and Peptide Ranker) which integrates multiple molecular features to prioritize potentially antigenic proteins and peptides in a given pathogen proteome. These features include subcellular localization, presence of repetitive motifs, natively disordered regions, secondary structure, transmembrane spans and predicted interaction with the immune system. We trained and tested this method with a number of bacteria and protozoa causing human diseases: Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease), Brucella melitensis (Brucellosis), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Escherichia coli (Gastroenteritis), Francisella tularensis (Tularemia), Leishmania braziliensis (Leishmaniasis), Leptospira interrogans (Leptospirosis), Mycobacterium leprae (Leprae), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tuberculosis), Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria), Porphyromonas gingivalis (Periodontal disease), Staphylococcus aureus (Bacteremia), Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcal infections), Toxoplasma gondii (Toxoplasmosis) and Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas Disease). We have evaluated this integrative method using non-parametric ROC-curves and made an unbiased validation using Onchocerca volvulus as an independent data set. We found that APRANK is successful in predicting antigenicity for all pathogen species tested, facilitating the production of antigen-enriched protein subsets. We make APRANK available to facilitate the identification of novel diagnostic antigens in infectious diseases."

		"abstract": "Pathogens possess the ability to adapt and survive in some host species but not in others-an ecological trait known as host tropism. Transmitted through ticks and carried mainly by mammals and birds, the Lyme disease (LD) bacterium is a well-suited model to study such tropism. Three main causative agents of LD, Borrelia burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, vary in host ranges through mechanisms eluding characterization. By feeding ticks infected with different Borrelia species, utilizing feeding chambers and live mice and quail, we found species-level differences in bacterial transmission. These differences localize on the tick blood meal, and specifically complement, a defense in vertebrate blood, and a polymorphic bacterial protein, CspA, which inactivates complement by binding to a host complement inhibitor, Factor H (FH). CspA selectively confers bacterial transmission to vertebrates that produce FH capable of allele-specific recognition. CspA is the only member of the Pfam54 gene family to exhibit host-specific FH-binding. Phylogenetic analyses revealed convergent evolution as the driver of such uniqueness, and that FH-binding likely emerged during the last glacial maximum. Our results identify a determinant of host tropism in Lyme disease infection, thus defining an evolutionary mechanism that shapes host-pathogen associations."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne infectious disease that may confer an increased risk of mental disorders, but previous studies have been hampered by methodological limitations, including small sample sizes. The authors used a nationwide retrospective cohort study design to examine rates of mental disorders following Lyme borreliosis. Using Denmark's National Patient Register and the Psychiatric Central Research Register, and including all persons living in Denmark from 1994 through 2016 (N=6,945,837), the authors assessed the risk of mental disorders and suicidal behaviors among all individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts (N=12,156). Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated by Poisson regression analyses. Individuals with Lyme borreliosis had higher rates of any mental disorder (IRR=1.28, 95% CI=1.20, 1.37), of affective disorders (IRR=1.42, 95% CI=1.27, 1.59), of suicide attempts (IRR=2.01, 95% CI=1.58, 2.55), and of death by suicide (IRR=1.75, 95% CI=1.18, 2.58) compared with those without Lyme borreliosis. The 6-month interval after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of any mental disorder (IRR=1.96, 95% CI=1.53, 2.52), and the first 3 years after diagnosis was associated with the highest rate of suicide (IRR=2.41, 95% CI=1.25, 4.62). Having more than one episode of Lyme borreliosis was associated with increased incidence rate ratios for mental disorders, affective disorders, and suicide attempts, but not for death by suicide. Individuals diagnosed with Lyme borreliosis in the hospital setting had an increased risk of mental disorders, affective disorders, suicide attempts, and suicide. Although the absolute population risk is low, clinicians should be aware of potential psychiatric sequelae of this global disease."

		"abstract": "Riboflavin is an essential micronutrient, but its transport and utilization has remained largely understudied among pathogenic spirochetes. Here we show that Borrelia burgdorferi, the zoonotic spirochete that causes Lyme disease, is able to import riboflavin via products of its rfuABCD-like operon as well as synthesize flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide despite lacking canonical genes for their synthesis. Additionally, a mutant deficient in the rfuABCD-like operon is resistant to the antimicrobial effect of roseoflavin, a natural riboflavin analog, and is attenuated in a murine model of Lyme borreliosis. Our combined results indicate that not only are riboflavin and the maintenance of flavin pools essential for B. burgdorferi growth, but that flavin utilization and its downstream products (e.g., flavoproteins) may play a more prominent role in B. burgdorferi pathogenesis than previously appreciated."

Her medical history was notable for Raynaud syndrome, recurrent streptococcal pharyngitis, and an allergy to amoxicillin. Three days prior to developing diplopia, she presented to an outside emergency department due to fever, chills, and back pain. She received ciprofloxacin for presumed urinary tract infection based on urinalysis, which demonstrated few bacteria and was negative for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, and white blood cells. She then presented again to an outside emergency department for diplopia evaluation. Initial MRI and MR angiography of the brain at that time did not demonstrate any relevant findings, and the patient was referred to our department for neuro-ophthalmic evaluation, where she was seen 4 weeks later. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed 20/20 visual acuity in both eyes, and a right hypertropia in left gaze, downgaze and right head tilt, with right eye excyclotorsion. There were no ocular signs of myasthenia gravis or thyroid eye disease, nor did the patient report ocular or systemic symptoms. She denied recent travel. High-spatial-resolution MRI of the brain and orbit were performed."

		"abstract": "The spike protein of coronavirus is key target for drug development and other pharmacological interventions. In current study, we performed an integrative approach to predict antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding domain and found nine potential antigenic sites. The predicted antigenic sites were then assessed for possible molecular similarity with other known antigens in different organisms. Out of nine sites, seven sites showed molecular similarity with 54 antigenic determinants found in twelve pathogenic bacterial species (Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, Bacillus anthracis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium tetani, Helicobacter Pylori, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Vibrio cholera and Yersinia pestis), two malarial parasites (Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium knowlesi) and influenza virus A. Most of the bacterial antigens that displayed molecular similarity with antigenic sites in SARS-CoV-2 RBD (receptor binding domain) were toxins and virulent factors. Antigens from Mycobacterium that showed similarity were mainly involved in modulating host cell immune response and ensuring persistence and survival of pathogen in host cells. Presence of a large number of antigenic determinants, similar to those in highly pathogenic microorganisms, not merely accounts for complex etiology of the disease but also provides an explanation for observed pathophysiological complications, such as deregulated immune response, unleashed or dysregulated cytokine secretion (cytokine storm), multiple organ failure etc., that are more evident in aged and immune-compromised patients. Over-representation of antigenic determinants from Plasmodium and Mycobacterium in all antigenic sites suggests that anti-malarial and anti-TB drugs can prove to be clinical beneficial for COVID-19 treatment. Besides this, anti-leprosy, anti-lyme, anti-plague, anti-anthrax drugs/vaccine etc. are also expected to be beneficial in COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, individuals previously immunized/vaccinated or had previous history of malaria, tuberculosis or other disease caused by fifteen microorganisms are expected to display a considerable degree of resistance against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Out of the seven antigenic sites predicted in SARS-CoV-2, a part of two antigenic sites were also predicted as potent T-cell epitopes (KVGGNYNYL444-452 and SVLYNSASF366-374) against MHC class I and three (KRISNCVADYSVLYN356-370, DLCFTNVYADSFVI389-402, and YRVVVLSFELLHA508-520) against MHC class II. All epitopes possessed significantly lower predicted IC50 value which is a prerequisite for a preferred vaccine candidate for COVID-19."

Strain differences seem to explain some of the variation in the clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, which are both minor and substantive, between the United States and Europe.

The geographic distribution of the tick is associated with climatic variables that include temperature, precipitation, and humidity, and biotic factors such as the spatial distribution of its primary vertebrate hosts. Here, we explore (1) how climate change may alter the geographic distribution of I. pacificus in California, USA, during the 21st century, and (2) the spatial overlap among predicted changes in tick habitat suitability, land access, and ownership. Maps of potential future suitability for I. pacificus were generated by applying climate-based species distribution models to a multi-model ensemble of climate change projections for the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 (moderate emission) and 8.5 (high emission) scenarios for two future periods: mid-century (2026-2045) and end-of-century (2086-2099). Areas climatically-suitable for I. pacificus are projected to expand by 23% (mid-century RCP 4.5) to 86% (end-of-century RCP 8.5) across California, compared to the historical period (1980-2014), with future estimates of total suitable land area ranging from about 88 to 133 thousand km2, or up to about a third of California. Regions projected to have the largest area increases in suitability by end-of-century are in northwestern California and the south central and southern coastal ranges. Over a third of the future suitable habitat is on lands currently designated as open access (i.e. publicly available), and by 2100, the amount of these lands that are suitable habitat for I. pacificus is projected to more than double under the most extreme emissions scenario (from ~23,000 to >51,000 km2). Of this area, most is federally-owned (>45,000 km2). By the end of the century, 26% of all federal land in the state is predicted to be suitable habitat for I. pacificus. The resulting maps may facilitate regional planning and preparedness by informing public health and vector control decision-makers."

		"abstract": "We developed a transwell assay to quantify migration of the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), toward Ixodes scapularis salivary gland proteins. The assay was designed to assess B. burgdorferi s.s. migration upward against gravity through a transwell polycarbonate membrane overlaid with 6% gelatin. Borreliae that channeled into the upper transwell chamber in response to test proteins were enumerated by flow cytometry. The transwell assay measured chemoattractant activity for B. burgdorferi s.s. from salivary gland extract (SGE) harvested from nymphal ticks during bloodmeal engorgement on mice 42 h post-attachment and saliva collected from adult ticks. Additionally, SGE protein fractions separated by size exclusion chromatography demonstrated various levels of chemoattractant activity in the transwell assay. Sialostatin L, and Salp-like proteins 9 and 11 were identified by mass spectrometry in SGE fractions that exhibited elevated activity. Recombinant forms of these proteins were tested in the transwell assay and showed positive chemoattractant properties compared to controls and another tick protein, S15A. These results were reproducible providing evidence that the transwell assay is a useful method for continuing investigations to find tick saliva components instrumental in driving B. burgdorferi s.s. chemotaxis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is a newly described relapsing fever spirochete transmitted by ixodid tick species. Little is known about the prevalence of B. miyamotoi infections in humans and ticks in Inner Mongolia, China. Therefore, we investigated the prevalence of B. miyamotoi in Ixodes persulcatus ticks, and we aimed to isolateB. miyamotoi from I. persulcatus from four regions of Greater Khingan, Inner Mongolia, China. From May to June each year during the period 2016-2019, host-seeking adult I. persulcatus ticks were collected from vegetation. Genomic DNA was prepared from half of each tick body for PCR template, and the remaining half was used to cultivate B. miyamotoi in BSK-M medium. We employed quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to detect Borrelia DNA in the ticks and to calculate the prevalence of B. miyamotoi and infections with other borreliae. For characterization of the isolated B. miyamotoi, we performed draft genome sequencing and multilocus sequencing analysis (MLSA). A total of 2656 adult I. persulcatus ticks were collected. The overall prevalence of relapsing fever (RF) borreliae in ticks was 5.0% (134/2656) and that of Lyme disease (LD) borreliae was 43.8% (1164/2656). Co-infection with RF and LD borreliae was observed in 63 ticks (2.4%). Ticks that were positive for RF borreliae by qPCR were subjected to glycerophosphodiester diester phosphodiesterase gene (glpQ) PCR amplification and sequencing, through which we identified the RF borrelia specimens as B. miyamotoi. Furthermore, the B. miyamotoi strain Hetao-1 was isolated from I. persulcatus, and a draft genome sequence was obtained from the isolate. Sequencing determined the strain Hetao-1 genome to be approximately 906.1 kbp in length (28.9% average GC content), and MLSA identified the strain as ST633, which has previously been reported in Japan and Mongolia. We detected B. miyamotoi from I. persulcatus ticks collected in Inner Mongolia, and successfully isolated a B. miyamotoi strain. To our knowledge, this is the first study to culture a B. miyamotoi isolate from China. The data on the prevalence of B. miyamotoi and other borreliae in I. persulcatus ticks will be fundamental for future epidemiological studies of B. miyamotoi disease in Inner Mongolia."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti has gained a foothold in Canada as tick vectors become established in broader geographic areas. B. microti infection is associated with mild or no symptoms in healthy individuals but is transfusion-transmissible and can be fatal in immunocompromised individuals. This is the first estimate of clinically significant transfusion-transmitted babesiosis (TTB) risk in Canada. The proportion of B. microti-antibody (AB)/nucleic acid amplification test (NAT)-positive whole blood donations was estimated at 5.5% of the proportion of the general population with reported Lyme Disease (also tick-borne) based on US data. Monte Carlo simulation estimated the number and proportion of infectious red cell units for three scenarios: base, localized incidence (risk in Manitoba only), and donor study informed (prevalence from donor data). The model simulated 1,029,800 donations repeated 100,000 times for each. In the base scenario 0.5 (0.01, 1.75), B. microti-NAT-positive donations would be expected per year, with 0.08 (0, 0.38) recipients suffering clinically significant TTB (1 every 12.5 years). In the localized incidence scenario, there were 0.21(0, 0.7) B. microti-NAT-positive donations, with 0.04 (0, 0.14) recipient infections (about 1 every 25 years). In the donor study informed scenario, there were 4.6 (0.3, 15.8) B. microti-NAT-positive donations expected, and 0.81 (0.05, 3.14) clinically significant TTB cases per year. The likelihood of clinically relevant TTB is low. Testing would have very little utility in Canada at this time. Ongoing pathogen surveillance in tick vectors is important as B. microti prevalence appears to be slowly increasing in Canada."

We performed an 8-center prospective cohort study of children undergoing emergency department evaluation for Lyme disease limited to those who had an ECG obtained by their treating clinicians. The study cardiologist reviewed all ECGs flagged as abnormal by the study sites to assess for ECG evidence of carditis. We defined Lyme disease as the presence of an erythema migrans lesion or a positive 2-tier Lyme disease serology. We used logistic regression to measure the association between Lyme disease and atrioventricular (AV) block or any ECG evidence of carditis. Of the 546 children who had an ECG obtained, 214 (39%) had Lyme disease. Overall, 42 children had ECG evidence of carditis, of whom 24 had AV block (20 first-degree). Of the patients with ECG evidence of carditis, only 21 (50%) had any cardiac symptoms. The presence of AV block (OR 4.7, 95% CI 1.8-12.1) and any ECG evidence of carditis (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.3) were both associated with diagnosis of Lyme disease. ECG evidence of carditis, especially AV block, was associated with a diagnosis of Lyme disease. ECG evidence of carditis can be used as a diagnostic biomarker for Lyme disease to guide initial management while awaiting Lyme disease test results."

		"abstract": "In this study, we examined the relationship between c-di-GMP and its only known effector protein, PlzA, in Borrelia burgdorferi during the arthropod and mammalian phases of the enzootic cycle. Using a B. burgdorferi strain expressing a plzA point mutant (plzA-R145D) unable to bind c-di-GMP, we confirmed that the protective function of PlzA in ticks is c-di-GMP-dependent. Unlike ΔplzA spirochetes, which are severely attenuated in mice, the plzA-R145D strain was fully infectious, firmly establishing that PlzA serves a c-di-GMP-independent function in mammals. Contrary to prior reports, loss of PlzA did not affect expression of RpoS or RpoS-dependent genes, which are essential for transmission, mammalian host-adaptation and murine infection. To ascertain the nature of PlzA's c-di-GMP-independent function(s), we employed infection models using (i) host-adapted mutant spirochetes for needle inoculation of immunocompetent mice and (ii) infection of scid mice with in vitro-grown organisms. Both approaches substantially restored ΔplzA infectivity, suggesting that PlzA enables B. burgdorferi to overcome an early bottleneck to infection. Furthermore, using a Borrelia strain expressing a heterologous, constitutively active diguanylate cyclase, we demonstrate that 'ectopic' production of c-di-GMP in mammals abrogates spirochete virulence and interferes with RpoS function at the post-translational level in a PlzA-dependent manner. Structural modeling and SAXS analysis of liganded- and unliganded-PlzA revealed marked conformational changes that underlie its biphasic functionality. This structural plasticity likely enables PlzA to serve as a c-di-GMP biosensor that in its respective liganded and unliganded states promote vector- and host-adaptation by the Lyme disease spirochete."

Using daily weather data at ~4 km2 resolution, we created cumulative metrics hypothesized to promote (warm and humid) or inhibit (hot and dry) tick development or host-seeking during nymph development (March 1-May 31), nymph activity (May 1-July 30), and prior year larva activity (Aug 1-Sept 30). We estimated odds ratios (ORs) of Lyme disease by quartiles of each weather variable, adjusting for demographic, clinical, and other weather variables. Exposure-response patterns were observed for higher cumulative same-year temperature, humidity, and hot and dry days (nymph-relevant), and prior year hot and dry days (larva-relevant), with same-year hot and dry days showing the strongest association (4th vs. 1st quartile OR = 0.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.36, 0.43).

		"abstract": "Ticks may carry several pathogens as vectors and their pathogen load may vary due to differences in geography, climate and vegetation. In this study, we collected ticks from 39 districts of Istanbul (Turkey) between May and October, from 2013 to 2017, and identified them under stereo-microscope. In addition, we investigated the pathogens that the ticks carry (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia sp. and Babesia sp.) by using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. We collected a total of 875 ticks from the ground and from various animals and kept them at 4 °C until experiments. We identified 248 Rhipicephalus bursa (28.3% of the total), 205 (23.4%) Rhipicephalus annulatus, 197 (22.5%) Haemaphysalis concinna, 149 (17.0%) Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 24 (2.7%) Hyalomma marginatum, 21 (2.4%) Ixodes ricinus, 13 (1.5%) Rhipicephalus kohlsi, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma anatolicum, 5 (0.6%) Hyalomma aegyptium, 5 (0.6%) Dermacentor niveus and 3 (0.3%) Ixodes hexagonus. We included a total of 328 questing ticks in the study: 63 R. bursa, 63 R. sanguineus, 63 R. annulatus, 63 H. concinna, 24 H. marginatum, 21 I. ricinus, 13 R. kohlsi, 5 H. anatolicum, 5 H. aegyptium, 5 D. niveus and 3 I. hexagonus. Multiplex PCR indicated that 80 (24.4%) ticks were infected with Rickettsia sp., 5 (1.5%) with B. burgdorferi and 1 (0.3%) with Babesia sp. Our study indicated that Rickettsia is more common in ticks collected around Istanbul."

Charts of pediatric and adult patients with heart block (PR interval >300 ms) and positive Lyme serologies hospitalized in Portland, Maine, between January 2010 and December 2018 were analyzed. Data on medical history, presentation, treatment, and outcomes are described. Ten children and 20 adults were admitted for Lyme carditis between June and October. Ninety percent were male, and 87% had no prior cardiac history. Seventeen had outpatient evaluation before admission. Of these, a minority (41%) had Lyme disease suspected in the outpatient setting, and fewer (12%) were initiated on Lyme disease treatment. The most common alternate diagnoses were viral illness and erythema multiforme. More children than adults had disseminated erythema migrans and fever. First-degree heart block was more prevalent in children, and Mobitz type 2 heart block was more prevalent in adults. Ten patients presented with syncope. Proportionately more adults needed temporary pacing. Children had shorter antibiotic durations compared with adults. Of the 30 cases, 27 had improved heart block, while 3 adults required a pacemaker at discharge. Nine children and 14 adults were discharged with a PR 200-300 ms. There was a single death in this series. Cases tended to be younger males. Most patients had some heart block on discharge. Of patients evaluated as outpatients, Lyme disease was suspected in 41%. Improved early recognition and treatment of Lyme disease may decrease Lyme carditis."

		"abstract": "To compare hematologic results for juvenile versus adult dogs from shelters that outwardly appeared healthy and were presented for ovariohysterectomy or castration. 138 dogs from 13 regional shelters. Each dog underwent a physical examination (including use of a flea comb), age estimation by dental eruption characteristics, PCV, CBC, and tests for Dirofilaria immitis antigen and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia canis antibodies. Additional diagnostic tests were performed as needed. Dogs were grouped by age as < 3, ≥ 3 to ≤ 6, or > 6 months of age, with dogs ≤ 6 months of age considered juveniles and dogs > 6 months of age considered adults. Hematologic results were compared across groups. There were 138 dogs, of which 56 were juveniles (34 dogs < 3 months old; 22 dogs ≥ 3 to ≤ 6 months old) and 82 were adults. Juvenile (vs adult) dogs had lower mean calculated Hct and mean PCV whether dogs with infectious agents or parasites were included or excluded. The mean PCV and mean cell hemoglobin concentration were lower and the reticulocyte count higher for juvenile dogs < 3 months old (35.8%, 33.1 g/dL, and 135,000 reticulocytes/μL) versus adults (44.9%, 34.7 g/dL, and 68,500 reticulocytes/μL). Most (98.6%) dogs underwent surgery as scheduled; 2 dogs had surgery postponed because of thrombocytopenia or parvovirus infection. Our findings indicated that outwardly healthy-appearing juvenile shelter dogs often have results for PCV and calculated Hct that are lower than those for adult shelter dogs and adult dog reference intervals but rarely require postponement of ovariohysterectomy or castration."

		"abstract": "We present a case of middle-aged woman whose health problems began 3 months after a registered tick bite in endemic area of Lyme borreliosis. First symptoms included fatigue, chills, cervical lymphadenopathy, neck pain and stiffness. Patient was afebrile. Lyme disease was excluded due to lack of erythema migrans and negative enzyme immunoassay test results for anti-Borrelia antibodies. During the next few months, her condition was getting worse and symptoms were accompanied with brain fog, dizziness, palpitations, irregular menstrual cycles, insomnia, panic attacks, headaches, and muscle aches. This led to multiple medical tests and examinations, but the diagnosis failed to be established. Finally, after occurrence of paresthesia and weakness of leg muscles, clinical diagnosis of disseminated Lyme borreliosis with nervous system involvement was suspected and antibiotic therapy was initiated. After the second dose of Ceftriaxone, patient got fever and her condition worsened. However, Ceftriaxone therapy was continued for a total of 5 days and was followed by 4 weeks of doxycycline therapy. Upon completion of antibiotic therapy, high specific anti-Borrelia antibodies were detected by Western blot and SeraSpot. Appearance of anti-Borrelia antibodies, in contrast to negative test results performed immediately before the therapy started, indicated seroconversion. 18 months after the therapy, patient was completely without the symptoms. This paper emphasizes importance of clinical evaluation of Lyme disease and shows a unique case of seroconversion in patient with symptoms of disseminated Lyme disease. Seroconversion was likely triggered by release of lipoproteins and other immunogenic molecules from Borrelia once the bacterial die-off began due to antibiotic therapy."

		"abstract": "Interest in Babesia species is gaining an increasing attention as an emerging tick-borne pathogen. Infection is primarily transmitted through Ixodes ticks, and alternatively by blood transfusions from asymptomatic donors. The aim of the study was detection of Babesia seroprevalence in different groups of population with the usage of experimental B. divergens whole-cell slide antigen and commercial B. microti immunofluorescence assay substrate slide. Indirect immunofluorescence assay trial was performed by testing of 145 blood samples of different origins: healthy individuals (60 - blood donors), risk groups (30 - HIV-infected individuals, 30 - Lyme disease patients) and false-positive IFA controls (10 - seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients, 15 - patients with toxoplasmosis). The study revealed Babesia antibodies to B. divergens (6.9%) and B. microti (3.4%) that were detected with higher (p <0.05) frequency in HIV-infected individuals (26.7%) and in Lyme disease patients (16.7%) than at blood donors (1.7%). Diagnostically significant IgG titres were detected at 23.3% HIV-infected individuals, 13.3% Lyme disease patients and by 1.7% of blood donors and patients with seropositive latent toxoplasmosis. Specific IgM were detected at 20.0% HIV-infected individuals and 13.3% Lyme disease patients. 57.1% of diagnostically significant titres in HIV-infected and Lyme disease patients were represented by IgG and IgM. Immunofluorescence assay has a limited use in babesiosis: in acute form with negative microscopy or PCR; in chronic, asymptomatic and subclinical form with low level of parasitemia; and in retrospective and epidemiological studies of the population immune structure. Clinicians need to have increased awareness of babesiosis, and further studies are needed to clarify the optimal management of this infection in risk groups (including HIV-infected patients and blood donors)."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is endemic to parts of the Americas, Europe and Asia. However, only a handful of sporadic cases have been reported from India. In this study, we systematically evaluated the clinical and epidemiological features of Lyme disease in North India. All samples were tested by using the standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTA). Paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were used for demonstrating Borrelia burgdorferi specific intrathecal IgG antibody synthesis (AI). In addition, a commercial tick-borne bacterial flow chip (TBFC) system and a real-time PCR were also used to detect Borrelia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in patients who were positive by STTA. The diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed in 18 (7.14%) of the 252 clinically suspected cases by STTA. Neurological involvement was reported in 14 (77.78%) patients, whereas joint and heart involvement was reported in five (27.78%) and three (16.67%) patients, respectively. Lymphocytic pleocytosis (median 37.5 cells/mm3; range 12-175 cells/mm3) in the CSF was seen in 11 of 14 Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) patients. Intrathecal production of Borrelia specific IgG antibodies was demonstrated in 9 (64.28%, n = 14) patients, a highly specific finding for neuroborreliosis. Two patients (11.11%) were also found to be co-infected with human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The results of this study show clinical and laboratory evidence of endemic Lyme disease in North India and thus, highlight the importance for travel medicine practitioners and physicians to evaluate for Lyme disease in patients with compatible symptoms and a history of travel to tick risk areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common vector-borne disease in Europe. Monitoring changes in the prevalence of different Borrelia species in ticks may be an important indicator of risk assessment and of differences in pathogenicity in humans. The objective of our study was to assess the prevalence, co-infection and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks removed from humans in a large sample collected during a study period of 4 years. The ticks were collected throughout Poland from March to November over 4-year period from 2016 to 2019. All ticks (n = 1953) were morphologically identified in terms of species and developmental stage. Molecular screening for Borrelia and Babesia by amplification of the flagellin gene (flaB) or 18S rRNA marker was performed. Pathogen identity was confirmed by Sanger sequencing or PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. The ticks removed from humans in Poland during this study belonged to two species: Ixodes ricinus (97%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (3%). High Borrelia prevalence (25.3%), including B. miyamotoi (8.4%), was confirmed in Ixodes ricinus ticks removed from humans, as was the change in frequency of occurrence of Borrelia species during the 4-year study. Despite Babesia prevalence being relatively low (1.3%), the majority of tested isolates are considered to be pathogenic to humans. Babesia infection was observed more frequently among Borrelia-positive ticks (2.7%) than among ticks uninfected with Borrelia (0.8%). The most frequent dual co-infections were between Borrelia afzelii and Babesia microti. The presence of Borrelia was also confirmed in D. reticulatus (12.7%); however the role of these ticks in spirochete transmission to susceptible hosts is still unclear. Although the overall risk of developing LB after a tick bite is low in Europe, knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of Borrelia and Babesia species in ticks might be an important indicator of the risk of both these tick-borne diseases."

Overall, 12 tick samples in 227 (overall prevalence 5.3%) were positive for Candidatus B. javanense, 9 (5.1%) in 176 males, and 3 (5.9%) in 51 females. The phylogenetic analysis, based on the 16S rRNA gene and the flagellin gene sequences of the Borrelia sp., exhibited strong evidence that Candidatus B. javanense did not belong to the Lyme disease Borrelia group and the relapsing fever Borrelia group but another lineage of Borrelia. The discovery of the novel Borrelia species suggests that A. javanense may be the transmit vector, and the M. javanica pangolins should be considered a possible origin reservoir in the natural circulation of these new pathogens. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of a novel Borrelia species agent in A. javanense from pangolins. Whether the novel agent is pathogenic to humans is unknown and needs further research."

		"abstract": "Currently, the diagnosis of Lyme disease is based mostly on two-tiered serologic testing. In the new generation of immunoenzymatic assays, antigens comprise whole-cell lysates of members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) species complex, with the addition of selected recombinant proteins. Due to the high diversity of members of the B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies and the low degree of conservation among the amino acid sequences of their proteins, serodiagnostic methods currently in use are not sufficient for the correct diagnosis of borreliosis. Two divalent chimeric proteins (BmpA-BBK32 and BmpA-BBA64) were expressed in Escherichia coli. Following purification by one-step metal-affinity chromatography, preparations were obtained containing milligram levels of chimeric protein exhibiting electrophoretic purity in excess of 98%. Reactivity of the new chimeric proteins with specific human IgG antibodies was preliminarily determined by Western blot. For this purpose, 20 negative sera and 20 positive sera was used. The new chimeric proteins were highly reactive with IgG antibodies contained in the serum of patients suffering from borreliosis. Moreover, no immunoreactivity of chimeric proteins was observed with antibodies in the sera of healthy people. These promising results suggest that new chimeric proteins have the potential to discriminate between positive and negative sera."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in North America and Europe. Its causative agents are spirochetes of the Borrelia&nbsp;burgdorferi&nbsp;sensu&nbsp;latu complex. Infection with borreliae can manifest in different tissues, most commonly in the skin and joints, but in severe cases also in the nervous systems and the heart. The immune response of the host is a crucial factor for preventing the development or progression of Lyme disease. Macrophages are part of the innate immune system and thus one of the first cells to encounter infecting borreliae. As professional phagocytes, they are capable of recognition, uptake, intracellular processing and final elimination of borreliae. This sequence of events involves the initial capture and internalization by actin-rich cellular protrusions, filopodia and coiling pseudopods. Uptake into phagosomes is followed by compaction of the elongated spirochetes and degradation in mature phagolysosomes. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge about the processes and molecular mechanisms involved in recognition, capturing, uptake and intracellular processing of Borrelia by human macrophages. Moreover, we highlight interactions between macrophages and other cells of the immune system during these processes and point out open questions in the intracellular processing of borreliae, which include potential escape strategies of Borrelia."

		"abstract": "Recent scholarship supports the use of tick bite encounters as a proxy for human disease risk. Extending entomological monitoring, this study was designed to provide geographically salient information on self-reported tick bite encounters by survey respondents who concomitantly reported a Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis in a state perceived as non-endemic to tick-borne illness. Focusing on Texas, a mixed-methods approach was used to compare data on tick bite encounters from self-reported LD patients with county-level confirmed cases of LD from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), as well as serological canine reports. A greater proportion of respondents reported not recalling a tick bite in the study population, but a binomial test indicated that this difference was not statistically significant. A secondary analysis compared neighboring county-level data and ecological regions. Using multi-layer thematic mapping, our findings indicated that tick bite reports accurately overlapped with the geographic patterns of those patients previously known to be CDC-positive for serological LD and with canine-positive tests for Borrelia burgdorferi, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis, as well as within neighboring counties and ecological regions. LD patient-reported tick bite encounters, corrected for population density, also accurately aligned with official CDC county hot-spots. Given the large number of counties in Texas, these findings are notable. Overall, the study demonstrates that direct, clinically diagnosed patient reports with county-level tick bite encounter data offer important public health surveillance measures, particularly as it pertains to difficult-to-diagnose diseases where testing protocols may not be well established. Further integration of geo-ecological and socio-demographic factors with existing national epidemiological data, as well as increasingly accessible self-report methods such as online surveys, will contribute to the contextual information needed to organize and implement a coordinated public health response to LD."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the United States, infecting ~476,000 people annually. Borrelia spp. spirochetal bacteria are the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans and are transmitted by Ixodes spp ticks. Clinical manifestations vary depending on which Borrelia genospecies infects the patient and may be a consequence of distinct organotropism between species. In the US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most commonly reported genospecies and infection can manifest as mild to severe symptoms. Different genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto may be responsible for causing varying degrees of clinical manifestations. While the majority of Lyme borreliae-infected patients fully recover with antibiotic treatment, approximately 15% of infected individuals experience long-term neurological and psychological symptoms that are unresponsive to antibiotics. Currently, long-term antibiotic treatment remains the only FDA-approved option for those suffering from these chronic effects. Here, we discuss the current knowledge pertaining to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in the central nervous system (CNS), termed Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), within North America and specifically the United States. We explore the molecular mechanisms of spirochete entry into the brain and the role B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes play in CNS infectivity. Understanding infectivity can provide therapeutic targets for LNB treatment and offer public health understanding of the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genotypes that cause long-lasting symptoms."

		"abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate the frequency of vertigo symptoms and potential labyrinth damage in patients with diagnosed Lyme disease (LD). LD can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve, leading to hearing loss and vertigo/dizziness. The study included a group of 38 patients between the ages of 20 and 77, who were hospitalized due to vertigo/dizziness between 2018 and 2019. All of the patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological and neurological examination, including video electronystagmography (VENG), in addition to audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of LD. In 20 patients (53%), the Romberg trial was positive (p < 0.001). The degree of vestibular dysfunction as shown by the VENG test was associated with the rate of hearing loss as confirmed by the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test (p = 0.011), and it mainly concerned high-frequency sounds (p = 0.014). Vertigo can be a symptom of LD. It is often associated with labyrinth and hearing-organ damage, which can imply that the inner ear or nerve VIII is dysfunctional in the course of this disease. Antibiotic therapy is effective in reducing otoneurological symptoms."

We collected data from an experimental group of 252 Lyme disease patients and a control group of 267 healthy individuals. The quality of life and sleep, attention and memory performance were assessed in both groups. Additionally, we investigated depressive symptoms in patients with Lyme disease to examine whether the duration of the disease had an influence on the severity of symptoms shown. Furthermore, various data on the diagnostics and treatment carried out in the patient group were recorded. On average, patients visited almost eight physicians to obtain a diagnosis, and eight years passed between the tick bite and diagnosis (SD ± 7.8); less than half of the sample (46%) received their diagnosis within the first five years after the development of symptoms. It became clear that Lyme disease is often diagnosed very late. It appears that people suffering from Lyme disease have significantly lower quality of life and sleep and show cognitive impairments when it comes to attention and memory. This study shows that 3.1% of Lyme patients were satisfied with their lives and that 37% scored in the lower third of the quality-of-life scale. It was also shown that Lyme patients tend to have depressive symptoms."

It is a transient condition with good prognosis but in extremely rare cases may be life-threatening. We describe a 42-year-old man who presented with progressively worsening generalized weakness, presyncope and dyspnea on exertion for 2 weeks after sustaining a tick bite. He subsequently developed a 'bull's eye rash' on his flank 2 days before his presentation. He was found to have symptomatic third-degree AV conduction blockade with a ventricular escape rhythm resulting in a brief cardiac arrest. Intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone was commenced empirically and a temporary transvenous pacemaker was placed. In a few days he showed dramatic, rapid improvement; the pacemaker was removed, and the patient was discharged on oral doxycycline to complete a 24-day course. This case is unique due to its occurrence in an urban hospital where such cases are uncommon. Cardiac arrest, although brief in this case, is a rare occurrence. Lyme carditis was a surprise diagnosis in our hospital due to the patient's geographical dislocation during the COVID-19 pandemic."

		"abstract": "The microbiome of blood-sucking arthropods can shape their competence to acquire and maintain infections with vector-borne pathogens. We used a controlled study to investigate the interactions between Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, and the bacterial microbiome of Ixodes ricinus, its primary tick vector. We applied a surface sterilization treatment to I. ricinus eggs to produce dysbiosed tick larvae that had a low bacterial abundance and a changed bacterial microbiome compared to those of the control larvae. Dysbiosed and control larvae fed on B. afzelii-infected mice and uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to molt into nymphs. The nymphs were tested for B. afzelii infection, and their bacterial microbiome underwent 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Surprisingly, larval dysbiosis had no effect on the vector competence of I. ricinus for B. afzelii, as the nymphal infection prevalence and the nymphal spirochete load were the same between the dysbiosed group and the control group. The strong effect of egg surface sterilization on the tick bacterial microbiome largely disappeared once the larvae molted into nymphs. The most important determinant of the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs was the B. afzelii infection status of the mouse on which the nymphs had fed as larvae. Nymphs that had taken their larval blood meal from an infected mouse had a less abundant but more diverse bacterial microbiome than the control nymphs. Our study demonstrates that vector-borne infections in the vertebrate host shape the microbiome of the arthropod vector. IMPORTANCE Many blood-sucking arthropods transmit pathogens that cause infectious disease. For example, Ixodes ricinus ticks transmit the bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme disease in humans. Ticks also have a microbiome, which can influence their ability to acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens such as B. afzelii. We sterilized I. ricinus eggs with bleach, and the tick larvae that hatched from these eggs had a dramatically reduced and changed bacterial microbiome compared to that of control larvae. These larvae fed on B. afzelii-infected mice, and the resultant nymphs were tested for B. afzelii and for their bacterial microbiome. We found that our manipulation of the bacterial microbiome had no effect on the ability of the tick larvae to acquire and maintain populations of B. afzelii. In contrast, we found that B. afzelii infection had dramatic effects on the bacterial microbiome of I. ricinus nymphs. Our study demonstrates that infections in the vertebrate host can shape the tick microbiome."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is characterized by a bimodal age distribution and male predominance. We examined trends in reported cases during a 25-year period to describe changes in the populations most affected by Lyme disease in the United States. We examined demographic characteristics of people with confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 1992-2016 through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. We grouped cases into 5-year periods (1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016). We calculated the average annual incidence by age and sex and used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to describe changes in Lyme disease incidence by age and sex over time. We converted patient age at time of illness into patient birth year to ascertain disease patterns according to birth cohorts. The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States doubled from 1992-1996 to 2012-2016 (IRR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.70-1.78) and increased disproportionately among males; IRRs were 39%-89% higher among males than among females for most age groups. During the study period, children aged 5-9 years were most frequently and consistently affected. In contrast, the average age of adults with Lyme disease increased over time; of all adults, people born during 1950-1964 were the most affected by Lyme disease. Our findings suggest that age-related behaviors and susceptibilities may drive infections among children, and the shifting peak among adults likely reflects a probability proportional to the relative size of the baby boom population. These findings can inform targeted and efficient public health education and intervention efforts."

		"abstract": "Some fragmentary studies show that the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Poland is increasing. It has been generally accepted that the most affected are forestry workers and farmers. The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of borreliosis in urban and rural residents in 2008-2016. Databases on Lyme borreliosis from the National Health Fund and Central Statistical Office in Poland were analyzed. For each patient, ambulatory or discharged from every hospital, the diagnosis was compulsorily reported as encoded following the International Classification of Diseases. A steadily increasing number of patients with borreliosis in Poland was found, which doubled in 2008 - 2016. The incidence was similar in urban and rural residents. In all the provinces in Poland, an increase in incidence of borreliosis was observed, although there were big differences between them. The highest frequency of borreliosis was in Podlasie and Warmia-Masuria provinces. The lowest incidence of borreliosis was noticed in Wielkopolska province. In the most provinces the increase in the incidence of borreliosis was steady, except Warmia-Masuria, where it was very low in 2008, and soaring since 2011. The number of cases per year between 2008 - 2016 increased in both in males and females. The results suggest the need for higher awareness of the risk of Lyme borreliosis in urban residents, because the incidence of Lyme borreliosis is growing independently of the place of residence. Prompt measures to prevent tick bites and appropriate education are urgently needed."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multi-stage inflammatory disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted through the bite of an infected Ixodes scapularis tick. We previously discovered a B. burgdorferi infectivity gene, bbk13, that facilitates mammalian infection by promoting spirochete population expansion in the skin inoculation site. Initial characterization of bbk13 was carried out using an intradermal needle inoculation model of mouse infection, which does not capture the complex interplay of the pathogen-vector-host triad of natural transmission. Herein, we aimed to understand the role of bbk13 in the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi lacking bbk13 were unable to be acquired by naive larvae fed on needle inoculated mice. Using a capsule-feeding approach to restrict tick feeding activity to a defined skin site, we determined that delivery by tick bite alleviated the population expansion defect in the skin observed after needle inoculation of Δbbk13B. burgdorferi. Despite overcoming the early barrier in the skin, Δbbk13B. burgdorferi remained attenuated for distal tissue colonization after tick transmission. Disseminated infection of Δbbk13B. burgdorferi was improved in needle inoculated immunocompromised mice. Together, we established that bbk13 is crucial to the maintenance of B. burgdorferi in the enzootic cycle and that bbk13 is necessary beyond early infection in the skin, likely contributing to host immune evasion. Moreover, our data highlight the critical interplay between the pathogen, vector, and host as well as the distinct molecular genetic requirements for B. burgdorferi to survive at the pathogen-vector-host interface and to achieve productive disseminated infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is one of the most dangerous manifestations of Lyme disease, but the pathogenesis and inflammatory mechanisms are not fully understood. Cultured explants from the frontal cortex of rhesus monkey brain (n=3) were treated with live Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 6, 12, and 24 h. Total protein was collected for sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. In addition, changes in protein expression in the explants over time following Bb treatment were screened. We identified 1237 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs; fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.67, P-value ≤0.05). One of these, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), was highly expressed at all time points in the explants. The results of the protein-protein interaction network analysis of DEPs suggested that GAP-43 plays a role in the neuroinflammation associated with LNB. In HMC3 cells incubated with live Bb or PBS for 6, 12, and 24 h, real-time PCR and western blot analyses confirmed the increase of GAP-43 mRNA and protein, respectively. Elevated GAP-43 expression is a potential marker for LNB that may be useful for diagnosis or treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme Disease presents unique challenges for public health. Transfer of protective antibodies between mothers and offspring should occur after vaccination of mice. We present new evidence for maternal transfer of oral vaccine induced neutralizing anti-OspA IgG antibodies to mouse pups mainly through ingestion of colostrum. We found a strong statistical correlation of antibody transfer between mothers that produced the most robust IgG response to OspA and their respective pups. OspA-specific antibody was detected as early as 24 h after birth and protective levels of antibodies lasted until ~5 weeks of age in the majority of pups but persisted in some mice until 9 weeks. This was further supported by detection of neutralizing antibodies in serum of all pups at 2-3 weeks after birth and in some offspring adult mice at 9 weeks of age. A clear association was found between robust antibody responses in mothers and the length of time antibody persisted in the respective pups using a novel longitudinal Bayesian model. These factors are likely to impact the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi if reservoir targeted OspA-based vaccination interventions are implemented."

		"abstract": "Deer management (e.g., reduction) has been proposed as a tool to reduce the acarological risk of Lyme disease. There have been few opportunities to investigate Ixodes scapularis (blacklegged tick) and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto dynamics in the absence of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in midwestern North America. A pair of islands in Lake Michigan presented a unique opportunity to study the role of alternative hosts for the adult stage of the blacklegged tick for maintaining a tick population as a deer herd exists on North Manitou Island but not on South Manitou Island, where coyotes (Canis latrans) and hares (Lepus americanus) are the dominant medium mammals. Additionally, we were able to investigate the maintenance of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in small mammal communities on both islands, which were dominated by eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus). From 2011 to 2015, we surveyed both islands for blacklegged ticks by drag cloth sampling, bird mist netting, and small and medium-sized mammal trapping. We assayed questing ticks, on-host ticks, and mammal biopsies for the Lyme disease pathogen, B. burgdorferi. We detected all three life stages of the blacklegged tick on both islands. Of the medium mammals sampled, no snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus, 0/23) were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, but 2/2 coyotes (Canis latrans) sampled on South Manitou Island in 2014 were parasitized by adult blacklegged ticks, suggesting that coyotes played a role in maintaining the tick population in the absence of deer. We also detected I. scapularis ticks on passerine birds from both islands, providing support that birds contribute to maintaining as well as introducing blacklegged ticks and B. burgdorferi to the islands. We observed higher questing adult and nymphal tick densities, and higher B. burgdorferi infection prevalence in small mammals and in adult ticks on the island with deer as compared to the deer-free island. On the islands, we also found that 25% more chipmunks were tick-infested than mice, fed more larvae and nymphs relative to their proportional abundance compared to mice, and thus may play a larger role compared to mice in the maintenance of B. burgdorferi. Our investigation demonstrated that alternative hosts could maintain a local population of blacklegged ticks and an enzootic cycle of the Lyme disease bacterium in the absence of white-tailed deer. Thus, alternative adult blacklegged tick hosts should be considered when investigating deer-targeted management tools for reducing tick-borne disease risk, especially when the alternative host community may be abundant and diverse."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) is a bacterial species complex that includes the etiological agents of the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere, Lyme borreliosis. It currently comprises > 20 named and proposed genospecies that use vertebrate hosts and tick vectors for transmission in the Americas and Eurasia. Host (and vector) associations influence geographic distribution and speciation in Bbsl, which is of particular relevance to human health. To target gaps in knowledge for future efforts to understand broad patterns of the Bbsl-tick-host system and how they relate to human health, the present review aims to give a comprehensive summary of the literature on host association in Bbsl. Of 465 papers consulted (404 after exclusion criteria were applied), 96 sought to experimentally establish reservoir competence of 143 vertebrate host species for Bbsl. We recognize xenodiagnosis as the strongest method used, however it is infrequent (20% of studies) probably due to difficulties in maintaining tick vectors and/or wild host species in the lab. Some well-established associations were not experimentally confirmed according to our definition (ex: Borrelia garinii, Ixodes uriae and sea birds). We conclude that our current knowledge on host association in Bbsl is mostly derived from a subset of host, vector and bacterial species involved, providing an incomplete knowledge of the physiology, ecology and evolutionary history of these interactions. More studies are needed on all host, vector and bacterial species globally involved with a focus on non-rodent hosts and Asian Bbsl complex species, especially with experimental research that uses xenodiagnosis and genomics to analyze existing host associations in different ecosystems."

In 2014, CDC examined questions from a prospective nationwide survey of U.S. Hispanic adults conducted via the Offerwise QueOpinas panel regarding ticks and LD. From October to November, a total of 2,649 surveys were released and 1,006 completed surveys returned. Overall, 44% of respondents reported routinely practising at least one form of personal protection against tick bites, and wearing repellent was the most commonly reported method (29%). Approximately 6% of respondents reported a tick bite for either themselves or someone in their household during the previous 12 months. An individual or household diagnosis of LD in the previous year was reported by 2% of respondents, with the highest proportion of diagnoses reported by respondents from high LD incidence states. The annual incidence of healthcare provider-diagnosed LD in the survey population was higher than national surveillance estimates for reported LD among U.S. Hispanic persons during 2000-2013. As annual incidence of LD continues to increase, it is important to ensure equitable access to information about LD, including disease transmission, manifestations, and prevention recommendations. Results from this survey can help inform public health outreach focused on effective tick bite prevention methods and early recognition of LD."

		"abstract": "In Lyme disease endemic areas, Lyme and septic arthritis often present similarly. A published septic knee arthritis clinical prediction rule includes 2 high-risk predictors: absolute neutrophil count of 10,000 cells/mm or greater and erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/h or greater. The objective of the study was to externally validate this prediction rule in a multicenter prospective cohort. We enrolled a prospective cohort of children with knee monoarthritis undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease at 1 of 8 Pedi Lyme Net emergency departments located in endemic areas. We defined a case of septic arthritis with a positive synovial fluid culture or a synovial fluid white blood cell count of 50,000 or greater per high powered field with a positive blood culture and Lyme arthritis with a positive or equivocal C6 EIA, followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot. Other children were classified as having inflammatory arthritis. We report the performance of the septic arthritis clinical prediction rule in our study population. Of the 543 eligible children, 13 had septic arthritis (2.4%), 234 Lyme arthritis (43.1%), and 296 inflammatory arthritis (54.5%). Of the 457 children (84.2%) with available laboratory predictors, all children with septic arthritis were classified as high risk (sensitivity, 100%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 62.8%-100%; specificity, 68.1%; 95% CI, 63.6-73.3; negative predictive value, 278/278 [100%]; 95% CI, 98.6%-100%). Of the 303 low-risk children, 52 (17.2%) underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis. The septic knee arthritis clinical prediction rule accurately distinguished between septic and Lyme arthritis in an endemic area. Clinical application may reduce unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, persists in nature through an enzootic cycle consisting of a vertebrate host and an Ixodes tick vector. The sequence motifs modified by two well-characterized restriction/modification (R/M) loci of B. burgdorferi type strain B31 were recently described, but the methylation profiles of other Lyme disease Borrelia bacteria have not been characterized. Here, the methylomes of B. burgdorferi type strain B31 and 7 clonal derivatives, along with B. burgdorferi N40, B. burgdorferi 297, B. burgdorferi CA-11, B. afzelii PKo, B. afzelii BO23, and B. garinii PBr, were defined through PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. This analysis revealed 9 novel sequence motifs methylated by the plasmid-encoded restriction/modification enzymes of these Borrelia strains. Furthermore, while a previous analysis of B. burgdorferi B31 revealed an epigenetic impact of methylation on the global transcriptome, the current data contradict those findings; our analyses of wild-type B. burgdorferi B31 revealed no consistent differences in gene expression among isogenic derivatives lacking one or more restriction/modification enzymes. IMPORTANCE The principal causative agent of Lyme disease in humans in the United States is Borrelia burgdorferi, while B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, collectively members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, cause Lyme disease in Europe and Asia. Two plasmid-encoded restriction/modification systems have been shown to limit the genetic transformation of B. burgdorferi type strain B31 with foreign DNA, but little is known about the restriction/modification systems of other Lyme disease Borrelia bacteria. This paper describes the methylation motifs present on genomic DNAs of multiple B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii strains. Contrary to a previous report, we did not find evidence for an epigenetic impact on gene expression by methylation. Knowledge of the motifs recognized and methylated by the restriction/modification enzymes of Lyme disease Borrelia will facilitate molecular genetic investigations of these important human pathogens. Additionally, the similar motifs methylated by orthologous restriction/modification systems of Lyme disease Borrelia bacteria and the presence of these motifs within recombinogenic loci suggest a biological role for these ubiquitous restriction/modification systems in horizontal gene transfer."

		"abstract": "In the northeastern USA, active forest management can include timber harvests designed to meet silvicultural objectives (i.e., harvesting trees that meet certain maturity, height, age, or quality criteria). Timber harvesting is an important tool in enhancing regeneration and maintaining forest health. It also has considerable potential to influence transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens, which are deeply embedded in the forest ecosystem. We conducted a 2-year study to test the hypotheses that recent timber harvesting impacts blacklegged tick density and infection prevalence in managed nonindustrial forests. We found that (1) recent harvesting reduces the presence of nymphal and density of adult blacklegged ticks, (2) recently harvested stands are characterized by understory microclimate conditions that may inhibit tick survival and host-seeking behavior, (3) capture rates of small mammal species frequently parasitized by immature ticks are lower in recently harvested stands compared to control stands with no recent harvest history. In addition, a 1-year pilot study suggests that harvesting does not affect nymphal infection prevalence. Collectively, our results demonstrate that forest structure and understory conditions may impact ticks and the pathogens they transmit via a range of mechanistic pathways, and moreover, active forest management may offer sustainable tools to inhibit entomological risk of exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the landscape."

Subunit and bacterin vaccines are available for the prevention of LD in dogs. LD bacterin vaccines, which are comprised of cell lysates of two strains of B. burgdorferi, contain over 1000 different proteins and cellular constituents. In contrast, subunit vaccines are defined in composition and consist of either outer surface protein (Osp)A or OspA and an OspC chimeritope. In this study, we comparatively assessed antibody responses to OspA and OspC induced by vaccination with all canine bacterin and subunit LD vaccines that are commercially available in North America. Dogs were administered a two-dose series of the vaccine to which they were assigned (3 weeks apart): Subunit-AC, Subunit-A, Bacterin-1, and Bacterin-2. Antibody titers to OspA and OspC were determined by ELISA and the ability of each vaccine to elicit antibodies that recognize diverse OspC proteins (referred to as OspC types) assessed by immunoblot. While all of the vaccines elicited similar OspA antibody responses, only Subunit-AC triggered a robust and broadly cross-reactive antibody response to divergent OspC proteins. The data presented within provide new information regarding vaccination-induced antibody responses to key tick and mammalian phase antigens by both subunit and bacterin LD canine vaccine formulations."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) have complex life cycles involving tick vectors and vertebrate hosts. However, there is limited empirical evidence on the zoonotic circulation of TBPs. In this study, we used a One Health approach to study the possible circulation of TBPs in ticks, animals and humans within a rural household in the foothills of the Fruška Gora mountain, northern Serbia. The presence of TBP DNA was assessed using microfluidic PCR (25 bacterial species, 7 parasite species, 5 bacterial genera, 3 parasite genera) in animal, human and tick samples and the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) RNA was screened for using RT-qPCR on tick samples. In addition, Lyme borreliosis serology was assessed in patients sera. Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Ixodes ricinus ticks were identified on dogs and Haemaphysalis punctata was identified on house walls. Rickettsia helvetica was the most common pathogen detected in pooled R. sanguineus and I. ricinus tick samples, followed by Hepatozoon canis. None of the H. punctata tick samples tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia monacensis were the most frequent pathogens detected in dogs, followed by Rickettsia felis, whereas Anaplasma bovis was the only pathogen found in one of the goats tested. None of the human blood samples collected from family members tested positive for the presence of TBPs. Although microfluidic PCR did not detect Borrelia sp. in any of the tested tick or blood samples, a family member with a history of Lyme disease was seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). We conclude that, despite the presence of TBPs in tick and vertebrate reservoirs, there is no evidence of infection with TBPs across various components of the epidemiological chain in a rural Fruška Gora household."

Transdiaphragmatic pressure is the gold standard for diagnosis of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis, a study that has been reported on few occasions. We present a case of neuralgic amyotrophy associated with Borrelia infection and bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis that provides a detailed follow-up of the spirometric evolution, of the maximum static pressures in the mouth and of transdiaphragmatic pressure from the onset of symptoms and the long term. This case allows us to know one of the possible evolutionary profiles of diaphragmatic dysfunction in neuralgic amyotrophy due to borreliosis."

The common feature of VBDs is that the only way of preventing them is by avoiding the contact between vectors and humans. There are no vaccines, and they will not be available shortly as tools for prevention and control in Argentina. Although dengue outbreaks attracted the attention of mass media from 2009, other VBDs have been affecting public health in Argentina for many decades, as Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. Over these, and others that could potentially settle in the national territory (West Nile, Lyme, etc.), there are repeated mass media claims and political declarations justifying their increase because of climate changes. The argument asserts that the \"tropicalization\" of the climate in temperate regions promotes the installation of VBDs in areas previously unfavorable for them. Although much evidence exists showing that the climate is changing, there is very little evidence that the climate is the main factor promoting the increase of VBDs. In this article, the influence of the so-called climate change on the situation of disease vectors in Argentina (with emphasis on triatomines) and vector control activities implemented by governmental public health agencies are discussed."

Evidence suggests that tick presence, density, infection prevalence and the density of infected ticks can vary between habitats within urban green space, suggesting that the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission can also vary. This study assessed nymph density, Borrelia prevalence and the density of infected nymphs across a range of habitat types in nine parks in London which receive millions of visitors each year. Ixodes ricinus were found in only two of the nine locations sampled, and here they were found in all types of habitat surveyed. Established I. ricinus populations were identified in the two largest parks, both of which had resident free-roaming deer populations. Highest densities of nymphs (15.68 per 100 m2) and infected nymphs (1.22 per 100 m2) were associated with woodland and under canopy habitats in Richmond Park, but ticks infected with Borrelia were found across all habitat types surveyed. Nymphs infected with Borrelia (7.9%) were only reported from Richmond Park, where Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii were identified as the dominant genospecies. Areas with short grass appeared to be less suitable for ticks and maintaining short grass in high footfall areas could be a good strategy for reducing the risk of Lyme borreliosis transmission to humans in such settings. In areas where this would create conflict with existing practices which aim to improve and/or meet historic landscape, biodiversity and public access goals, promoting public health awareness of tick-borne disease risks could also be utilised."

		"abstract": "This article discusses a case involving a pediatric patient who presented to a large urban children's hospital in the Northeastern United States with complaints of migratory monoarticular joint swelling. The patient had presented with a swollen and painful left knee but with no other associated symptoms. He was nontoxic appearing, afebrile, and had normal vital signs. On examination, he was noted to have a tender and swollen left knee that was not erythematous, bruised, or warm to the touch. There was a history of fevers over the summer after returning home from a camping trip in a park located in the northeastern United States. A plain film knee x-ray showed signs of joint effusion but no osseous abnormalities. A bedside ultrasonography of the knee showed a pocket of fluid in the joint space. With parental consent, the left knee joint was aspirated under direct ultrasound guidance, with collection of dark yellow synovial fluid. This was sent for analysis that included cultures, Gram stain, crystal analysis, and Lyme antigens. The patient was admitted, and his symptoms improved during his hospitalization. The results were positive for Lyme and he was discharged home on a 3-week course of Amoxicillin with complete resolution of his symptoms."

In this retrospective cohort study of adults with definite or possible LNB, clinical and microbiological characteristics and long-term outcome over 12 months were evaluated at a single medical center. Severity of acute disease and long-term outcome were assessed using a composite clinical score encompassing clinical findings and symptoms and by the probability of incomplete recovery. Amongst 311 adult patients enrolled from 2008 to 2017, 139 (44.7%) had definite LNB and 172 (55.3%) had possible LNB. The most frequent LNB manifestation was cranial neuropathy with or without meningitis (53.4%). Patients with definite LNB more often had Bannwarth syndrome (53.2% vs. 18.6%), more severe disease (6 points vs. 4 points), longer pre-treatment duration (median 21 days vs. 13.5 days), higher cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis (median 139 × 106 /L vs. 11 × 106 /L) and higher rate of Borrelia seropositivity (84.2% vs. 68.6%) than those with possible LNB. Ceftriaxone was prescribed more often than oral doxycycline in definite LNB than in possible LNB (96.4% vs. 65.7%). Unfavorable outcomes decreased during follow-up, being higher in patients with more severe disease at enrollment and in those with possible LNB, but were not associated with antibiotic therapy. Early LNB, most often presenting as cranial neuropathy, was definitively diagnosed in less than half of cases. A better diagnostic approach is needed to confirm borrelial etiology. Ceftriaxone was not superior to doxycycline in the treatment of early LNB, regardless of diagnostic certainty.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, traverses through vastly distinct environments between the tick vector and the multiple phases of the mammalian infection that requires genetic adaptation for the progression of pathogenesis. Borrelial gene expression is highly responsive to changes in specific environmental signals that initiate the RpoS regulon for mammalian adaptation, but the mechanism(s) for direct detection of environmental cues has yet to be identified. Secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) produced by adenylate cyclase is responsive to environmental signals, such as carbon source and pH, in many bacterial pathogens to promote virulence by altering gene regulation. B. burgdorferi encodes a single non-toxin class IV adenylate cyclase (bb0723, cyaB). This study investigates cyaB expression along with its influence on borrelial virulence regulation and mammalian infectivity. Expression of cyaB was specifically induced with co-incubation of mammalian host cells that was not observed with cultivated tick cells suggesting that cyaB expression is influenced by cellular factor(s) unique to mammalian cell lines. The 3' end of cyaB also encodes a small RNA, SR0623, in the same orientation that overlaps with bb0722. The differential processing of cyaB and SR0623 transcripts may alter the ability to influence function in the form of virulence determinant regulation and infectivity. Two independent cyaB deletion B31 strains were generated in 5A4-NP1 and ML23 backgrounds and complemented with the cyaB ORF alone that truncates SR0623, cyaB with intact SR0623, or cyaB with a mutagenized full-length SR0623 to evaluate the influence on transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of borrelial virulence factors and infectivity. In the absence of cyaB, the expression and production of ospC was significantly reduced, while the protein levels for BosR and DbpA were substantially lower than parental strains. Infectivity studies with both independent cyaB mutants demonstrated an attenuated phenotype with reduced colonization of tissues during early disseminated infection. This work suggests that B. burgdorferi utilizes cyaB and potentially cAMP as a regulatory pathway to modulate borrelial gene expression and protein production to promote borrelial virulence and dissemination in the mammalian host."

Many have argued that a health frame increases engagement, as do visual methodologies including online and interactive platforms, yet to date there has been limited research on audience responses to health messaging using visual interventions. This study explores public attitudes regarding communication tools focused on climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease through six focus groups (n = 61) in rural and urban southern Manitoba, Canada. The results add to the growing evidence of the efficacy of visual and storytelling methods in climate communications and argues for a continuum of mediums: moving from video, text, to maps. Findings underscore the importance of tailoring both communication messages and mediums to increase uptake of adaptive health and environmental behaviours, for some audiences bridging health and climate change while for others strategically decoupling them."

To date, B. mayonii has been isolated from two vertebrate host species in Minnesota: field-caught white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque; Rodentia: Cricetidae) and American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben). Here, we describe the first detection of B. mayonii in field-caught eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus L. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)) from northern Wisconsin. During our study, we captured 530 unique small mammals and found an infection prevalence of 23.50% in field-caught eastern chipmunks (4/17) and 1.19% in Peromyscus spp. (5/420). Mean larval and nymphal burdens were determined for captured Blarina brevicauda (0, 0), Glaucomys volans (0.29, 0.14), Myodes gapperi (0.27, 0), Napaeozapus insignis (0, 0.25), Peromyscus spp. (1.88, 0.11), T. striatus (1.06, 0.65), and Sorex cinereus (0.09, 0). The high B. mayonii infection prevalence in eastern chipmunks suggests that the species may be an important reservoir for B. mayonii in the Upper Midwest."

		"abstract": "Bilateral facial palsy (BFP) is exceedingly rare, representing only 0.3%-2.0% of facial palsy cases. Unlike unilateral facial palsy, it is often caused by a serious underlying systemic disease and therefore warrants urgent medical intervention. The differential diagnosis is broad, and detailed history, physical examination, and investigations are essential for identifying the etiology. Common acquired causes in existing case series include Lyme disease, Guillain-Barré syndrome, sarcoidosis, trauma, and Bell's palsy. Palsy that develops rapidly is often caused by trauma, infections, or autoimmune disorders, whereas slow progressive palsy suggests neoplastic diseases. While management varies by etiology, the physician can consider early empiric corticosteroids given their efficacy in numerous differential diagnoses. Antivirals can be considered in those with a strong history of viral prodrome. In this paper, we present the case of a puerperal patient with BFP and discuss its differential diagnosis, diagnostic approach, and management."

A patient-level simulation model was built to incorporate effectiveness estimation from a structured focused literature review, and health-care cost inputs for the United States, Germany, and Italy. Simulated clinical outcomes were 1) percent of patients with timely and correct diagnosis, 2) patients appropriately treated and exposed to antibiotics therapy, and 3) patients with late Lyme disease manifestations. Expected health outcomes were expressed in terms of differences in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) due to disseminated Lyme disease and persisting symptoms, and economic outcomes were analyzed from a third-party payer perspective. The DiaSorin LDA resulted in a better sensitivity compared to sTTT and mTTT, 84% vs 49% and 45%, respectively, in the base case (13% of infected patients in the tested population). Due to the improved diagnostic performance, the LDA-based strategy is expected to be more effective, providing mean incremental 0.024 QALYs per tested patient, or 0.19 per infected patient. Furthermore, from a third-party payer perspective, the adoption of the LDA-based strategy would reduce the expected health-care cost for suspected and confirmed Lyme disease by roughly 40%, ie about $410, €130, and €170 per tested patient in the United States, Germany, and Italy, respectively, compared to sTTT. The results are most sensitive to the infection rate in the tested population, with LDA maintaining a cost advantage for Lyme disease active infection rates ≥0.8-2.5%. LDA early diagnostic testing and subsequent treatment of subjects with early Lyme disease without EM are expected to outperform traditional management strategies both clinically and economically in the US, Germany, and Italy."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) is the most common pathogen of medical significance transmitted by ticks of the family Ixodidae in Belarus. Human infection with B. burgdorferi causes Lyme borreliosis, most commonly referred to as Lyme disease. Currently, 20 species of Lyme disease-associated Borrelia and more than 20 relapsing fever-associated Borrelia species have been identified. These etiologic agents belong to the genus Borrelia in the family Spirochaetaceae. Genetically characterized isolates with specific sequences have proven that these pathogens are endemically transmitted in many European and Asian countries. In addition, joinpoint regression analysis is often applied to characterize infection trends over time and to identify the time point(s) at which the trend significantly changes. In this epidemiological investigation, joinpoint analysis was applied to investigate the temporal trend of B. burgdorferi s.l. infections in 4070 ticks collected between April and October 2012-2019. Detection of Borrelia species in ticks is an important tool to determine temporal and geographic distribution and abundance, and to predict the risk of Lyme disease to people in different regions. Our data provide a basis for further studies to determine the distribution and abundance of B. burgdorferi s.l. species in Belarus."

		"abstract": "Transmission of the causative agents of numerous infectious diseases might be potentially conducted by various routes if this is supported by the genetics of the pathogen. Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host-pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans' habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

		"abstract": "Ticks are important vectors of various pathogens that result in clinical illnesses in humans and domestic and wild animals. Information regarding tick infestations and pathogens transmitted by ticks is important for the identification and prevention of disease. This study was a large-scale investigation of ticks collected from dogs and their associated environments in the Republic of Korea (ROK). It included detecting six prevalent tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma spp., A. platys, Borrelia spp., Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis, and E. chaffeensis). A total of 2293 ticks (1110 pools) were collected. Haemaphysalis longicornis (98.60%) was the most frequently collected tick species, followed by Ixodes nipponensis (0.96%) and H. flava (0.44%). Anaplasma spp. (24/1110 tick pools; 2.16%) and Borrelia spp. (4/1110 tick pools; 0.36%) were detected. The phylogenetic analyses using 16S rRNA genes revealed that the Anaplasma spp. detected in this study were closely associated with A. phagocytophilum reported in humans and rodents in the ROK. Borrelia spp. showed phylogenetic relationships with B. theileri and B. miyamotoi in ticks and humans in Mali and Russia. These results demonstrate the importance of tick-borne disease surveillance and control in dogs in the ROK."

		"abstract": "The hard tick Ixodes ricinus is a vector of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Host blood protein digestion, essential for tick development and reproduction, occurs in tick midgut digestive cells driven by cathepsin proteases. Little is known about the regulation of the digestive proteolytic machinery of I. ricinus. Here we characterize a novel cystatin-type protease inhibitor, mialostatin, from the I. ricinus midgut. Blood feeding rapidly induced mialostatin expression in the gut, which continued after tick detachment. Recombinant mialostatin inhibited a number of I. ricinus digestive cysteine cathepsins, with the greatest potency observed against cathepsin L isoforms, with which it co-localized in midgut digestive cells. The crystal structure of mialostatin was determined at 1.55 Å to explain its unique inhibitory specificity. Finally, mialostatin effectively blocked in vitro proteolysis of blood proteins by midgut cysteine cathepsins. Mialostatin is likely to be involved in the regulation of gut-associated proteolytic pathways, making midgut cystatins promising targets for tick control strategies."

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis should be performed if Lyme neuroborreliosis is suspected.

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the etiological agent of Lyme disease, produces a series of simple glycolipids where diacylglycerol and cholesterol serve as the precursor. The cholesterol-based glycolipids, cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal) and cholesteryl-β-D-galactopyranoside (CGal) are immunogenic and proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Detailed studies of CGal and ACGal in Bb have been hampered by a lack of knowledge of their underlying biosynthetic processes. The genome of Bb encodes four putative glycosyltransferases, and only one of these, BB0572, was predicted to be an inverting family 2 glycosyltransferase (GT2 enzyme) capable of using UDP-galactose as a substrate and forming a β-glycosidic bond. Comparison of the 42 kDa BB0572 amino acid sequence from Bb with other Borrelia spp demonstrates that this protein is highly conserved. To establish BB0572 as the galactosyltransferase capable of cholesterol glycolipid formation in Bb, the protein was produced as a recombinant product in Escherichia coli and tested in a cell-free assay with 14C-cholesterol and UDP-galactose as the substrates. This experiment resulted in a radiolabeled lipid that migrated with the cholesterol glycolipid standard of CGal when evaluated by thin layer chromatography. Additionally, mutation in the predicted active site of BB0572 resulted in a recombinant protein that was unable to catalyze the formation of the cholesterol glycolipid. These data characterize BB0572 as a putative cholesterol galactosyltransferase. This provides the first step in understanding how Bb cholesterol glycolipids are formed and will allow investigations into their involvement in pathogen transmission and disease development."

		"abstract": "The skin lesion erythema migrans (EM) is an initial sign of the Ixodes tick-transmitted Borreliella spirochetal infection known as Lyme disease. T cells and innate immune cells have previously been shown to predominate the EM lesion and promote the reaction. Despite the established importance of B cells and antibodies in preventing infection, the role of B cells in the skin immune response to Borreliella is unknown. Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq in conjunction with B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing to immunophenotype EM lesions and their associated B cells and BCR repertoires. We found that B cells were more abundant in EM in comparison with autologous uninvolved skin; many were clonally expanded and had circulating relatives. EM-associated B cells upregulated the expression of MHC class II genes and exhibited preferential IgM isotype usage. A subset also exhibited low levels of somatic hypermutation despite a gene expression profile consistent with memory B cells. Our study demonstrates that single-cell gene expression with paired BCR sequencing can be used to interrogate the sparse B cell populations in human skin and reveals that B cells in the skin infection site in early Lyme disease expressed a phenotype consistent with local antigen presentation and antibody production."

How often these pathogens cause human disease is unknown. In addition, diagnostic tools to identify such diseases are lacking or reserved to research laboratories. To elucidate their prevalence and disease burden, the study 'Ticking on Pandora's Box' has been initiated, a collaborative effort between Amsterdam University Medical Center and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment. The study investigates how often the tick-borne pathogens Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia species, Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis, spotted fever group Rickettsia species and/or tick-borne encephalitis virus cause an acute febrile illness after tick-bite. We aim to determine the impact and severity of these tick-borne diseases in the Netherlands by measuring their prevalence and describing their clinical picture and course of disease. The study is designed as a prospective case-control study. We aim to include 150 cases - individuals clinically suspected of a tick-borne disease - and 3 matched healthy control groups of 200 persons each. The controls consist respectively of a group of individuals with either a tick-bite without complaints, the general population and of healthy blood donors. During a one-year follow-up we will acquire blood, urine and skin biopsy samples and ticks at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. Additionally, participants answer modified versions of validated questionnaires to assess self-reported symptoms, among which the SF-36, on a 3 monthly basis. This article describes the background and design of the study protocol of 'Ticking on Pandora's Box'. With our study we hope to provide insight into the prevalence, clinical presentation and disease burden of the tick-borne diseases anaplasmosis, babesiosis, B. miyamotoi disease, neoehrlichiosis, rickettsiosis and tick-borne encephalitis and to assist in test development as well as provide recommendations for national guidelines.

The sera were tested for Lyme disease by standard two-tiered testing (STTT) and anti-C6 antibodies by ELISA and the levels of IFN-γ in the blood samples were detected by QuantiFERON ELISA. A positive STTT result supported the clinical diagnosis of 37 (54%) subjects and anti-C6 antibodies were detected in 45 (66%) subjects, including 36 (97%) STTT-positive subjects, and the responses often persisted or expanded after antibiotic therapy.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multisystem disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection and accounts for well-defined manifestations, appearing either at an early or late stage. Appropriate antibiotic therapy generally leads to a favorable outcome. Still, unspecific persisting symptoms such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia or cognitive dysfunction are reported by several patients months to years after adequate treatment. Their underlying pathophysiologic mechanism is unclear. However, there is no evidence for microbiological persistence in these cases and attempts to resolve the symptoms by repeated or prolonged antibiotic treatment have not been convincingly successful, but they may rather be harmful. To narrow down the controversially handled entity of posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) and to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, case definitions have been proposed, acknowledging PTLDS as a complex of nonspecific, subjective symptoms, which are neither caused by ongoing infection nor by any other identifiable disease. PTLDS is mainly a diagnosis of exclusion and requires careful evaluation of differential diagnosis followed by counseling about optimal management in light of missing specific therapeutic options."

Herein, we sought to identify other HLA-DR-presented Pc peptides and source proteins from the PBMC of additional patients to better understand Pc immune responses and RA disease pathogenesis. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we searched for HLA-DR-presented Pc peptides in PBMC from RA and Lyme arthritis (LA) patients. The identified peptides and source proteins were tested for reactivity in RA patients, those with other arthritides, or the general population; the results were correlated with clinical findings. Including Pc-p27, we have identified 5 HLA-DR-presented Pc peptides, each derived from a different Pc protein, in 3 of 4 RA patients, but none in 2 LA patients. When tested in our RA cohort, 14 of 19 patients (74%) had T cell responses and 47 of 89 patients (53%) had IgG or IgA responses with ≥1 of the 5 Pc peptides or proteins, most commonly IgA reactivity with Pc-p27. Additionally, 74% of RA patients with IgA antibodies to ≥1 Pc protein had anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) compared with 49% of patients who lacked IgA Pc antibody responses (P=0.05), and IgA Pc antibody levels correlated with ACPA values. The majority of our RA patients had Pc immune responses. The correlation of IgA Pc antibodies, particularly to Pc-p27, with ACPA supports the hypothesis that specific microbial antigens in the mucosa have a role in shaping or amplifying immune responses in RA joints."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), which transmits Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has undergone rapid range expansion in Ontario. In horses, Lyme disease remains an enigmatic disease, with limited understanding of the pathogenesis and many issues pertaining to selection and interpretation of laboratory tests. We evaluated B. burgdorferi seropositivity in naturally exposed horses over a 12-mo period and compared paired samples with 2 common serologic tests. Serum samples were collected in 2017, ~1 y after initial testing, from a cohort of 22 horses that were seropositive in a 2016 seroprevalence study. Samples were tested using a C6 ELISA and a multiplex ELISA targeting outer surface proteins A, C, and F. 1 y after initial testing, 14 of 22 (64%) horses remained seropositive; 7 (32%) were positive on the multiplex ELISA, 2 (9%) on C6 ELISA, and 5 (23%) on both tests. Repeatability was 100% for the C6 ELISA, and 95% for the multiplex ELISA, with no significant difference between paired sample multiplex titer values. Our results indicate strong intra-test reliability, although further investigation is required to determine the clinical significance of serologic testing."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi) can cause a variety of clinical manifestations including Lyme neuroborreliosis. Following the tick-borne transmission, B. burgdorferi initially evade immune responses, later symptomatic infection is associated with occurrence of specific antibody responses. We hypothesized that B. burgdorferi induce immune hyporesponsiveness or immune suppression and aimed to investigate patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis ability to respond to immune stimulation. An observational cohort study investigating the stimulated immune response by standardized whole blood assay (TruCulture®) in adult patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis included at time of diagnosis from 01.09.2018-31.07.2020. Reference intervals were based on a 5-95% range of cytokine concentrations from healthy individuals (n = 32). Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis and references were compared using Mann-Whitney U test. Heatmaps of cytokine responses were generated using the webtool Clustvis. In total, 22 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (19 definite, 3 probable) were included. In the unstimulated samples, the concentrations of cytokines in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis were comparable with references, except interferon (IFN)-α, interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-1β and IL-8, which were all significantly below the references. Patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis had similar concentrations of most cytokines in all stimulations compared with references. IFN-α, IFN-γ, IL-12 and IL-17A were lower than references in multiple stimulations. In this exploratory cohort study, we found lower or similar concentrations of circulating cytokines in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis at time of diagnosis compared with references. The stimulated cytokine release in blood from patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis was in general slightly lower than in the references. Specific patterns of low IL-12 and IFN-γ indicated low Th1-response and low concentrations of IL-17A did not support a strong Th17 response. Our results suggest that patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis elicit a slightly suppressed or impaired immune response for the investigated stimulations, however, whether the response normalizes remains unanswered."

		"abstract": "The complex etiology of neurodegenerative disease has prompted studies on multiple mechanisms including genetic predisposition, brain biochemistry, immunological responses, and microbial insult. In particular, Lyme disease is often associated with neurocognitive impairment with variable manifestations between patients. We sought to develop methods to reliably detect Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete bacteria responsible for Lyme disease, in autopsy specimens of patients with a history of neurocognitive disease. In this report, we describe the use of multiple molecular detection techniques for this pathogen and its application to a case study of a Lyme disease patient. The patient had a history of Lyme disease, was treated with antibiotics, and years later developed chronic symptoms including dementia. The patient's pathology and clinical case description was consistent with Lewy body dementia. B. burgdorferi was identified by PCR in several CNS tissues and by immunofluorescent staining in the spinal cord. These studies offer proof of the principle that persistent infection with the Lyme disease spirochete may have lingering consequences on the CNS."

		"abstract": "Expectancies about symptom improvement or deterioration are reliable predictors of symptom progression and treatment outcomes (symptom resolution or symptomatic improvement) in many (non-)pharmacological studies and treatments. This study examined predictors of symptom improvement after antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, hypothesizing particularly pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement to be predictive. A predictive study was performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment individual characteristics, including expectancies, and physical and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) from the PLEASE-trial comparing randomized 12-weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. At end-of-treatment (14 weeks after trial start) and follow-up (52 weeks), complete data of 231 and 170 (of initial 280) patients with persistent symptoms temporally related to a history of erythema migrans or otherwise confirmed symptomatic Lyme disease, or accompanied by B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM antibodies, were examined through hierarchical regression analyses. In addition to pre-treatment HRQoL, pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement were consistently associated with stronger physical and mental HRQoL improvements at both end-of-treatment and follow-up (95% CI range: .09;.54, p < .01 to .27;.92, p < .001). Post-treatment expectancies regarding having received antibiotics vs. placebo was associated with more HRQoL improvement at end-of-treatment, but not at follow-up (95% CI-range 1.00;4.75, p = .003 to -7.34; -2.22, p < .001). The present study shows that, next to pre-treatment functioning, patients' pre-treatment and post-treatment expectancies regarding improvement of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease relate to a more beneficial symptom course. Expectancies of patients may be relevant to explain and potentially improve patient outcomes (e.g., by optimized communication about treatment success). ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01207739 (Registration date: 23-09-2010) Key Points • As there is currently no sufficient symptom resolution or symptomatic improvement for many patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, it is relevant to know which factors determine symptom progression and predict heterogeneity in treatment response. • Next to pre-treatment functioning, expectancies regarding symptom improvement and having received antimicrobial study medication are associated with a more beneficial symptom course after both shorter-term and longer-term antimicrobial treatment. • Expectancies are relevant to consider in treatment studies and may be useful in clinical settings to improve symptom course and treatment outcome (e.g., by optimized communication about treatment success)."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are a growing problem in many parts of the world, and their surveillance and control touch on challenging issues in medical entomology, agricultural health, veterinary medicine, and biosecurity. Spatial approaches can be used to synthesize the data generated by integrative One Health surveillance systems, and help stakeholders, managers, and medical geographers understand the current and future distribution of risk. Here, we performed a systematic review of over 8,000 studies and identified a total of 303 scientific publications that map tick-borne diseases using data on vectors, pathogens, and hosts (including wildlife, livestock, and human cases). We find that the field is growing rapidly, with the major Ixodes-borne diseases (Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in particular) giving way to monitoring efforts that encompass a broader range of threats. We find a tremendous diversity of methods used to map tick-borne disease, but also find major gaps: data on the enzootic cycle of tick-borne pathogens is severely underutilized, and mapping efforts are mostly limited to Europe and North America. We suggest that future work can readily apply available methods to track the distributions of tick-borne diseases in Africa and Asia, following a One Health approach that combines medical and veterinary surveillance for maximum impact."

		"abstract": "Currently, various zoonotic diseases are classified as emerging or reemerging. Because equids have a direct relationship with various vectors, they are possibly more frequently exposed to zoonotic agents than are humans. The undeniable importance of diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis, spotted fever, and leishmaniasis for both public and animal health, as well as the possibility of equids acting as sources, reservoirs, or even sentinels for these pathogens, justifies the detection of their frequency and factors associated with infection in equids from northeastern Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 569 equids (528 horses, 33 donkeys, and 8 mules), 516 from a rural area and 53 from an urban area. Pathogen detection was carried out as follows: Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp., serological analysis; Leishmania spp., serological analysis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Anaplasma phagocytophilum, PCR. Determination of associated factors was carried out through generalized linear models. The frequencies of positivity for the pathogens observed in equids were as follows: Borrelia spp., 13.9% (79/569); Leishmania spp., 3.5% (20/569); Rickettsia spp. 33.4% (190/569). Regarding factors associated with infection, male sex was associated with protection against Borrelia spp.; donkeys and mules were associated with protection against Rickettsia spp., while a younger age was a risk factor. The infection of A. phagocytophilum was not detected in the sampled population. Co-infection was detected in 5.1% (29/569) of the animals. Most of the studied pathogenic agents are present in the prospected area, indicating a possible risk for both human and animal health. This demonstrates that equids can be considered important sentinels in the assessment of pathogens with zoonotic potential in the region."

		"abstract": "Arthropod vectors carry vector-borne pathogens that cause infectious disease in vertebrate hosts, and arthropod-associated microbiota, which consists of non-pathogenic microorganisms. Vector-borne pathogens and the microbiota can both influence the fitness of their arthropod vectors, and hence the epidemiology of vector-borne diseases. The bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which causes Lyme borreliosis in Europe, is transmitted among vertebrate reservoir hosts by Ixodes ricinus ticks, which also harbour a diverse microbiota of non-pathogenic bacteria. The purpose of this controlled study was to test whether B. afzelii and the tick-associated microbiota influence the fitness of I. ricinus. Eggs obtained from field-collected adult female ticks were surface sterilized (with bleach and ethanol), which reduced the abundance of the bacterial microbiota in the hatched I. ricinus larvae by 28-fold compared to larvae that hatched from control eggs washed with water. The dysbiosed and control larvae were subsequently fed on B. afzelii-infected or uninfected control mice, and the engorged larvae were left to moult into nymphs under laboratory conditions. I. ricinus larvae that fed on B. afzelii-infected mice had a significantly faster larva-to-nymph moulting time compared to larvae that fed on uninfected control mice, but the effect was small (2.4% reduction) and unlikely to be biologically significant. We found no evidence that B. afzelii infection or reduction of the larval microbiota influenced the four other life history traits of the immature I. ricinus ticks, which included engorged larval weight, unfed nymphal weight, larva-to-nymph moulting success, and immature tick survival. A retrospective power analysis found that our sampling effort had sufficient power (> 80%) to detect small effects (differences of 5% to 10%) of our treatments. Under the environmental conditions of this study, we conclude that B. afzelii and the egg surface microbiota had no meaningful effects on tick fitness and hence on the R0 of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii has a worldwide distribution and a very wide host range, infecting most warm-blooded hosts. Approximately 30% of humanity is infected with T. gondii, but clinical toxoplasmosis is relatively infrequent. Toxoplasmosis has a wide range of clinical symptoms involving almost all organ systems. In most persons that acquire infection postnatally, symptoms (when present) are mild and mimic other diseases such as flu, Lyme disease, Q fever, hematological alterations, or mumps. It is likely that clinical disease is more common than reported. The ingestion of infected meat or food and water contaminated with oocysts are the two main modes of postnatal transmission of Toxoplasma gondii. The infective dose and the incubation period of T. gondii infection are unknown because there are no human volunteer experiments. Here, I have critically reviewed outbreaks of clinical toxoplasmosis in humans for the past 55 years, 1966-2020. Information from oocyst-acquired versus meat-acquired infections was assessed separately. Most outbreaks were from Brazil. There were no apparent differences in types or severity of symptoms in meat- versus oocyst-acquired infections. Fever, cervical lymphadenopathy, myalgia, and fatigue were the most important symptoms, and these symptoms were not age-dependent. The incubation period was 7-30 days. A genetic predisposition to cause eye disease is suspected in the parasites responsible for three outbreaks (in Brazil, Canada, and India). Only a few T. gondii tissue cysts might suffice to cause infection, as indicated by outbreaks affecting some (but not all) individuals sharing a meal of infected meat. Whether the high frequency of outbreaks of toxoplasmosis in humans in Brazil is related to environmental contamination, poor hygiene, socioeconomic conditions, or to genotypes of T. gondii needs investigation."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether contrast sensitivity (CS) is altered in patients with PTLD compared with healthy controls and, second, whether CS is associated with cognitive and/or neurologic deficits. CS was measured using a Pelli-Robson chart with forced-choice procedures, and the total number of letters read was recorded for each eye. CS impairment was defined for age <60 years as logCS of 1.80 (36 letters or fewer) and for those age ≥60 years as logCS of 1.65 (33 letters or fewer). Participants self-administered a questionnaire to assess presence of ocular symptoms and underwent a neurologic exam and battery of neurocognitive tests. CS impairment was associated with an increased odds of being in the PTLD group that was 2.6 times as high as those without CS impairment (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.2). Neither cases nor controls had significant distance acuity impairment. CS impairment was not associated with any of the ocular complaints in cases but was borderline associated with neurologic abnormalities and cognitive impairment. CS impairment in patients with PTLD is linked to signs of cognitive and neurologic impairment and may be a marker of illness severity. Further investigation into the value of testing CS impairment in PTLD cases is warranted, especially if it is an indicator of cognitive or neurologic manifestations."

Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose individuals early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that individuals may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to individuals for whom referral is recommended."

		"abstract": "Macrophages play prominent roles in bacteria recognition and clearance, including Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochete. To elucidate mechanisms by which MyD88/TLR signaling enhances clearance of Bb by macrophages, we studied wildtype (WT) and MyD88-/- Bb-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). MyD88-/- BMDMs exhibit impaired uptake of spirochetes but comparable maturation of phagosomes following internalization of spirochetes. RNA-sequencing of infected WT and MyD88-/- BMDMs identified a large cohort of differentially expressed MyD88-dependent genes associated with re-organization of actin and cytoskeleton during phagocytosis along with several MyD88-independent chemokines involved in inflammatory cell recruitment. We computationally generated networks which identified several MyD88-dependent intermediate proteins (Rhoq and Cyfip1) that are known to mediate inflammation and phagocytosis respectively. Our findings show that MyD88 signaling enhances, but is not required, for bacterial uptake or phagosomal maturation and provide mechanistic insights into how MyD88-mediated phagosomal signaling enhances Bb uptake and clearance."

Some adverse events may occur during treatment, including photosensitivity reactions, which are divided in phototoxic or photoallergic. We performed a systematic search on Pubmed, Cochrane and Embase from database inception to August 9, 2020 aim to summarize all available papers on photosensitive reactions related to tetracyclines in all clinical settings where they are used on human being. On the basis of our inclusion criteria, we selected only randomized controlled trials, open comparative trials and prospective cohort studies performed on both volunteers and patients, moreover we included a pharmacovigilance register. Thirty-eight articles met inclusion criteria, describing photo-sensitive effects due to doxycycline, minocycline, tetracycline, lymecycline, sarecycline, demethylchlortetracycline, chlortetracycline and metacycline, across six diagnoses (acne, Lyme disease, Gulf Veteran Illness, adbominal aortic aneurysms, traveler's diarrhea and pterygium) and several volunteers who were deliberately exposed to natural or artificial light sources. Not all drugs belonging to tetracyclines class are available to date, moreover the studies included lacked a homogeneous design and most of them involved a scarce number of patients, including reactions induced in volunteers during photo-testing. Available data on incidence, severity and clinical relevance of tetracyclines-related photo-sensitive reactions are scarce, heterogeneous and weak. What we can extrapolate is that some tetracyclines are more often related to phototoxic skin reactions than others and some of those seem to have a very low risk of phototoxicity."

This study investigates potential effects of these local anaesthetics on growth of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss), Borrelia bavariensis (Bbav) and Borrelia afzelii (Ba). For this purpose, Borrelia spp. organisms were either continuously or temporarily exposed to one of four local anaesthetics preparations: 20 mg/ml procaine hydrochloride (P); 10 mg/ml ropivacaine hydrochloride (R); 20 mg/ml lidocaine hydrochloride (L1, L2). L2 also contained the preservatives methyl-benzoate and propyl-benzoate, whereas P, R and L1 did not. All four local anaesthetic preparations inhibited in vitro growth of Borrelia spp. depending on concentration and exposure time. There are differences in sensitivity among the Borrelia spp. with Bbav being more susceptible to growth inhibition than Bbss and Ba. When comparing the different local anaesthetic preparations with their regard to inhibition of growth of Borrelia spp. organisms, P showed the lowest impact. It cannot be completely excluded that preservatives present in L2, methyl-benzoate and propyl-benzoate, may be a reason for further inhibition of Borrelia spp. organisms. Concentrations of local anaesthetics used in these experiments may also be present in the skin of patients during regular medical procedures. These are preliminary findings and further experiments, preferably in vivo, are necessary. To minimize the risk to produce false negative results with cultures, we recommend using procaine in a preparation without preservatives for local anaesthesia prior to skin sampling."

		"abstract": "Ticks and the pathogens they transmit, including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths, constitute a growing burden for human and animal health worldwide. The ability of some animal species to acquire resistance to blood-feeding by ticks after a single or repeated infestation is known as acquired tick resistance (ATR). This resistance has been associated to tick-specific IgE response, the generation of skin-resident memory CD4+ T cells, basophil recruitment, histamine release, and epidermal hyperplasia. ATR has also been associated with protection to tick-borne tularemia through allergic klendusity, a disease-escaping ability produced by the development of hypersensitivity to an allergen. In addition to pathogen transmission, tick infestation in humans is associated with the α-Gal syndrome (AGS), a type of allergy characterized by an IgE response against the carbohydrate Galα1-3Gal (α-Gal). This glycan is present in tick salivary proteins and on the surface of tick-borne pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agents of Lyme disease and granulocytic anaplasmosis. Most α-Gal-sensitized individuals develop IgE specific against this glycan, but only a small fraction develop the AGS. This review summarizes our current understanding of ATR and its impact on the continuum α-Gal sensitization, allergy, and the AGS. We propose that the α-Gal-specific IgE response in humans is an evolutionary adaptation associated with ATR and allergic klendusity with the trade-off of developing AGS."

We describe a 49-year-old woman with erosive genital ulcerations, secondary EM rashes and jagged skin lesions associated with Lyme disease. The skin rashes exhibited fibers characteristic of Morgellons disease. Molecular testing confirmed the presence of Borrelia DNA in both vaginal culture and serum specimens. In further studies on a secondary EM lesion containing filaments, Gömöri trichrome staining revealed the presence of collagen in the filaments, while Dieterle and anti-Borrelia immunostaining revealed intracellular and extracellular Borrelia organisms. Intracellular staining for Borrelia was also observed in lymphocytic infiltrates. Lyme disease may present with a variety of genital lesions and dermatological manifestations including Morgellons disease. Careful evaluation is required to determine the presence of Borrelia organisms associated with these dermopathies."

		"abstract": "The bacterial pathogen responsible for causing Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is an atypical Gram-negative spirochete that is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. In diderms, peptidoglycan (PG) is sandwiched between the inner and outer membrane of the cell envelope. In many other Gram-negative bacteria, PG is bound by protein(s), which provide both structural integrity and continuity between envelope layers. Here, we present evidence of a peptidoglycan-associated protein (PAP) in B. burgdorferi. Using an unbiased proteomics approach, we identified Neutrophil Attracting Protein A (NapA) as a PAP. Interestingly, NapA is a Dps homologue, which typically functions to bind and protect cellular DNA from damage during times of stress. While B. burgdorferi NapA is known to be involved in the oxidative stress response, it lacks the critical residues necessary for DNA binding. Biochemical and cellular studies demonstrate that NapA is localized to the B. burgdorferi periplasm and is indeed a PAP. Cryo-electron microscopy indicates that mutant bacteria, unable to produce NapA, have structural abnormalities. Defects in cell-wall integrity impact growth rate and cause the napA mutant to be more susceptible to osmotic and PG-specific stresses. NapA-linked PG is secreted in outer membrane vesicles and augments IL-17 production, relative to PG alone. Using microfluidics, we demonstrate that NapA acts as a molecular beacon-exacerbating the pathogenic properties of B. burgdorferi PG. These studies further our understanding of the B. burgdorferi cell envelope, provide critical information that underlies its pathogenesis, and highlight how a highly conserved bacterial protein can evolve mechanistically, while maintaining biological function."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia spp. are tick-borne pathogenic spirochetes that include the agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. As part of their life cycle, the spirochetes traffic between the tick vector and the vertebrate host, which requires significant physiological changes and remodeling of their outer membranes and proteome. This crucial proteome resculpting is carried out by a diverse set of proteases, adaptor proteins, and related chaperones. Despite its small genome, Borrelia burgdorferi has dedicated a large percentage of its genome to proteolysis, including a full complement of ATP-dependent proteases. Energy-driven proteolysis appears to be an important physiological feature of this dual-life-cycle bacterium. The proteolytic arsenal of Borrelia is strategically deployed for disposal of proteins no longer required as they move from one stage to another or are transferred from one host to another. Likewise, the Borrelia spp. are systemic organisms that need to break down and move through host tissues and barriers, and so their unique proteolytic resources, both endogenous and borrowed, make movement more feasible. Both the Lyme disease and relapsing fever Borrelia spp. bind plasminogen as well as numerous components of the mammalian plasminogen-activating system. This recruitment capacity endows the spirochetes with a borrowed proteolytic competency that can lead to increased invasiveness."

Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease, and Mount Desert Island, Maine, home to Acadia National Park, currently is affected by a high Lyme disease burden. Ticks have many natural predators, including ants, although no previous studies have investigated interactions between these two species. To test the hypothesis that the presence of M. rubra alters I. scapularis abundance, we collected ticks by drag-sampling at eight ant-infested sites and eight uninfested control sites in Acadia National Park. We found that nymph density was significantly higher at ant-infested sites, while larval density was significantly higher at control sites. In addition, we conducted a laboratory bioassay to measure M. rubra aggression against I. scapularis larvae, nymphs, and adults and Dermacentor variabilis adults, and found that ant aggression was significantly higher against D. variabilis adults than I. scapularis adults. Our findings support the hypothesis that M. rubra has divergent effects across I. scapularis life stages, and we discuss possible ecological mechanisms, including optimal microclimate and predation, that could promote density of nymphs while inhibiting density of larvae."

		"abstract": "The incidence and prevalence of Lyme disease are expanding and rising, respectively, which constitutes a worldwide public health problem. The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Lyme disease (LD) in Qiongzhong County, Hainan, and to determine the LD infection level in the local population, so as to provide evidence for further local LD surveillance as well as effective prevention and treatment measures. A total of 252 serum samples were collected from cases with suspected LD in Qiongzhong County, including 159 and 93 cases with joint and neurological symptoms, respectively. The serum samples were preliminarily screened for LD antibodies by indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA). Western Blot (WB) was used to confirm the diagnosis of IFA positive serum samples. Of the 252 serum samples, 39 tested positive by indirect immunofluorescence, translating to a positive rate of 15.48%. Of these 39 positive serum samples, western blot testing confirmed 28 to be positive for LD antibodies, representing a positive rate of 11.11%. LD spirochete infection was found in individuals of different ages, with the positive rate being highest among those aged ≤20 and ≥81 years old (22.22% in both groups). The positive rate of LD antibody detection in men was 16.89%, which was higher than the rate of 13.46% seen in women; however, the difference was not statistically significant. The positive rate of LD antibody detection using the 2-step testing method was 10.06% in patients with joint symptoms, which was slightly lower than the positive rate among individuals with neurological symptoms. Our results confirm the presence of LD among the population of Qiongzhong County, Hainan. LD surveillance should be carried out to actively prevent and treat LD in the locality. Local doctors should also consider the possibility of LD when diagnosing and treating patients with arthritis and neurological diseases."

Differences in the habitats and host preferences of these closely related tick species present an opportunity to examine key aspects of the tick microbiome. While advances in sequencing technologies have accelerated a descriptive understanding of the tick microbiome, molecular and mechanistic insights into the tick microbiome are only beginning to emerge. Progress is stymied by technical difficulties in manipulating the microbiome and by biological variables related to the life cycle of Ixodid ticks. This review highlights these challenges and examines avenues to understand the significance of the tick microbiome in tick biology."

		"abstract": "We report the case of a pregnant woman with complete heart block during her first trimester who presented with dyspnea at the East African Heart Rhythm Project in Nairobi. There was no evidence of an acute cause (e.g., myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, autoimmune or neuromuscular disease). No ECG had been previously documented; therefore, congenital complete heart block was likely. We implanted a dual-chamber pacemaker using conventional fluoroscopy. Several measures at implantation allowed us to limit fluoroscopy to 30 s and radiation to < 100 µGym2. The implantation was uneventful, dyspnea improved instantaneously and further pregnancy, labor and birth were uncomplicated. Bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation is rare during pregnancy and usually consists of symptomatic complete heart block. Beyond undiagnosed or untreated pre-existing atrioventricular block, drug therapy for fetal tachycardia, myocarditis (including Lyme borreliosis and Chagas disease), inflammatory infiltrative diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis), cardiomyopathies and neuromuscular disease may have caused bradycardia. In the absence of treatable causes, pacemaker implantation becomes necessary if bradycardia brings about risks for the mother or the fetus. Using transesophageal or intracardiac echocardiography, radiation can be avoided completely or, by taking some simple measures, may be kept to a minimum so that there is no risk for the fetus."

		"abstract": "Children with acute peripheral facial nerve palsy cannot yet be recommended corticosteroid treatment based on evidence. Adults with idiopathic facial nerve palsy are treated with corticosteroids, according to guidelines resulting from a meta-analysis comprising two major randomized placebo-controlled trials. Corresponding trials in children are lacking. Furthermore, acute facial nerve palsy in childhood is frequently associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The efficacy and safety of corticosteroid treatment of acute facial nerve palsy associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis, has not yet been determined in prospective trials in children, nor in adults. This randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study will include a total of 500 Swedish children aged 1-17 years, presenting with acute facial nerve palsy of either idiopathic etiology or associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis. Inclusion is ongoing at 12 pediatric departments, all situated in Borrelia burgdorferi endemic areas. Participants are randomized into active treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (maximum 50 mg/day) or placebo for oral intake once daily during 10 days without taper. Cases associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis are treated with antibiotics in addition to the study treatment. The House-Brackmann grading scale and the Sunnybrook facial grading system are used for physician-assessed evaluation of facial impairment at baseline, and at the 1- and 12-month follow-ups. Primary outcome is complete recovery, measured by House-Brackmann grading scale, at the 12-month follow-up. Child/parent-assessed questionnaires are used for evaluation of disease-specific quality of life and facial disability and its correlation to physician-assessed facial impairment will be evaluated. Furthermore, the study will evaluate factors of importance for predicting recovery, as well as the safety profile for short-term prednisolone treatment in children with acute facial nerve palsy. This article presents the rationale, design and content of a protocol for a study that will determine the efficacy of corticosteroid treatment in children with acute facial nerve palsy of idiopathic etiology, or associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis. Future results will attribute to evidence-based treatment guidelines applicable also in Borrelia burgdorferi endemic areas. The study protocol was approved by the Swedish Medical Product Agency (EudraCT nr 2017-004187-35) and published at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT03781700 , initial release 12/14/2018)."

		"abstract": "Both philosophers and scientists have recently promoted transparency as an important element of responsible scientific practice. Philosophers have placed particular emphasis on the ways that transparency can assist with efforts to manage value judgments in science responsibly. This paper examines a potential challenge to this approach, namely, that efforts to promote transparency can themselves be value-laden. This is particularly problematic when transparency incorporates second-order value judgments that are underwritten by the same values at stake in the desire for transparency about the first-order value judgments involved in scientific research. The paper uses a case study involving research on Lyme disease to illustrate this worry, but it responds by elucidating a range of scenarios in which transparency can still play an effective role in managing value judgments responsibly."

This report presents a case of a 33-year-old Caucasian female with a remote history of Lyme disease who presented with blurry vision in the right eye. Exam and imaging revealed a right active chorioretinitis and positive Lyme serology. The patient was systemically treated with prednisone and antibiotics. Symptoms initially improved, but she later developed a localized choriocapillaritis in the left eye. Steroids and antibiotics were restarted many times with fluctuating course of the disease. The patient was then started on chronic steroid-sparing immunosuppression, which has controlled the condition without recurrence. The current report presents a unique case of recurrent bilateral chorioretinitis with positive Lyme serology and raises the question of the existence of true Lyme-associated uveitis."

		"abstract": "We use mathematical modelling to examine how microbial strain communities are structured by the host specialisation traits and antigenic relationships of their members. The model is quite general and broadly applicable, but we focus on Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease bacterium, transmitted by ticks to mice and birds. In this system, host specialisation driven by the evasion of innate immunity has been linked to multiple niche polymorphism, while antigenic differentiation driven by the evasion of adaptive immunity has been linked to negative frequency dependence. Our model is composed of two host species, one vector, and multiple co-circulating pathogen strains that vary in their host specificity and their antigenic distances from one another. We explore the conditions required to maintain pathogen diversity. We show that the combination of host specificity and antigenic differentiation creates an intricate niche structure. Unequivocal rules that relate the stability of a strain community directly to the trait composition of its members are elusive. However, broad patterns are evident. When antigenic differentiation is weak, stable communities are typically composed entirely of generalists that can exploit either host species equally well. As antigenic differentiation increases, more diverse stable communities emerge, typically around trait compositions of generalists, generalists and very similar specialists, and specialists roughly balanced between the two host species."

TLR2 and TLR4 are displayed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells and recognise structurally conserved microbial signatures defined as Pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). C3H mice are susceptible to tick-borne pathogens; Lyme disease causing Borrelia burgdorferi that manifests arthritis and carditis and Apicomplexan protozoan, Babesia microti (Bm) that causes significant parasitemia associated with erythrocytopenia and haemoglobinuria. B. burgdorferi lacks typical TLR4 ligand lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and Bm TLR ligand(s) remain unknown. Only Borrelia lipoproteins that signal through TLR2 are established as PAMPs of these pathogens for TLR2/TLR4. Infection of C3H mice with each pathogen individually resulted in increase in the percentage of splenic B, T and FcR+ cells while their co-infection significantly diminished levels of these cells and caused increased B. burgdorferi burden in the specific organs. The most pronounced inflammatory arthritis was observed in co-infected C3H/HeJ mice. Parasitemia levels and kinetics of resolution of Bm in both mice strains were not significantly different. Transfected HEK293 cells showed pronounced signalling by B. burgdorferi through TLR2 and to some extent by TLR4 while Bm and infected erythrocytes did not show any response confirming our results in mice."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tickborne diseases in the United States is increasing; reported cases more than doubled from >22,000 in 2004 to >48,000 in 2016 (1). Ticks are responsible for approximately 95% of all locally acquired vectorborne diseases reported by states and the District of Columbia, with Lyme disease accounting for >80% of those cases (2). After a tick bite, persons might seek care at an emergency department (ED) for tick removal and to receive postexposure prophylaxis, which has been shown to effectively prevent Lyme disease when taken within 72 hours of a high-risk bite (3). Using data from CDC's National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP), investigators examined ED tick bite visits during January 2017-December 2019 by sex, age group, U.S. region, and seasonality. During this 36-month period, 149,364 ED tick bite visits were identified. Mean cumulative incidence was 49 ED tick bite visits per 100,000 ED visits overall; incidence was highest in the Northeast (110 per 100,000 ED visits). The seasonal distribution of ED tick bite visits was bimodal: the larger peak occurred during the spring and early summer, and the smaller peak occurred in the fall. This pattern aligns with the seasonality of a known and abundant human-biter, the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (4). Compared with other age groups, pediatric patients aged 0-9 years accounted for the highest number and incidence of ED tick bite visits; incidence was higher among male patients than among females. Tick bites are not monitored by current surveillance systems because a tick bite is an event that in and of itself is not a reportable condition to health departments. Syndromic surveillance of ED tick bite visits can provide timely information that might predict temporal and geographic risk for exposure to tickborne diseases and guide actionable public health messaging such as avoiding tick habitats, wearing repellent consistently when outdoors, and performing regular tick checks during times of increased tick bite risk."

		"abstract": "Disrupting transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi) from infected ticks to humans is one strategy to prevent the significant morbidity from Lyme disease. We have previously shown that an anti-OspA human mAb, 2217, prevents transmission of B. burgdorferi from infected ticks in animal models. Maintenance of a protective plasma concentration of a human mAb for tick season presents a significant challenge for a preexposure prophylaxis strategy. Here, we describe the optimization of mAb 2217 by amino acid substitutions (2217LS: M428L and N434S) in the Fc domain. The LS mutation led to a 2-fold increase in half-life in cynomolgus monkeys. In a rhesus macaque model, 2217LS protected animals from tick transmission of spirochetes at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Crystallographic analysis of Fab in complex with OspA revealed that 2217 bound an epitope that was highly conserved among the B. burgdorferi, B. garinii, and B. afzelii species. Unlike most vaccines that may require boosters to achieve protection, our work supports the development of 2217LS as an effective preexposure prophylaxis in Lyme-endemic regions, with a single dose at the beginning of tick season offering immediate protection that remains for the duration of exposure risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) and transmitted through the Ixodes tick. Nervous system involvement is known as Lyme neuroborreliosis; it only occurs in disseminated Lyme disease and is manifested by the classic triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis. Timeline is a significant factor when staging Lyme manifestations. However, certain cases do not follow the typical presentation timelines described in most literature. We report a case of a 66-year-old male who presented with progressively worsening generalized body aches, severe fatigue, and new-onset urine retention for two weeks. Physical examination revealed severe pain with neck flexion and lying supine and diminished deep tendon reflexes bilaterally. Laboratory data revealed a positive Lyme immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody with lymphocytic pleocytosis on lumbar puncture. He was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone for early disseminated Lyme disease. His radicular pain responded well to therapy, and he regained full bladder function. Bannwarth syndrome (BWS) is a term applied to the constellation of painful radiculoneuritis characterized as severe, burning, often dermatomal pain. In most cases, BWS affects the limbs, with only a few reported cases of sacral radiculitis causing neurogenic urinary dysfunction. Early recognition of this rare presentation associated with Lyme disease and treatment with antibiotics can prevent disease progression and detrimental neurological sequelae."

Here, we establish HS-198 as a small-molecule fluorescent conjugate that selectively targets the highly conserved bacterial protein HtpG (high-temperature protein G), within Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease. We describe the use of HS-198 to target morphologic forms of B. burgdorferi in both the logarithmic growth phase and the metabolically dormant stationary phase as well as in inactivated spirochetes. Furthermore, in a murine infection model, systemically injected HS-198 identified B. burgdorferi as revealed by imaging in postnecropsy tissue sections. These findings demonstrate how small-molecule probes directed at conserved bacterial protein targets can function to identify the microbe using noninvasive imaging and potentially as scaffolds to deliver antimicrobial agents to the pathogen."

Early treatment with corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in Bell's palsy and antibiotics improve outcome in LNB, but there is a lack of knowledge on how the addition of corticosteroids to standard antibiotic treatment affects outcome in LNB PFP. This prospective open trial with historical controls was conducted at two large hospitals in western Sweden between 2011 and 2018. Adults presenting with LNB PFP were included in the study group and were treated with oral doxycycline 200 mg b.i.d. for 10 days and prednisolone 60 mg o.d. for 5 days, then tapered over 5 days. The historical controls were adult patients with LNB PFP included in previous studies and treated with oral doxycycline. Both groups underwent a follow-up lumbar puncture and were followed until complete recovery or for 12 months. Fifty-seven patients were included, 27 in the study group and 30 in the control group. Two patients (6%) in the study group and 6 patients (20%) in the control group suffered from sequelae at end follow up. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups, neither in the proportion of patients with sequelae, nor in the decline in CSF mononuclear cell count. Adjunctive corticosteroids neither improve nor impair the outcome for patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis peripheral facial palsy treated with doxycycline."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes of the family Borreliaceae are, with one exception, tick-borne pathogens of a variety of vertebrates. The family at present comprises two genera: Borrelia (Swellengrebel), which includes the agents of relapsing fever, avian spirochetosis, and bovine borreliosis, and Borreliella (Gupta et al.), which includes the agents of Lyme disease and was formerly known as 'Borrelia burgdorferi sensulato complex'. The two genera are distinguished not only by their disease associations but also biological features in the tick vector, including tissue location in unfed ticks and transovarial transmission. Borrelia species transmitted by argasid (soft) ticks tend to have more exclusive relationships with their tick vectors than do other Borrelia species and all Borreliella species that have ixodid (hard) ticks as vectors. The division of genera is supported by phylogenomic evidence from whole genomes and by several specific molecular markers. These distinguishing phylogenetic criteria also applied to three new species or isolates of Borrelia that were discovered in ixodid ticks of reptiles, a monotreme, and birds. Although the deep branching of the family from other spirochetes has been a challenge for inferences about evolution of the family, the discovery of related microorganisms in the gut microbiota of other arachnids suggests an ancestral origin for the family as symbionts of ticks and other arachnids."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases in California include Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi), infections with Borrelia miyamotoi, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis (caused by Anaplasma phagocytophilum). We surveyed multiple sites and habitats (woodland, grassland, and coastal chaparral) in California to describe spatial patterns of tick-borne pathogen prevalence in western black-legged ticks (Ixodes pacificus). We found that several species of Borrelia-B. burgdorferi, Borrelia americana, and Borrelia bissettiae-were observed in habitats, such as coastal chaparral, that do not harbor obvious reservoir host candidates. Describing tick-borne pathogen prevalence is strongly influenced by the scale of surveillance: aggregating data from individual sites to match jurisdictional boundaries (e.g., county or state) can lower the reported infection prevalence. Considering multiple pathogen species in the same habitat allows a more cohesive interpretation of local pathogen occurrence. IMPORTANCE Understanding the local host ecology and prevalence of zoonotic diseases is vital for public health. Using tick-borne diseases in California, we show that there is often a bias to our understanding and that studies tend to focus on particular habitats, e.g., Lyme disease in oak woodlands. Other habitats may harbor a surprising diversity of tick-borne pathogens but have been neglected, e.g., coastal chaparral. Explaining pathogen prevalence requires descriptions of data on a local scale; otherwise, aggregating the data can misrepresent the local dynamics of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the northern hemisphere and is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and related Borrelia species. The constellation of symptoms attributable to this malady results from vascular dissemination of B. burgdorferi throughout the body to invade various tissue types. However, little is known about the mechanism by which the spirochetes can breach the blood vessel wall to reach distant tissues. We have studied this process by direct observation of spirochetes in the microvasculature of living mice using multi-laser spinning-disk intravital microscopy. Our results show that in our experimental system, instead of phagocytizing B. burgdorferi, host neutrophils are involved in the production of specific cytokines that activate the endothelium and potentiate B. burgdorferi escape into the surrounding tissue. Spirochete escape is not induced by paracellular permeability and appears to occur via a transcellular pathway. Neutrophil repurposing to promote bacterial extravasation represents a new and innovative pathogenic strategy."

This study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of the novel BioPlex 2200 Lyme IgG and Lyme IgM assays. It also assesses potential improvements to the assays through receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The BioPlex assays were performed on sera of 158 Dutch patients with physician-confirmed LB (both early localized and disseminated), 800 healthy blood donors from the Netherlands, and 90 cross-reactive controls. The BioPlex (Biopl) assays were compared with two commercial enzyme immunoassays (Euroimmun [Eur]/C6-ELISA) and one immunoblot (recomLine). The highest sensitivity in early LB was achieved with the BioPlex assays, which outperformed the Euroimmun and C6-ELISA (Biopl: 81/88, 92.1%; Eur: 64/88, 72.7%; C6: 72/88, 81.8%). Sensitivity of all assays was comparable in patients with disseminated LB. The BioPlex assays were outperformed in terms of specificity (all healthy blood donors, Biopl: 571/800, 71.4%; Eur: 711/800, 88.9%; C6: 727/800, 90.9%), but further analyses showed promising avenues following cutoff optimization. ROC analysis showed that 2/6 antigens of the combined BioPlex IgG and IgM assays had significantly higher areas under the curve (AUCs) than those of the other analyses. Potential modified versions of the assays based on these antigens largely outperformed the Euroimmun and C6-ELISA in EM patients (Biopl: 81/80, 92.1%) while maintaining a comparable or even higher specificity (Biopl: 714/800, 89.3%). The BioPlex 2200 Lyme IgG and Lyme IgM assays are promising tools for the serodiagnosis of early LB, with the potential to be used as a standalone test. Further research is necessary to validate the findings of this discovery cohort."

A borrelial homolog (BB_0167) interacted specifically with borrelilal PG via its peptidoglycan interacting motif (MHELSEKRARAIGNYL); was localized to the protoplasmic cylinder of Bb; and was designated as Borrelia peptidoglycan interacting Protein (BpiP). A bpiP mutant displayed no defect under in vitro growth conditions with similar levels of several virulence-related proteins. However, the burden of bpiP mutant in C3H/HeN mice at day 14, 28 and 62 post-infection was significantly lower compared to control strains. No viable bpiP mutant was re-isolated from any tissues at day 62 post-infection although bpiP mutant was able to colonize immunodeficient SCID at day 28 post-infection. Acquisition or transmission of bpiP mutant by Ixodes scapularis larvae or nymphs respectively, from and to mice, was significantly lower compared to control strains. Further analysis of bpiP mutant revealed increased sensitivity to vancomycin, osmotic stress, lysosomal extracts, human antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin-LL37, complement-dependent killing in the presence of day 14 post-infection mouse serum and increased internalization of CFSC-labeled bpiP mutant by macrophages and dendritic cells compared to control strains. These studies demonstrate the importance of accessory protein/s involved in sustaining integrity of PG and cell envelope during different phases of Bb infection."

		"abstract": "The literature on Lyme disease includes a lively debate about the paradoxical role of changing deer populations. A decrease in the number of deer will both (1) reduce the incidence of Lyme disease by decreasing the host populations for ticks and therefore tick populations, and (2) enhance the incidence of Lyme disease by offering fewer reservoir-incompetent hosts for ticks, forcing the vector to choose reservoir-competent, and therefore possibly diseased, hosts to feed on. A review of field studies exploring the net impact of changing deer populations shows mixed results. In this manuscript, we investigate the hypothesis that the balance of these two responses to changing deer populations depends on the relative population sizes of reservoir-competent vs. reservoir-incompetent hosts and the presence of host preference in larval and adult stages. A temperature driven seasonal model of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (cause of Lyme disease) transmission among three host types (reservoir-competent infected and uninfected hosts, and reservoir-incompetent hosts) is constructed as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model, which produces biologically reasonable results for both the tick vector Ixodes scapularis Say 1921 and the hosts, is used to investigate the effects of reservoir-incompetent host removal on both tick populations and disease prevalence for various relative population sizes of reservoir-competent hosts vs. reservoir-incompetent hosts. In summary, the simulation results show that the model with host preference appears to be more accurate than the one with no host preference. Given these results, we found that removal of adult I. scapularis(Say) hosts is likely to reduce questing nymph populations. At very low levels questing adult abundance may rise with lack of adult hosts. There is a dilution effect at low reservoir-competent host populations and there is an amplification effect at high reservoir-competent host populations."

		"abstract": "Arthritis is one of the most important symptoms of late-stage borreliosis, observed in approximately 60% of untreated patients with Lyme disease. In several percent of them, this manifestation is of interest to orthopedic surgeons. The authors present a case of a patient, working as a forester, who underwent left hip replacement arthroplasty having contracted a Borrelia burgdorferi infection in the past, and who was hospitalized 12 years before in the infectious ward due to suspected neuroborreliosis for which he was treated with Ceftriaxone 2 × 2.0 g intravenously for 4 weeks. At that time, a tomographic examination of the spinal cord revealed herniated nuclei at levels L4/L5 and L5/S1, which filled the left lateral recess, narrowing the intervertebral holes and compressing the nerve roots on the left side of L4 and L5. In September 2019, total hip replacement in the patient's left hip joint was performed. It is concluded that an active role of neuroborreliosis in this process of hip joint destruction may be suggested. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2021;34(5):693-9."

		"abstract": "Bell's palsy is acute peripheral facial nerve palsy; its cause is often unknown but it can be triggered by acute viral infection. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection commonly presents with respiratory symptoms, but neurologic complications have been reported. A few studies have reported the occurrence of facial nerve palsy during the COVID-19 pandemic. We present a case of Bell's palsy in a 36-year-old man with COVID-19 infection and a past medical history of nephrolithiasis. He presented to the emergency room with a day history of sudden right facial weakness and difficulty closing his right eye four weeks following a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Physical examination revealed right lower motor neuron facial nerve palsy (House-Brackmann grade IV). Serologic screen for Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 were negative for acute infection; however, neuroimaging with MRI confirmed Bell's palsy. He made remarkable improvement following treatment with a course of valacyclovir and methylprednisolone. This case adds to the growing body of literature on neurological complications that should be considered when managing patients with COVID-19 infection."

This study has two key objectives: 1) to determine seroreactivity against T. cruzi in dogs from the town of Colón, in Portoviejo city, in the central coast of Ecuador; and 2) to establish the coinfection frequency of other companion vector-borne diseases in dogs positive for T. cruzi. Antibodies against T. cruzi were detected using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Diagnostic consensus between ELISA tests was established using the Cohen's Kappa coefficient. Other haemoparasitic diseases were detected using the IDEXX SNAP® 4Dx® kit in dogs previously diagnosed as T. cruzi-seropositive. From 84 dogs sampled, 57.14% (48/84) tested positive for T. cruzi. Co-infection analysis of 25 dogs positive for T. cruzi revealed antibodies also against Ehrlichia spp. (48%), Anaplasma spp. (28%), and Dirofilaria immitis (12%). These results provide a novel perspective regarding the status of these pathogens which co-infect dogs in Colón. Since all these pathogens are zoonotic, our findings should warn regional health authorities to implement sanitary programs, to better prevent and control vectors associated to these pathogens. On the other hand, human and veterinarian doctors, should consider that patients with a cardiac infection condition could be suffering co-infections with two or more vector transmitted pathogens."

On examination, he was febrile and had left leg pain with passive range of motion. Laboratory studies revealed anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury and elevated aminotransaminases. Due to his recent travel to the Northeastern United States, he was suspected of having a possible tick-borne illness. Serologies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti, and the patient was diagnosed with Lyme disease, babesiosis and anaplasmosis. He was treated with doxycyline, atovaquone and azithromycin, leading to resolution of symptoms. While co-infection with Lyme disease is common, infection with three tickborne illnesses at one time is relatively rare."

Ixodes pacificus nymphs were sampled from 2015 to 2017 at one Sierra Nevada foothill site to evaluate our efficiency in collecting this life stage, characterize nymphal seasonality, and identify environmental factors affecting their abundance and infection with B. burgdorferi sl. To assess sampling success, we compared the density and prevalence of I. pacificus nymphs flagged from four questing substrates (logs, rocks, tree trunks, leaf litter). Habitat characteristics (e.g., canopy cover, tree species) were recorded for each sample, and temperature and relative humidity were measured hourly at one location. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess environmental factors associated with I. pacificus abundance and B. burgdorferi sl infection. In total, 2,033 substrates were sampled, resulting in the collection of 742 I. pacificus nymphs. Seasonal abundance of nymphs was bimodal with peak activity occurring from late March through April and a secondary peak in June. Substrate type, collection year, month, and canopy cover were all significant predictors of nymphal density and prevalence. Logs, rocks, and tree trunks had significantly greater nymphal densities and prevalences than leaf litter. Cumulative annual vapor pressure deficit was the only significant climatic predictor of overall nymphal I. pacificus density and prevalence. No associations were observed between the presence of B. burgdorferi sl in nymphs and environmental variables."

Research in the northeastern United States has revealed a positive association between Babesia microti, the main pathogen that causes babesiosis in humans, and Bo. burgdorferi in humans and in ticks. This study was conducted to examine associations between the disease agents in the Upper midwestern United States. Ixodes scapularis Say nymphs (N = 2,858) collected between 2015 and 2017 from nine locations in Wisconsin were tested for Babesia spp. and Borrelia spp. using real-time PCR. Two species of Babesia were detected; Ba. microti and Babesia odocoilei (a parasite of members of the family Cervidae). Prevalence of infection at the nine locations ranged from 0 to 13% for Ba. microti, 11 to 31% for Bo. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and 5.7 to 26% for Ba. odocoilei. Coinfection of nymphs with Bo. burgdorferi and Ba. odocoilei was detected in eight of the nine locations and significant positive associations were observed in two of the eight locations. The prevalence of nymphal coinfection with both and Bo. burgdorferi and Ba. microti ranged from 0.81 to 6.5%. These two pathogens were significantly positively associated in one of the five locations where both pathogens were detected. In the other four locations, the observed prevalence of coinfection was higher than expected in all but one site-year. Clinics and healthcare providers should be aware of the association between Ba. microti and Bo. burgdorferi pathogens when treating patients who report tick bites."

		"abstract": "Animals that are competent reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens commonly suffer little morbidity from the infections. To investigate mechanisms of this tolerance of infection, we used single-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an experimental model of inflammation and compared the responses of two rodents: Peromyscus leucopus, the white-footed deermouse and reservoir for the agents of Lyme disease and other zoonoses, and the house mouse Mus musculus Four hours after injection with LPS or saline, blood, spleen, and liver samples were collected and subjected to transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq), metabolomics, and specific reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Differential expression analysis was at the gene, pathway, and network levels. LPS-treated deermice showed signs of sickness similar to those of exposed mice and had similar increases in corticosterone levels and expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor, IL-1β, and C-reactive protein. By network analysis, the M. musculus response to LPS was characterized as cytokine associated, while the P. leucopus response was dominated by neutrophil activity terms. In addition, dichotomies in the expression levels of arginase 1 and nitric oxide synthase 2 and of IL-10 and IL-12 were consistent with type M1 macrophage responses in mice and type M2 responses in deermice. Analysis of metabolites in plasma and RNA in organs revealed species differences in tryptophan metabolism. Two genes in particular signified the different phenotypes of deermice and mice: the Slpi and Ibsp genes. Key RNA-seq findings for P. leucopus were replicated in older animals, in a systemic bacterial infection, and with cultivated fibroblasts. The findings indicate that P. leucopus possesses several adaptive traits to moderate inflammation in its balancing of infection resistance and tolerance.IMPORTANCE Animals that are natural carriers of pathogens that cause human diseases commonly manifest little or no sickness as a consequence of infection. Examples include the deermouse, Peromyscus leucopus, which is a reservoir for Lyme disease and several other disease agents in North America, and some types of bats, which are carriers of viruses with pathogenicity for humans. Mechanisms of this phenomenon of infection tolerance and entailed trade-off costs are poorly understood. Using a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxin as a proxy for infection, we found that deermice differed from the mouse (Mus musculus) in responses to LPS in several diverse pathways, including innate immunity, oxidative stress, and metabolism. Features distinguishing the deermice cumulatively would moderate downstream ill effects of LPS. Insights gained from the P. leucopus model in the laboratory have implications for studying infection tolerance in other important reservoir species, including bats and other types of wildlife."

Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in Switzerland and Lyme arthritis the most prevalent manifestation of late-stage Lyme disease. It presents as a monoarthitis or oligoarthritis in large joints, often involving the knee. Such a clinical presentation, together with positive Lyme serologies or polymerase chain reactions from synovial fluid/tissue, is considered diagnostic. If there is no tick bite or erythema migrans in the patient's history the diagnosis can be challenging due to the many differential diagnoses. The initial treatment is a prolonged course of oral antibiotics."

		"abstract": "Brazilian borreliosis (BB) disease is an infectious disease transmitted by ticks that mimics Lyme disease (LD) from the Northern Hemisphere. The BB clinical picture is characterized by a pathognomonic skin lesion (migratory erythema) and joint, neurological, cardiac and psychiatric symptoms. Innate and Th1/Th17 adaptive immunity seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. The aim of this study was to characterize the role of innate and Th1/Th17 adaptive immunity in BB patients with acute (<3 months) and convalescent (>3 months) disease. Fifty BB patients (28 with acute and 22 with convalescent disease) without treatment and 30 healthy subjects were evaluated. Levels of 20 cytokines or chemokines associated with innate and Th1/Th17 adaptive immunity were analyzed using Luminex (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA). Overall, BB patients had increased levels of IL-8 (6.29 vs 2.12 p = 0.002) and MIP-1α/CCL3 (5.20 vs 2.06, p = 0.030), associated with innate immunity, and MIP3B/CCL19 (Th1; 297.86 vs 212.41, p = 0.031) and IL-17A (Th17; 3.11 vs 2.20, p = 0.037), associated with adaptive immunity, compared with the levels of healthy controls. When comparing acute BB vs. convalescent BB subjects vs. healthy controls, IL-1β, IL-8 and MIP-1α/CCL3 (innate mediators) levels were highest in patients in the acute phase of disease (p < 0.05). TNF-α was associated with disseminated symptoms and with humoral reactivity against Borrelia burgdorferi. IL-10 was significantly correlated with IL-6 (r = 0.59, p = 0.003), IL-8 (r = 0.51, p < 0.001), MIP-1α/CCL3 (r = 0.42, p < 0.001) and MIP-3β/CCL19 (r = 0.40, p = 0.002) in all BB patients. This is the first study describing that innate and Th1/Th17 adaptive immunity play a crucial role in BB disease. Furthermore, innate mediators are particularly important in acute BB disease, and TNF-α is associated with evolution of BB symptoms."

		"abstract": "Relapsing fever (RF), caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, is a globally distributed, vector-borne disease with high prevalence in developing countries. To date, signaling pathways required for infection and virulence of RF Borrelia spirochetes are unknown. Cyclic di-AMP (c-di-AMP), synthesized by diadenylate cyclases (DACs), is a second messenger predominantly found in Gram-positive organisms that is linked to virulence and essential physiological processes. Although Borrelia is Gram-negative, it encodes one DAC (CdaA), and its importance remains undefined. To investigate the contribution of c-di-AMP signaling in the RF bacterium Borrelia turicatae, a cdaA mutant was generated. The mutant was significantly attenuated during murine infection, and genetic complementation reversed this phenotype. Because c-di-AMP is essential for viability in many bacteria, whole-genome sequencing was performed on cdaA mutants, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified potential suppressor mutations. Additionally, conditional mutation of cdaA confirmed that CdaA is important for normal growth and physiology. Interestingly, mutation of cdaA did not affect expression of homologs of virulence regulators whose levels are impacted by c-di-AMP signaling in the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi Finally, the cdaA mutant had a significant growth defect when grown with salts, at decreased osmolarity, and without pyruvate. While the salt treatment phenotype was not reversed by genetic complementation, possibly due to suppressor mutations, growth defects at decreased osmolarity and in media lacking pyruvate could be attributed directly to cdaA inactivation. Overall, these results indicate CdaA is critical for B. turicatae pathogenesis and link c-di-AMP to osmoregulation and central metabolism in RF spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Over the past 2 decades, tickborne disease has been increasingly recognized as a threat to humans as a result of the growing geographic range of ticks. This review describes 2 tickborne diseases, Borrelia miyamotoi and Powassan virus, that likely have a significant impact on humans, yet are underdiagnosed compared to most other tickborne diseases. We performed a literature search from 2015 to 2020. Borrelia miyamotoi is a tickborne pathogen that infects and co-infects ticks along with other pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi. Because B miyamotoi infects the same Ixodes ticks as B burgdorferi, B miyamotoi may cover a similar geographic range. B miyamotoi infection may be underdiagnosed for 2 reasons. First, a presumptive treatment approach to Lyme disease may result in B miyamotoi infection treatment without identification of the actual cause. Second, the absence of readily available testing and diagnostic criteria makes it difficult to diagnose B miyamotoi infection. Powassan virus is a tickborne flavivirus similar to the dengue virus. Powassan virus disease appears to have an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic presentation in most people but can cause devastating and fatal encephalitis. The Powassan virus may be transmitted in less than 15 min of tick feeding. Powassan virus disease is a difficult diagnosis because testing capabilities are limited and because there may be co-infection with other tickborne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, is the most common vector-borne disease in North America. This disease has a much lower incidence in western compared with eastern North America. Passive tick surveillance data submitted over 17 years from 2002 to 2018 were analyzed to determine the occurrence of tick species and the prevalence of Borrelia spp. in ticks in British Columbia (BC), Canada. The BC Centre for Disease Control Public Health Laboratory received tick submissions from physicians, veterinarians, and BC residents. Ticks were identified to species, and all ticks, except Dermacentor andersoni, were tested using generic B. burgdorferi s.l. primer sets and species-specific PCR primer sets for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). Tick submission data were analyzed to assess temporal and geographical trends, tick life stages, and tick species. Poisson regression was used to assess temporal trends in annual tick submissions. A total of 15,464 ticks were submitted. Among these, 0.29% (n = 10,235) of Ixodes spp. ticks and 5.3% (n = 434) of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks were found carrying B. burgdorferi s.s. B. burgdorferi s.s. was primarily detected in Ixodes pacificus (52%; n = 16) and Ixodes angustus ticks (19%; n = 6) retrieved from humans (n = 5) and animals (n = 26). B. burgdorferi was found in ticks submitted throughout the year. Ixodes spp. ticks were primarily submitted from the coastal regions of southwestern BC, and D. andersoni ticks were primarily submitted from southern interior BC. The number of human tick submissions increased significantly (p < 0.001) between 2013 and 2018. The annual prevalence of B. burgdorferi in ticks remained stable during the study period. These findings correspond to those observed in US Pacific Northwestern states. Passive tick surveillance is an efficient tool to monitor long-term trends in tick distribution and B. burgdorferi prevalence in a low endemicity region."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in North America. Though human infection is mostly transmitted in a limited geography, the range has expanded in recent years. One notable area of recent expansion is in the mountainous region of southwestern Virginia. The ecological factors that facilitate or constrain the range of human Lyme disease in this region remain uncertain. To evaluate this further, we obtained ecological data, including remotely sensed data on forest structure and vegetation, weather data, and elevation. These data were aggregated within the census block groups of a 9,153 km2 area around the cities of Blacksburg and Roanoke, VA, an area with heterogeneous Lyme disease transmission. In this geographic area, 755 individuals were reported to have Lyme disease in the 10 yr from 2006 to 2015, and these cases were aggregated by block group. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to evaluate which environmental variables influenced the abundance of Lyme disease cases. Higher elevation and higher vegetation density had the greatest effect size on the abundance of Lyme disease. Measures of forest edge, forest integrity, temperature, and humidity were not associated with Lyme disease cases. Future southward expansion of Lyme disease into the southeastern states may be most likely in ecologically similar mountainous areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease that is widespread throughout the northern hemisphere. Ixodes ricinus is present throughout metropolitan France, except for the Mediterranean region. The debate revolves around whether or not a chronic form of Lyme disease exists. This controversy is not limited to France but has been reported worldwide. In France, in 2019, 24 scientific societies representing the medical disciplines most involved in Lyme disease, including the Société Française de Rhumatologie (French Rheumatology Society [SFR]) and the Société de Pathologie Infectieuse de la Langue Française (French Infectious Disease Society-SPILF), published recommendations on the management of Lyme borreliosis following a submission to the Director General of Health. These recommendations conflict with those of the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS), a multi-specialties independent group of physician, on a key point: whether to add a new nosological entity labeled as \"persistent polymorphous signs and symptoms (or syndrome) possibly due to tick bite.\" The creation of this new syndrome risks should increase anchoring bias, leading to the attribution of all symptoms to a possible tick bite, without considering differential diagnoses. Lyme disease has been extensively studied. Erythema migrans is the primary clinical manifestation. In the presence of nonmetabolic, nonseptic monoarthritis involving the knee or radiculitis of a lower limb during the summer, Lyme disease should be suspected. Serologic testing for Lyme disease is reliable in the case of late forms such as chronic arthritis, while the detection of Borrelia DNA in synovial fluid by PCR is inconsistent. Sometimes, the serology can be misleading in early forms such as radiculitis. Treatment is based on doxycycline for 14 days in early forms (radiculitis), or 28 days in late forms (arthritis). Arthritis can persist or recur after antibiotic therapy. The prevalence of a diffuse polyalgia syndrome (fibromyalgia) following Lyme disease does not seem to differ much from that in the general population. It is not improved by prolonged antibiotic therapy, which is therefore not recommended."

		"abstract": "Currently there is no human vaccine against Lyme borreliosis, and most research focuses on recombinant protein vaccines, as such a vaccine has been proven to be successful in the past. The expression of recombinant antigens in meningococcal Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMVs), with the OMV functioning both as adjuvant and delivery vehicle, greatly enhances their potential. Immunization studies in mice have shown that OMV-based vaccines can protect against various pathogens and an OMV-based meningococcal vaccine is approved and available for human use. Because of its surface localization in Borrelia and the detailed knowledge regarding its immunogenicity and structure, OspA was chosen as a suitable lipoprotein to be tested as an OMV-based vaccine against Lyme borreliosis. We have previously shown that the OMV-OspA vaccine was immunogenic in mice and here we assessed the efficacy of OMV-OspA. We generated a second-generation OMV-OspA vaccine and vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with (EDTA extracted) meningococcal OMVs expressing OspA from B. burgdorferi strain B31. The adjuvant effect of empty OMVs on recombinant OspA was tested as well. We subsequently challenged mice with a subcutaneous injection of B. burgdorferi. Average antibody end-point titers against the OspA-OMV construct were high, although lower compared to the antibodies raised against recombinant OspA. Interestingly, antibody titers between recombinant OspA adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxide and recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant were comparable. Finally, qPCR and culture data show that both the OspA-OMV and the vaccine based on recombinant OspA with OMV as adjuvant provided significant, yet partial protection, against Borrelia infection. OMV-based vaccines using Borrelia (lipo)proteins are an easy and feasible vaccination method protecting against B. burgdorferi infection and could be a promising strategy in humans."

The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Lyme disease infection among forestry workers in National Park Offices in South Korea. We enrolled National Park Office forestry workers (NPOFWs) who had worked for ≥1 year. Participants completed questionnaires that addressed various subjects including work types and work hygiene-related factors. Collected serum samples were tested using immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Borrelia antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors of seroprevalence. Of 1,410 NPOFWs, 655 (46.5%) participated in this study, and an overall seroprevalence of Lyme disease antibodies was 8.1%. Analysis showed that always eating meals in woodland (odds ratio (OR), 5.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08-12.52) and raising dogs outside homes (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57-6.75) were significantly associated with Lyme disease infection. This seroprevalence study indicates that Lyme disease is an important disease among NPOFWs in South Korea. These identified modifiable risk factors should be considered while designing preventive strategies for reducing Lyme disease infection among NPOFWs."

Tick distributions respond to climate change, but how their geographic ranges will shift in future decades and how those shifts may translate into changes in disease incidence remain unclear. In this study, we have assembled correlative ecological niche models for eight tick species of medical or veterinary importance in North America (Ixodes scapularis, I. pacificus, I. cookei, Dermacentor variabilis, D. andersoni, Amblyomma americanum, A. maculatum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus), assessing the distributional potential of each under both present and future climatic conditions. Our goal was to assess whether and how species' distributions will likely shift in coming decades in response to climate change. We interpret these patterns in terms of likely implications for tick-associated diseases in North America."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), caused by the TBE virus (TBEV), is a life-threatening disease with clinical symptoms ranging from non-specific to severe inflammation of the central nervous system. Despite TBE is a notifiable disease in Serbia since 2004, there is no active TBE surveillance program for the serologic or molecular screening of TBEV infection in humans in the country. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the TBEV exposure among tick-infested individuals in Serbia during the year 2020. A total of 113 individuals exposed to tick bites were recruited for the study and screened for anti-TBEV antibodies using a commercial indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) test. Blood samples from 50 healthy donors not exposed to tick bites were included as a control group. Most of the enrolled patients reported infestations with one tick, being I. ricinus the most frequent tick found in the participants. The TBEV seroprevalence was higher (13.27%, 15 total 113) in tick-infested individuals than in healthy donors (4%, 2 total 50), although the difference was not significant. Notably, male individuals exposed to tick bites showed five times higher relative risk (RR) of being TBEV-seropositive than healthy donors of the same gender (RR= 5.1, CI = 1.6-19; p = 0.007). None of the seropositive individuals developed clinical manifestations of TBE, but the first clinical-stage of Lyme borreliosis (i.e., erythema migrans) was detected in seven of them. Potential TBEV foci were identified in rural areas, mostly in proximity or within the Fruška Gora mountain. We conclude that the Serbian population is at high risk of TBEV exposure. Further epidemiological studies should focus on potential TBEV foci identified in this study. The implementation of active surveillance for TBEV might contribute to evaluating the potential negative impact of TBE in Serbia."

There is a scarcity of data regarding the impact of tick-borne pathogens on bone. The aim of this review was to survey existing research literature on this topic. The search was performed using PubMed and Google Scholar search engines. From our search, we were able to find evidence of eight tick-borne diseases (Anaplasmosis, Ehrlichiosis, Babesiosis, Lyme disease, Bourbon virus disease, Colorado tick fever disease, Tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever) affecting the bone. Pathological bone effects most commonly associated with tick-borne infections were disruption of bone marrow function and bone loss. Most research to date on the effects of tick-borne pathogen infections on bone has been quite preliminary. Further investigation of this topic is warranted."

However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later \"febrile patients\") based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

B. burgdorferi utilizes several immune evasion tactics ranging from the regulation of surface proteins, tick saliva, antimicrobial peptide resistance, and the disabling of the germinal center. This review aims to cover the various methods by which B. burgdorferi evades detection and destruction by the host immune response, examining both the innate and adaptive responses. By understanding the methods employed by B. burgdorferi to evade the host immune response, we gain a deeper knowledge of B. burgdorferi pathogenesis and Lyme disease, and gain insight into how to create novel, effective treatments."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease in Serbia and other European countries. Rabies is a fatal zoonosis distributed worldwide and is caused by the rabies virus. Professionals at risk of rabies-including veterinarians, hunters, communal service workers, and forestry workers-overlap with some professions at a higher risk of exposure to tick bites and tick-borne pathogen infections. We hypothesized that individuals identified by the public health system as at risk of rabies virus infection, and consequently vaccinated against rabies virus, also share a higher likelihood of Borrelia exposure. To test our hypothesis, a case-control study was carried out during 2019 in Serbia to determine the seroprevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies in two case groups (individuals at risk and vaccinated against rabies virus) and a control group (individuals without risk of rabies). Individuals vaccinated against rabies following either \"pre-exposure protocol\" (PrEP, n = 58) or \"post-exposure protocol\" (PEP, n = 42) were considered as rabies risk groups and healthy blood donors (n = 30) as the control group. The results showed higher Borrelia seroprevalence in PrEP (17.2%; 10/58) and PEP (19.0%; 8/42) groups compared with the control group (6.67%; 2/30). Furthermore, odds ratio (OR) analysis showed that risk of rabies (in either the PrEP (OR = 2.91) or PEP (OR = 3.29) groups) is associated with increased odds of being seropositive to Borrelia. However, the difference in Borrelia seroprevalence between groups was not statistically significant (Chi-square (χ²) test p > 0.05). The shared odds of LB and rabies exposure found in this study suggest that, in countries where both diseases occur, the common citizen can be at risk of both diseases when in a risky habitat. These findings are important to guide physicians in targeting high-risk groups, and diagnose LB, and to guide decision-makers in targeting control and prevention measures for both infections in risk areas."

		"abstract": "Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or more over at least three adjacent audiometric frequencies occurring within a 72-h period of time. One of the causes of SSNHL could be the progressive inflammatory state caused by an infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of SSNHL caused by various factors, most importantly those potentially related to Lyme disease. The study includes a group of 86 patients between the ages of 20 and 70 who were hospitalized due to SSNHL between 2017 and 2018. All of these patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological examination, including audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. In this group of 86 patients, nine patients presented with positive antibodies toward Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. This group was treated with antibiotics and experienced partial or complete regression of their deafness. This may suggest a relationship between SSNHL and Lyme disease. Infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi may contribute to the development of inflammatory and angiopathic lesions, which are a possible cause of SSNHL. The longer the duration of the infection, the greater the likelihood of permanent and irreversible changes in the vessels of the cochlea or auditory nerve. Therefore, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi should be performed during the diagnosis of SSNHL as a possible cause of this illness."

		"abstract": "In the present scenario, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) are well known for their negative impacts on humans as well as animal health in India. The reason lies in their increased incidences due to global warming, environmental and ecological changes, and availability of suitable habitats. On a global basis, they are now considered a serious threat to human as well as livestock health. The major tick-borne diseases in India include Kyasanur forest disease (KFD), Crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Lyme disease (LD), Q fever (also known as coxiellosis), and Rickettsial infections. In recent years, other tick-borne diseases such as Babesiosis, Ganjam virus (GANV), and Bhanja virus (BHAV) infections have also been reported in India. The purpose of this paper is to review the history and the current state of knowledge of tick-borne diseases in the country. The conclusion of this review is extending the requirement of greater efforts in research and government management for the diagnosis and treatment and as well as prevention of these diseases so that tick-borne disease burden should be minimizing in India."

Serological testing is the primary means of diagnosis but testing approaches differ widely, with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, there is currently no reliable test to determine disease resolution following treatment. A distinct challenge in Lyme disease diagnostics is the variable patterns of human immune response to a plurality of antigens presented by Borrelia spp. during the infection. Thus, multiplexed testing approaches that capture these patterns and detect serological response against multiple antigens may be the key to prompt, accurate Lyme disease diagnosis. In this review, current state-of-the-art multiplexed diagnostic approaches are presented and compared with respect to their diagnostic accuracy and their potential for monitoring response to treatment."

		"abstract": "The successful treatment of Lyme disease (LD) is contingent on accurate diagnosis. However, current laboratory detection assays lack sensitivity in the early stages of the disease. Because delayed diagnosis of LD incurs high healthcare costs and great suffering, new highly sensitive tests are in need. To overcome these challenges, we developed an internally controlled quantitative PCR (Ter-qPCR) that targets the multicopy terminase large subunit (terL) gene encoded by prophages that are only found in LD-causing bacteria. The terL protein helps phages pack their DNA. Strikingly, the detection limit of the Ter-qPCR was analytically estimated to be 22 copies and one bacterial cell in bacteria spiked blood. Furthermore, significant quantitative differences was observed in terms of the amount of terL detected in healthy individuals and patients with either early or late disease. Together, the data suggests that the prophage-targeting PCR has significant power to improve success detection for LD. After rigorous clinical validation, this new test could deliver a step-change in the detection of LD. Prophage encoded markers are prevalent in many other pathogenic bacteria rendering this approach highly applicable to bacterial identification in general."

While antimicrobial therapy is effective in resolving swelling and pain for 90% of patients, many patients have persistent inflammation, termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis (PILA). Current outcome measures for Lyme arthritis have several limitations, as improvement is considered a dichotomous outcome based solely on physical examination. There is growing interest in the use of ultrasonography to better define outcomes in inflammatory arthritis, and this is particularly relevant for conditions such as late Lyme arthritis and PILA, which are monoarticular or oligoarticular. We describe results from a series of 5 patients who underwent ultrasound evaluations leading to a diagnosis of PILA. This is a case series describing 5 patients with PILA who were referred for evaluation and treatment of symptomatic joints. Musculoskeletal ultrasound showed significant joint pathology, even in cases with minimal clinical findings. Synovitis, effusions, enthesitis/tendinopathy, and bone erosions were seen and helped confirm the presence of ongoing inflammatory arthritis. Marked inflammatory change-with synovitis, enthesitis and erosions-can be seen in selected patients with PILA. Systematic sonographic evaluation of patients with PILA is needed to further evaluate pathology and treatment response."

A convenience sample of adults with self- reported, persistent post-Lyme treatment symptoms seeking treatment at the Lifespan Lyme Disease Center in Rhode Island completed a demographic and medical survey, the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 v2.0, and other short-form PROMIS measures of cognitive function, sleep disturbance, and fatigue. Compared to average standardized scale scores (T=50; SD=10), participants had mild impairments in physical (T=41) and social (T=42) functioning, mild symptoms of depression (T=56), anxiety (T=60), and sleep disturbance (T=57), and moderate pain interference (T=62), and fatigue (T=65). Participants reported greater symptoms than some other clinical samples including those with cancer and chronic pain. Post-hoc analyses revealed that women reported higher levels of fatigue than men. People with persistent post-Lyme treatment symptoms report debilitating symptoms and functional impairments which must be considered in clinical care."

		"abstract": "In recent years, the number of recorded cases of Borrelia burgdorferi infections causing Lyme borreliosis has been on a steady rise in Poland. A wide spectrum of disorders in the peripheral and central nervous system is observed in the course of such infections. Symptoms which are not clear-cut are reported by approx. 10-25% of all people infected with B. burgdorferi. They may concern both the somatic and mental spheres, which in turn significantly impedes the daily functioning of the patients. The main purpose of the research was to compare the mental health status of people with neuroborreliosis with that of healthy people. An answer was also obtained to the question of whether people with neuroborreliosis experience difficulties in functioning in the following areas: family, social, professional and educational. The study included 60 people: 30 people with the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis and 30 healthy people aged 18-47. The mean age in the study group was 28.6 years. As a research tool, the General Health Questionnaire 28 (GHQ-28) by Goldberg was used along with a socio-demographic questionnaire. The subjects diagnosed with neuroborreliosis obtained higher results in GHQ-28, both on individual scales: Somatic Symptoms, Anxiety, Insomnia, Social Dysfunction, Severe Depression, as well as the overall result, which is an indicator of the mental health status. As much as 70% of the patients experienced difficulties in functioning in the social area, 66% in the professional area, and 60% in the educational area. No impact of the disease on functioning in the family area has been demonstrated. The results of the study indicate some significant differences in the mental health status of people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis and that of healthy people. The patients obtained significantly higher results in GHQ-28 than the healthy subjects, which proves the poor mental health of the former. It was also confirmed that people diagnosed with neuroborreliosis experience difficulties in functioning in the social, professional and educational areas. Therefore, it becomes crucial to deepen research into mental health in tick-borne diseases, including neuroborreliosis, and to adapt and implement appropriate preventive and therapeutic measures.

		"abstract": "Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

Evidence suggests communication in the clinical encounter improves when both patient and healthcare provider (HCP) have concordant orientations (or beliefs) on discussed topics, resulting in higher patient satisfaction and care outcomes. The purpose of this scoping review was to characterize and summarize current research findings on patient and provider knowledge and experiences regarding LD - two factors that may influence the orientation of both patients and providers toward LD in the clinical setting. None of the articles included in the review specifically addressed patient-provider interaction and relationships as the main objective. However, the existing literature indicates notable HCP uncertainty regarding LD diagnosis, treatment, and applied practice patterns. Current research also describes limited knowledge of LD among patient populations and a high prevalence of negative perceptions of care received in mainstream healthcare settings among individuals with persistent symptoms. We identified a critical gap in research that seeks to understand the dynamic of patients and HCPs communicating on the topic of LD in the clinical setting. Future research may identify opportunities where the patient-provider communication dynamic can be improved."

At each visit, RNA-sequencing was applied to profile patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells in addition to extensive clinical phenotyping. Based on the projection of the RNA-seq data into lower dimensions, we observe that the cases are separated from controls, and almost all cases never return to cluster with the controls over time. Enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes between clusters identifies up-regulation of immune response genes. This observation is also supported by deconvolution analysis to identify the changes in cell type composition due to Lyme disease infection. Importantly, we developed several machine learning classifiers that attempt to perform various Lyme disease classifications. We show that Lyme patients can be distinguished from the controls as well as from COVID-19 patients, but classification was not successful in distinguishing those patients with early Lyme disease cases that would advance to develop post-treatment persistent symptoms."

		"abstract": "A tick infestation is one of the most common arthropod-related skin diseases in Hokkaido, the northernmost island of Japan. Ticks also act as an infectious disease vector for humans. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a highly mortal central nervous system infection caused by TBE virus (TBEV), has sporadically occurred there recently. However, there have been no epidemiological data on the current surveillance of human tick bites and the prevalence of TBEV in human-feeding ticks. This study was performed to clarify those indeterminate issues. One hundred and fifty-three ixodid ticks feeding on humans were collected from 150 outpatients in Hokkaido during the season of April to August 2018. None of the cases showed any infectious symptoms. These ticks were morphologically identified to species, and a cytopathic assay on baby hamster kidney cells was carried out to detect TBEV from each tick. The tick collection consisted of 108 Ixodes persulcatus (one nymph and 107 adult females), 44 female Ixodes ovatus, and one female Haemaphysalis japonica. No tick extracts showed positive results of the cytopathic assay, suggesting the non-existence of TBEV in the present specimens. However, the survey to detect TBEV from human-feeding ticks is still important to monitor the occurrence of TBE, because human tick bites by I. ovatus, a possible vector of TBEV, are increasing even in the northern and eastern areas of Hokkaido."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis and other tick-borne diseases is increasing in Europe and North America. There is currently much interest in identifying the ecological factors that determine the density of infected ticks as this variable determines the risk of Lyme borreliosis to vertebrate hosts, including humans. Lyme borreliosis is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and in western Europe, the hard tick Ixodes ricinus is the most important vector. Over a 15-year period (2004-2018), we monitored the monthly abundance of I. ricinus ticks (nymphs and adults) and their B. burgdorferi s.l. infection status at four different elevations on a mountain in western Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production (masting) from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically 2 years after a masting event. We used generalized linear mixed effects models and AIC-based model selection to identify the ecological factors that influence inter-annual variation in the nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) and the density of infected nymphs (DIN). We found that the NIP decreased by 78% over the study period. Inter-annual variation in the NIP was explained by the mean precipitation in the present year, and the duration that the DNA extraction was stored in the freezer prior to pathogen detection. The DIN decreased over the study period at all four elevation sites, and the decrease was significant at the top elevation. Inter-annual variation in the DIN was best explained by elevation site, year, beech tree masting index 2 years prior and the mean relative humidity in the present year. This is the first study in Europe to demonstrate that seed production by deciduous trees influences the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and hence the risk of Lyme borreliosis. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that masting by deciduous trees is an important predictor of the risk of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Blood-feeding arthropods are considered an enormous public health threat. They are vectors of a plethora of infectious agents that cause potentially fatal diseases like Malaria, Dengue fever, Leishmaniasis, and Lyme disease. These vectors shine due to their own physiological idiosyncrasies, but one biological aspect brings them all together: the requirement of blood intake for development and reproduction. It is through blood-feeding that they acquire pathogens and during blood digestion that they summon a collection of multisystemic events critical for vector competence. The literature is focused on how classical immune pathways (Toll, IMD, and JAK/Stat) are elicited throughout the course of vector infection. Still, they are not the sole determinants of host permissiveness. The dramatic changes that are the hallmark of the insect physiology after a blood meal intake are the landscape where a successful infection takes place. Dominant processes that occur in response to a blood meal are not canonical immunological traits yet are critical in establishing vector competence. These include hormonal circuitries and reproductive physiology, midgut permeability barriers, midgut homeostasis, energy metabolism, and proteolytic activity. On the other hand, the parasites themselves have a role in the outcome of these blood triggered physiological events, consistently using them in their favor. Here, to enlighten the knowledge on vector-pathogen interaction beyond the immune pathways, we will explore different aspects of the vector physiology, discussing how they give support to these long-dated host-parasite relationships."

		"abstract": "Human neutrophils are highly sensitive to the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease (LD), in tissues. Although Bb is also found in the blood of LD patients, far less is known about how neutrophils respond to Bb in the presence of blood. In this study, we employed microfluidic tools to probe the interaction between human neutrophils and Bb and measured the activation of human neutrophils in blood samples from patients. We found that neutrophils migrate vigorously toward Bb in the presence of serum, and this process was complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage or blocking complement receptors decreased neutrophil's ability to interact with Bb. We also found that spiking Bb directly into the blood from healthy donors induced spontaneous neutrophil motility. This response to Bb was also complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage decreased spontaneous neutrophil motility in Bb-spiked blood. Moreover, we found that neutrophils in blood samples from acute LD patients displayed spontaneous motility patterns similar to those observed in Bb-spiked samples. Neutrophil motility was more robust in blood samples from LD patients than that measured in healthy and ill controls, validating the utility of the microfluidic assay for the study of neutrophil-Bb interactions in the presence of blood."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is one of the most important vector-borne diseases worldwide. However, there is limited information on the prevalence and risk analysis using correlated factors in the tropical areas. A total of 1583 serum samples, collected from five hospitals of Hainan Province, were tested by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and western blot (WB) analyses using anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies. Then, we mapped the distribution of positive rate (by IFA) and the spread of confirmed Lyme patients (by WB). Using ArcGIS, we compiled host-vector-human interactions and correlated data as risk factor layers to predict LD risk in Hainan Province. There are three LD hotspots, designated hotspot I, which is located in central Hainan, hotspot II, which contains Sanya district, and hotspot III, which lies in the Haikou-Qiongshan area. The positive rate (16.67% by IFA) of LD in Qiongzhong, located in hotspot I, was higher than that in four other areas. Of confirmed cases of LD, 80.77% of patients (42/52) whose results had been confirmed by WB were in hotspots I and III. Hotspot II, with unknowed prevalence of LD, need to be paid more attention considering human-vector interaction. Wuzhi and Limu mountains might be the most important areas for the prevalence of LD, as the severe host-vector and human-vector interactions lead to a potential origin site for LD. Qiongzhong is the riskiest area and is located to the east of Wuzhi Mountain. In the Sanya and Haikou-Qiongshan area, intervening in the human-vector interaction would help control the prevalence of LD."

		"abstract": "Persistent symptoms attributed to presumed tick-bite exposure constitute an unresolved medical controversy. We evaluated whether Swedish adults who met the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) exhibited characteristics distinguishable from adults who did not, but who displayed similar symptoms and disease course after suspected previous tick-bite infection (TBI). During 2015-2018, 255 patients-referred to the Centre for Vector-borne Infections, Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden with symptoms lasting longer than six months-were recruited. Of this group, 224 completed the study. Each patient was examined by an infectious disease specialist and, besides a full medical history, underwent a panel of blood and cerebrospinal fluid laboratory tests including hematological, biochemical, microbiological and immunological analyses, and the RAND-36 scale to measure quality of life. For analysis purposes, patients were divided into five subgroups, of which one represented PTLDS. According to serological results indicating TBI and documented/ reported objective signs of Lyme disease, 85 (38%) patients fulfilled the criteria for PTLDS and were compared with the other 139 (62%) serologically classified patients. In the PTLDS group, erythema chronicum migrans (ECM) was documented/reported in 86% of patients, previous neuroborreliosis in 15%, and acrodermatitis chronica atroficans (ACA) in 3.5%. However, there were no significant differences regarding symptoms, laboratory results or disease course between patients with PTLDS and those without laboratory evidence of Borrelia exposition. Most reported symptoms were fatigue-related (70%), musculoskeletal (79%), neurological (82%) and neurocognitive (57%). Tick bites were recalled by 74%. The RAND-36 score was significantly below that of the general Swedish population. Signs of immunological/inflammatory reactivity with myositis antibodies were detected in 20% of patients, fibrinogen levels were moderately increased in 21% and elevated rheumatoid factor in 6%. The PTLDS group did not differ exclusively in any respect from the other subgroups, which either lacked previously documented/reported evidence of borreliosis or even lacked detectable serological signs of exposure to Lyme disease. The results suggest that symptoms often categorized as Chronic-Lyme-Disease (CLD) in the general debate, cannot be uniquely linked to Lyme disease. However, approximately 20% of the total group of patients showed signs of autoimmunity. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying causes and mechanisms of PTLDS and there is reason to consider a multifactorial approach."

		"abstract": "Dirofilaria immitis, a mosquito-borne nematode that primarily infects dogs, can equally infect cats. Although there have been numerous studies on canine heartworm prevalence in Brazil, there have been few studies on feline infections. Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are both life-threatening retroviruses transmitted directly between cats. Infections with Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. are highly prevalent among dogs in Brazil, with Rhipicephalus sanguineus being the main vector for both bacteria. This study aimed to gather information on these infections among dogs and cats in the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro by performing rapid point-of-care tests for prophylactic enforcement. Surplus samples of serum or plasma from private laboratories were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (SNAP Feline Triple Test or SNAP 4Dx Plus Test). The prevalence of heartworm disease was 7% among dogs and 0.9% among cats, the latter being 12.9% of the former. The prevalence of FIV and FeLV was 4.3 and 11.9%, respectively. Among dogs, the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma spp. was 27.1 and 9.8%, respectively, and Borrelia burgdorferi was not detected. Given that such infections circulate among pets, prophylactic measures should be encouraged by small animal practitioners."

These salivary components are indispensable for successful blood feeding on vertebrate hosts and are believed to facilitate the transmission of tick-borne pathogens. Here we present the functional and structural characterization of Iripin-3, a protein expressed in the salivary glands of the tick Ixodes ricinus, a European vector of tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease. Belonging to the serpin superfamily of protease inhibitors, Iripin-3 strongly inhibited the proteolytic activity of serine proteases kallikrein and matriptase. In an in vitro setup, Iripin-3 was capable of modulating the adaptive immune response as evidenced by reduced survival of mouse splenocytes, impaired proliferation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, suppression of the T helper type 1 immune response, and induction of regulatory T cell differentiation. Apart from altering acquired immunity, Iripin-3 also inhibited the extrinsic blood coagulation pathway and reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition to its functional characterization, we present the crystal structure of cleaved Iripin-3 at 1.95 Å resolution. Iripin-3 proved to be a pluripotent salivary serpin with immunomodulatory and anti-hemostatic properties that could facilitate tick feeding via the suppression of host anti-tick defenses. Physiological relevance of Iripin-3 activities observed in vitro needs to be supported by appropriate in vivo experiments."

Methods: From 2013 to 2018, sampling surveys had been conducted in medical institutions in 8 cities in Hainan Province(Haikou, Sanya, Danzhou, Dongfang, Wenchang, Qionghai, Qiongzhong, Wuzhishan), 2 311 patients serum samples were collected with arthritis symptoms, and descriptive research were conducted base on the collected clinical data. The Indirect Fluorescent-Antibody Test (IFA) method was used for preliminary screening of Lyme disease antibody, the Western Blot (WB) method was used for IFA positive samples confirmation. Statistical analysis using χ2 test. Results: 2 311 serum samples were tested by IFA, and 166 were positive with the positive rate of 7.18%. Further confirmed by WB method, 62 samples were positive, the positive rate of Lyme disease antibody was 2.68%(62/2 311). The positive rate of Lyme disease antibody among patients with arthritis in different regions of Hainan was statistically significant (χ²=40.636,P<0.001), and the positive rate in Qiongzhong city was the highest (8.81%, 14/159). Danzhou's positive rate was the second highest, 5.62%(5/89). Dongfang city had the lowest positive rate (0.51%, 2/394). The positive rates of Lyme disease serum antibody in men and women were 2.79% (33/1 182) and 2.57% (29/1 129), respectively; the positive rates of antibodies between each age groups were in the range of 1.74% to 3.64%. The antibody positive rate of Lyme disease showed no significant difference between gender and age (χ²=0.110,P=0.740 ;χ²=1.938,P=0.747). Conclusion: Patients with arthritis symptoms caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection were found in 8 cities in Hainan province, but the Lyme disease antibody positive rate was different among cities, with Qiongzhong County being the highest."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. Currently there is no human vaccine against Lyme borreliosis, and most research focuses on recombinant protein vaccines. DNA tattoo vaccination with B. afzelii strain PKo OspC in mice has proven to be fully protective against B. afzelii syringe challenge and induces a favorable humoral immunity compared to recombinant protein vaccination. Alternatively, several recombinant protein vaccines based on tick proteins have shown promising effect in tick-bite infection models. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of DNA vaccines against Borrelia OspC or tick antigens in a tick-bite infection model. We vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with OspC using a codon-optimized DNA vaccine or with recombinant protein. We challenged these mice with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss)-infected Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Subsequently, we vaccinated C3H/HeN mice with DNA vaccines coding for tick proteins for which recombinant protein vaccines have previously resulted in interference with tick feeding and/or Borrelia transmission: Salp15, tHRF, TSLPI, and Tix-5. These mice were also challenged with B. burgdorferi ss infected Ixodes scapularis nymphs. DNA tattoo and recombinant OspC vaccination both induced total IgG responses. Borrelia cultures and DNA loads of skin and bladder remained negative in the mice vaccinated with OspC DNA vaccination, except for one culture. DNA vaccines against tick antigens Salp15 and Tix-5 induced IgG responses, while those against tHRF and TSLPI barely induced any IgG response. In addition, Borrelia cultures, and DNA loads from mice tattooed with DNA vaccines against tick proteins TSLPI, Salp15, tHRF, and Tix-5 were all positive. A DNA tattoo vaccine against OspC induced high specific IgG titers and provided near total protection against B. burgdorferi ss infection by tick challenge. In contrast, DNA tattoo vaccines against tick proteins TSLPI, Salp15, tHRF, and Tix-5 induced low to moderate IgG titers and did not provide protection. Therefore, DNA tattoo vaccination does not seem a suitable vaccine strategy to identify, or screen for, tick antigens for anti-tick vaccines. However, DNA tattoo vaccination is a straightforward and effective vaccination platform to assess novel B. burgdorferi sl antigen candidates in a relevant tick challenge model."

We sought to broadly validate this clinical prediction rule in children with meningitis undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease. We performed a patient-level data meta-analysis of 2 prospective and 2 retrospective cohorts of children ≤21 years of age with cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis who underwent evaluation for Lyme disease. We defined a case of Lyme meningitis with a positive 2-tier serology result (positive or equivocal first-tier enzyme immunoassay followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot). We applied the Rule of 7's and report the accuracy for the identification of Lyme meningitis. Of 721 included children with meningitis, 178 had Lyme meningitis (24.7%) and 543 had aseptic meningitis (75.3%). The pooled data from the 4 studies showed the Rule of 7's has a sensitivity of 98% [95% confidence interval (CI): 89%-100%, I2 = 71%], specificity 40% (95% CI: 30%-50%, I2 = 75%), and a negative predictive value of 100% (95% CI: 95%-100%, I2 = 55%). The Rule of 7's accurately identified children with meningitis at low-risk for Lyme meningitis for whom clinicians should consider outpatient management while awaiting Lyme disease test results."

		"abstract": "Neurosyphilis (NS) and Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) are spirochetal diseases with distinct clinical manifestations. The diagnosis of NS remains challenging due to imperfect diagnostic criteria and testing modalities. With LNB, misconceptions about diagnosis and treatment lead to considerable morbidity and drug related adverse effects. Although studies continue investigating alternate approaches and new diagnostic tests for NS, few data exist to change current approaches to diagnosis, management or follow up. In the diagnosis of LNB, the chemokine CXCL13 shows promising diagnostic accuracy. A systematic review discourages the use of cell-based assays when investigating Lyme disease. Clinical studies show no benefit from extended antibiotic treatment for patients with unspecific symptoms labelled as having Lyme disease. The diagnosis of NS may be delayed due to a lack of specificity of findings, low suspicion for syphilis, and/or similarities in presentation to other diseases. A high index of suspicion for syphilis is required provide timely diagnosis and management of NS. Fortunately, penicillin remains the treatment of choice. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment in patients labelled as having Lyme disease can be avoided by an evidence-based approach towards diagnosis and treatment."

The objective of this report was to perform preliminary serological survey of hospitalized population for LB. Methods: Sera were collected from 203 patients of a hospital located in Western Ukraine. Most patients showed clinical signs that were compatible with LB such as arthritis (n = 29), neurological signs (n = 35), and erythema migrans (EM)-like lesions (n = 60) or unrelated to LB (n = 79). The specimens were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot for anti-Borrelia antibodies. Results: LB was confirmed in 8.6%, 34.5%, and 50% of the patients, who exhibited neurological signs, arthritis, or EM-like lesions, respectively. Anti-Borrelia antibodies were also detected in 6.3% of the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Conclusions: This study provides the first preliminary data on the seroprevalence of LB in Ukraine. Future studies are warranted to investigate more subsets of the Ukrainian population for this emerging tick-borne disease."

All 574 inpatient patients (51% male, median age: 60 years) with ISSNHL and NISSNHL, who were treated in federal state Thuringia in 2011 and 2012, were included retrospectively. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. ISSNHL was diagnosed in 490 patients (85%), NISSNHL in 84 patients (15%). 49% of these cases had hearing loss due to acute otitis media, 37% through varicella-zoster infection or Lyme disease, 10% through Menière disease and 7% due to other reasons. Patients with ISSNHL and NISSNHL showed no difference between age, gender, side of hearing loss, presence of tinnitus or vertigo and their comorbidities. 45% of patients with ISSNHL and 62% with NISSNHL had an outpatient treatment prior to inpatient treatment (p < 0.001). The mean interval between onset of hearing loss to inpatient treatment was shorter in ISSNHL (7.7 days) than in NISSNHL (8.9 days; p = 0.02). The initial hearing loss of the three most affected frequencies in pure-tone average (3PTAmax) scaled 72.9 dBHL ± 31.3 dBHL in ISSNHL and 67.4 dBHL ± 30.5 dBHL in NISSNHL. In the case of acute otitis media, 3PTAmax (59.7 dBHL ± 24.6 dBHL) was lower than in the case of varicella-zoster infection or Lyme disease (80.11 dBHL ± 34.19 dBHL; p = 0.015). Mean absolute hearing gain (Δ3PTAmaxabs) was 8.1 dB ± 18.8 dB in patients with ISSNHL, and not different in NISSNHL patients with 10.2 dB ± 17.6 dB. A Δ3PTAmaxabs ≥ 10 dB was reached in 34.3% of the patients with ISSNHL and to a significantly higher rate of 48.8% in NISSNHL patients (p = 0.011). ISSNHL and NISSNHL show no relevant baseline differences. ISSNHL tends to have a higher initial hearing loss. NISSHNL shows a better outcome than ISSNHL."

Significant variability in EM presenting characteristics such as shape, color, pattern, and homogeneity, has been reported. We studied associations between these presenting characteristics, as well as whether they were associated with age, sex, EM duration, body location, and initiation of antibiotics. Two hundred and seventy one adult participants with early Lyme disease who had a physician-diagnosed EM skin lesion of ≥ 5 cm in diameter and ≤ 72 h of antibiotic treatment were enrolled. Participant demographics, clinical characteristics, and characteristics of their primary EM lesion were recorded. After adjusting for potential confounders, EM size increased along with increasing EM duration to a peak of 14 days. Male EM were found to be on average 2.18 cm larger than female EM. The odds of a red (vs blue/red) EM were 65% lower in males compared to females, and were over 3 times as high for EM found on the pelvis, torso, or arm compared to the leg. Age remained a significant predictor of central clearing in adjusted models; for every 10-year increase in age, the odds of central clearing decreased 25%. Given that EM remains a clinical diagnosis, it is essential that both physicians and the general public are aware of its varied manifestations. Our findings suggest possible patterns within this variability, with implications for prompt diagnosis and treatment initiation, as well as an understanding of the clinical spectrum of EM."

		"abstract": "Climate change plays an important role in the geographic spread of zoonotic diseases. Knowing which populations are at risk of contracting these diseases is critical to informing public health policies and practices. In Québec, 14 zoonoses have been identified as important for public health to guide the climate change adaptation efforts of decision-makers and researchers. A great deal has been learned about these diseases in recent years, but information on at-risk workplaces remains incomplete. The objective of this study is to paint a portrait of the occupations and sectors of economic activity at risk for the acquisition of these zoonoses. A rapid review of the scientific literature was conducted. Databases on the Ovid and EBSCO research platforms were searched for articles published between 1995 and 2018, in English and French, on 14 zoonoses (campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli, giardiasis, listeriosis, salmonellosis, Eastern equine encephalitis, Lyme disease, West Nile virus, food botulism, Q fever, avian and swine influenza, rabies, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) and occupational health. The literature search retrieved 12,558 articles and, after elimination of duplicates, 6,838 articles were evaluated based on the title and the abstract. Eligible articles had to address both concepts of the research issue (prioritized zoonoses and worker health). Of the 621 articles deemed eligible, 110 were selected following their full reading. Of the diseases under study, enteric zoonoses were the most frequently reported. Agriculture, including veterinary services, public administration services and medical and social services were the sectors most frequently identified in the literature. The results of our study will support public health authorities and decision-makers in targeting those sectors and occupations that are particularly at risk for the acquisition of zoonoses. Doing so will ultimately optimize the public health practices of those responsible for the health of workers."

		"abstract": "Ticks are obligate hematophagous parasites and are important vectors of a wide variety of pathogens. These pathogens include spirochetes in the genus Borrelia that cause Lyme disease, rickettsial pathogens, and tick-borne encephalitis virus, among others. Due to their prolonged feeding period of up to two weeks, hard ticks must counteract vertebrate host defense reactions in order to survive and reproduce. To overcome host defense mechanisms, ticks have evolved a large number of pharmacologically active molecules that are secreted in their saliva, which inhibits or modulates host immune defenses and wound healing responses upon injection into the bite site. These bioactive molecules in tick saliva can create a privileged environment in the host's skin that tick-borne pathogens take advantage of. In fact, evidence is accumulating that tick-transmitted pathogens manipulate tick saliva composition to enhance their own survival, transmission, and evasion of host defenses. We review what is known about specific and functionally characterized tick saliva molecules in the context of tick infection with the genus Borrelia, the intracellular pathogen Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Additionally, we review studies analyzing sialome-level responses to pathogen challenge."

Some of these proteins also serve different roles in infection and dissemination of the spirochete in the mammalian host. In this spirochete, a number of proteins have been associated with binding to plasminogen or components of the extracellular matrix, which is important for tissue colonization and dissemination. GroEL is a cytoplasmic chaperone protein that has previously been associated with the outer membrane of Borrelia. A His-tag purified B. burgdorferi GroEL was used to generate a polyclonal rabbit antibody showing that GroEL also localizes in the outer membrane and is surface exposed. GroEL binds plasminogen in a lysine dependent manner. GroEL may be part of the protein repertoire that Borrelia successfully uses to establish infection and disseminate in the host. Importantly, this chaperone is readily recognized by sera from experimentally infected mice and rabbits. In summary, GroEL is an immunogenic protein that in addition to its chaperon role it may contribute to pathogenesis of the spirochete by binding to plasminogen and components of the extra cellular matrix."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is the most prevalent tick-borne disease. There is evidence that vaccines based on tick proteins that promote tick transmission of B. burgdorferi could prevent LD. As Ixodes scapularis nymph tick bites are responsible for most LD cases, this study sought to identify nymph tick saliva proteins associated with B. burgdorferi transmission using LC-MS/MS. Tick saliva was collected using a non-invasive method of stimulating ticks (uninfected and infected: unfed, and every 12 h during feeding through 72 h, and fully-fed) to salivate into 2% pilocarpine-PBS for protein identification using LC-MS/MS. We identified a combined 747 tick saliva proteins of uninfected and B. burgdorferi infected ticks that were classified into 25 functional categories: housekeeping-like (48%), unknown function (18%), protease inhibitors (9%), immune-related (6%), proteases (8%), extracellular matrix (7%), and small categories that account for <5% each. Notably, B. burgdorferi infected ticks secreted high number of saliva proteins (n=645) than uninfected ticks (n=376). Counter-intuitively, antimicrobial peptides, which function to block bacterial infection at tick feeding site were suppressed 23-85 folds in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Similar to glycolysis enzymes being enhanced in mammalian cells exposed to B. burgdorferi : eight of the 10-glycolysis pathway enzymes were secreted at high abundance by B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Of significance, rabbits exposed to B. burgdorferi infected ticks acquired potent immunity that caused 40-60% mortality of B. burgdorferi infected ticks during the second infestation compared to 15-28% for the uninfected. This might be explained by ELISA data that show that high expression levels of immunogenic proteins in B. burgdorferi infected ticks. Data here suggest that B. burgdorferi infection modified protein content in tick saliva to promote its survival at the tick feeding site. For instance, enzymes; copper/zinc superoxide dismutase that led to production of H2O2 that is toxic to B. burgdorferi were suppressed, while, catalase and thioredoxin that neutralize H2O2, and pyruvate kinase which yields pyruvate that protects Bb from H2O2 killing were enhanced. We conclude data here is an important resource for discovery of effective antigens for a vaccine to prevent LD."

Both I. scapularis and its associated pathogens have expanded their geographic range throughout the northeastern Unites States and into northern New England. Through this study, we present an updated distribution of I. scapularis in Maine and report the first statewide passive surveillance infection and coinfection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti within the state's I. scapularis population. In 2019, we collected 2016 ticks through a passive surveillance program, in which Maine residents submitted tick samples for identification and/or pathogen testing. We used a single multiplex quantitative PCR assay to detect tickborne pathogens in 1901 tick samples. At the state level, we found that Bo. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum infection rates of adults (42.4%, 11.1%) were nearly double that of nymphs (26.9%, 6.7%), whereas B. microti prevalence was similar for both adults (6.5%) and nymphs (5.2%). Spatially, we found an uneven distribution of both tick activity and pathogen prevalence, with both increasing on a north to south gradient. We also noted a potential association between the ratio of adult to nymphal ticks and the incidence of tickborne disease in human populations, with counties that exhibit high rates of human disease also maintaining low adult to nymph ratios."

		"abstract": "Pathogen species often consist of genetically distinct strains, which can establish mixed infections or coinfections in the host. In coinfections, interactions between pathogen strains can have important consequences for their transmission success. We used the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii, which is the most common cause of Lyme disease in Europe, as a model multi-strain pathogen to investigate the relationship between coinfection, competition between strains, and strain-specific transmission success. Mus musculus mice were infected with one or two strains of B. afzelii, strain transmission success was measured by feeding ticks on mice, and the distribution of each strain in six different mouse organs and the ticks was measured using qPCR. Coinfection and competition reduced the tissue infection prevalence of both strains and changed their bacterial abundance in some tissues. Coinfection and competition also reduced the transmission success of the B. afzelii strains from the infected hosts to feeding ticks. The ability of the B. afzelii strains to establish infection in the host tissues was strongly correlated with their transmission success to the tick vector. Our study demonstrates that coinfection and competition between pathogen strains inside the host tissues can have major consequences for their transmission success."

		"abstract": "As opposed to pathogens passively circulating in the body fluids of their host, pathogenic species within the Spirochetes phylum are able to actively coordinate their movement in the host to cause systemic infections. Based on the unique morphology and high motility of spirochetes, we hypothesized that their surface adhesive molecules might be suitably adapted to aid in their dissemination strategies. Designing a system that mimics natural environmental signals, which many spirochetes face during their infectious cycle, we observed that a subset of their surface proteins, particularly Decorin binding protein (Dbp) A/B, can strongly enhance the motility of spirochetes in the extracellular matrix of the host. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we disentangled the mechanistic details of DbpA/B and decorin/laminin interactions. Our results show that spirochetes are able to leverage a wide variety of adhesion strategies through force-tuning transient molecular binding to extracellular matrix components, which concertedly enhance spirochetal dissemination through the host."

The diagnosis was confirmed by the detection of Borrelia-DNA in a skin punch biopsy. The patient history did not reveal any tick exposure. She had suffered for several months from fluctuating pain and swelling of the right knee as well as skin involvement with redness and oedema around the ankle of the same leg. Monoarthritis was confirmed by a rheumatologist. Knee puncture was performed but the synovial fluid was only sufficient for microscopic examination of crystals. Neither monosodium urate crystals nor calcium pyrophosphate crystals were found. Borrelia serology in blood revealed borderline levels of immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG, respectively. Treatment with doxycycline resulted in resolution of the joint and skin manifestations within a month. This case highlights that Borrelia-specific antibody levels cannot be reliably interpreted in patients who have received B-cell depleting therapy. Under these circumstances, detection of the bacterial genome in different body fluids, such as in the skin, can be a useful complement to the diagnosis of Lyme disease. In this young female, the diagnosis would certainly have been further delayed without the detection of Borrelia-DNA in the skin."

We propose that the co-occurrence of COVID-19 and Lyme disease during the spring of 2020 resulted in a delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease due to COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in healthcare workflow and diagnostic reasoning. This delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease in the patient we describe resulted in disseminated infection and sixth nerve palsy. We present the use of telemedicine to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease and to provide prompt access to diagnosis and care during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in the future."

		"abstract": "The purpose of the study was to carry out the molecular surveillance of piroplasmosis, granulocytic anaplasmosis and lyme borreliosis in horses which originated from Poland and exhibited symptoms raising the suspicion of the aforementioned disease units. The presence of Theileria equi genetic material was detected in 37 out of 512 examined horses (7.2%), and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in 9 (1.8%). The DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi was found in 11 out of 204 examined horses (5.4%). The above-cited results indicate that the problem of tick-borne diseases affecting horses in Poland is not as significant as in other parts of Europe, however they have to be considered in differential diagnosis of the diseases with lethargy, fever, anaemia and thrombocytopenia."

We have observed disproportionate equivocal serologies in children requiring reflex western blot (WB) using manufacturer-provided ranges based on adult studies. We aimed to determine appropriate ranges for our pediatric population. We performed a one-year retrospective institutional review of all 2755 children with LD testing with the Vidas® Lyme IgM II/IgG II immunoassays with reflex to WB for equivocal/positive serologies. Results were assessed by frequency distributions, optimization via percent agreement analysis, and clinical adjudication. The proposed ranges for IgM (negative ≤0.20, equivocal ≥0.21 to <0.32, positive ≥0.32) and IgG (negative ≤0.50, positive >0.50) allowed for a decrease in the IgM equivocal rate (7% to 2%) and IgG positive rate (15% to 13%). There was a decrease in the positive percent agreement between tiers (95% to 83% and 98% to 95%) with increase in the negative (32% to 63% and 70% to 81%) and overall (65% to 73% and 85% to 88%) percent agreements for IgM and IgG, respectively. Of 15 IgM serologies reclassified as negative with a positive WB and not positive for IgG, 8 were clinically negative, 5 were clinically positive, and two had insufficient history. Of the 10 IgG serologies reclassified as negative with a positive WB 3 were clinically positive, 6 were clinically negative and one had insufficient history. Our modified ranges are more suitable for our pediatric population while reducing overdiagnosis, unnecessary treatment, diagnostic uncertainty, and turnaround time."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is predominantly caused by Borrelia afzelii and transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Although Borrelia behavior throughout tick development is quite well documented, specific molecular interactions between Borrelia and the tick have not been satisfactorily examined. Here, we present the first transcriptomic study focused on the expression of tick midgut genes regulated by Borrelia. By using massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE), we searched for tick transcripts expressed differentially in the midgut of unfed, 24h-fed, and fully fed I. ricinus nymphs infected with B. afzelii. In total, we identified 553 upregulated and 530 downregulated tick genes and demonstrated that B. afzelii interacts intensively with the tick. Technical and biological validations confirmed the accuracy of the transcriptome. The expression of five validated tick genes was silenced by RNA interference. Silencing of the uncharacterized protein (GXP_Contig_30818) delayed the infection progress and decreased infection prevalence in the target mice tissues. Silencing of other genes did not significantly affect tick feeding nor the transmission of B. afzelii, suggesting a possible role of these genes rather in Borrelia acquisition or persistence in ticks. Identification of genes and proteins exploited by Borrelia during transmission and establishment in a tick could help the development of novel preventive strategies for Lyme borreliosis."

All three episodes of strep occurred during the 6-months interval between suspected Lyme disease exposure and the onset of multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Her sometimes incapacitating symptoms followed a relapsing and remitting course that impacted her personal, family, social, and academic domains. Over a span of 31 consecutive months of treatment with various antimicrobials and three courses of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) she experienced complete remission and remains symptom free at the time of this publication.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. While Lyme disease vectors are widespread, high incidence states are concentrated in the Northeast, North Central and Mid-Atlantic regions. Mapping the distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes in ticks may aid in providing data-driven explanations of epidemiological trends and recommendations for targeting prevention strategies to communities at risk. We compiled data from the literature, publicly available tickborne pathogen surveillance databases, and internal CDC pathogen testing databases to map the county-level distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes reported in host-seeking Ixodes pacificus and Ixodes scapularis across the contiguous United States. We report B. burgdorferi s.s.-infected I. scapularis from 384 counties spanning 26 eastern states located primarily in the North Central, Northeastern, and Mid-Atlantic regions, and in I. pacificus from 20 counties spanning 2 western states, with most records reported from northern and north-coastal California. Borrelia mayonii was reported in I. scapularis in 10 counties in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the North Central United States, where records of B. burgdorferi s.s. were also reported. In comparison to a broad distribution of vector ticks, the resulting map shows a more limited distribution of Lyme disease spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Throughout its enzootic cycle, the Lyme disease spirochete Borreliella (Borrelia) burgdorferi, senses and responds to changes in its environment using a small repertoire of transcription factors that coordinate the expression of genes required for infection of Ixodes ticks and various mammalian hosts. Among these transcription factors, the DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression in B. burgdorferi during periods of nutrient limitation and is required for mammalian infectivity. In many pathogenic bacteria, the gene regulatory activity of DksA, along with the alarmone guanosine penta- and tetra-phosphate ((p)ppGpp), coordinate the stringent response to various environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of DksA in regulating the transcriptional activity of RNA polymerase and its role in the regulation of RpoS-dependent gene expression required for B. burgdorferi infectivity. Using in vitro transcription assays, we observed recombinant DksA inhibits RpoD-dependent transcription by B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase independent of ppGpp. Additionally, we determined the pH-inducible expression of RpoS-dependent genes relies on DksA, but this relationship is independent of (p)ppGpp produced by Relbbu. Subsequent transcriptomic and western blot assays indicate DksA regulates the expression of BBD18, a protein previously implicated in the post-transcriptional regulation of RpoS. Moreover, we observed DksA was required for infection of mice following intraperitoneal inoculation or for transmission of B. burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis nymphs. Together, these data suggest DksA plays a central role in coordinating transcriptional responses in B. burgdorferi required for infectivity through DksA's interactions with RNA polymerase and post-transcriptional control of RpoS."

Therefore, the list of potential applications is still increasing, exemplified by the US Food and Drug Administration approval of disulfiram (Antabuse) and its metabolite diethyldithiocarbamate in clinical trials against cancer, human immunodeficiency virus, and Lyme disease, as well as new DTC-related compounds that have been synthesized to target diseases with unmet therapeutic needs. In this review, we will discuss the latest progress of DTCs as anti-cancer agents and provide a summary of the mechanisms of action.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States, yet critical gaps remain in our understanding of tick and host interactions that shape disease dynamics. Rodents such as deer mice (Peromyscus spp.) and dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) are key reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological bacterium of Lyme disease, and can vary greatly in abundance between habitats. The aggregation of Ixodes pacificus, the western black-legged tick, on rodent hosts is often assumed to be constant across various habitats and not dependent on the rodent or predator communities; however, this is rarely tested. The factors that determine tick burdens on key reservoir hosts are important in estimating Lyme disease risk because larger tick burdens can amplify pathogen transmission. This study is the first to empirically measure I. pacificus larval burdens on competent reservoir hosts as a function of community factors such as rodent diversity, predator diversity, and questing tick abundance. Rodents were live trapped at oak woodland sites to collect tick burdens and tissue samples to test for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that N. fuscipes tick burdens were negatively correlated with predator diversity, but positively correlated with questing I. pacificus larvae. In addition, rodent hosts that were infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato tend to have higher burdens of larval ticks. These results demonstrate that tick burdens can be shaped by variability between individuals, species, and the broader host community with consequences for transmission and prevalence of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "We performed tick surveys in all regions (Kaetsu, Chuetsu, Joetsu, and Sado) of the Niigata prefecture, Japan. A total of 105 field surveys were done from 2016 to 2018 in 41 sites, from north to south, in the prefecture. All 4806 ticks collected were identified and classified by species, sex, and developmental stage. Twelve species were recorded: Dermacentor taiwanensis, Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis hystricis, Haemaphysalis japonica, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Ixodes ovatus, Ixodes nipponensis, Ixodes persulcatus, Ixodes monospinosus, Ixodes columnae, and Ixodes turdus. The major tick species in Niigata prefecture were H. flava, H. longicornis, and I. ovatus and they comprised 93.4% of all samples. These three species have one generation per year. Climatic and anthropogenic factors may be involved in the substantial change of the endemic species composition from a previous tick survey (1959) in the Niigata prefecture. These factors include increasing temperatures, introduction of new hosts such as the wild boar, highway construction, and a rural exodus facilitating animal migration and reproduction. Tick hosts suitable for the transmission of Japanese spotted fever, Lyme borreliosis, and SFTS occur in Niigata prefecture. Heightened awareness of these three tick-borne diseases is needed for preparation and disease prevention."

		"abstract": "The diagnosis of Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is clinical but frequently supported by laboratory tests. Lyme arthritis is now less frequently seen than at the time of its discovery. However, it still occurs, and it is important to recognize this, the differential diagnoses, and how laboratory tests can be useful and their limitations. The most frequently used diagnostic tests are antibody based. However, antibody testing still suffers from many drawbacks and is only an indirect measure of exposure. In contrast, evolving direct diagnostic methods can indicate active infection."

		"abstract": "Recently, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, has undergone a range expansion from the northeastern and mid-west United States to areas of southeastern Canada, including parts of Ontario. Understanding the seroprevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in horses and risk factors for exposure is important for monitoring and preventing this emerging disease. Cross-sectional study of 551 horses in southern, central, and eastern Ontario, Canada. To assess the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi in horses in Ontario, Canada; to evaluate risk factors associated with seropositivity; and, to compare the performance of two diagnostic tests. Serum samples were obtained from clinically healthy horses in Ontario, Canada, along with completed questionnaires that were used for the risk factor analysis. Sera were tested with a Multiplex ELISA (Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University) and C6 ELISA (IDEXX SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test, IDEXX Laboratories). The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi on at least one test was 17% (91/551), though only 15 (16%) horses tested positive with both tests. A spatial cluster of cases was detected in Eastern Ontario. The odds of being seropositive for B. burgdorferi on the C6 ELISA were significantly increased when oak trees were present by pastures (OR = 7.3 (1.8-29.2), P = .005), while the odds were significantly decreased when regular tick checks were performed (OR = 0.1 (0.01-0.7), P = 0.02). Recruitment focused on known areas with blacklegged ticks as well as areas of higher horse density, which may have led to selection bias. The expansion of blacklegged tick populations poses an ongoing risk for horses. Assessment of diagnostic testing options and risk factors is important for diagnosis and prevention, and with further investigation this information may be used to propose changes in management."

		"abstract": "In children, tick-borne encephalitis and neuroborreliosis are common infections affecting the central nervous system. As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "Exposure of sheep to Borreliaburgdorferi sensulato (s.I.) complex, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis (LB), has been reported in tick-abundant areas worldwide, while no data have been reported in Greece. The aim of the study was to identify the hematological alterations in sheep with seropositivity against Borrelia burgdorferi (s.I.). Blood samples were obtained from 318 tick infested sheep for blood analysis and serological determination of IgG and IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi by indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) assay after exclusion of endo-ectoparasites and other tick-borne infections. A total number of 162 sheep met the inclusion criteria, allocated in four groups based on the presence or absence of IgG and/or IgM; sheep found negative for IgM and IgG (Group A), positive for IgM (Group B), positive for both IgM and IgG (Group C) and positive for IgG (Group D). Anemia, thrombocytopenia and normal or decreased leukocyte count, mainly due to lymphopenia were the main hematological features observed in seropositive sheep. The presence of these features raises the suspicion of Borrelia infection in tick infested sheep. The seropositivity of 23.58% in sheep raises concerns of Borrelia circulation, especially in rural areas and potential risk of transmission to humans."

		"abstract": "Entomological measures have long served as proxies for human risk of Lyme disease (LD) and other tickborne diseases (TBDs) in endemic areas of the United States, despite conflicting results regarding the correlation between these measures and human disease outcomes. Using data from a previous TBD intervention study in Connecticut, Maryland and New York, we evaluated whether human-tick encounters can serve as an accurate proxy for risk of TBDs in areas where LD and other Ixodes scapularis-transmitted infections are common. Among 2,590 households consisting of 4,210 individuals, experiencing a tick encounter was associated with an increased risk of both self-reported (RR = 3.17, 95% CI: 2.05, 4.91) and verified TBD (RR = 2.60, 95% CI: 1.39, 4.84) at the household level. Household characteristics associated with experiencing any tick encounter were residence in Connecticut (aOR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.38, 2.51) or New York (aOR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.25, 2.22), head of household having a graduate level education (aOR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.04, 2.08), owning a pet (aOR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.46, 2.23) and a property size of 2 acres or larger (aOR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.42, 3.70). Results for individual characteristics were similar to those for households. Future prevention studies in LD endemic areas should consider using human-tick encounters as a robust proxy for TBD risk."

Atypical presentations include abdominal pain, ileus/pseudo-obstruction and constipation thought to be due to autonomic dysfunction. Other less common presentations include Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormones (SIADH). Lyme disease should be a differential when a patient presents from Lyme endemic areas with abdominal pain, constipation and SIADH in the setting of other causes of gastrointestinal and renal symptoms ruled out.

We assessed clinical and microbiological characteristics of patients with ACA diagnosed at a single medical centre and compared findings in periods 1991-2004 vs. 2005-2018. The cohort is representative of Slovenian ACA patients. We assessed 693 patients: 461 females and 232 males, with median age of 64 years. Median duration of ACA before diagnosis was 12 months. In all but 2 patients, the skin lesions were located on extremities, more often on the lower (70.0%) than the upper (45.2%), bilaterally in 42.4%. Reddish-blue discoloration, swelling, thinning and wrinkling of skin were present in 95.2%, 28.1%, 46.4% and 20.5% of patients, respectively. Overall, 64.4% of patients reported constitutional symptoms, 23.1% had local symptoms, and 20.8% had symptoms/signs of peripheral neuropathy. Nodules, arthritis, joint deformity, muscle atrophy and paresis were rare (<3%). Borreliae were isolated from 200/664 (30.1%) skin samples; 92.8% were Borrelia afzelii. B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. were more often isolated from the skin of male patients (OR = 4.17) and from those with arthropathy (OR = 11.74). Patients included in the more recent period were older, complained less often of constitutional symptoms but more often of local symptoms, and more often had local swelling but less often skin atrophy and bilateral involvement, probably as a consequence of earlier diagnosis. ACA, typically caused by B. afzelii, usually affects older women. Clinical presentation depends on the duration of illness and probably on the Borrelia species causing the disease."

		"abstract": "In the United States, exposure to human-biting ixodid ticks can occur while spending time on residential properties or in neighborhood green spaces as well as during recreational or occupational activities on public lands. Human-biting tick species collectively transmit >15 species of pathogenic microorganisms and the national burden of tick-borne diseases is increasing. The prospect of a new Lyme disease vaccine for use in humans provides hope for substantial reduction in the >450,000 estimated annual cases of Lyme disease but this breakthrough would not reduce cases of other tick-borne diseases, such as anaplasmosis, babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever group rickettsiosis, and Powassan encephalitis. One intriguing question is to what extent a new Lyme disease vaccine would impact the use of personal protection measures acting broadly against tick-bites. The main tick vector for Lyme disease spirochetes in the eastern United States, Ixodes scapularis, also transmits causative agents of anaplasmosis, babesiosis, and Powassan encephalitis; and this tick species co-occurs with other human-biting vectors such as Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis. It therefore is important that a new Lyme disease vaccine does not result in reduced use of tick-bite prevention measures, such as tick repellents, permethrin-treated clothing, and frequent tick checks. Another key issue is the continuing problem with tick exposure on residential properties, which represents a heavily used outdoor environment the residents cannot reasonably avoid and where they tend to spend large amounts of time outside. As it may not be realistic to keep up daily vigilance with personal protective measures against tick-bites on residential properties during many months of every year, homeowners may also consider the option to suppress host-seeking ticks by means of deer fencing, landscaping, vegetation management, and use of products to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks infesting rodents. When considering the full range of options for actions that can be taken to suppress host-seeking ticks on residential properties, it is clear that individual homeowners face a difficult and bewildering task in deciding what to do based on very general guidance from public health agencies (developed without the benefit of a strong evidence base) and often without ready access to local public health professionals experienced in tick control. This situation is not satisfactory but cannot be corrected without first addressing knowledge gaps regarding the impact of peridomestic tick control measures on host-seeking ticks, human tick-bites, and tick-borne diseases. In parallel with this effort, there also is a need to increase the local public health workforce with knowledge of and experience with tick control to provide better access for homeowners to sound and objective advice regarding tick control on their properties based on key characteristics of the landscaping, habitat composition, and use patterns by wild animal tick hosts as well as the residents."

The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli's DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

		"abstract": "Canadians face an emerging threat of Lyme disease due to the northward expansion of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. We evaluated the degree of I. scapularis population establishment and Borrelia burgdorferi occurrence in the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada from 2017-2019 using active surveillance at 28 sites. We used a field indicator tool developed by Clow et al. to determine the risk of I. scapularis establishment for each tick cohort at each site using the results of drag sampling. Based on results obtained with the field indicator tool, we assigned each site an ecological classification describing the pattern of tick colonization over two successive cohorts (cohort 1 was comprised of ticks collected in fall 2017 and spring 2018, and cohort 2 was collected in fall 2018 and spring 2019). Total annual site-specific I. scapularis density ranged from 0 to 16.3 ticks per person-hour. Sites with the highest density were located within the Greenbelt zone, in the suburban/rural areas in the western portion of the city of Ottawa, and along the Ottawa River; the lowest densities occurred at sites in the suburban/urban core. B. burgdorferi infection rates exhibited a similar spatial distribution pattern. Of the 23 sites for which data for two tick cohorts were available, 11 sites were classified as \"high-stable\", 4 were classified as \"emerging\", 2 were classified as \"low-stable\", and 6 were classified as \"non-zero\". B. burgdorferi-infected ticks were found at all high-stable sites, and at one emerging site. These findings suggest that high-stable sites pose a risk of Lyme disease exposure to the community as they have reproducing tick populations with consistent levels of B. burgdorferi infection. Continued surveillance for I. scapularis, B. burgdorferi, and range expansion of other tick species and emerging tick-borne pathogens is important to identify areas posing a high risk for human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in the face of ongoing climate change and urban expansion."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a growing epidemiological threat in many areas of the world, including North America and Europe. Due to the lack of effective protection against this disease, it seems important to ensure a timely diagnosis for effective treatment and the prevention of serious health consequences. The aim of this study was to assess the costs of diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Poland. The costs incurred for the medical payer were analyzed. The cost of hospitalization due to LB for one patient in 2018 was estimated to be ~582.39 EUR, which constituted 53.10% of the average monthly salary of that year. In the analyzed period (2008-2018), the number of people treated by medical services due to Lyme disease increased, both in hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care. Although, the costs of hospitalization were the highest of the two, we noticed a change ratio between hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care in favor of the latter."

		"abstract": "Purpose: Lyme borreliosis (LB) occurs throughout Europe. No clinical and seroprevalence studies for LB in Kosovo have been publicly available thus far. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate LB from a tick bite perspective in the Pristina region, Kosovo. Methods: This single-center prospective observational study enrolled consecutive adult participants (≥18 years of age) with tick bite (embedded tick in the skin), who were examined at the Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Pristina, between January 2015 and August 2018. At the first visit related to the index tick bite, ticks (the complete ticks or parts of the ticks) were removed from the skin, blood samples were taken for serological tests, and antibiotic treatment was started when deemed necessary. The complete, undamaged ticks removed were proceeded for entomological identification. Participants were followed up at 2 months (serological tests were repeated) and 6 months after the index event for the development of clinical manifestations of LB and/or seroconversion against Borrelia burgdorferi. Results: A total of 380 subjects were included in the study. Most cases were seen in May and June in all study years. All 117 preserved ticks were identified as Ixodes ricinus. Immunoglobulin G seroprevalence among subjects during the first visit in the study was 28/380 (7.4%). Erythema migrans (EM) was clinically diagnosed in 74/380 patients (19.5%, 95% confidence interval 15.6-23.8). Only 15 clinically diagnosed EM (in seronegative patients) were serologically confirmed with seroconversion (2 months later), 3.9% of all subjects included in the study. There were three cases with clinical manifestation between the second and third visit: EM recidivans, multiple erythema, or several nonspecific systemic symptoms. Doxycycline and amoxicillin were mainly used for the treatment of borrelial skin lesions. Conclusion: This assessment can help indicate the need for disease awareness and reinforce the importance of primary prevention measures, early diagnosis, and appropriate treatment."

Despite several studies, the prevalence, cause and severity of such complaints are still not clarified. More knowledge about cognitive function, fatigue and MRI findings in the acute phase of neuroborreliosis could possibly contribute to clarification. In the current study, we therefore aimed to address this. Patients with well-characterized acute neuroborreliosis (n = 72) and a matched control group (n = 68) were screened with eight subtests from three different neuropsychological test batteries assessing attention, working memory and processing speed, and with Fatigue Severity Scale. Fazekas score was used to grade white matter hyperintensities on MRI. We found no differences in mean scores on the neuropsychological tests between the groups. The patient group reported significantly higher level of fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale: 4.8 vs. 2.9, p < .001). There was no significant difference in Fazekas score between the groups. Neuroborreliosis does not seem to affect cognitive functions in the acute state of the disease, while fatigue is common."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, which is caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and related species, can lead to inflammatory pathologies affecting the joints, heart, and nervous systems including the central nervous system (CNS). Inbred laboratory mice have been used to define the kinetics of B. burgdorferi infection and host immune responses in joints and heart, however similar studies are lacking in the CNS of these animals. A tractable animal model for investigating host-Borrelia interactions in the CNS is key to understanding the mechanisms of CNS pathogenesis. Therefore, we characterized the kinetics of B. burgdorferi colonization and associated immune responses in the CNS of mice during early and subacute infection. Using fluorescence-immunohistochemistry, intravital microscopy, bacterial culture, and quantitative PCR, we found B. burgdorferi routinely colonized the dura mater of C3H mice, with peak spirochete burden at day 7 post-infection. Dura mater colonization was observed for several Lyme disease agents including B. burgdorferi, B. garinii, and B. mayonii. RNA-sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR showed that B. burgdorferi infection was associated with increased expression of inflammatory cytokines and a robust interferon (IFN) response in the dura mater. Histopathologic changes including leukocytic infiltrates and vascular changes were also observed in the meninges of infected animals. In contrast to the meninges, we did not detect B. burgdorferi, infiltrating leukocytes, or large-scale changes in cytokine profiles in the cerebral cortex or hippocampus during infection; however, both brain regions demonstrated similar changes in expression of IFN-stimulated genes as observed in peripheral tissues and meninges. Taken together, B. burgdorferi is capable of colonizing the meninges in laboratory mice, and induces localized inflammation similar to peripheral tissues. A sterile IFN response in the absence of B. burgdorferi or inflammatory cytokines is unique to the brain parenchyma, and provides insight into the potential mechanisms of CNS pathology associated with this important pathogen."

		"abstract": "The composition of tick microbiomes varies both within and among tick species. Whether this variation is intrinsic (related to tick characteristics) or extrinsic (related to vertebrate host and habitat) is poorly understood but important, as microbiota can influence the reproductive success and vector competence of ticks. We aimed to uncover what intrinsic and extrinsic factors best explain the microbial composition and taxon richness of 11 species of neotropical ticks collected from eight species of small mammals in 18 forest fragments across central Panama. Microbial richness varied among tick species, life stages, and collection sites but was not related to host blood source. Microbiome composition was best explained by tick life stage, with bacterial assemblages of larvae being a subset of those of nymphs. Collection site explained most of the bacterial taxa with differential abundance across intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Francisella and Rickettsia were highly prevalent, but their proportional abundance differed greatly among tick species, and we found both positive and negative cooccurrence between members of these two genera. Other tick endosymbionts (e.g., Coxiella and Rickettsiella) were associated with specific tick species. In addition, we detected Anaplasma and Bartonella in several tick species. Our results indicate that the microbial composition and richness of neotropical ticks are principally related to intrinsic factors (tick species and life stage) and collection site. Taken together, our analysis informs how tick microbiomes are structured and can help anchor our understanding of tick microbiomes from tropical environments more broadly.IMPORTANCE Blood-feeding arthropod microbiomes often play important roles in disease transmission, yet the factors that structure tick microbial communities in the Neotropics are unknown. Utilizing ticks collected from live animals in neotropical forest fragments, this study teases apart the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic tick-associated factors on tick microbial composition as well as which specific microbes contribute to differences across tick species, tick life stages, the mammals they fed on, and the locations from where they were sampled. Furthermore, this study provides revelations of how notable tick-associated bacterial genera are interacting with other tick-associated microbes as well as the forest animals they encounter."

When the disease affects the central nervous system, it is referred to as neuroborreliosis. In Europe, neuroborreliosis is most often caused by Borrelia garinii. Although it is known that in the host Lyme borreliae spread from the tick bite site to distant tissues via the blood vasculature, the adherence of Lyme borreliae to human brain microvascular endothelial cells has not been studied before. Decorin binding proteins are adhesins expressed on Lyme borreliae. They mediate the adhesion of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan, and the lysine residues located in the binding site of decorin binding proteins are important to the binding activity. In this study, we show that lysine residues located in the canonical binding site can also be found in decorin binding proteins of Borrelia garinii, and that these lysines contribute to biglycan and decorin binding. Most importantly, we show that the lysine residues are crucial for the binding of Lyme borreliae to decorin and biglycan expressing human brain microvascular endothelial cells, which in turn suggests that they are involved in the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis."

Here we present results of a study on tick-borne pathogens detected from tick vectors and rodent reservoirs from an ongoing 5-yr tick suppression study in the Lyme disease-endemic state of Maryland, where human-biting tick species, including Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes), are abundant. During the 2017 tick season, we collected 207 questing ticks and 602 ticks recovered from 327 mice (Peromyscus spp. (Rodentia: Cricetidae)), together with blood and ear tissue from the mice, at seven suburban parks in Howard County. Ticks were selectively tested for the presence of the causative agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [s.l.]), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), babesiosis (Babesia microti), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia ewingii, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and 'Panola Mountain' Ehrlichia) and spotted fever group rickettsiosis (Rickettsia spp.). Peromyscus ear tissue and blood samples were tested for Bo. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s), A. phagocytophilum, Ba. microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi. We found 13.6% (15/110) of questing I. scapularis nymphs to be Bo. burgdorferi s.l. positive and 1.8% (2/110) were A. phagocytophilum positive among all sites. Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. was found in 71.1% (54/76) of I. scapularis nymphs removed from mice and 58.8% (194/330) of captured mice. Results from study on tick abundance and pathogen infection status in questing ticks, rodent reservoirs, and ticks feeding on Peromyscus spp. will aid efficacy evaluation of the integrated tick management measures being implemented."

		"abstract": "In the clinical setting, it is not common practice to consider a vector bite, such as from a tick or flea, to be a contributing factor to chronic digestive symptoms. This article investigates associations we have observed among symptomatic patients and positive blood tests for vector-borne illness (VBI). Patients who visited an urban gastroenterology clinic over a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. A total of 270 patients presenting with a constellation of digestive symptoms - and who had no apparent digestive pathology and reported no prior diagnosis or treatments for VBI - were analyzed. Before the initial visit, all patients completed a review of systems medical history form, which comprised 19 gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and 73 non-GI-related symptoms and conditions. Patients were tested for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) by lactulose breath test. VBI (babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, bartonellosis, borreliosis) was established using 1 or more of several blood tests. Odds ratio (OR) analysis determined associations between exposure to VBI, SIBO, and presenting symptoms/conditions. Two age groups (≤35 years and ≥36 years) were studied using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel stratum-based test. A higher OR (2.03, 95% CI: 1.5-3.6) was found between patients with ≥3 digestive symptoms and positive blood tests for ≥1 VBI. Five of the 19 GI symptoms were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: food intolerance, indigestion, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and heartburn. A similar association in patients with ≥3 non-GI symptoms (OR: 2.83, 95% CI: 1.3-6.4) was observed. Five of the 73 non-GI symptoms/conditions were independently associated with VBI-positive samples: chest pain, shortness of breath, extremity or joint pain, anxiety, and night sweats. Having ≥3 of any digestive or nondigestive symptoms generated significant relative risk of being VBI-positive. Presence of SIBO alone did not identify significant relative risk for a VBI, and age was not a confounder. Findings revealed an association between positive blood tests for vector-borne illness and chronically symptomatic patients regardless of whether symptoms were digestive or nondigestive. The manifestation of 3 or more gastrointestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms should raise suspicion for a VBI."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is common in the northeastern United States, but rare in the southeast, even though the tick vector is found in both regions. Infection prevalence of Lyme spirochetes in host-seeking ticks, an important component to the risk of Lyme disease, is also high in the northeast and northern midwest, but declines sharply in the south. As ticks must acquire Lyme spirochetes from infected vertebrate hosts, the role of wildlife species composition on Lyme disease risk has been a topic of lively academic discussion. We compared tick-vertebrate host interactions using standardized sampling methods among 8 sites scattered throughout the eastern US. Geographical trends in diversity of tick hosts are gradual and do not match the sharp decline in prevalence at southern sites, but tick-host associations show a clear shift from mammals in the north to reptiles in the south. Tick infection prevalence declines north to south largely because of high tick infestation of efficient spirochete reservoir hosts (rodents and shrews) in the north but not in the south. Minimal infestation of small mammals in the south results from strong selective attachment to lizards such as skinks (which are inefficient reservoirs for Lyme spirochetes) in the southern states. Selective host choice, along with latitudinal differences in tick host-seeking behavior and variations in tick densities, explains the geographic pattern of Lyme disease in the eastern US."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is caused by a growing list of related, yet distinct, spirochetes with complex biology and sophisticated immune evasion mechanisms. It may result in a range of clinical manifestations involving different organ systems, and can lead to persistent sequelae in a subset of cases. The pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis is incompletely understood, and laboratory diagnosis, the focus of this review, requires considerable understanding to interpret the results correctly. Direct detection of the infectious agent is usually not possible or practical, necessitating a continued reliance on serologic testing. Still, some important advances have been made in the area of diagnostics, and there are many promising ideas for future assay development. This review summarizes the state of the art in laboratory diagnostics for Lyme borreliosis, provides guidance in test selection and interpretation, and highlights future directions."

A region immediately downstream of the 16S rRNA gene, which included the gene encoding SdhC, was sequenced. For the A. phagocytophilum strains from patients no sequence differences were detected in this region. In contrast, significantly fewer ticks had a sequence encoding SdhC that was identical to that of the human strains (11/16 vs. 16/16, p = 0.04). This variation is consistent with the premise that not all A. phagocytophilum strains present in nature are able to cause clinical illness in humans. A strain referred to as A. phagocytophilumVariant-1 that is regarded as non-pathogenic for humans was previously described using a different typing method. Data from the current study suggest that both typing methods are identifying the same non-pathogenic strains."

The age, sex, and geographic composition of the enrolled population during 2010-2018 remained proportionally stable, despite fluctuations in the number of enrollees. Annual incidence of Lyme disease diagnoses per 100,000 enrollees ranged from 49 to 88, ≈6-8 times higher than that observed for cases reported through notifiable disease surveillance. Age and sex distributions among Lyme disease diagnoses in MarketScan were similar to those of cases reported through surveillance, but proportionally more diagnoses occurred outside of peak summer months, among female enrollees, and outside high-incidence states. Misdiagnoses, particularly in low-incidence states, may account for some of the observed epidemiologic differences. Commercial claims provide a stable data source to monitor trends in Lyme disease diagnoses, but certain important characteristics warrant further investigation."

The environmental and human components of Lyme disease risk in open habitats remain unknown. We quantified the environmental hazard and risk factors for human tick bite exposure among treeless islands with low and high Lyme disease incidence in the Western Isles. We found a higher prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks on high-incidence than on low-incidence islands (6.4% vs. 0.7%); we also found that residents of high-incidence islands reported increased tick bite exposure. Most tick bites (72.7%) occurred <1 km from the home, including many in home gardens. Residents of high Lyme disease incidence islands reported increasing problems with ticks; many suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. We highlight the benefits of an integrated approach in understanding the factors that contribute to Lyme disease emergence."

Hard ticks are obligate haematophagous ectoparasites that serve as vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi. Studies on the presence of Lyme borreliosis in Egyptian animals and associated ticks are scarce. This study was conducted to detect B. burgdorferi in different tick vectors and animal hosts. Three hundred animals (dogs=100, cattle=100, and camels=100) were inspected for tick infestation. Blood samples from 160 tick-infested animals and their associated ticks (n=1025) were collected and examined for the infection with B. burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The identified tick species were characterized molecularly by PCR and sequencing of the ITS2 region. The overall tick infestation rate among examined animals was 78.33% (235/300). The rate of infestation was significantly higher in camels (90%), followed by cattle (76%) and dogs (69%); (P = 0.001). Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus, and both Hyalomma dromedarii and Amblyomma variegatum, were morphologically identified from infested dogs, cattle, and camels; respectively. Molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region confirmed the morphological identification, as well as displayed high similarities of R. sanguineus, H. dromedarii, and A. Variegatu with ticks identified in Egypt and various continents worldwide. Just one dog (1.67%) and its associated tick pool of R. sanguineus were positive for B. burgdorferi infection. The 16S rRNA gene sequence for B. burgdorferi in dog and R. sanguineus tick pool showed a 100% homology. Analyzed data revealed a relatively low rate of B. burgdorferi infection, but a significantly high prevalence of tick infestation among domesticated animals in Egypt, which possesses a potential animal and public health risk. Additionally, molecular characterization of ticks using the ITS2 region was a reliable tool to discriminate species of ticks and confirmed the morphological identification."

Here, we are reporting an interesting and challenging case of Neuro-Borreliosis in a young officer cadet, meeting the description for Bannwarth's syndrome and presenting initially as a surgical emergency followed by paraparesis. The diagnosis was finally clinched based on clinical profile of Chronic Myeloradiculopathy with focal myositis in the setting of recent outdoor camping, and confirmed by demonstrating high IgG antibody titres in serum and Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF). The officer cadet was treated successfully with a 6 week course of Ceftriaxone and Doxycycline, and went back to full training."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), one of the most prevalent tick-borne diseases in the United States (US), is caused by Borreliella burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bb). To date, in the US, LD diagnostics is primarily based on validated two-tiered serological testing, which overall exhibits low sensitivity among other drawbacks. In the present study, a potential of Raman spectroscopy (RS) to detect Bb infection in mice has been explored. For that, C3H mice were infected with wild-type Bb strains, 297, B31, or B31-derived mutant, ∆vlsE. Blood samples taken prior to and post Bb infection were subjected to RS. The data demonstrated that RS did not directly detect Bb spirochetes in blood, but rather sensed biochemical changes associated with Bb infection. Despite Bb infection-associated blood changes detectable by RS were very limited, the partial least square discriminant analysis showed that the average true positive rates were 86% for 297 and 89% for B31 and ∆vlsE."

		"abstract": "The ecology of vector-borne diseases in a region can be attributed to vector-host interactions. In the United States, tick-borne pathogens are the cause of the highest number of reported vector-borne diseases. In the mid-Atlantic region of the eastern United States, tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, have increased in incidence, with tick-host-pathogen interactions considered a contributing factor to this increase. Ticks become infected with pathogens after taking a blood meal from a systemically infected host or through a localized infection while co-feeding on a host with other infected ticks. The host not only plays a role in pathogen acquisition by the tick, but can also facilitate dispersal of the tick locally within a region or over greater distances into new geographical ranges outside of their historical distributional range. In this study conducted in southeastern Virginia (USA), we examined the interaction between both resident and migratory bird species and Ixodes ticks, the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) the main causative agent of Lyme disease on the East coast of the United States. Over a two-year period (2012-2014), 1879 passerine birds were surveyed, with 255 Ixodes ticks tested for the presence of Borrelia spp. Eighty passerine birds (4.3 %) representing 17 bird species were parasitized by at least one Ixodes tick, but only three bird species were parasitized by Ixodes ticks that tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. Twenty Ixodes ticks (7.8 %) tested positive for B. burgdorferi s.s. with nearly all collected from resident bird species including the Carolina wren (Thryothorus ludovicianus) and brown thrasher (Toxostoma rufum). Given that millions of birds pass through southeastern Virginia during migration, even with the low number of Ixodes ticks parasitizing passerine birds and the low prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.s. found within Ixodes ticks collected, the sheer volume of passerine birds suggests they may play a role in the maintenance and dispersal of B. burgdorferi s.s. in southeastern Virginia."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary vector of several tick-borne pathogens, including those causing Lyme disease and babesiosis, in the eastern United States and active collection methods for this species include dragging or wild animal sampling. Nest boxes targeting mice may be an alternative strategy for the surveillance and collection of immature I. scapularis feeding on these hosts and would be much safer for animals compared to small mammal trapping. We constructed double-walled insulated nest boxes (DWINs) with collection tubes mounted below the nesting chamber and deployed eleven in southern Wisconsin from June until September of 2020. The DWINs were occupied by Peromyscus spp. and birds (wren species, Troglodytidae family). We collected 192 ticks from collection tubes, all of which were identified as either I. scapularis (95%) or Dermacentor variabilis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (5%). Only 12% (21/182) and 20% (2/10) of I. scapularis and D. variabilis were blood-fed, respectively. The high proportion of unfed ticks found in collection tubes may be due to grooming by hosts inside the nest boxes. Alternatively, immature ticks may have climbed trees and entered the DWIN seeking a host. Results suggest that nest boxes could be a tool for finding ticks in areas of low density or at the leading edge of invasion, when small mammal trapping or drag sampling is not feasible."

		"abstract": "Around the world, human health and animal health are closely linked in terms of the One Health concept by ticks acting as vectors for zoonotic pathogens. Animals do not only maintain tick cycles but can either be clinically affected by the same tick-borne pathogens as humans and/or play a role as reservoirs or sentinel pathogen hosts. However, the relevance of different tick-borne diseases (TBDs) may vary in human vs. veterinary medicine, which is consequently reflected by the availability of human vs. veterinary diagnostic tests. Yet, as TBDs gain importance in both fields and rare zoonotic pathogens, such as Babesia spp., are increasingly identified as causes of human disease, a One Health approach regarding development of new diagnostic tools may lead to synergistic benefits. This review gives an overview on zoonotic protozoan, bacterial and viral tick-borne pathogens worldwide, discusses commonly used diagnostic techniques for TBDs, and compares commercial availability of diagnostic tests for humans vs. domestic animals, using Germany as an example, with the aim of highlighting existing gaps and opportunities for collaboration in a One Health framework."

A clinical case series of patents. Participants were recruited from a single-site, Lyme disease referral clinic patient population and were evaluated by physical exam, clinical laboratory testing and standardised questionnaires. Two hundred and twelve participants met study criteria for PTLD, with medical record-confirmed prior Lyme disease as well as current symptoms and functional impact. Exploratory factor analysis classified 30 self-reported symptoms into 6 factors: 'Fatigue Cognitive', 'Ocular Disequilibrium', 'Infection-Type', 'Mood-Related', 'Musculoskeletal Pain' and 'Neurologic'. A final latent profile analysis was conducted using 'Fatigue Cognitive', 'Musculoskeletal Pain' and 'Mood-Related' factor-based scores, which produced three emergent symptom profiles, and participants were classified into corresponding subgroups with 59.0%, 18.9% and 22.2% of the sample, respectively. Compared with the other two groups, subgroup 1 had similarly low levels across all factors relative to the sample as a whole, and reported lower rates of disability (1.6% vs 10.0%, 12.8%; q=0.126, 0.035) and higher self-efficacy (median: 7.5 vs 6.0, 5.3; q=0.068,<0.001). Subgroup 2 had the highest 'Musculoskeletal Pain' factor-based scores (q≤0.001). Subgroup 3 was characterised overall by higher symptom factor-based scores, and reported higher depression (q≤0.001). This analysis identified six symptom factors and three potentially clinically relevant subgroups among patients with well-characterised PTLD. We found that these subgroups were differentiated not only by symptom phenotype, but also by a range of other factors. This may serve as an initial step towards engaging with the symptom heterogeneity that has long been observed among patients with this condition."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi must acquire all of its amino acids (AAs) from its arthropod vector and vertebrate host. Previously, we determined that peptide uptake via the oligopeptide (Opp) ABC transporter is essential for spirochete viability in vitro and during infection. Our prior study also suggested that B. burgdorferi employs temporal regulation in concert with structural variation of oligopeptide-binding proteins (OppAs) to meet its AA requirements in each biological niche. Herein, we evaluated the contributions to the B. burgdorferi enzootic cycle of three of the spirochete's five OppAs (OppA1, OppA2, and OppA5). An oppA1 transposon (tn) mutant lysed in the hyperosmolar environment of the feeding tick, suggesting that OppA1 imports amino acids required for osmoprotection. The oppA2tn mutant displayed a profound defect in hematogenous dissemination in mice, yet persisted within skin while inducing only a minimal antibody response. These results, along with slightly decreased growth of the oppA2tn mutant within DMCs, suggest that OppA2 serves a minor nutritive role, while its dissemination defect points to an as yet uncharacterized signaling function. Previously, we identified a role for OppA5 in spirochete persistence within the mammalian host. We now show that the oppA5tn mutant displayed no defect during the tick phase of the cycle and could be tick-transmitted to naïve mice. Instead of working in tandem, however, OppA2 and OppA5 appear to function in a hierarchical manner; the ability of OppA5 to promote persistence relies upon the ability of OppA2 to facilitate dissemination. Structural homology models demonstrated variations within the binding pockets of OppA1, 2, and 5 indicative of different peptide repertoires. Rather than being redundant, B. burgdorferi's multiplicity of Opp binding proteins enables host-specific functional compartmentalization during the spirochete lifecycle."

At the completion of the survey, 192 responses were received from veterinarians practicing in all 10 Canadian provinces. Answers to short scenario and treatment questions reflected a wide variety of clinical approaches taken by veterinarians. Regional differences were seen in reported tick distribution and clinical approaches. Regional differences and generalized differences were found in approaches used by responding Canadian veterinarians with regard to managing Bb exposure and Lyme disease in dogs.

Ticks spend most of their lives in the external environment away from the host and are thus expected to be affected by changes in climate. Most empirical and theoretical studies demonstrate or predict range shifts or increases in ticks and tick-borne diseases, but there can be a lot of heterogeneity in such predictions. Tick-borne disease systems are complex, and determining whether changes are due to climate change or other drivers can be difficult. Modeling studies can help tease apart and understand the roles of different drivers of change. Predictive models can also be invaluable in projecting changes according to different climate change scenarios. However, validating these models remains challenging, and estimating uncertainty in predictions is essential. Another focus for future research should be assessing the resilience of ticks and tick-borne pathogens to climate change."

There is a risk for overdiagnosis of LB, inadequate use of antibiotics, and potential delay of proper diagnosis. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic value of IgM analysis in serum and IgM antibody index (AI) in LB diagnosis. This was a retrospective observational study regarding Borrelia-specific antibodies in serum and Borrelia-specific AI in LB investigations being made during 2017 in Jönköping County, Sweden. Medical records of 610 patients with detectable anti-Borrelia antibodies in serum (IgM and/or IgG) and 15 patients with elevated Borrelia-specific AI were retrospectively scrutinized, and the compliance to current European recommendations was assessed. Among the 610 patients, only 30% were tested according to the European recommendations. Within this group of tests taken correctly, 50% of the LB diagnoses in patients with isolated IgM reactivity in serum were retrospectively assessed as incorrect (LB unlikely). Three pediatric patients with clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) had elevated IgM AI alone. Serological testing without distinct clinical signs/symptoms consistent with LB contributes to most misdiagnoses. Isolated IgM positivity in serum shows limited clinical value and needs further assessment before being reported by the laboratory. Detection of IgM in combination with IgG antibodies in serum shows no clinical enhancement for correct LB diagnosis compared to isolated IgG positivity. However, Borrelia-specific IgM AI may be important for sensitivity in early LNB."

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tickborne infection in North America and those infected may present with cutaneous, cardiac, articular, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The protean nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic conundrum. Lyme disease can affect the heart, albeit rarely, with cardiac abnormalities usually manifesting as varying degrees of heart block or arrhythmias. CASE REPORT We present a case of complete heart block in a young man who participated in outdoor activities in a Lyme-endemic area and developed fatigue and palpitations weeks after a flu-like illness. He noticed that his heart rate was low; he had an intermediate suspicious index in Lyme carditis (SILC) score with positive Lyme serologies. His initial electrocardiogram when he presented to the emergency department showed a complete heart block. In this case, he was successfully managed with intravenous ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and a transcutaneous pacemaker, obviating the need for a permanent pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS Electrocardiographic changes such as heart block and arrhythmias with or without symptoms may be the initial manifestation of Lyme carditis in a patient who may or may not remember a tick bite or have a typical skin rash. The SILC score may assist in recognizing these cases and prompt initiation of antibiotics usually leads to the resolution of these electrocardiographic abnormalities and symptoms that may be present."

		"abstract": "Dogs in the US are commonly infected with vector-borne pathogens, including heartworm and tick-borne disease agents. The geographic distribution of both arthropod vectors and the pathogens they transmit continues to expand. To describe the current geographic distribution and prevalence of antigen of Dirofilaria immitis and antibody to Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia spp., and Anaplasma spp. in dogs, we summarized over 144 million test results from 2013 to 2019, inclusive, by county, state, and region. Canine seroprevalence by state was compared to population-adjusted human reports of tick-borne diseases. Results varied regionally, with D. immitis antigen and Ehrlichia spp. antibodies more frequently detected in the Southeast (2.6% and 5.2%, respectively) and antibody to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. most common in the Northeast (12.1% and 7.3%, respectively). Overall, percent positive test results to D. immitis decreased in the Southeast by 33.3% when compared to earlier summaries using the same strategy (from 3.9 to 2.6%). Geographic expansion of areas where dogs commonly test positive for Ehrlichia spp. was evident, likely because of a change in the test made in 2012 to allow detection of antibodies to E. ewingii concomitant with expansion of vector tick populations. Percent positive test results to Ehrlichia spp. increased in every region; this shift was particularly pronounced in the Southeast, where percent positive test results increased fourfold (from 1.3 to 5.2%). Continued geographic expansion of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum was apparent in the Northeast, Midwest, and Upper South, although canine seroprevalence of antibody to B. burgdorferi was much lower than prior surveys in many Lyme-endemic areas. Annual reports of human cases of Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, and anaplasmosis were associated with percent positive canine results by state for the three tick-borne disease agents (R2 = 0.812, 0.521, and 0.546, respectively). Within endemic areas, percent positive test results for all three tick-borne agents demonstrated evidence of geographic expansion. Large scale analysis of results from screening dogs in practice for evidence of vector-borne infections, including those with zoonotic importance, continues to be a valuable strategy for understanding geographic trends in infection risk over time."

		"abstract": "In the twenty-first century, ticks and tick-borne diseases have expanded their ranges and impact across the US. With this spread, it has become vital to monitor vector and disease distributions, as these shifts have public health implications. Typically, tick-borne disease surveillance (e.g., Lyme disease) is passive and relies on case reports, while disease risk is calculated using active surveillance, where researchers collect ticks from the environment. Case reports provide the basis for estimating the number of cases; however, they provide minimal information on vector population or pathogen dynamics. Active surveillance monitors ticks and sylvatic pathogens at local scales, but it is resource-intensive. As a result, data are often sparse and aggregated across time and space to increase statistical power to model or identify range changes. Engaging public participation in surveillance efforts allows spatially and temporally diverse samples to be collected with minimal effort. These citizen-driven tick collections have the potential to provide a powerful tool for tracking vector and pathogen changes. We used MaxEnt species distribution models to predict the current and future distribution of Ixodes pacificus across the Western US through the use of a nationwide citizen science tick collection program. Here, we present niche models produced through citizen science tick collections over two years. Despite obvious limitations with citizen science collections, the models are consistent with previously-predicted species ranges in California that utilized more than thirty years of traditional surveillance data. Additionally, citizen science allows for an expanded understanding of I. pacificus distribution in Oregon and Washington. With the potential for rapid environmental changes instigated by a burgeoning human population and rapid climate change, the development of tools, concepts, and methodologies that provide rapid, current, and accurate assessment of important ecological qualities will be invaluable for monitoring and predicting disease across time and space."

The molecular changes associated with the response to Borrelia burgdorferi over the course of infection are poorly understood. Here, we identify broad transcriptomic and proteomic changes in the heart during infection that reveal a profound down-regulation of mitochondrial components. We also describe the long-term functional modulation of macrophages exposed to live bacteria, characterized by an augmented glycolytic output, increased spirochetal binding and internalization, and reduced inflammatory responses. In vitro, glycolysis inhibition reduces the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by memory macrophages, whereas in vivo, it produces the reversion of the memory phenotype, the recovery of tissue mitochondrial components, and decreased inflammation and spirochetal burdens. These results show that B. burgdorferi induces long-term, memory-like responses in macrophages with tissue-wide consequences that are amenable to be manipulated in vivo."

This study was performed retrospectively on CSF and serum samples collected from children evaluated for LNB (n = 233) and controls with other specific neurological disorders (n = 59) in a Swedish Lyme endemic area. For anti-Borrelia antibody index, the IDEIA Lyme Neuroborreliosis kit (Oxoid) was used. Two in-house real-time PCR assays targeting the 16S rRNA gene were evaluated (TaqMan® and LUX™). Among patients classified as LNB cases (n = 102), five children (5%) were Borrelia PCR-positive in CSF with the TaqMan® assay. In the Non-LNB group (n = 131), one patient was Borrelia PCR positive with the TaqMan® assay. Among controls (n = 59), all CSF samples were PCR negative. When amplifying and sequencing ospA, we found B. garinii (n = 2), B. afzelii (n = 2), B. bavariensis (n = 1), and one untypable (n = 1). With the LUX™ technology, all CSF samples were PCR negative. The TaqMan® assay could detect only few cases (n = 6) of B. burgdorferi s.l. in CSF among children with LNB and the sensitivity was very low (5%). However, using larger CSF volumes and centrifugation of samples, the PCR technique could still be useful as a complementary diagnostic method when evaluating LNB. Furthermore, detection of spirochete DNA in clinical matrices, including CSF, is the method of choice for studying epidemiological aspects of LNB, a tick-borne emerging disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, a multisystemic disorder affecting primarily skin, joints and nervous system. Successful internalization and intracellular processing of borreliae by immune cells, like macrophages, is decisive for the outcome of a respective infection. Here, we use, for the first time, focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy tomography (FIB-SEM tomography) to visualize the interaction of borreliae with primary human macrophages with high resolution. We report that interaction between macrophages and the elongated and highly motile borreliae can lead to formation of membrane tunnels that extend deeper into the host cytoplasm than the actual phagosome, most probably as a result of partial extrication of captured borreliae. We also show that membrane tubulation at borreliae-containing phagosomes, a process suggested earlier as a mechanism leading to phagosome compaction but hard to visualize in live-cell imaging, is apparently a frequent phenomenon. Finally, we demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms multiple STIM1-positive contact sites with both membrane tunnels and phagosome tubulations, confirming the important role of the ER during uptake and intracellular processing of borreliae."

One hundred and 29 cases of Lyme borreliosis were diagnosed in a single hospital representing 27 % of all cases reported in the Veneto region in the same period. The mean annual incidence of Lyme borreliosis was 0.992/100,000 inhabitants. A peak incidence of 2/100,000 inhabitants was observed in 2018. Early localized Lyme borreliosis was the most common presentation (74 %), followed by early disseminated Lyme borreliosis (21 %). One possible early Lyme neuroborreliosis and two cranial neuropathies were diagnosed. IgM and/or IgG borrelia antibodies were positive in 90 % of the cases. This significant increase of Lyme borreliosis incidence in the province of Verona highlights the need to increase knowledge on its epidemiology and clinical manifestation among both the general population and clinicians to allow early diagnosis and treatment."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the leading tick-borne illness in the United States. However, due to, in part, to the significant number of proteins of unknown function encoded across the complex fragmented genome, the molecular mechanisms of B. burgdorferi infection remain largely undefined. Previous work identified the virulence determinant gene, bbk13, which is critical for B. burgdorferi's ability to establish a productive disseminated infection. BBK13 is an immunogenic, non-surface exposed protein of unknown function predicted to harbor an N-terminal transmembrane domain and annotated as a member of the SIMPL domain protein superfamily (PF04402). In eukaryotes, SIMPL domain proteins have been shown to contribute to NF-kappa-B signaling but have no known functions in prokaryotes. Herein we investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of BBK13 toward elucidation of its function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed secondary and tertiary structural homology between BBK13 and two other prokaryotic SIMPL domain proteins for which the crystal structures have been solved, Brucella abortus BP26 and Campylobacter jejuni cjSLP. Furthermore, comparable to BP26, recombinant BBK13 self-assembled into multimeric complexes in vitro and endogenous BBK13 was found in large oligomeric complexes in the spirochete membrane. Together these data suggest that the oligomeric structure of BBK13 may be important for the molecular function of this critical infection protein."

		"abstract": "Over the past three decades, citizens of Maine in the northeastern United States have experienced increasing blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) abundance and rising incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overabundance has been considered one cause of the high incidence of tick-borne diseases on offshore islands of New England. Most of Maine's 15 offshore, unbridged island communities have a history of concern about ticks, Lyme disease, and white-tailed deer overabundance, but have been challenged to keep deer numbers down through hunting or culls. This history has led to perennial, often divisive community debates about whether and how to reduce the size of their deer herds. In 2016 we conducted a convenience sample survey of year-round and summer residents of Maine's offshore islands to quantify the level of concern about Lyme disease, and assess the motivations and level of support for deer herd reduction. Among respondents, 84 % agreed Lyme disease was a problem on their island and 61 % supported deer herd reduction. Agreement that Lyme disease was a problem was associated with having acquired tick-borne disease as well as with tick bites without disease. Respondents ranked deer overabundance as a top cause of tick abundance and tick-borne disease and supported deer herd reduction as an approach to reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Other problems associated with deer overabundance (vehicle collisions, damage to landscaping, and damage to forests) also motivated support for deer reduction. Approval of doe permits, an expanded archery season, and sharpshooting as reduction methods was greater than an expanded firearms season. Respondents felt responsibility for tick control fell to the town for the most part, and recognized that multiple factors have contributed to the tick problem in Maine, not just deer."

B. burgdorferi is able to survive in both mammalian and tick hosts through careful modulation of its gene expression. This allows B. burgdorferi to adapt to the environmental and nutritional changes that occur when it is transmitted between the two hosts. Distinct interactions between the spirochete and its host occur at every step of the enzootic cycle and dictate the ability of the spirochete to survive until the next stage of the cycle. Studying the interface between B. burgdorferi, the Ixodes tick vector and the natural mammalian reservoirs has been made significantly more feasible through the complete genome sequences of the organisms and the advent of high throughput screening technologies. Ultimately, a thorough investigation of the interplay between the two domains (and two phyla within one domain) is necessary in order to completely understand how the pathogen is transmitted."

		"abstract": "Antigen presentation is a crucial innate immune cell function that instructs adaptive immune cells. Loss of this pathway severely impairs the development of adaptive immune responses. To investigate whether B. burgdorferi sensu lato. spirochetes modulate the induction of an effective immune response, primary human PBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and stimulated with B. burgdorferi s.l. Through cell entry, TNF receptor I, and RIP1 signaling cascades, B. burgdorferi s.l. strongly downregulated genes and proteins involved in antigen presentation, specifically HLA-DM, MHC class II and CD74. Antigen presentation proteins were distinctively inhibited in monocyte subsets, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells. When compared to a range of other pathogens, B. burgdorferi s.l.-induced suppression of antigen presentation appears to be specific. Inhibition of antigen presentation interfered with T-cell recognition of B. burgdorferi s.l., and memory T-cell responses against Candidaalbicans. Re-stimulation of PBMCs with the commensal microbe C.albicans following B. burgdorferi s.l. exposure resulted in significantly reduced IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-22 production. These findings may explain why patients with Lyme borreliosis develop delayed adaptive immune responses. Unravelling the mechanism of B. burgdorferi s.l.-induced inhibition of antigen presentation, via cell entry, TNF receptor I, and RIP1 signaling cascades, explains the difficulty to diagnose the disease based on serology and to obtain an effective vaccine against Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The host immune response to infection is a well-coordinated system of innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert to prevent the colonization and dissemination of a pathogen. While this typically leads to a beneficial outcome and the suppression of disease pathogenesis, the Lyme borreliosis bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, can elicit an immune profile that leads to a deleterious state. As B. burgdorferi s.l. produces no known toxins, it is suggested that the immune and inflammatory response of the host are responsible for the manifestation of symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive disorders. The past several years has seen a substantial increase in the use of microarray and sequencing technologies to investigate the transcriptome response induced by B. burgdorferi s.l., thus enabling researchers to identify key factors and pathways underlying the pathophysiology of Lyme borreliosis. In this review we present the major host transcriptional outcomes induced by the bacterium across several studies and discuss the overarching theme of the host inflammatory and immune response, and how it influences the pathology of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Many species have experienced dramatic changes in both geographic range and population sizes in recent history. Increases in the geographic range or population size of disease vectors have public health relevance as these increases often precipitate the emergence of infectious diseases in human populations. Accurately identifying environmental factors affecting the biogeographic patterns of vector species is a long-standing analytical challenge, stemming from a paucity of data capturing periods of rapid changes in vector demographics. We systematically investigated the occurrence and abundance of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks at 532 sampling locations throughout New York State (NY), USA, between 2008 and 2018, a time frame that encompasses the emergence of diseases vectored by these ticks. Analyses of these field-collected data demonstrated a range expansion into northern and western NY during the last decade. Nymphal abundances increased in newly colonised areas, while remaining stable in areas with long-standing populations over the last decade. These trends in the geographic range and abundance of nymphs correspond to both the geographic expansion of human Lyme disease cases and increases in incidence rates. Analytic models fitted to these data incorporating time, space, and environmental factors, accurately identified drivers of the observed changes in nymphal occurrence and abundance. These models accounted for the spatial and temporal variation in the occurrence and abundance of nymphs and can accurately predict nymphal population patterns in future years. Forecasting disease risk at fine spatial scales prior to the transmission season can influence both public health mitigation strategies and individual behaviours, potentially impacting tick-borne disease risk and subsequently human disease incidence."

Research questions: To what extent does acceptability vary by vaccine type? To what extent does acceptability of vaccines in development vary by race and other key demographics? To what extent are general vaccine hesitancy and key demographics associated with acceptability of vaccines in development? Cross-sectional online survey administered through GfK's KnowledgePanel in 2015. Analysis completed in 2020. Nationally representative sample of Black and White American adults (n = 1,643). Willingness to accept a novel vaccine was measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Independent variables included demographics (e.g. age, race, gender) and measures of vaccine hesitancy, trust, and the \"Three C's\" of vaccine confidence, complacency, and convenience. Exploratory analysis including descriptive statistics and regression modeling. Acceptability varied from 77% for a cancer vaccine to 55% for an obesity vaccine. White race, male gender, older age, having a chronic health condition, and higher socioeconomic status were associated with higher acceptability. Higher vaccine confidence and lower vaccine hesitancy were predictors for acceptability. The success of a vaccine depends on widespread public acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy may hinder acceptance of future vaccines, with significant differences by demographics. Future social science research is necessary to better understand and address vaccine hesitancy."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease Borrelia are obligately parasitic, tick- transmitted, invasive, persistent bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans and non-reservoir vertebrates primarily through the induction of inflammation. During transmission from the infected tick, the bacteria undergo significant changes in gene expression, resulting in adaptation to the mammalian environment. The organisms multiply and spread locally and induce inflammatory responses that, in humans, result in clinical signs and symptoms. Borrelia virulence involves a multiplicity of mechanisms for dissemination and colonization of multiple tissues and evasion of host immune responses. Most of the tissue damage, which is seen in non-reservoir hosts, appears to result from host inflammatory reactions, despite the low numbers of bacteria in affected sites. This host response to the Lyme disease Borrelia can cause neurologic, cardiovascular, arthritic, and dermatologic manifestations during the disseminated and persistent stages of infection. The mechanisms by which a paucity of organisms (in comparison to many other infectious diseases) can cause varied and in some cases profound inflammation and symptoms remains mysterious but are the subjects of diverse ongoing investigations. In this review, we provide an overview of virulence mechanisms and determinants for which roles have been demonstrated in vivo, primarily in mouse models of infection."

		"abstract": "All members of the Borrelia genus that have been examined harbour a linear chromosome that is about 900 kbp in length, as well as a plethora of both linear and circular plasmids in the 5-220 kbp size range. Genome sequences for 27 Lyme disease Borrelia isolates have been determined since the elucidation of the B. burgdorferi B31 genome sequence in 1997. The chromosomes, which carry the vast majority of the housekeeping genes, appear to be very constant in gene content and organization across all Lyme disease Borrelia species. The content of the plasmids, which carry most of the genes that encode the differentially expressed surface proteins that interact with the spirochete's arthropod and vertebrate hosts, is much more variable. Lyme disease Borrelia isolates carry between 7-21 different plasmids, ranging in size from 5-84 kbp. All strains analyzed to date harbor three plasmids, cp26, lp54 and lp17. The plasmids are unusual, as compared to most bacterial plasmids, in that they contain many paralogous sequences, a large number of pseudogenes, and, in some cases, essential genes. In addition, a number of the plasmids have features indicating that they are prophages. Numerous methods have been developed for Lyme disease Borrelia strain typing. These have proven valuable for clinical and epidemiological studies, as well as phylogenomic and population genetic analyses. Increasingly, these approaches have been displaced by whole genome sequencing techniques. Some correlations between genome content and pathogenicity have been deduced, and comparative whole genome analyses promise future progress in this arena."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, can acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) responsible for diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [ANPH]), babesiosis (Babesia microti [BABE]), Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [BBSL]), and the relatively novel relapsing fever-like illness, Borrelia miyamotoi (BMIY) disease in the northeastern United States. Coinfections with these pathogens are becoming increasingly more common in I. scapularis and their hosts, likely attributed to their shared enzootic cycles. Urban habitats are favorable to host species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and these ungulates are known to be important to I. scapularis for reproduction and dispersal in North America. To understand the relationship between TBPs, white-tailed deer, and I. scapularis, we sampled eight sites across central Maryland collecting I. scapularis using standard tick dragging/flagging methods and retrieved others from deer carcasses. Pathogenic TBP species in each tick were determined using qPCR. In total, 903 adult ticks (deer: n = 573; questing: n = 330) revealed landscape-level prevalence of ANPH (27.8%), BABE (1.3%), BBSL (14.6%), and BMIY (0.8%) as singular infections overall. However, secondary coinfections of ANPH and BBSL were highest (9.9%) in ticks feeding from deer while associations of BBSL and BABE (4.2%) were highest in questing ticks. Results from this study provide evidence suggesting that adult I. scapularis acquire pathogenic species through phenologically associated host use, and thus, subsequent infections found in adults may provide insights into coinfection relationships."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a tick-borne, zoonosis of adults and children caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The ailment, widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, continues to increase globally due to multiple environmental factors, coupled with increased incursion of humans into habitats that harbor the spirochete. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex. In North America, B. burgdorferi causes nearly all infections; in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii are most associated with human disease. The spirochete's unusual fragmented genome encodes a plethora of differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins that play a seminal role in the bacterium's ability to sustain itself within its enzootic cycle and cause disease when transmitted to its incidental human host. Tissue damage and symptomatology (i.e., clinical manifestations) result from the inflammatory response elicited by the bacterium and its constituents. The deposition of spirochetes into human dermal tissue generates a local inflammatory response that manifests as erythema migrans (EM), the hallmark skin lesion. If treated appropriately and early, the prognosis is excellent. However, in untreated patients, the disease may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly involving the central nervous system, joints, or heart. A small percentage (~10%) of patients may go on to develop a poorly defined fibromyalgia-like illness, post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) unresponsive to prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Below we integrate current knowledge regarding the ecologic, epidemiologic, microbiologic, and immunologic facets of Lyme disease into a conceptual framework that sheds light on the disorder that healthcare providers encounter."

The spirochete subsists in an enzootic cycle that encompasses acquisition from a vertebrate host to a tick vector and transmission from a tick vector to a vertebrate host. To adapt to its environment and persist in each phase of its enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi wields three systems to regulate the expression of genes: the RpoN-RpoS alternative sigma factor cascade, the Hk1/Rrp1 two-component system and its product c-di-GMP, and the stringent response mediated by RelBbu and DksA. These regulatory systems respond to enzootic phase-specific signals and are controlled or fine- tuned by transcription factors, including BosR and BadR, as well as small RNAs, including DsrABb and Bb6S RNA. In addition, several other DNA-binding and RNA-binding proteins have been identified, although their functions have not all been defined. Global changes in gene expression revealed by high-throughput transcriptomic studies have elucidated various regulons, albeit technical obstacles have mostly limited this experimental approach to cultivated spirochetes. Regardless, we know that the spirochete, which carries a relatively small genome, regulates the expression of a considerable number of genes required for the transitions between the tick vector and the vertebrate host as well as the adaptation to each."

To some extent, our views on the synecology of the borreliae has been dominated by an applied focus, viz., analyses that seek to understand the elements of human risk for borreliosis. But, the elements of borrelial perpetuation do not necessarily bear upon risk, nor do our concepts of risk provide the best structure for analyzing perpetuation. We identify the major global themes for the perpetuation of borreliae, and summarize local variations on those themes, focusing on key literature to outline the factors that serve as the basis for the distribution and abundance of borreliae."

		"abstract": "The mammalian host responds to infection with Borrelia spirochetes through a highly orchestrated immune defense involving innate and adaptive effector functions aimed toward limiting pathogen burdens, minimizing tissue injury, and preventing subsequent reinfection. The evolutionary adaptation of Borrelia spirochetes to their reservoir mammalian hosts may allow for its persistence despite this immune defense. This review summarizes our current understanding of the host immune response to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, the most widely studied Borrelia spp. and etiologic agent of Lyme borreliosis. Pertinent literature will be reviewed with emphasis on in vitro, ex vivo and animal studies that influenced our understanding of both the earliest responses to B. burgdorferi as it enters the mammalian host and those that evolve as spirochetes disseminate and establish infection in multiple tissues. Our focus is on the immune response of inbred mice, the most commonly studied animal model of B. burgdorferi infection and surrogate for one of this pathogen's principle natural reservoir hosts, the white-footed deer mouse. Comparison will be made to the immune responses of humans with Lyme borreliosis. Our goal is to provide an understanding of the dynamics of the mammalian immune response during infection with B. burgdorferi and its relation to the outcomes in reservoir (mouse) and non-reservoir (human) hosts."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato causes Lyme borreliosis in a variety of animals and humans. These atypical bacterial pathogens are maintained in a complex enzootic life cycle that primarily involves a vertebrate host and Ixodes spp. ticks. In the Northeastern United States, I. scapularis is the main vector, while wild rodents serve as the mammalian reservoir host. As B. burgdorferi is transmitted only by I. scapularis and closely related ticks, the spirochete-tick interactions are thought to be highly specific. Various borrelial and arthropod proteins that directly or indirectly contribute to the natural cycle of B. burgdorferi infection have been identified. Discrete molecular interactions between spirochetes and tick components also have been discovered, which often play critical roles in pathogen persistence and transmission by the arthropod vector. This review will focus on the past discoveries and future challenges that are relevant to our understanding of the molecular interactions between B. burgdorferi and Ixodes ticks. This information will not only impact scientific advancements in the research of tick- transmitted infections but will also contribute to the development of novel preventive measures that interfere with the B. burgdorferi life cycle."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an emerging zoonotic infection that is increasing in incidence in North America, Europe, and Asia. With the development of safe and efficacious vaccines, LD can potentially be prevented. Vaccination offers a cost-effective and safe approach for decreasing the risk of infection. While LD vaccines have been widely used in veterinary medicine, they are not available as a preventive tool for humans. Central to the development of effective vaccines is an understanding of the enzootic cycle of LD, differential gene expression of Borrelia burgdorferi in response to environmental variables, and the genetic and antigenic diversity of the unique bacteria that cause this debilitating disease. Here we review these areas as they pertain to past and present efforts to develop human, veterinary, and reservoir targeting LD vaccines. In addition, we offer a brief overview of additional preventative measures that should employed in conjunction with vaccination."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease incidence is increasing in the United States despite myriad efforts to educate individuals about effective prevention practices to reduce exposure to nymphal Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) (blacklegged tick), the primary vector of the pathogen causing Lyme disease. Furthermore, Lyme prevention educational needs currently exceed the ability of public health professionals to deliver the information in person. Past work has shown there is especially high confusion regarding the use of acaricides for tick management by homeowners. Story-based education is known to engage individuals and change behaviors. To increase the reach and engagement regarding Lyme disease prevention practices, especially residential acaricide use, we created short, story-based educational films (Spray Safe, Play Safe) and evaluated their educational benefit with a survey pre- and post-viewing. We determined that after viewing the films, a significantly higher percentage of respondents reported increased confidence in identifying the riskiest areas in their yards for ticks, using personal protective measures to prevent tick bites, using tick-safe landscaping, and using tick control products. This study also suggests that using short, engaging films that can be posted to popular websites and social media outlets could be employed more frequently for successful and engaging Lyme disease education, as creative and up-to-date educational methods are needed."

		"abstract": "Consistent and effective use of personal prevention methods for tickborne diseases, including Lyme disease (LD), is dependent on risk awareness. To improve our understanding of the general U.S. population's experiences with tick exposure and use of personal prevention methods, we used data from ConsumerStyles, a web-based, nationally representative questionnaire on health-related topics. Questions addressed tick bites and LD diagnosis in the last year, use of personal prevention methods to prevent tick bites, and willingness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine. Of 10,551 participants surveyed over three years, 12.3 % reported a tick bite for themselves or a household member in the last year, including 15.4 % of participants in high LD incidence (LDI) states, 16.3 % in states neighboring high LDI states, and 9.4 % in low LDI states. Participants in high LDI states and neighboring states were most likely to use personal prevention methods, though 46.6 % of participants in high LDI states and 53.9 % in neighboring states reported not using any method. Participants in low LDI states, adults ≥ 75 years of age, those with higher incomes, and those living in urban housing tended to be less likely to practice personal prevention methods. Likeliness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine was high in high LDI (64.5 %), neighboring (52.5 %), and low LDI (49.7 %) states. Targeted educational efforts are needed to ensure those in high LDI and neighboring states, particularly older adults, are aware of their risk of LD and recommended personal prevention methods."

		"abstract": "Unrecognized immunodeficiency has been proposed as a possible cause of failure of antibiotics to resolve symptoms of Lyme disease. Here, we examined the efficacy of doxycycline in different immunodeficient mice to identify defects that impair antibiotic treatment outcomes. We found that doxycycline had significantly lower efficacy in the absence of adaptive immunity, specifically B cells. This effect was most pronounced in immunodeficient C3H mice compared with C57BL/6 mice, suggesting a role for genetic background beyond immunodeficiency. Addition of a single dose of ceftriaxone to doxycycline treatment effectively cleared infection in C3H mice with severe combined immunodeficiency."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say) is the primary vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae), the Lyme disease agent in North America. The basic reproduction number (R0) for B. burgdorferi in I. scapularis in the Northeast is highly sensitive to the probability that engorged larvae survive the winter, molt into nymphs, and find a host. These processes are dependent on local environmental variables, including climate, host population size and movement, and tick behavior. A simple model is presented for estimating host-finding success from the ratio of tick abundance in two subsequent years, accounting for overwinter survival and possible differences in host associations between nymphs and larvae. This model was parameterized using data from two sites in mainland Connecticut and two on Block Island, RI. Host abundance and tick burdens were estimated via mark-recapture trapping of the primary host, Peromyscus leucopus Rafinesque. Overwintering survival was estimated using engorged larvae placed in field enclosures at each site. Only nymphs were recovered alive, and no significant differences in model parameters were observed between Connecticut and Block Island. Host-finding success was predicted to be high across a wide range of host association patterns at three of four sites. Assuming equivalent host association between larvae and nymphs, R0 was also estimated to be greater than one at three of four sites, suggesting these conditions allow for the persistence of B. burgdorferi. The model output was highly sensitive to differences between nymphal and larval host associations."

		"abstract": "Deer tick-transmitted Borrelia burgdorferisensu stricto (Lyme disease) and Babesia microti (babesiosis) increasingly burden public health across eastern North America. The white-footed mouse is considered the primary host for subadult deer ticks and the most important reservoir host for these and other disease agents. Local transmission is thought to be modulated by less reservoir-competent hosts, such as deer, diverting ticks from feeding on mice. We measured the proportion of mouse-fed or deer-fed host-seeking nymphs from 4 sites during 2 transmission seasons by blood meal remnant analysis using a new retrotransposon-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay. We then determined the host that was associated with the infection status of the tick. During the first year, the proportion of mouse-fed ticks ranged from 17% on mainland sites to 100% on an island, while deer-fed ticks ranged from 4% to 24%. The proportion of ticks feeding on mice and deer was greater from island sites than mainland sites (on average, 92% versus 43%). Mouse-fed ticks decreased significantly during year 2 in 3 of 4 sites (most were <20%), while deer-fed ticks increased for all sites (75% at one site). Overall, ticks were more likely to be infected when they had fed on mice (odds ratio [OR] of 2.4 and 1.6 for Borrelia and Babesia, respectively) and were less likely to be infected if they had fed on deer (OR, 0.8 and 0.4). We conclude that host utilization by deer ticks is characterized by significant spatiotemporal diversity, which may confound efficacy tests of interventions targeting reservoir hosts.IMPORTANCE White-footed mice are thought to be the most important reservoir host for the deer tick-transmitted pathogens that cause Lyme disease and human babesiosis because they are the primary host for immature ticks. Transmission would be reduced, however, if ticks feed on deer, which are not capable of infecting ticks with either pathogen. By directly measuring whether ticks had fed on either mice or deer using a new quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to detect remnants of host DNA leftover from the larval blood meal, we demonstrate that host utilization by ticks varies significantly over time and space and that mice often feed fewer ticks than expected. This finding has implications for our understanding of the ecology of these diseases and for the efficacy of control measures."

We analyzed retrospective surveillance data for Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus/rickettsial diseases, and tularemia diagnosed in Indiana from 2009 to 2016. We used chi-square cross tabulation to test gender, age group, and county classification (rural, rural-mixed, urban) differences in tickborne disease. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc Conover test to identify differences in summated tickborne disease by county classification. Finally, we used retrospective space-time permutation models in SaTScan to test the hypothesis of complete spatiotemporal randomness of tickborne disease. We found more Lyme disease diagnoses among Indiana residents 44 years of age or younger compared with those over 44 years. Conversely, more ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia were reported in Indiana residents aged over 44 years of age. An analysis of summated tickborne disease by county showed significantly higher diagnosis reported in urban counties, compared with rural and rural-mixed counties. Finally, 2 significant clusters of summated tickborne disease were observed in south-central Indiana in 2014 and in western Indiana from 2010 to 2011. The detection of tickborne disease clusters, coupled with the finding that significant differences exist in the diagnosis of tickborne diseases between urban, rural, and rural-mixed counties in Indiana, suggests a need for continued surveillance of the counties observed within these clusters."

The role of Anaplasma spp. and secondary kidney dysfunction is not known. A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine if dogs within a defined Lyme disease and anaplasmosis region with B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibodies had an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient exposure was defined as having a B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibody positive result recorded at any point in the available patient history. CKD was defined as concurrent increased symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine (Cr) for a minimum of 25 days with inappropriate urine specific gravity (USG). Patients were matched using propensity scoring to control for age, region, and breed. Contingency tables were used to compare dogs seropositive and not seropositive to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. and CKD outcome. For each comparison that was performed, statistical significance was defined by a P-value of <.025. The risk ratio of CKD for patients exposed to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. were found to be 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1.27, 1.61], P < .0001) and 1.04, (95% CI [0.87, 1.24], P = .6485), respectively. Results suggest in this cohort no increased risk for developing CKD when exposed to Anaplasma spp. but a significant increase in risk for developing CKD with exposure to B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden."

		"abstract": "Widely employed diagnostic antibody serology for Lyme disease, known as standard two-tier testing (STTT), exhibits insufficient sensitivity in early Lyme disease, yielding many thousands of false-negative test results each year. Given this problem, we applied serum antibody repertoire analysis (SERA), or next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based serology, to discover IgG and IgM antibody epitope motifs capable of detecting Lyme disease-specific antibodies with high sensitivity and specificity. Iterative motif discovery and bioinformatic analysis of epitope repertoires from subjects with Lyme disease (n = 264) and controls (n = 391) yielded a set of 28 epitope motifs representing 20 distinct IgG antibody epitopes and a set of 38 epitope motifs representing 21 distinct IgM epitopes, which performed equivalently in a large validation cohort of STTT-positive samples. In a second validation set from subjects with clinically defined early Lyme disease (n = 119) and controls (n = 257), the SERA Lyme IgG and IgM assay exhibited significantly improved sensitivity relative to STTT (77% versus 62%; Z-test; P = 0.013) and improved specificity (99% versus 97%). Early Lyme disease subjects exhibited significantly fewer reactive epitopes (Mann-Whitney U test; P < 0.0001) relative to subjects with Lyme arthritis. Thus, SERA Lyme IgG and M panels provided increased accuracy in early Lyme disease in a readily expandable multiplex assay format."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement 'I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves 'outdoorsy', results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate diagnostic outcome and to characterize demographics and clinical presentations of patients referred between the 1st of September 2017 to 31st of August 2019. A diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, symptoms, serology and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The patients were classified as definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis manifestations was initiated in accordance with the national guidelines. Patients not fulfilling the criteria of Lyme borreliosis were further investigated and discussed with an interdisciplinary team consisting of specialists from relevant specialties, according to individual clinical presentation and symptoms. Clinical information and demographics were registered and managed in a database. A total of 215 patients were included in the study period. Median age was 51 years (range 17-83 years), and 56 % were female. Definite Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 45 patients, of which 20 patients had erythema migrans, 14 patients had definite Lyme neuroborreliosis, six had acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, four had multiple erythema migrans and one had Lyme carditis. Furthermore, 12 patients were classified as possible Lyme borreliosis and 12 patients as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. A total of 146 patients (68 %) did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of Lyme borreliosis. Half of these patients (73 patients, 34 %) were diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis including inflammatory diseases, cancer diseases and two patients with a tick-associated disease other than Lyme borreliosis. A total of 73 patients (34 %) were discharged without sign of somatic disease. Lyme borreliosis patients had a shorter duration of symptoms prior to the first hospital encounter compared to patients discharged without a specific diagnosis (p<0.001). When comparing symptoms at presentation, patients discharged without a specific diagnosis suffered more often from general fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, 66 % of all referred patients were given a specific diagnosis after ended outpatient course. A total of 32 % was diagnosed with either definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome; 34 % was diagnosed with a non-tick-associated diagnosis. Our findings underscore the complexity in diagnosing Lyme borreliosis and the importance of ruling out other diseases through careful examination."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that transmit a variety of pathogens to host animals and humans, causing severe infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. In a certain combination of animal and tick species, tick infestation elicits acquired immunity against ticks in the host, which can reduce the ability of ticks to feed on blood and to transmit pathogens in the following tick infestations. Therefore, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of acquired tick resistance (ATR) can advance the development of anti-tick vaccines to prevent tick infestation and tick-borne diseases. Basophils are a minor population of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream and are rarely observed in peripheral tissues under steady-state conditions. Basophils have been reported to accumulate at tick-feeding sites during re-infestation in cattle, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. Selective ablation of basophils resulted in a loss of ATR in guinea pigs and mice, illuminating the essential role of basophils in the manifestation of ATR. In this review, we discuss the recent advance in the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying basophil recruitment to the tick-feeding site and basophil-mediated ATR."

		"abstract": "Pathogens transmitted by ticks cause several important diseases in humans, including Lyme disease, the incidence of which has been increasing in Belarus. Between April and October 2017, a total of 504 questing Ixodid ticks (77% Ixodes ricinus and 23% Dermacentor reticulatus) were collected from six regions and city of Minsk, in Belarus. All ticks were analyzed by RT-PCR amplification for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Anaplasma phagocytophillum, Ehrlihia muris, and Borrelia miyamotoi. B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp. were the most commonly detected tick-borne pathogens, with prevalence rates of 31.08% and 33.7%, respectively. A. phagocytophillum was found in 104 (20.63%), and 107 (21.2%) ticks were positive for E. muris. TBEV was detected in 83 (16.47%). Circulation of Borrelia miyamotoi spirochete in I. ricinus ticks in Brest, Gomel, and Minsk region was detected for the first time. Our data provide a basis for further studies to determine the distribution and abundance of different tick species in Belarus and therefore a capacity to predict where cases of important tick-borne diseases may occur."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States with hotspots in the Northeast and Midwest. Integrated vector control for mosquito-borne disease prevention is often organized at the community level, but tick control is primarily coordinated at the household and individual level. Management of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis (Say), the vector of the causative agent of Lyme disease in the Midwest and eastern United States in peridomestic environments may be critical as many tick encounters are reported to occur in the yard. Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness of a widely available and low-cost pesticide that targets common lawn pests and is labeled for use against ticks. In June 2019, we evaluated a granular form of gamma-cyhalothrin in a placebo-controlled residential backyard study (n = 90) in two communities in Wisconsin. The product applied by the research team reduced nymphal blacklegged ticks in plots established in the lawn part of the ecotone by 97% one week after application at both communities and by 89-97% three to four weeks postapplication. The proportion of homes with at least one nymphal tick postapplication was significantly lower at acaricide-treated homes and ranged from 4.2 to 29.2% compared with placebo homes where at least one nymphal tick was found at 50-81.5% of homes. These results support the efficacy of a low-cost do-it-yourself strategy for homeowners seeking to reduce blacklegged ticks in the yard."

We aimed to evaluate patients receiving long-term antimicrobial treatment for lyme borreliosis. We included patients referred to a Parisian teaching hospital between January 1st, 2014 and June 30th, 2019, with a presumed diagnosis of lyme borreliosis for which they were treated with antimicrobials for at least 6 months. Fifteen patients were included (11 women and mean age 44 years). The mean antimicrobial treatment duration was 476 days (180-942). The mean number of antimicrobials was 6.8 per patient (1-18). None of the 15 patients had lyme borreliosis. Nine patients were diagnosed with a mental disorder. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of lyme borreliosis put patients at risk of undiagnosed illnesses and multiple adverse effects of unjustified treatments. The clinical management of such patients requires a comprehensive approach including expertise in mental disorders."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common arthropod-borne disease in Europe and North America and is caused by members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) species complex. These bacteria are transmitted by ixodid tick vectors and therefore human LB risk is influenced by the prevalence and distribution of Bbsl genospecies within tick vectors throughout the wild. These distributions can easily change over spatiotemporal scales and, to understand LB risk fully, up to date information on prevalence and distribution of Bbsl is required. The last survey of Bbsl in southern Germany, including parts of the Munich metropolitan area, was completed in 2006 and new data is needed. Ixodid ticks were collected in seven plots located in and around Munich, Germany, from March to July 2019 and were screened for Bbsl. Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. positive ticks (52 adults, 158 nymphs) were found in all plots and adults (0-61.5 % Bbsl positive/plot) and nymphs (17.4-59.5 % Bbsl positive/plot) did not differ significantly in their overall Bbsl prevalence. The number of Bbsl positive nymphs did vary significantly between plots but the number of positive adults did not. In total, six Bbsl genospecies were located with B. afzelii and B. garinii dominating. Additionally, the relapsing-fever species B. miyamotoi was found in two sampling plots. Our results highlight the variability in Bbsl prevalence and genospecies distribution over short geographic distances and aid in understanding LB risk in and around the Munich metropolitan area."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tick-borne diseases has increased in recent decades and accounts for the majority of vector-borne disease cases in temperate areas of Europe, North America, and Asia. This emergence has been attributed to multiple and interactive drivers including changes in climate, land use, abundance of key hosts, and people's behaviors affecting the probability of human exposure to infected ticks. In this forum paper, we focus on how land use changes have shaped the eco-epidemiology of Ixodes scapularis-borne pathogens, in particular the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern United States. We use this as a model system, addressing other tick-borne disease systems as needed to illustrate patterns or processes. We first examine how land use interacts with abiotic conditions (microclimate) and biotic factors (e.g., host community composition) to influence the enzootic hazard, measured as the density of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.s. We then review the evidence of how specific landscape configuration, in particular forest fragmentation, influences the enzootic hazard and disease risk across spatial scales and urbanization levels. We emphasize the need for a dynamic understanding of landscapes based on tick and pathogen host movement and habitat use in relation to human resource provisioning. We propose a coupled natural-human systems framework for tick-borne diseases that accounts for the multiple interactions, nonlinearities and feedbacks in the system and conclude with a call for standardization of methodology and terminology to help integrate studies conducted at multiple scales."

The genomes of relapsing fever borreliae and Lyme disease borreliae consist of multiple linear and circular plasmids in addition to the chromosome. Previous work with B. burgdorferi sensu lato found diminished infectivity upon continuous in vitro culture passage that was attributable to plasmid loss. The effect of long-term culture passage on B. miyamotoi is not known. We generated a series of plasmid-specific primer sets and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect the 14 known plasmids of B. miyamotoi North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. We assessed the plasmid content of B. miyamotoi LB-2001 over 64 culture passages spanning 15 months and determined that strain LB-2001 retained all plasmids upon prolonged in vitro cultivation and remained infectious in mice. We also found that strain LB-2001 lacks plasmid lp20-1 which is present in strain CT13-2396. These results suggest that B. miyamotoi remains genetically stable when cultured and passaged in vitro."

However, data on ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine are scarce. The objective of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in engorged and questing ixodid ticks collected from five administrative regions (oblasts) of Ukraine, namely Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Ternopil, and Vinnytsia. The ticks were collected from both wild and domestic animals and from vegetation. Of 524 ixodid ticks collected, 3, 99, and 422 ticks were identified as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes ricinus, and Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. DNA samples individually extracted from 168 questing and 354 engorged adult ticks were subjected to pathogen-specific PCR analyses. The mean prevalence in I. ricinus and D. reticulatus were, respectively: 10 % (10/97) and 3 % (12/422) for A. phagocytophilum; 69 % (67/97) and 52 % (220/422) for members of the Anaplasmataceae family; 25 % (24/97) and 28 % (117/422) for Rickettsia spp.; 3 % (3/97) and 1 % (6/422) for Babesia spp.; and 9 % (9/97) and 5 % (20/422) for Bartonella spp. Overall, between the five cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of any of the pathogens for the respective ticks (p > 0.05). The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in the questing and engorged I. ricinus varied from 0 to 27 % and 14-44%, respectively, with no statistical significance identified between the five cities (p > 0.05). In addition to reporting the updated data for Kyiv and Ternopil, this study is the first to provide the prevalences of the tick-borne pathogens for Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Vinnytsia. This investigation is also the first to detect Neoehrlichia mikurensis in ixodid ticks from Ukraine. These new data will be useful for medical and veterinary practitioners as well as public health officials when diagnosing infections and when implementing measures to combat tick-borne diseases in Ukraine."

The attribution of chronic but aspecific symptoms to Lyme borreliosis is a source of worldwide controversy. Some patients attribute their aspecific symptoms to Lyme borreliosis even though, in fact, they have a functional somatic syndrome. These patients' diagnostic and therapeutic wandering contributes to the above attribution and to their suffering. The Internet has deregulated the information market. Cognitive confirmation bias contributes to confinement in belief. Negativity bias explains the tendency of the human brain to select the most alarming information available. The narrative force of alarmist videos or personal testimonies acts like a nocebo effect. The social exclusion generated by adherence to this belief is a factor of reinforcement and aggravation. Deconstructing chronic Lyme disease with empathy and conviction is in patients' best interests."

Sixty-three (2.2%) children were two-tier positive, generating a crude annual incidence rate of 1.15/100,000. Proformas were returned for 55 (87%) and 47 met clinical and laboratory criteria for LD. Twenty-seven (57%) presented with non-focal symptoms (erythema migrans and/or influenza-like symptoms), and 20 (43%) with focal symptoms (cranial nerve involvement, 11; CNS involvement, 8; arthritis, 1). Median age at presentation was 8.2 (2.5-17.9) years. Seventeen (36%) acquired LD overseas. Twenty-five (83%) of the remaining 30 children acquired infection in the West/Northwest of Ireland. Full resolution of symptoms was reported in 97% of those with available data. Serologically confirmed LD in children is relatively rare in the Republic of Ireland. Ninety-eight percent of children tested were seronegative. Of the seropositive cases, 40% could have been diagnosed based on clinical findings alone. Neurological presentations (40%) were common. Full resolution of symptoms occurred in almost all (97%) where data were available."

To investigate the risk of psychiatric disease, the percentage of psychiatric hospital inpatient and outpatient contacts, and the receipt of prescribed psychiatric medications among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis compared with individuals in a matched comparison cohort. This nationwide population-based matched cohort study included all residents of Denmark who received a positive result on an intrathecal antibody index test for Borrelia burgdorferi (patient cohort) between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 2015. Patients were matched by age and sex to a comparison cohort of individuals without Lyme neuroborreliosis from the general population of Denmark. Data were analyzed from February 2019 to March 2020. Diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis, defined as a positive result on an intrathecal antibody index test for B burgdorferi. The 0- to 15-year hazard ratios for the assignment of psychiatric diagnostic codes, the difference in the percentage of psychiatric inpatient and outpatient hospital contacts, and the difference in the percentage of prescribed psychiatric medications received among the patient cohort vs the comparison cohort. Among 2897 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (1646 men [56.8%]) and 28 970 individuals in the matched comparison cohort (16 460 men [56.8%]), the median age was 45.7 years (interquartile range [IQR], 11.5-62.0 years) for both groups. The risk of a psychiatric disease diagnosis and the percentage of hospital contacts for psychiatric disease were not higher among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis compared with individuals in the comparison cohort. A higher percentage of patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis compared with individuals in the comparison cohort received anxiolytic (7.2% vs 4.7%; difference, 2.6%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.5%), hypnotic and sedative (11.0% vs 5.3%; difference, 5.7%; 95% CI, 4.5%-6.8%), and antidepressant (11.4% vs 6.0%; difference, 5.4%; 95% CI, 4.3%-6.6%) medications within the first year after diagnosis, after which the receipt of psychiatric medication returned to the same level as the comparison cohort. In this population-based matched cohort study, patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis did not have an increased risk of developing psychiatric diseases that required hospital care or treatment with prescription medication. The increased receipt of psychiatric medication among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis within the first year after diagnosis, but not thereafter, suggests that most symptoms associated with the diagnosis subside within a short period."

Cohort register-based study of 264 patients with non-idiopathic peripheral FP and uniform diagnostics and standardized treatment in a university hospital from 2007 to 2017 (47% female, median age: 57 years). Clinical data, facial grading, electrodiagnostics, motor function tests, non-motor function tests, and onset of prednisolone therapy were assessed for their impact on the probability of complete recovery using univariable and multivariable statistics. The most frequent reason for a non-idiopathic peripheral FP was a reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV; 36.4%). Traumatic origin had a higher proportion of complete FP (52.9%). Furthermore, in traumatic FP, the mean interval between onset and start of prednisolone therapy was longer than in other cases (5.6 ± 6.2 days). Patients with reactivation of VZV, Lyme disease or otogenic FP had a significant higher recovery rate (p = 0.002, p < 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively), whereas patients with post-surgery FP and other reasons had a significant lower recovery rate (p < 0.0001). After multivariate analyses voluntary activity in first EMG, Lyme disease and post-surgery cause were identified as independent diagnostic and prognostic factors on the probability of complete recovery (all p < 0.05). Infectious causes for non-idiopathic FP like VZV reactivation and Lyme disease had best probability for complete recovery. Post-surgery FP had a worse prognosis. 2."

		"abstract": "The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an acellular membrane that covers the gut epithelium in arthropods and physically separates it from the lumen. The structure is thought to play an important role in tick biology. The PM is also known to impact the persistence of tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi, although limited information is available about its molecular constituents or their biological significance. Herein, we characterise a novel PM-associated gut protein in Ixodes scapularis ticks, annotated as Peritrophic Membrane Chitin Binding Protein (PM_CBP), for its role in the integrity and function of the matrix. The PM_CBP displays homology to the chitin deacetylase metalloenzyme, shows upregulation during tick feeding, and is localized at the luminal surface of the gut epithelium. The structural integrity of the PM was impaired both by the knock down of PM_CBP expression via RNA interference and by treatment with anti-PM_CBP antibodies, as revealed by its electron microscopic appearance. Additionally, the duration of tick engorgement on mice and the passage of experimentally-inoculated fluorescent dextran molecules across the PM are affected by the knock down of PM_CBP expression. The transfer of anti-PM_CBP antibodies into the tick gut impacted the overall composition of the resident microbiome, and also influenced B. burgdorferi acquisition in ticks and its transmission to mice. Taken together, these data highlight the biological significance of the Ixodes PM and suggest that the targeting of its molecular constituents may contribute to the development of novel interventions against tick-borne infections."

Ocular involvement is most commonly seen as uveitis, chorioretinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, papillitis, panuveitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, and retinal vasculitis. A 27-year-old male patient was admitted with a history of fatigue, malaise, and sudden loss of vision in his left eye for 3 days. The best visual acuity was found 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed no pathological findings in the right eye; but hyperfluorescence that was compatible with choroiditis foci was seen in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening in the left eye compared to the right eye. Lyme IgM antibody was found to be positive, explaining choroiditis etiology, while IgG values were found to be negative. Western blot verification test was positive. The patient was treated with 2 × 100 mg doxycycline (21 days) with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, prednol 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) for choroiditis. Omeprazole tablets were given 1 × 1 during the period of cortisone intake. On the third day of treatment, visual acuity increased to 20/200 and continued to increase until reaching 20/20 in the second week. Lyme disease is rare, but must be kept in mind when investigating the etiology of chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The patient reported here is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in literature that shows atypical clinic for Lyme disease with unilateral chorioretinitis without Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)."

In this retrospective, population-based study, we collected data from the medical records of all patients referred for infectious disease consultations in 2013 due to presumed LB from a population of 1.58 million. The patients were classified according to the certainty of LB on the basis of their symptoms, signs and laboratory results. Data on the outcomes and subsequent alternative diagnoses during the 4-year follow-up period were reviewed from all of the available patient records from public, private and occupational healthcare providers. A total of 256 patients (16/100 000) were referred as a result of suspicion of LB; 30 (12%) of 256 were classified with definite, 36 (14%) with probable and 65 (25%) with possible LB. LB was unlikely in 121 (47%) patients. A novel diagnosis was discovered in the background symptoms in 73 (29%) of patients. Previously diagnosed comorbidities caused at least some of the symptoms in 48 (19%) patients. Other explanations for symptoms were found in 81 (67%) of 121 of unlikely and 22 (34%) of 65 of possible LB patients. The spectrum of conditions behind the symptoms was quite broad and most often were musculoskeletal, neurological, psychological or functional disorders. LB was unlikely in half of the patients with presumed LB. In most cases the patients had other conditions that explained their symptoms."

Here, we integrated an extensive field sampling, laboratory analysis and GIS models to provide first publicly available information on pathogen diversity, prevalence and infection risk for four overlooked zoonotic TBDs in the Czech Republic. In addition, we assessed the effect of landscape variables on the abundance of questing ticks at different spatial scales and examined whether pathogen prevalence increased with tick density. Our data from 13,340 ticks collected in 142 municipalities showed that A. phagocytophilum (MIR = 3.5%) and Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (MIR = 4.0%) pose geographically uneven risks with localized hotspots, while Rickettsia (MIR = 4.9%) and Babesia (MIR = 1.1%) had relatively homogeneous spatial distribution. Landscape variables had significant effect on tick abundance up to the scale of 1 km around the sampling sites. Questing ticks responded positively to landscape diversity and configuration, especially to forest patch density that strongly correlates with the amount of woodland-grassland ecotones. For all four pathogens, we found higher prevalence in places with higher densities of ticks, confirming the hypothesis that tick abundance amplifies the risk of TB infection. Our findings highlight the importance of landscape parameters for tick vectors, likely due to their effect on small vertebrates as reservoir hosts. Future studies should explicitly investigate the combined effect of landscape parameters and the composition and population dynamics of hosts on the host-vector-pathogen system."

		"abstract": "Ticks are responsible for spreading harmful diseases including Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. Understanding tick population dynamics and predicting risk of tick-borne disease insurgence helps to design preventive actions against the disease spread. Using a compartmental model describing the pathogen transmission among ticks and hosts, we study the influence of host-targeted tick control strategies with chemical insecticides on tick population and disease transmission dynamics. Our analysis shows that in areas with rapid-growing population of ticks, host-targeted controls using chemical insecticides may enhance disease persistence and even turn a disease-free area to a disease endemic area. Therefore, the complex dynamics of pathogen spread among ticks and hosts should be carefully examined when designing tick control strategies."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases is dramatically increasing across the United States. While the rapid rise in Lyme disease is clear, the causes of it are not. Modeling Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary Lyme disease vector in the eastern United States, presents an opportunity to disentangle the drivers of increasing Lyme disease, including climate, land cover, and host populations. We improved upon a recently developed compartment model of ordinary differential equations that simulates I. scapularis growth, abundance, and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae) by adding land cover effects on host populations, refining the representation of growth stages, and evaluating output against observed data. We then applied this model to analyze the sensitivity of simulated I. scapularis dynamics across temperature and land cover in the northeastern United States. Specifically, we ran an ensemble of 232 simulations with temperature from Hanover, New Hampshire and Storrs, Connecticut, and land cover from Hanover and Cardigan in New Hampshire, and Windsor and Danielson in Connecticut. Consistent with observations, simulations of I. scapularis abundance are sensitive to temperature, with the warmer Storrs climate significantly increasing the number of questing I. scapularis at all growth stages. While there is some variation in modeled populations of I. scapularis infected with B. burgdorferi among land cover distributions, our analysis of I. scapularis response to land cover is limited by a lack of observations describing host populations, the proportion of hosts competent to serve as B. burgdorferi reservoirs, and I. scapularis abundance."

		"abstract": "Geographical range expansions of blacklegged tick [Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae)] populations over time in the United States have been attributed to a mosaic of factors including 20th century reforestation followed by suburbanization, burgeoning populations of the white-tailed deer [Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman (Artiodactyla: Cervidae)], and, at the northern edge of I. scapularis' range, climate change. Maine, a high Lyme disease incidence state, has been experiencing warmer and shorter winter seasons, and relatively more so in its northern tier. Maine served as a case study to investigate the interacting impacts of deer and seasonal climatology on the spatial and temporal distribution of I. scapularis. A passive tick surveillance dataset indexed abundance of I. scapularis nymphs for the state, 1990-2013. With Maine's wildlife management districts as the spatial unit, we used a generalized additive model to assess linear and nonlinear relationships between I. scapularis nymph abundance and predictors. Nymph submission rate increased with increasing deer densities up to ~5 deer/km2 (13 deer/mi2), but beyond this threshold did not vary with deer density. This corroborated the idea of a saturating relationship between I. scapularis and deer density. Nymphs also were associated with warmer minimum winter temperatures, earlier degree-day accumulation, and higher relative humidity. However, nymph abundance only increased with warmer winters and degree-day accumulation where deer density exceeded ~2 deer/km2 (~6/mi2). Anticipated increases in I. scapularis in the northern tier could be partially mitigated through deer herd management."

Virus-like particles (VLPs) are important vaccine platforms against pathogenic threats, including Covid-19. However, symmetry mismatch can prohibit vaccine nanoassembly. We established an approach for coupling VLPs to diverse antigen symmetries. SpyCatcher003 enabled efficient VLP conjugation and extreme thermal resilience. Many people had pre-existing antibodies to SpyTag:SpyCatcher but less to the 003 variants. We coupled the computer-designed VLP not only to monomers (SARS-CoV-2) but also to cyclic dimers (Newcastle disease, Lyme disease), trimers (influenza hemagglutinins), and tetramers (influenza neuraminidases). Even an antigen with dihedral symmetry could be displayed. For the global challenge of influenza, SpyTag-mediated display of trimer and tetramer antigens strongly induced neutralizing antibodies. SpyCatcher003 conjugation enables nanodisplay of diverse symmetries towards generation of potent vaccines."

		"abstract": "Companion animals can become infected with tick-borne diseases (TBDs) becoming a reservoir for human transfer, thereby damaging human health. To evaluate whether companion animals are infested with ticks harboring human TBD pathogens, we detected TBD pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and cats brought to animal hospitals in the Yamagata prefecture of Japan. An investigation of 164 adult ticks collected from 88 dogs and 41 cats between March and July 2018 revealed that this region was dominated by three tick species, Ixodes ovatus (n = 95, 57.9%), Ixodes nipponensis (n = 37, 22.6%) and Haemaphysalis flava (n = 10, 6.1%). To evaluate their pathogenic potential, we went on to test each tick for spotted fever group rickettsiae, Lyme disease borreliae, relapsing fever borreliae, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (formerly SFTS virus). Our results identified two I. ovatus ticks infected with Borrelia miyamotoi, which causes emerging relapsing fever; several I. nipponensis ticks infected with Rickettsia monacensis, which cause rickettsiosis; and several Ixodes persulcatus ticks infected with Rickettsia helvetica, which can also cause rickettsiosis. These results suggest that dogs and cats, and veterinary professionals and pet owners, in the Yamagata prefecture have some risk of exposure to several TBDs. This means that there should be continuous monitoring and reporting of TBDs, even those known to be uncommon in Japan, in both companion animals and humans to ensure the health and safety of both humans and animals in Japan."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. is a Gram-negative spirochaete, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere. Reports on the presence of B. burgdorferi in central Mexico have been strongly criticized, since these were based only on unspecific serological methods. Furthermore, the worldwide genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi s.s. has not been evaluated. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to confirm the presence of B. burgdorferi in the central area of Mexico and to evaluate its relationship with regard to the global genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi s.s. To achieve this, fragments of the flagellin and the outer surface protein A genes were amplified from ear biopsies of the arboreal wild endemic mice Habromys schmidlyi. With these sequences, a concatenated Bayesian analysis was performed to confirm the identity of B. burgdorferi s.s. Afterwards, the global genetic diversity of this bacterial species was evaluated using our sequences and those available in GenBank. A prevalence of 10.4% (5/48) of H. schmidlyi infected with Borrelia sp. was detected, and the phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of B. burgdorferi s.s. Using both genes, the genetic diversity was low. However, genetic structuring analyses revealed that populations of western United States and those from Mexico formed slightly different genetic groups, separated from the populations of the rest of the world. Our study not only confirms the presence of this bacterium in central Mexico, but also shows the most southern record of this bacterium so far. It also highlights the importance of H. schmidlyi as a new potential host of this bacterial species. Our study also provides first genetic data on an incipient process of divergence in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations of eastern United States and central Mexico."

We assessed the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite in Europe. We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 h after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment. Potential participants ≥ 8 years of age who reported a recent tick bite online were invited for the study. After informed consent, they were randomly assigned to either the prophylaxis or the no-treatment group. Participants in the prophylaxis group were asked to visit their general practitioner to administer the antibiotics. All participants were followed up by online questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the development of physician-confirmed Lyme borreliosis in a modified-intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3953) and is closed. Between April 11, 2013, and June 10, 2015, 3538 potential participants were randomized, of whom 1689 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat analysis. 10 cases of Lyme borreliosis were reported out of 1041 participants (0.96%) in the prophylaxis group, and 19 cases out of 648 no-treatment participants (2.9%), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31 - 84%), and a number-needed-to-treat of 51 (95% CI 29 - 180). No serious adverse events were reported. This primary care-based trial provides evidence that a single dose of doxycycline can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes ricinus tick bite."

To evaluate the impact of Lyme borreliosis seroprevalence and serologic test characteristics on the probability of obtaining a false-positive result and impact on antimicrobial use. Cross-sectional serological survey and modelling. Sera from 303 horses in southern Belgium were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apparent seroprevalence was derived from serological data and a Bayesian estimate of true seroprevalence was computed. These were a starting point to model the impact of test and population characteristics on the probability of obtaining false-positive results and consequently unnecessary treatments and complications. Apparent and true seroprevalence were 22% (95% CI 18%-27%) and 11% (credible interval with 95% probability 0.6%-21%) respectively. We estimate that two-thirds of positive samples are false positive in southern Belgium, with one in five of tested horses potentially misdiagnosed as infected. Around 5% of antimicrobial use in equine veterinary practice in Belgium may be attributable to treatment of a false-positive result. There was uncertainty regarding the ELISA's sensitivity and specificity. This study highlights the importance of appreciating the poor diagnostic value of ELISA screening for Lyme borreliosis as demonstrated by this case study of seroprevalence in southern Belgium where we demonstrate that a nontrivial number of horses is estimated to receive unwarranted treatment due to poor appreciation of screening test characteristics by practitioners, contributing substantially to unnecessary use of antimicrobials."

A century of research on Chagas' cardiomyopathy has generated compelling data for pathophysiological models, evaluated the efficacy of therapy in large randomized controlled trials, and explored the social determinants of health impacting preventative measures.

		"abstract": "Lyme and other tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States. Development of tick control tools have focused primarily on the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say. Application of acaricides or entomopathogenic fungal agents to kill host-seeking ticks or ticks on rodents can suppress I. scapularis abundance in residential landscapes, but evidence is lacking for impact on human tick bites or tick-borne disease. Similar studies remain limited for the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.). Other knowledge gaps include how well homeowners and pest control companies perform in the broadcast application of tick-killing products, relative to high efficacy reported in research studies, and the tick-killing potential of natural product formulations exempt from Environmental Protection Agency registration. Area-wide control based on preventing ticks from feeding on their main reproductive host, the white-tailed deer, can suppress populations of both I. scapularis and A. americanum. Some studies also suggest an impact on Lyme disease cases, but this needs to be further validated in larger-scale intervention studies. The effectiveness, scale, cost, and implementation of various tick management strategies are important considerations in efforts to reduce human tick encounters and tick-borne disease. Additional barriers include weak incentives for industry and academia to develop, test, and register new tick and pathogen control technologies, including vaccines targeting humans, tick reproductive hosts, or wildlife pathogen reservoirs. Solutions will need to be 'two-pronged': improving the tick and pathogen control toolbox and strengthening the public health workforce engaging in tick control at local and state levels."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis (LC) is an early-disseminated manifestation of Lyme disease, most commonly presenting as a high-degree atrioventricular block (AVB). The degree of AVB can fluctuate rapidly within minutes, and progression to third-degree AVB is potentially fatal if not recognized and managed promptly. However, the AVB in LC is often transient and usually resolves with appropriate antibiotic therapy. LC should be on the differential diagnosis in young patients presenting with new high-degree AVB and factors that increase the index of suspicion for Lyme disease. The Suspicious Index in Lyme Carditis (SILC) score helps clinicians risk-stratify for LC. A systematic approach to the diagnosis and treatment of LC minimizes the unnecessary implantation of permanent pacemakers."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Lyme borreliosis is the most common zoonotic disease in Europe and causes an estimated total burden of 10.55 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) per 100 000 population. Its incidence in Western Europe is assumed to be increasing, yet this remains to be confirmed. The aim of this study was to assess the emergence of Lyme disease in Western Europe by performing a systematic review of the scientific literature.Methods: Pubmed, Embase and grey literature were searched from database inception until August 2018 for articles reporting the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Western European countries. We included observational studies in English that reported data on a random sample of the population and fulfilled our definition of Lyme disease diagnosis. Annual population-weighted averages and the evolution of Lyme borreliosis incidence were extracted or calculated for every Western European country.Results: Our review identified 1514 and included 18 studies next to seven surveillance reports reporting data from 16 Western European countries. Incidence of Lyme borreliosis ranged from 0.001 (Italy) to 632 (Sweden, Blekinge county) cases/100 000/year. Iceland reported the strongest emergence with an average yearly increase of 21.15% over a 12-year period, whereas Italy reported the strongest average yearly decrease of 52.71% over a 5-year period. Very limited high-quality data were available on Lyme borreliosis incidence in the southern Western European countries.Conclusion: Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is on the rise in some Western European countries, mostly in the northern and central part. Better surveillance in the southern countries is necessary."

		"abstract": "Infections with Borrelia burgdorferi can cause Lyme disease with multiorganic involvement such as (myo)carditis or joint manifestations. Musculoskeletal complaints possibly mimicking some of these symptoms are common among elite athletes. This study aimed to determine seroprevalence and incidence of B. burgdorferi antibodies in professional football players. Prospective observational study. Healthy professional football players. Five hundred thirty-five men in the first and second German league. Two screening assays were used to examine immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) against B. burgdorferi: an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a chemiluminescence assay (CLIA). In case of a positive or equivocal result, an immunoblot including in vivo antigens was performed. Course of IgM and IgG against B. burgdorferi in overall 1529 blood samples. A total of 96.4% of all results were concordant between EIA and CLIA. Considering only samples with identical results in both assays, prevalence was 1.6%. A positive IgM was detected in 2.3%. No player showed any symptoms of Lyme disease. A seroconversion to IgG was not found. Three players developed a positive IgM corresponding to an incidence of 1032/100 000 person-years. Depending on the assay, 49% to 75% of positive or equivocal screening results could not be confirmed by immunoblot. Seroprevalence and incidence of B. burgdorferi among healthy male professional football players are low. Therefore, infections with B. burgdorferi have to be regarded a rare differential diagnosis in professional football in Central Europe. The low confirmation rate of positive screening assays points to an unspecific immune activation."
