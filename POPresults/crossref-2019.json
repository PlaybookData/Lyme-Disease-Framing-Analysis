Analyzing the medical governance of Lyme disease through actors’ everyday decision-making practices, the author shows how, in failing to accurately diagnose and treat his sick body and depriving him of treatment, credentialed health care providers reproduced culturally dominant, institutionalized, yet inadequate formations of medical power-knowledge. The author’s experience of this disease illustrates how the manufacture of disease categories and their ascription regulates bodies that do not fit into established categories. Analyzing data from his own life in light of medical science research, the author advances an analytical autoethnography and dissenting embodied knowledge, legitimizing the diagnostic category of chronic Lyme disease, and introducing two concepts—<italic>contested disease</italic> and <italic>contested care</italic>—to theorize the complex phenomenon of Lyme disease.</p>"

In this study, we compared paired results of clinical 2-tier Lyme disease tests to those of the C6 peptide EIA followed by supplemental immunoblotting (C6 2-tier test). Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of children aged ≥1 to ≤21 years who were undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease in the emergency department at 1 of 6 centers located in regions in which Lyme disease is endemic. The clinical first-tier test and a C6 EIA were performed on the same serum sample with supplemental immunoblotting if the first-tier test result was either positive or equivocal. We compared the results of the paired clinical and C6 2-tier Lyme disease test results using the McNemar test. Results: Of the 1714 children enrolled, we collected a research serum sample from 1584 (92.4%). The clinical 2-tier EIA result was positive in 316 (19.9%) children, and the C6 2-tier test result was positive or equivocal in 295 (18.6%) children. The clinical and C6 2-tier test results disagreed more often than they would have by chance alone (P = .002). Of the 39 children with either a positive clinical or C6 2-tier test result alone, 2 children had an erythema migrans (EM) lesion, and 29 had symptoms compatible with early disseminated Lyme disease. Conclusions: Two-tier Lyme disease test results differed for a substantial number of children on the basis of the specific first-tier test used. In children for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for Lyme disease and who have an initially negative test result, clinicians should consider retesting for Lyme disease."

It shows how critical analysis of scientific, clinical and other real- world evidence drew on and reflected the ethos of the Radstats network. It is a story showing how I worked with others with statistical skills - using science and evidence to challenge policy successfully. It explains how communities can take action, while using or creating scientific knowledge - to improve policy and people’s health. It shows how networks of communities can engage through social change (based on an understanding of policy and science) to make it more socially relevant and responsive, as well as more scientifically robust.</p>"

The framework was applied to the Lyme Bay MPA, southwest England, the site of a controversial fisheries closure, which has subsequently been proposed as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well the location for an NGO-led project focusing on stakeholder engagement. This paper examines a broad range of perspectives on the governance of this MPA, via semi-structured interviews with representatives of different interest groups and document analyses. The MPAG framework found a governance structure with a diversity of incentives, providing for bottom-up stakeholder engagement and awareness-raising coupled with strong top-down legislative structures. Although the fisheries closure and subsequent SAC restrictions have provided the main mechanisms for protecting biodiversity, an NGO-led project has provided a complement to the legislative framework and helped to facilitate a mechanism for adaptive co-management. However, the site is predicted to be subject to external pressures from changes in legislation, state resource restrictions and reduced NGO involvement, which will test the resilience of the structure and whether such a diversity of incentives provides sufficient resilience to maintain MPA effectiveness in the face of these pressures.</p>"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Background: In Finland, the routine surveillance of Lyme borreliosis (LB) is laboratory-based. In addition, we have well established national health care registers where countrywide data from patient visits in public health care units are collected. In our previous study based on these registers, we reported an increasing incidence of both microbiologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed LB cases in Finland during the past years. Here, we evaluated our register data, refined LB incidence estimates provided in our previous study, and evaluated treatment practices considering LB in the primary health care. Methods: Three national health care registers were used. The Register for Primary Health Care Visits (Avohilmo) and the National Hospital Discharge Register (Hilmo) collect physician-recorded data from the outpatient and inpatient health care visits, respectively, whereas the National Infectious Diseases Register (NIDR) represents positive findings in LB diagnostics notified electronically by microbiological laboratories. We used a personal identification number in register-linkage to identify LB cases on an individual level in the study year 2014. In addition, antibiotic purchase data was retrieved from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution in order to evaluate the LB treatment practices in the primary health care in Finland.Results: Avohilmo was found to be useful in monitoring clinically diagnosed LB (i.e. EM infections), whereas Hilmo did not add much value next to existing laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB. However, Hilmo gave valuable information about uncertainties related to physician-based surveillance of disseminated LB and the total annual number of EM infections in our country. Antibiotic purchases associated with the LB-related outpatient visits in the primary health care indicated a good compliance with the recommended treatment guidelines. Conclusions: In 2018, Avohilmo was introduced in the routine surveillance of LB in Finland next to laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB."

		"abstract": "Lyme Disease continues to be a complex phenomenon, medically, culturally, epistemologically. Based on a theoretical framework steeped in feminist science studies and post-human onto-epistemologies, I suggest that conventional biomedicine has failed not only practically as far as helping patients suffering from Lyme and other \"emergent diseases,\" but also conceptually as it applies the determinist monocausal infectious disease model to Lyme. Several recent essays on autoimmunity have developed tools based on both science studies and deconstruction that pinpoint the conceptual  shortcoming of dominant immunology, which presumes a stable and antagonistic ontology of immune self and pathogenic other. The authors suggest to replace this ontology with an ecology of entangled becomings. My argument is developed by weaving together the human-centered Lyme conundrum with that of horses because Lyme seems better understood by veterinarians than human physicians. While I critically examine an important official study on equine borreliosis, conducted by Cornell University's Veterinary College, which is characterized by the typical reductionist and mechanistic approach, I nevertheless concede that it has yielded a better testing system than what is available in the human context. But ultimately, I end up making the case for an energy-medicine approach to healing rather than a biomedical \"cure\" through the case study of my horse Caspio, who suffers from the chronic stage of the illness, and whom I have rehabilitated over the course of nearly a decade. His etiology simultaneously blends into my own, as I move from self- to cross-species case history in this hybrid piece. Leaning on the notion of entangled ecologies developed in recent literature, which proposes to think of immune-system related illnesses as dynamic relations of becoming together, I conclude with the notion of balance —mental, immunological, and biomechanical— which I have striven to achieve with Caspio through acupuncture and the art of classical training: learning to live well with the embodiment of (at times debilitating) symptoms, rather than engaging in pharmacological warfare."

		"abstract": "The Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Neurology, and American Academy of Rheumatology jointly proposed Lyme disease guidelines. Four areas most relevant to psychiatry were reviewed—the disclaimer, laboratory testing, and adult and pediatric psychiatric sections. The disclaimer and the manner in which these guidelines are implemented are insufficient to remove the authors and sponsoring organizations from liability for harm caused by these guidelines. The guidelines and supporting citations place improper credibility upon surveillance case definition rather than clinical diagnosis criteria. The guidelines fail to address the clear causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, developmental disabilities and substance abuse despite significant supporting evidence. If these guidelines are published without very major revisions, and if the sponsoring medical societies attempt to enforce these guidelines as a standard of care, it will directly contribute to increasing a national and global epidemic of psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, substance abuse and developmental disabilities and the associated economic and non-economic societal burdens. The guideline flaws could be improved with a more appropriate disclaimer, an evidence-based rather than an evidence-biased approach, more accurate diagnostic criteria, and recognition of the direct and serious causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease, caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus. Infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi can occur throughout Poland and therefore, according to ECDC description, the whole country should be considered as an endemic area. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2017 in comparison to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on data from the annual bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017”. (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2018, NIZP-PZH, GIS). RESULTS. In 2017 were registered 21,514 Lyme disease cases i.e. 1.48% more than in the previous year and 2,324 people were hospitalized. Epidemiological situation in Western European countries and Poland are similar. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. A slightly increase in 2017 and lack of a clear trend in individual voivodeships may indicate, that a very high level of sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance has been achieved."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to describe incidence over time, geographic and seasonal distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of Lyme disease cases in Canada.IntroductionLyme disease (LD), a multisystem infection that is manifested by progressive stages (1), is emerging in central and eastern provinces of Canada due to northward expansion of the geographic range of Ixodes scapularis, the main vector in these regions (2). In 2004, approximately 40 human cases of LD were reported in Canada. In 2009, LD disease became nationally notifiable, with provincial and territorial health departments reporting clinician-diagnosed cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). This study summarizes seven years (2009-2015) of national surveillance data for LD in Canada.MethodsNational Lyme disease surveillance data is collected through two surveillance systems, the Canadian National Disease Surveillance System (CNDSS) and the Lyme disease enhanced surveillance system (LDES). The CNDSS collects only demographic data (age and sex), and information on episode date and case classification. The LDES system captures additional data, including: possible geographic location of infection (for both locally acquired and travel-related cases); clinical manifestations; and results of laboratory testing. Nine provinces out of ten participate to LDES that means they provide a part of or all the data elements of this surveillance system. The 2009 national Lyme disease case definition (3) that distinguishes confirmed and probable cases (Table 1) is used to classify and report cases diagnosed by clinicians.This study describes the incidence over time, seasonal and geographic distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of reported LD cases. Logistic regression was used to explore variations among age groups, sex and year of reporting clinical manifestations to better understand potential demographic risk factors for the occurrence of LD. Different models were used with as outcomes absence or presence of: erythema migrans (early Lyme disease), neurologic and cardiac symptoms and multiple erythema, migrans (early disseminated Lyme disease); and arthritis (late disseminated Lyme disease). The most parsimonious multivariate models were sought by backward elimination of nonsignificant variables until all factors in the model were significant (P<0.05).ResultsThe number of reported LD cases increased more than six-fold, from 144 in 2009 to 917 in 2015, mainly due to an increase in infections acquired in Canada. For the provinces participating into the LDES system, the month of illness onset for Lyme disease cases acquired in Canada was available for 2010 cases. Most cases were reported during the summer months of June (20.7%), July (35.4%) and August (17.3%) (Figure 1). An increase in incidence of LD was observed in provinces from Manitoba eastwards (Figure 2). This is consistent with our knowledge of range expansion of the tick vectors in this region. In the western provinces the incidence has remained low and stable. All cases reported by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador were acquired outside of the province, either elsewhere in Canada or abroad. There was a bimodal distribution for LD by age with peaks at 5–9 and 45–74 years of age (Figure 3). The most common presenting symptoms were a single erythema migrans rash (74.2%) and arthritis (35.7%) (Figure 4). In the multivariate analysis for clinical manifestations, children aged 0–9 years had a greater number of cases reported as early LD (erythema migrans only) than patients aged 10–19 and 30–39 years (P<0.05). For early disseminated manifestations, young adults 20–29 years of age reported more neurologic manifestations, cardiac manifestations or multiple erythema migrans than the reference age group of 0–9 years (P<0.05). For late disseminated manifestations, children under 15 years of age were more frequently reported as having arthritis than other age groups.ConclusionsLyme disease incidence continues to increase in Canada as does the geographic range of ticks that carry the LD bacteria. This increasing of LD incidence might also be due to changing in knowledge, attitudes, and practices of clinicians who diagnose the disease and or of the public health workers who collect and report the data. Ongoing surveillance, preventive strategies as well as early disease recognition and treatment will continue to minimize the impact of LD in Canada.References1.

		"abstract": "Whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can persist for long periods in the human body has been a controversial question. The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation."

For example, CRISPR-based genome editing may be used to create white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) that are resistant to the Lyme disease spirochete vectored by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). Toward this goal, academic researchers are developing Lyme-resistant and tick-resistant white-footed mice, which are a primary pathogen reservoir for Lyme disease in the United States. If field trials on small, experimental islands are successful, the project would scale up to the larger islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and possibly to the mainland, most likely with a local gene drive to speed the traits’ proliferation, pending approvals from relevant constituents. Despite considerable publicity, this project has yet to be evaluated by independent professional ecologists. In the present article, I discuss key ecological and evolutionary questions that should be considered before such genetically engineered mice are released into natural habitats."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective of this research is to develop the model for calculating the forecast of the Lyme disease dynamics what will help to take effective preventive and control measures using the intelligent multi-agent approach.IntroductionClimate warming, globalization, social and economic crises lead to the activation of natural foci of vector-borne infections, among which a special place belongs to Lyme disease (Ixodic tick borreliosis – ITB), the vectors of which are the Ixodes ticks. More than 5,000 cases are registered in the United States every year [1]. In European countries, the number of cases may reach up to 8,000-10,000 per year. Incidence rate for ITB in France is 39.4 per 100,000 population, in Bulgaria – 36.6 [2]. In Ukraine, among all ticks, 10-70% are infected with Borrelia; from 10% to 42.2% of Ukrainian population had contact with the causative agent of ITB.Mathematical modeling as an element of monitoring of natural focal infections makes it possible to assess the epidemiological potential of foci in the region and in individual territories, to forecast the trends of the epidemic process and to determine the main priorities and directions in the prevention of ITB. The most modern and effective method of simulation is multi-agent simulation, which is associated with the concept of an intelligent agent, as some robot, purposefully interacting with other similar elements and the external environment under given conditions. An intelligent agent is an imitation model of an active element, the state and behavior of which in various situations of achieving the goal vary depending on the state and behavior of other agents and the environment, in analogy with the intellectual behavior of a live organism (including a human) under similar conditions.As the epidemic process of Lyme disease is characterized by vector transmission, heterogeneous tick population, variable pathogen infectivity, heterogeneous environment, and seasonal changes in tick activity, the use of classical statistical methods for predicting the dynamics of morbidity cannot show high accuracy. The multiagent approach to simulation of the epidemic process of Lyme disease allows considering all of the above features, and since the dynamics of the modeled system is formed from the behavior of local objects (humans and ticks), we expect that a model constructed using a multiagent approach will yield a higher accuracy of prognosis morbidity. The multiagent model will allow not only to calculate the forecast, but also to reveal the factors influencing increase of the incidence of Lyme disease the most.MethodsThe research is based on official reports of new Lyme disease cases registered during 2006-2017. The data were collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine from the healthcare facilities of Kharkiv Oblast of Ukraine as a part of passive routine disease surveillance. In total, 1016 cases of Lyme disease registered during the study period were included in this research.The multi-agent approach to simulation of epidemic process has been used for the model development.The epidemiological model of Lyme disease is based on the Gromashevsky’s concept of the epidemic process, according to which the epidemic process exists with the continuous interaction of the three main components - source of infection, mechanism of transmission and susceptible organism.The most profitable type of agent in the study of epidemic process is an emotionally-motivated intellectual agent for the most complete and accurate model of human behavior. Let’s consider the agent as a set of properties:a=<s,st,c,ta,l>, a∈A, s∈S, c∈C, ta∈Ta, (1)where st is time in state s,A is set of all agents,S is set of different agent’s states,C is set of working area’s cells,Ta is set of possible agent’s types,l is length of life.The set of agent states is predefined and is constant. Depending on the process being studied, the set can be supplemented by different states, the initial set is:S={Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Dead}. (2)The composition of the workspace leads to the appearance of a set of cells, as conditional abstract objects. It is assumed that one cell can simultaneously include a number of agents as well as one object-vector of infection (tick). It is assumed that depending on the type of working area where the agent is located the specific nature of the epidemic process is changed.The vector transmission of the disease from tick to agent is realized as follows. To begin with, the possibility of contact with tick is checked. It is believed that this is possible if other agents are also processed in the same cell along with the tick processed as well. Each pair agent-tick is compared. If tick is infected, it is believed that with a certain probability healthy agent can become infected.To automate the prediction of the incidence of Lyme disease, a software package has been developed using C# programing language that allows to calculate prognosis morbidity based on existing statistical data in real time. In the developed model, the configuration of the software package includes data for the period 2006-2017. This data include incidence rate of ITB per 100,000 population, the population's seeking healthcare providers for tick bites, the results of studies of ticks removed from humans for the presence of Borrelia, the number and proportion of ticks infected by Borrelia collected by the flagging method.ResultsThe calculated prognosis shows the expected increase in the number of cases with a certain three-year cycle: an increase in the number of cases of Ixodic tick borreliosis within 2 years with a slight decrease for the next year.A comparative analysis of the accuracy of forecasting by moving average method to 3 years [3] and multiagent simulation showed that the latter describes the existing data better, therefore, the forecast will be more accurate. The accuracy rates using the moving average method is 85.4%, with the use of multiagent simulation 96.6%.ConclusionsA comparative assessment of the accuracy of predicting the dynamics of the epidemic process using the moving average method [3] and the multiagent approach was carried out. A higher accuracy is noted with the use of multi-agent simulation (96.6% against 85.4% using moving average method), based on which a software package has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate the expected morbidity rate of Lyme disease. That means that the hypothesis made of the research was confirmed. The adequacy of the tested prognosis was verified on the real statistical data collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine on the incidence of Lyme disease in Kharkiv Oblast (Ukraine) from 2006 to 2017. The obtained forecast revealed the expected persistence of the unstable epidemic situation with respect to Lyme disease, which dictates the need to develop a set of preventive measures aimed at reducing the morbidity of people by ITB. Virtual verification of the effectiveness of such events will be the next step in our study.ReferencesGulia-Nuss M. Genomic insights into the Ixodes scapularis tick vector of Lyme disease [Text] / M.

In the present study, we provided a qualitative analysis of written correspondence produced by 23 parents of children and adolescents with Lyme disease. The goal of this study was to investigate how medical and psychological issues were highlighted by parents describing their family’s Lyme disease experiences. The results suggest a series of four stages in these families where satisfactory treatment had not been obtained over months or years. The experiences of parents evolved from feelings of worry for the child to frustration with the lack of a helpful treatment, to mistrust of physicians’ actions, and, in some case, to a rejection of the conventional health care system as a whole. Improved diagnostic testing and treatment guidelines, as well as family-centered practices of medical care were proposed as important features for improving the experiences of families living with Lyme disease."

The prevalence of LD is swiftly mounting in the present scenario in many countries from species to species. Although Lyme’s infection is now detectable via serologic examination of early and late Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), the management of persistent symptoms is still fraught with quora of doubt and debate. LD is a multisystem spirochete which results after the dissemination of B. burgdorferi from a dermal inoculation site after a tick bite. Lyme&#039;s infection can easily get transmitted to the central nervous system and develop various neurological symptoms due to inflammation and an autoimmune response from body may lead to life-threatening “Lyme Borreliosis”. The neurological symptoms are well mixed in presentation, late and confusing to get differentiated easily from other diseases. The use of antibiotics in post Lyme infection with neurological complications is still a topic of debate. Babesiosisstates, and human ehrlichiosis&#039; the two other diseases, are associated with the same ticks that spread the LD. However, the prevalence of diagnosed human cases is usually much lower than that of actual cases of LD due to misdiagnosis, late diagnosis or undiagnosis at y such lateral neuroinfection stage after the tick bite. The current review focuses on the molecular neuropathology and current advancements in LD. There are very few patents or discoveries made on borrelia infection, drawing attention towards more focused and targeted research for the cure."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. This species undergoes a life cycle consisting of eggs and three active stages: larva, nymph, and adult. Each active life stage takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of blood digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within endosomes of acidic digestive cells. However, in other hematophagous arthropods, the serine protease trypsin plays an important role in early protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of I. scapularis cathepsins and serine proteases, some with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. Gut pH was also determined and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels during blood digestion. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 days post host detachment, respectively. In addition, alkaline gut pH (8.0) conditions after I. scapularis blood feeding were similar to those required for trypsin activity in other arthropods suggesting these enzymes have an important and previously overlooked role in I. scapularis blood digestion."

Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) causes all or part of a triad including meningitis, radiculoneuritis, and cranial neuritis. Rarely, parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement occur, with focal findings on examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LNB diagnosis requires plausible exposure, objective evidence of nervous system involvement, and, generally, positive two-tier serology. Central nervous system (CNS) LNB is almost always accompanied by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cells, protein), often with intrathecal antibody production, which is determined by concentration-adjusted comparison of serum and CSF antibody. Measuring CSF antibody in isolation and nucleic acid-based testing of CSF are not useful in LNB and should be avoided. LNB treatment is highly effective with a 2- to 3-week course of antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that LNB not involving the CNS parenchyma can be treated successfully with oral doxycycline."

There is rising awareness of LD by the general public through media coverage and high-profile celebrity cases. Greater awareness has benefits, such as increased diagnosis and treatment of LD. However, cases in the media tend to highlight delays in diagnosis and complications of LD, which can lead to high levels of patient anxiety about the risks of LD."

Radiculitis or inflammation of the nerve root can be seen 3-5% of the time in acute neuroborreliosis affecting the PNS with a typical presentation and meningitis affecting the CNS is usually seen 1% of the time. The appropriate diagnosis and management of neuroborelliosis can be challenging and require meticulous medical approaches. Herein we present a unique case of Lyme disease with neurologic manifestations including both radiculitis and meningitis due to its atypical and challenging clinical presentation and management with updated literature review."

		"abstract": "Background: In endemic areas, Lyme arthritis (LA) is a leading cause of joint swelling. Due to the shared inflammatory nature and common clinical features, acute LA is often misdiagnosed as septic arthritis (SA) while recurrent disease is at times difficult to differentiate from other causes of chronic arthritis. In Minnesota, there has been a steady increase in cases of Lyme disease. This has not been met by a clear guideline and there is no consensus for the management of pediatric arthritis. In this context, we sought to characterize the epidemiology and clinical presentation of a large local cohort. Methods: This is a retrospective review of medical charts from children with confirmed LA, presented at a large academic medical organization in the Upper Midwest between January 2011 to December 2017. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Results: Lyme arthritis was confirmed in 109 children. Acute presentation was more common (67) while the rest (42) had either persistence or reoccurrence of symptoms [Figure 1]. Elevated inflammatory markers and synovial pleocytosis were common, unlike fever and refusal to bear weight which were seen occasionally [Figure 2]. Seasonal distribution and the clinical setting for initial presentation as well as admissions are summarized in Figure 3. The knee was involved in all but 2 patients, both had acute monoarthritis (elbow and hip) [Figure 4]. Conclusion: LA causes a spectrum of disease, is seen year round, and across the clinical setting continuum. Acute knee monoarthritis is the most common presentation (54% in our cohort) and is often misdiagnosed as SA leading to unnecessary hospitalizations and aggressive interventions. This occurs more frequently at the ED setting and for children with significant synovial pleocytosis. When evaluating a child with arthritis, laboratory findings are none specific and should be used in caution. Pediatric providers in endemic regions, especially those in primary, hospital, or emergency care must be familiar with the clinical presentation and have a high index of suspicion for LA in order to prevent mismanagement.

		"abstract": "Introduction. Lyme borreliosis (LB) is endemic spirochetosis with a transmission mechanism, which is often marked by a durable, recurrent course with multiple organ damages. LB is characterized by the appearance of migrating erythema at the site of tick bite. Durable persistence of the agent promotes disease progressing and occurrence of serious complications related to the nervous system, the heart and the locomotive apparatus. Among infrequent and especially dangerous complications of LB is damage to the hearing apparatus with the development of sensorineural deafness – hearing loss, which develops within 24 hours due to function impairment of the internal ear or auditory nerve. That infectious diseases account for 12.8-13% of numerous causes of sensorineural deafness development. Most frequently, the disease caused by B. burgdorferi is mentioned. Aim. To analyze the clinical case of Lyme borreliosis complicated by the sensorineural hearing loss. Materials and methods. The analysis of clinical-laboratory and instrumental data of the patient with Lyme borreliosis, whose course of the disease was complicated by sensorineural hearing loss. The patient received care at Lviv Regional Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital (LRIDCH). Results. The article presents a clinical case of Lyme borreliosis, complicated by sensorineural hearing loss, which appeared on the 15th day from the onset of erythema annulare in the patient. Hearing recovery in the patient could not be achieved via administration of etiotropic treatment (2.0 g/per day of ceftriaxone for 28 days), which was likely associated with late visit of the patient for medical aid. Conclusions. Sensorineural hearing loss is one of the rare, but severe lesions of auditory analyzer in LB. Hearing improvement after antibiotic therapy is possible in certain cases in early treatment."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease is a common entity in Maine, and Lyme carditis is an uncommon manifestation of this disease. This case series describes and compares the presentation, management, and outcomes of Lyme carditis in pediatric and adult populations. Methods: Charts of pediatric and adult patients with heart block and positive Lyme serologies hospitalized in Portland, Maine between January 2010 and December 2018 were analyzed. Data on medical history, presentation, treatment, and outcomes are described. Results: Ten children (range 7–17, mean 12.4 years) and 20 adults (range 22–81, mean 41.4 years) were admitted for Lyme carditis in the examined period. All cases presented between June and October. Twenty-seven (90%) were male, and 26 (87%) had no prior cardiac history. Of the adults, 1 (5%) reported using cocaine, 4 (20%) opioids, and 6 (30%) marijuana. Seventeen (57%) had outpatient evaluation prior to admission. Ten patients (59%) were not recognized as having Lyme disease. One case suspected to have Lyme was not initially treated with doxycycline. The most common alternative diagnoses were a viral illness and erythema multiforme. No coinfections were noted. Proportionately more children than adults had disseminated erythema migrans (40% vs. 20%) and fever (60% vs. 35%). First degree heart block was more prevalent in children (40%), and Mobitz type 2 heart block was more prevalent in adults (55%). Ten patients (30%) presented with syncope. More adults than children needed temporary pacing, 9 (45%) vs. 2 (20%). Children had shorter antibiotic durations compared with adults (mean 19.8 days vs. 23.6 days) Twenty-seven (90%) had improved heart block. Three adult patients (10%) required a pacemaker following hospitalization. Nine (90%) children and 14 (70%) adults were discharged with a PR 200-300ms. There was a single death in this series, which occurred after discharge to another state. Conclusion: Cases tended to be in younger patients with male predominance. Most patients still had some degree of heart block on discharge. The majority of patients were evaluated prior to hospitalization but Lyme disease was suspected in only 41%. Improved recognition of early Lyme disease and more prompt treatment may lead to decreased complications of Lyme carditis. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

Three international database (electronic PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus) and two national database (Ulakbim and Turkmedline) searches were performed using the following keywords ([‘Lyme’ or ‘Borrelia burgdorferi’ or ‘Borrelia’ or ‘Borreliosis’] and ‘Turkey [and/country]’). National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNNDS) of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria were used for classification. A PRISMA-based algorithm was used for systematic review. There were a total of 75 LD cases in 36 different reports. Studies related to LD are confined to case reports. We believe that LD is an important healthcare problem in Turkey and to our knowledge this is the first systematic review from this country."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a complex tick-borne zoonosis that poses an escalating public health threat in several parts of the world, despite sophisticated healthcare infrastructure and decades of effort to address the problem. Concepts like the true burden of the illness, from incidence rates to longstanding consequences of infection, and optimal case management, also remain shrouded in controversy. At the heart of this multidisciplinary issue are the causative spirochetal pathogens belonging to the Borrelia Lyme complex. Their unusual physiology and versatile lifestyle have challenged microbiologists, and may also hold the key to unlocking mysteries of the disease. The goal of this review is therefore to integrate established and emerging concepts of Borrelia biology and pathogenesis, and position them in the broader context of biomedical research and clinical practice. We begin by considering the conventions around diagnosing and characterizing Lyme disease that have served as a conceptual framework for the discipline. We then explore virulence from the perspective of both host (genetic and environmental predispositions) and pathogen (serotypes, dissemination, and immune modulation), as well as considering antimicrobial strategies (lab methodology, resistance, persistence, and clinical application), and borrelial adaptations of hypothesized medical significance (phenotypic plasticity or pleomorphy)."

Projections estimate that by the year 2049 all health units in Ontario will have suitable environmental conditions for the establishment of this vector. A review of website content from health units in Ontario was performed to assess the quality of tick and Lyme disease information provided to the public and health care providers. Websites were evaluated based on criteria such as the provision of Lyme disease information (i.e., transmission, symptoms, treatment, etc.), the inclusion of misleading or incorrect information, and visuals provided. The quality of textual and visual information varied substantially across the 35 health units analyzed. Eleven health units were found to provide misleading or incorrect information. Disparities were found between areas with current Lyme disease risk and those without. The majority of health units did not include satisfactory visual content pertaining to ticks. Given the expected expansion and intensification of blacklegged tick populations across the province, all health units must ensure the information communicated to the public about ticks and Lyme disease is of high-quality and consistent. We conclude with specific recommendations to improve the textual and visual content of websites."

The disease is multisystemic and the affected organs are the skin (Erythema migrans), nervous system, eyes, heart and joints. Borrelia burgdorferi is the bacterium that causes borreliosis and the hosts are rodents of the genus Apodemus. In the Balkan region, Ixodes ricinus is the most representative vector. A bite from an infected insect is the most common mode of transmitting Borrelia; however, transplacental transmission has also been documented. Pathogenesis of the disease consists of both direct and indirect mechanisms of immunological reactions which result in the production of IgM antibodies to Borrelia in the first 3-6 weeks, and production of IgG class after 6 weeks. Many skin diseases and skin symptoms mimicking Lyme borreliosis, such as dermatomycosis, erysipelas, and undefined hyperpigmentation must be elaborated and considered for borreliosis, as skin symptoms of borreliosis can imitate many of them."

Due to partial response to therapy and further test results including positive serologies and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies for Borrelia, the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis was considered. Further exploring revealed the possibility of exposure to ticks although there was no report of typical skin lesions. Daily physical therapy and appropriate antibiotic treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone resulted in significant improvement of motor symptoms and functional status. The patient was discharged with marked functional improvement and indication for further physical rehabilitation."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme arthritis commonly presents as an acute inflammatory monoarticular arthritis, frequently challenging to distinguish from septic arthritis. While management for Lyme arthritis focuses on antibiotic therapy, septic arthritis requires operative debridement plus antibiotic therapy. Delay in Lyme serology results may complicate decisions on surgical intervention in Lyme endemic areas. During the transition period of western Pennsylvania to a Lyme endemic region many children ultimately diagnosed with Lyme arthritis were managed by operative intervention due to diagnostic ambiguity. The impact of an operative intervention on outcomes of pediatric Lyme arthritis is unknown. Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review from 2008 to 2018 of patients admitted to UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh and diagnosed with Lyme arthritis. We recorded the clinical presentation, laboratory data, details of hospitalization and follow-up, costs and outcome after therapy to compare the impact of antibiotic therapy alone (non-operative group) vs. antibiotics plus operative debridement (operative group). Results: We identified 164 patients admitted for management of arthritis with the eventual diagnosis of Lyme arthritis. Fifty-two patients underwent operative debridement in addition to antibiotic therapy. Operative debridement plus antibiotics was associated with increased duration of admission, increased the cost of hospitalization, and increased PICC line placement compared with antibiotics alone. In patients for whom follow-up information was available, resolution of symptoms was documented in 62 of 66 patients in the non-operative group and 46 of 47 patients in the operative group with a median duration to symptom resolution of 17 and 23 days,, respectively. Conclusion: Operative debridement for pediatric patients with Lyme arthritis was associated with increased cost and duration of hospitalization, and a greater number of procedures, while being similarly efficacious to non-operative management with antibiotic therapy alone.

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. The disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, a skin rash, and joint pain. If left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system, resulting in inflammation and long-term symptoms that include arthritis and/or intermittent pain in joints and muscles, facial palsy, cardiovascular abnormalities and cognitive disturbances. Recent research suggests that late-stage Lyme disease may be a result of malfunctioning immune function. AHCCÒ is a natural immune modulating compound derived from a unique fraction of special cultured medicinal mushroom mycelia. Previous studies have also suggested that AHCCÒ exhibits preventive effect against a wide range of infections caused by MRSA, influenza and West Nile virus. The effect of AHCCÒ supplementation on Lyme disease patients was evaluated in the current study.Methods: In a pilot open-label study, 12 Lyme disease patients were administered 3 grams of AHCCÒ daily for 8 weeks. Before commencement of the administration and after 4 and 8 weeks, the effects of AHCCÒ were evaluated clinically based on symptoms, serum antibodies to pathogens, inflammatory activity and serum immunological parameters. Patients completed questionnaires pertaining to Qualify of Life parameters.Results: After 8 weeks of AHCCÒ administration, AHCCÒ ameliorated flu-like symptoms and manifestations in the eye, joint, muscle, nervous system and cardiovascular system. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an index as inflammation and serum interleukin-8 was significantly decreased.Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that AHCCÒ may be effective in treating patients with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Abstract: In an update of earlier surveys conducted in Connecticut and New Jersey in the mid-1990s, an online survey of private commercial pest control firms engaged in residential tick control showed that the application of synthetic acaricides continues to be the primary method of control used. The carbamate and organophospate acaricides, previously the most commonly used against ticks, have given way to synthetic pyrethroids and, to a lesser extent, the use of natural product/organic acaricides. Typical costs for a single acaricide application today ($100–$200 for a 1 acre [0.4 ha] property) remain similar to those reported from the earlier surveys, although the frequency of applications and, therefore, also the overall annual cost has increased. The application habitats within residential properties, life stages targeted, and application equipment used have not changed appreciably since the mid-1990s. While most survey respondents expressed knowledge of natural product acaricides and Damminix Tick Tubes, many reported that they either did not employ or knew very little about other alternative tick control methods (including entomopathogenic fungus and topical application of acaricides to tick hosts via 4-Poster deer treatment stations or Select TCS rodent bait boxes). This suggests either a failure to adequately inform the pest management industry and their potential client base of the availability of alternate methods, and/or industry concerns about cost and effectiveness of the alternatives."

It was after the second spontaneous tear that the patient's recent diagnosis of Lyme disease became the likely culprit. Often, patients with chronic Lyme disease present with an elaborate clinical picture that can mimic many more common diagnoses such as septic arthritis, transient synovitis, ligamentous sprain, and various other traumatic injuries. With the pathognomonic erythema migrans rash reported to be present less than 50% of the time in late-stage infections, the diagnosis of Lyme disease can often be difficult, with a high rate of underdiagnosis. It is important that Lyme disease be included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous tendon pathology, especially for physicians practicing in highly endemic areas. The treatment is relatively simple and successful—especially for an acute infection—and it is important to initiate treatment promptly to prevent disability."

We use a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach to understand the arguments of the authors to establish the legitimacy, or not, of a CLD diagnosis. This enabled us to make sense of the nature of the stalemate between patient groups and advocates of the medical establishment, as performed by authors of academic articles. In this article, we bring together the arguments to explain the polemical debate and to support accounts that avoid the impasse to give us greater insight into the experience of chronic illness."

Setting: Study data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a primary care database covering about 8% of the population in the UK in 658 primary care practices. Participants: Cohort of 8.4 million individuals registered with general practitioners with 52.4 million person-years of observation between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012. Primary and secondary outcome measures: LD was identified from recorded medical codes, notes indicating LD, laboratory tests and use of specific antibiotics. Annual incidence rates and the estimated total number of LD cases were calculated separately for each UK region. Results: The number of cases of LD increased rapidly over the years 2001 to 2012, leading to an estimated incidence rate of 12.1 (95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) per 100 000 individuals per year and a UK total of 7738 LD cases in 2012. LD was detected in every UK region with highest incidence rates and largest number of cases in Scotland followed by South West and South England. If the number of cases has continued to rise since the end of the study period, then the number in the UK in 2019 could be over 8000. The incidence of LD is about threefold higher than previously estimated, and people are at risk throughout the UK. These results should lead to increased awareness of the need for preventive measures.

Evidence Acquisition:: The PubMed database was queried through June 2018, and restricted to the English language, in search of relevant articles. Study Design:: Clinical review. Level of Evidence:: Level 3. Results:: A total of 5 cases of Lyme arthritis as a postoperative complication have been reported in the literature. Conclusion:: These cases highlight the importance for providers practicing in Lyme-endemic regions to keep such an infection in mind when evaluating postoperative joint pain and swelling. We propose herein an algorithm for the workup of potential postoperative Lyme arthritis. Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT):: C"

However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% (n=16) performed in the impaired range. Among patients who displayed sufficient performance validity, 2.9% (n=7) were classified as cognitively impaired. No association between subjective cognitive symptoms and objective impairment was found. Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment."

		"abstract": "Background: Chronic Lyme disease (LD) is a matter of debate worldwide and has emerged as a social problem. We aim to analyze the media content and describe the transformation process of a collective pain into a social problem in France. Methods: Using social science methodology, a corpus of articles from 20 newspapers and videos from seven major TV stations from 1987 to 2017 were analyzed for discourse content. The speaking times and the frequency of interventions between doctors supporting the official guidelines and those against them were compared using the Mann–Whitney test and the Chi-square test, respectively. Results: In France, the media discourse is carried through testimonials from patient organizations and a professor of infectiology who acted as a whistleblower (WB). We showed that the emergence of the LD alert in the media corresponds to the process described by social sciences as ‘naming, blaming, claiming’. Since his first article in 2014, the WB has featured in 24% (22/89) of newspaper articles compared with 20% (18/89) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.52). Since his first appearance on a TV newscast in 2014, the WB has appeared in 45% (22/49) of news reports on LD with 24% of the speaking time compared with 22% (11/49) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.018). Conclusions: Media coverage of LD has been unbalanced since 2014 and promotes associations as well as the WB, who seems to be better identified than any of the different doctors defending the official guidelines."

The hot topic is whether or not long-term antibiotics should be used for Lyme disease patients with persistent symptoms. The source of such a long-running debate stems from the difference in opinions over the cause of long-term, persistent symptoms after treatment in some patients. Toward its end, Medicine has finally begun to embrace the existence of Chronic Lyme Disease, but changes still need to be made in the future."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) cases have been on the rise throughout the United States, costing the healthcare system up to $1.3 billion per year, and making LD one of the greatest threats to public health. Factors influencing the number of LD cases range from environmental to system-level variables, but little is known about the influence of vegetation (canopy, understory, and ground cover) and human behavioral risk on LD cases and exposure to infected ticks. We determined the influence of various risk factors on the risk of exposure to infected ticks on 22 different walkways using multinomial logistic regression. The model classifies the walkways into high-risk and low-risk categories with 90% accuracy, in which the understory, human risk, and number of rodents are significant indicators. These factors should be managed to control the risk of transmission of LD to humans."

Borrelia infections can cause an intrathecal inflammatory response with accompanying cerebral and spinal imaging findings. Cases. Two children with acute or subacute initial neurological presentation, subsequent relapsing  course, and MR imaging features suggestive of multiple sclerosis are presented. A history of tick bite or dramatic response to antibiotic treatment supported Lyme disease in the beginning, but requirement of disaese-modifying treatment later in the course supported multiple sclerosis. Results. These cases carrying features supportive of both multiple sclerosis and Lyme disease caused clinical dilemma and were treated for both disorders. Borrelia-specific IgG index testing before any treatment could have prevented the difficulty in differential diagnosis. Conclusions. Clinical, imaging and CSF findings of multiple sclerosis and acute or chronic progressive borrelia encephalomyelitis may overlap and testing for Borrelia-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis should not be omitted in endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Objective: Chronic Lyme disease has been a poorly defined term and often dismissed as a fictitious entity. In this paper, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) provides its evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease. Definition: ILADS defines chronic Lyme disease (CLD) as a multisystem illness with a wide range of symptoms and/or signs that are either continuously or intermittently present for a minimum of six months. The illness is the result of an active and ongoing infection by any of several pathogenic members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bbsl). The infection has variable latency periods and signs and symptoms may wax, wane and migrate. CLD has two subcategories, CLD, untreated (CLD-U) and CLD, previously treated (CLD-PT). The latter requires that CLD manifestations persist or recur following treatment and are present continuously or in a relapsing/remitting pattern for a duration of six months or more. Methods: Systematic review of over 250 peer reviewed papers in the international literature to characterize the clinical spectrum of CLD-U and CLD-PT. Conclusion: This evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease clarifies the term’s meaning and the literature review validates that chronic and ongoing Bbsl infections can result in chronic disease. Use of this CLD definition will promote a better understanding of the infection and facilitate future research of this infection."

Although both gene products can function as potential porins, only BB0405 is essential for infection. Here we show that, despite sequence homology and coexpression from the same operon, both proteins differ in their membrane localization attributes, antibody accessibility, and immunogenicity in mice. BB0406 is required for spirochete survival in mammalian hosts, particularly for the disseminated infection in distant organs. We identified that BB0406 interacts with laminin, one of the major constituents of the vascular basement membrane, and facilitates spirochete transmigration across host endothelial cell barriers. A better understanding of how B. burgdorferi transmigrates through dermal and tissue vascular barriers and establishes disseminated infections will contribute to the development of novel therapeutics to combat early infection."

Methodology: three questionnaires were designed and applied to 290 individuals (40 small animal veterinarians, 50 in other professional practice and 200 veterinary students). Results and discussion: in general, the three groups were unaware about the disease, although there is a high interest in learning about this problem. Graduates from seven universities included in this study stated that Lyme disease was not part of the veterinary curriculum in their schools. Five clinical cases suggestive of Lyme disease occurring in dogs in the area were detected at the time of this research. Conclusion: although the presence of the agent causing Lyme disease has not been demonstrated in the studied area due to the lack of laboratory support and the apparent absence of the vector, it cannot be ruled out; furthermore, it is important that veterinary practitioners and student alike be aware of the potential presence of Lyme disease, paying particular attention to differential diagnosis when resembling clinical signs are observed."

This exploratory study relies on the theory of planned behavior and certain constructs from the health belief model to identify the factors leading municipal authorities to implement preventive interventions for Lyme disease (PILD). Data were obtained from an online survey sent, during the summer of 2018, to municipal officers in 820 municipalities in Quebec, in all health regions where the population is at risk of contracting Lyme disease (response rate = 36%). The questionnaire was used to measure the implementation of PILD, the intention to implement these interventions, attitudes, perceived social pressure, perceived control (levers and barriers) over interventions, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures, risk, and perceived vulnerability. Results of structural equation analyses showed that attitudes were significantly associated with municipal authorities’ intention to implement PILD, while the intention to implement PILD was a significant predictor of the implementation of PILD. Additional analyses showed that perceived barriers added a moderating effect in the intention-implementation relationship. The prediction of behaviors or practices that municipal authorities could implement to prevent Lyme disease will enable the evaluation over time of the evolution of Quebec municipalities’ adaptation to Lyme disease. Moreover, the examination of the associations of specific psychosocial factors revealed important implications for the design of effective behavior-change interventions, which would allow health officials doing awareness work to create personalized interventions better suited to municipal officers and their specific contexts."

In 2014, when the present study was designed, there were also plans to make neuroborreliosis notifiable within the European Union. Aim: We compared possibilities of surveillance of neuroborreliosis in Sweden through two different sources: the hospital discharge register and reporting from the clinical microbiology laboratories. Methods: We examined the validity of ICD-10 codes in the hospital discharge register by extracting personal identification numbers for all cases of neuroborreliosis, defined by a positive cerebrospinal fluid–serum anti- Results: Among 150 neuroborreliosis cases, 67 (45%) had received the ICD-10 code A69.2 (Lyme borreliosis) in combination with G01.9 (meningitis in bacterial diseases classified elsewhere), the combination that the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare recommends for neuroborreliosis. All 22 clinical laboratories replied to our questionnaire. Based on laboratory reporting, the annual incidence of neuroborreliosis in Sweden was 6.3 cases per 100,000 in 2014. Conclusion: The hospital discharge register was unsuitable for surveillance of neuroborreliosis, whereas laboratory-based reporting was a feasible alternative. In 2018, the European Commission included Lyme neuroborreliosis on the list of diseases under epidemiological surveillance."

Methods: Serum and CSF levels of κ- and λ-FLC, albumin and total concentration of immunoglobulin M (IgM) were determined together with CSF chemokine CXCL13 in 23 patients with definite LNB, 35 inflammatory neurological disease control (INDC) and 18 non-inflammatory control (NIC) patients. Indices and intrathecal fractions (IFs) of FLC and IgM were calculated. Results: Significant differences in FLC indices and IFs were found between the LNB group and both control groups, p ≤ 0.007. Sensitivity of intrathecal κ- and λ-FLC synthesis reached 78%–87% in LNB patients with a specificity of 94%–100% in NIC patients, whereas specificity in INDC patients was 69%. The corresponding frequencies of positive results for IF and index of IgM and CSF CXCL13 in these three diagnostic groups were 74%–96% in LNB patients, 0% in NIC patients and 3%–6% in INDC patients at the chosen cut-off levels. Conclusions: The findings of this study show a moderate to high sensitivity of CSF κ- and λ-FLC in LNB patients with a high specificity in NIC patients. However, overlap in CSF κ- and λ-FLC levels between LNB and INDC patients calls for caution in the interpretation and limits the diagnostic usefulness in the LNB diagnosis. CSF CXCL13 appears to be the most valuable additional biomarker of LNB aside from routine parameters such as CSF pleocytosis and anti-"

RESULTS: The results of this protocol on serious pathologies considered incurable in veterinary and overlapping human pathologies, are giving good outcomes. DISCUSSION: The difficult to diagnose Borrelliosis and Bartonellosis in the Lab and variability of the clinical symptoms cause difficulty to both human and veterinary doctors. Even when these pathologies are confirmed by analyses they are treated with a short antibiotic cycle. Because bacteria have systems to overcome antibiotics the pathologies become chronic leading to sub-clinical meningitis that also blocks the correct functioning of the autonomous nervous system that regulates every physiological process. Serious pathologies appear even years after bacterial contamination and mankind’s increasing longevity together with these bacterias’ tropism can cause or has already caused a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Alternating or combining therapies using various antibiotics, together with the antibacterial and catalytic effect of the oxygen/ozone therapy in the antibiotics and stem cells and the immunomodulation and neurotrophic effect of the Blood Stem Cells can indirectly resolve pathologies considered incurable up to now."

		"abstract": "Issue: Virtually non-existent in Eastern Townships (ET) before 2010, Lyme disease incidence rate reached 52 confirmed cases per 100 000 in some districts in 2018, leading to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendation by public health. To improve access to PEP, community pharmacists can now screen and initiate PEP under a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) with the regional Medical Officer of Health. Knowledge, attitudes and practices of pharmacists regarding Lyme disease PEP were surveyed after implementation of this measure. Description of the problem: 312 community pharmacists practicing in ET were invited, in October 2018, to complete an online survey, based on Godin’s integrative model (2012), with questions on professional characteristics, knowledge of CPA, attitudes about PEP, and facilitators and barriers to the use of CPA. Pharmacist’s practices were evaluated using 8 clinical vignettes. Vignette-specific and a global score were calculated. Bivariate analyses were done to test the association between global score and knowledge, attitudes, facilitators and barriers. Results: Response rate was 13.8%. Most pharmacists knew (97.4%) and were in favor (93.1%) of the CPA, and believed it was effective to prevent Lyme disease (96.4%). The main barriers reported to using the CPA were related to the assessment of PEP criteria. With regards to practice, pharmacists answered correctly for clients presenting all criteria for PEP (80.6%), aged &lt; 8 y.o. (51.6%), who had their tick removed for &gt;72 hrs (67.7%), already presenting with symptoms (32.3%) or who had exposure in a non-endemic area (38.7%). Finally, none of the variables studied were associated with the global score. Lessons: This measure has now been expanded in other endemic regions in Quebec and a provincial CPA is under development. These results will help guide the development of the provincial CPA, specifically to better consider and to provide guidance regarding PEP contraindications. Key messages: Pharmacist-initiated PEP is an innovative approach to increase timely population access to an essential preventive measure in the fight against Lyme disease in endemic districts. Additional guidance is required for pharmacists with regards to assessment of PEP criteria in future CPAs."

He was empirically started on intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected Lyme carditis, which subsequently led to the resolution of high-degree heart block. Lyme immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgM returned positive. Follow-up ECG after the course of antibiotic exhibited normal sinus rhythm. AF is a rare presentation of Lyme disease but still exists. It should be considered in terms of appropriate treatment, especially in Lyme-endemic areas."

Methods: Testing data performed at Quest Diagnostics during 2010 to 2016 were analyzed nationally and at the state level. Results: Testing and positivity for most NLTBIs increased dramatically from 2010 through 2016 based on testing from a large reference laboratory. The number of positive cases, though not as stringent as criteria for public health reporting, generally exceeds that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The frequency of NLTBI in the US is seasonal but testing activity and positive test results are observed throughout all months of the year. Positive results for NLTBI testing mostly originated from a limited number of states, indicating the geographic concentration and distribution of NLTBIs reported in this study. Conclusions: This report provides an important complementary source of data to best understand trends in and spread of NLTBI."

		"abstract": "<i>Abstract.</i>Ã¢â‚¬â€Anadromous Sea Lamprey <i>Petromyzon marinus</i> spawning runs in the Connecticut River and other streams in the state of Connecticut, USA were decimated by the construction of dams, which were built from 1720 to 1920 for a variety of reasons, notably hydropower. Many of these dams blocked migratory routes to spawning grounds. Government fish management programs begun in the 1960s and 1970s to restore other anadromous species to the Connecticut River did not initially target Sea Lamprey for restoration. The installation of fishways intended for Atlantic Salmon <i>Salmo salar</i> and American Shad <i>Alosa sapidissima</i> at barrier dams resulted in coincidental upstream passage of Sea Lamprey. The public knew about the destructive invasion by Sea Lamprey into the Great Lakes and initially questioned the wisdom of letting Sea Lamprey move upstream into areas where they were not present. The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CTDEEP) engaged in a public education campaign to inform about the benefits of Sea Lamprey restoration, which include increased biodiversity and forage base for other fish species, importation of marine-derived nutrients into the freshwater ecosystems, and beneficial physical habitat modification through nest building. By the 1990s, the species was officially targeted for restoration, reflecting evolving public perceptions and state agenciesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ embrace of increased biodiversity as a program goal. The CTDEEP pursued Sea Lamprey restoration in other watersheds in addition to the Connecticut River watershed. The main strategies for restoration have been provision of fish passage, transplantation, and public education. Restoration efforts have succeeded in increasing the number of adult Sea Lampreys in specific watersheds and expanding their geographical range within these watersheds. Monitoring and research have advanced our knowledge of anadromous Sea Lamprey, including details of the juvenile and adult migrations. Results in Connecticut suggest that individual Sea Lampreys will move upstream beyond any pheromone signal when the run has been previously established in that river below the dam, but they tend not to enter a river from the ocean without a pheromone signal. Many reasons exist why Sea Lamprey runs expanded into vacant habitat more quickly than other anadromous species, but the fact that Sea Lampreys do not home to natal rivers has limited the subsequent increase of the Connecticut River annual run. Lessons learned include specific tools for restoring Sea Lamprey, how to combat negative public perceptions of a parasitic animal, and how to promote support for restoring runs of ecologically valuable but uncharismatic species."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Early confirmatory diagnosis remains a challenge, while the disease can be debilitating if left untreated. Further, the decision to test is complicated by under-reporting, low positive predictive values of testing in non-endemic areas and travel, which together exacerbate the difficulty in identification of newly endemic areas or areas of emerging concern. Spatio-temporal analyses at the national scale are critical to establishing a baseline human LD risk assessment tool that would allow for the detection of changes in these areas. A well-established surrogate for human LD incidence is canine LD seroprevalence, making it a strong candidate covariate for use in such analyses. In this paper, Bayesian statistical methods were used to fit a spatio-temporal spline regression model to estimate the relationship between human LD incidence and canine seroprevalence, treating the latter as an explanatory covariate. A strong non-linear monotonically increasing association was found. That is, this analysis suggests that mean incidence in humans increases with canine seroprevalence until the seroprevalence in dogs reaches approximately 30%. This finding reinforces the use of canines as sentinels for human LD risk, especially with respect to identifying geographic areas of concern for potential human exposure."

Previous research has examined the potential role of climate change on the disease’s expansion, but no studies have considered the role of future land cover upon its distribution. This research examines Lyme disease risk in the south-eastern U.S. based on projected land cover developed under four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scenarios: A1B, A2, B1, and B2. Land cover types and edge indices significantly associated with Lyme disease in Virginia were incorporated into a spatial Poisson regression model to quantify potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease in the south-eastern U.S. under each scenario. Our results indicate an intensification of potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease under the A scenarios and a decrease of potential land cover suitability under the B scenarios. The decrease under the B scenarios is a critical result, indicating that Lyme disease risk can be decreased by making different land cover choices. Additionally, health officials can focus efforts in projected high incidence areas."

Despite typical symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash, sometimes we cannot find those due to the lack of physician consultation in those early stages. If this disease is left untreated, infection could spread to the nervous system causing neuroborreliosis, an atypical and complicated manifestation of this disease. We present the case of an atypical papillitis, probably caused by this bacterium. We suspected this because of the results on the indirect test bloods and the improvement of the symptoms after treatment. This entity should be considered as a possible diagnosis of atypical optical neuropathies, particularly if it occurs in an endemic area."

Among 4157 adults diagnosed with erythema migrans in the period 2009–2018, 16 (2.6%) patients were receiving TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, etarnecept, golimumab), often in combination with other immunosuppressants, for rheumatic (13 patients) or inflammatory bowel (three patients) disease. Findings in this group were compared with those in 32 sex- and age-matched immunocompetent patients diagnosed with erythema migrans in the same years. In comparison with the control group, the immunocompromised patients had a shorter incubation period (7 vs. 14 days; p = 0.0153), smaller diameter of erythema migrans (10.5 vs. 15.5 cm; p = 0.0014), and more frequent comorbidities other than immune-mediated diseases (62.5% vs. 25%, p = 0.0269), symptoms/signs of disseminated Lyme borreliosis (18.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.0324), and treatment failure (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.0094). After retreatment with an antibiotic, the clinical course of Lyme borreliosis resolved. Continuing TNF inhibitor treatment during concomitant borrelial infection while using identical approaches for antibiotic treatment as in immunocompetent patients resulted in more frequent failure of erythema migrans treatment in patients receiving TNF inhibitors. However, the majority of treatment failures were mild, and the course and outcome of Lyme borreliosis after retreatment with antibiotics was favourable."

		"abstract": "Background: Approximately 300,000 cases of Lyme disease occur annually in the UNITED STATES, with children aged 5–9 years disproportionately affected. A single dose of doxycycline administered within 72 hours of a high-risk tick bite is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent Lyme disease in areas of high incidence. However, it is not known how often or for which patients PEP is used. We aimed to describe recent patterns of single-dose doxycycline medication claims in states with high and low Lyme disease incidence, and the associated patient and prescription characteristics in a large national commercial insurance claims database. Methods: Outpatient medication claims in the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Database®, a large nation-wide database of de-identified insurance claims filed between January 1, 2014–December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Claims of single-dose doxycycline were identified and associated patient demographics and medication characteristics were analyzed. Results: During 2014–2017, 66,210 medication claims for single-dose doxycycline were filed by 63,112 enrollees; mean annual incidence of receiving at least one single-dose doxycycline prescription was 56 per 100,000 enrollees. Mean patient age was 43 years (IQR 33–56 years); only 8% were for children aged <18 years. About half (46%) were male patients. Most claims (71%) were made by patients residing in the 14 states with high Lyme disease incidence, defined as an average annual incidence of ≥ 10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population. The majority (80%) of medication claims were during the 6 months of peak tick activity (April–July for nymphal ticks and October–November for adult ticks). Conclusion: Single-dose doxycycline medication claims are common in states with high Lyme disease incidence and are highest during months of peak tick activity, consistent with the assumption that most single-dose doxycycline is used for Lyme disease PEP. Use of single-dose doxycycline to prevent Lyme disease is infrequent in children, despite being a group at high risk for Lyme disease. Efforts to educate pediatric healthcare providers and parents should be made to increase Lyme disease PEP access for children. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

		"abstract": "This study examines potential challenges facing Lyme disease patients in Canada’s Maritime provinces—New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island—and considers how issues could be addressed. Reviews of both the academic and grey literature are complemented by surveys targeting both medical professionals and decision makers in government. Combined, the literature reviews and surveys demonstrate that there is considerable debate surrounding the effectiveness of testing, treatment options, and the existence of chronic Lyme disease. As the focus on the Maritimes demonstrates, these debates often pit the medical community against patients and patient advocates and, thus far, governments have been unable to produce policy that entirely pleases either side. Moving forward, this study recommends the creation of a discussion forum via a federal Commission of inquiry to review best practise guidelines for Lyme disease. The key is to foster an unbiased probe of central issues surrounding treatment and diagnosis without alienating stakeholders. This course of action will not necessarily solve the issue of Lyme disease, but would foster a greater understanding through dialogue that includes and validates the experiences of stakeholders, which is something that is currently missing."

Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central line. The line had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broad-spectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. The long duration of antibiotic use and presence of a central venous catheter predisposed the patient to this infection. Patients should be counseled regarding the serious risks of long courses of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics via central venous catheters to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Background: Diagnosing Lyme disease often involves laboratory evaluation, yet available tests have limitations. Serology remains negative for weeks after infection occurs, and may then remain positive for years. Borrelia burgdorferi blood PCR testing has low sensitivity, rendering it unhelpful. We sought to determine whether an emerging technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA), can detect B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with erythema migrans (EM). Methods: Patients aged 1–17 years with a clinically-identified single or multiple EM were enrolled. Two clinical investigators were required to agree on the EM finding, with no evidence of an alternative diagnosis. Subjects were excluded if they previously had Lyme disease, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to enrollment, or if the rash had resolved before the first blood draw. Three blood samples were taken during the study period: one before antibiotics were administered, then 1–3 weeks and 2–3 months later. At enrollment, plasma was tested for Lyme disease using C6 antibody with reflex to Western Blot and mcfDNA sequencing (Karius, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Briefly, mcfDNA was extracted from plasma and NGS performed. Human reads were removed and remaining sequences were aligned to a curated microbial database. Only mcfDNA testing was performed at follow-up visits. Results: We enrolled 5 subjects (ages 4–15 years old, median age 4). Four subjects had a single EM and negative Lyme serology. One subject had approximately 20 EMs and positive serology (C6-antibody=7.52 (Positive >1.09), 3/3 IgM, 2/10 IgG). All 14 plasma samples, including five pre- and nine post-antibiotic samples, were negative for B. burgdorferi DNA by mcfDNA sequencing. No other infections, including other tick-borne infections, were detected. Conclusion: NGS of mcfDNA did not identify B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with active EM rashes. This approach is unlikely to be helpful in diagnosing early localized Lyme disease. This may be because spirochetes are localized to the periphery of the rash in EM and spirochetemia likely occurs at later stages of infection. Follow-up studies are planned to investigate how NGS of mcfDNA performs during early and late disseminated Lyme disease. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

We sought to identify clinical and treatment factors associated with pediatric ARLA. Methods.: We performed a case-control study in 3 pediatric rheumatology clinics in a Lyme-endemic region (2000–2013). Eligible children were aged ≤ 18 years with arthritis and had positive testing for Lyme disease by Western blot. Cases were 49 children with persistently active arthritis despite ≥ 8 weeks of oral antibiotics or ≥ 2 weeks of parenteral antibiotics; controls were 188 children whose arthritis resolved within 3 months of starting antibiotics. We compared preselected demographic, clinical, and treatment factors between groups using logistic regression. Results.: Characteristics positively associated with ARLA were age ≥ 10 years, prolonged arthritis at diagnosis, knee-only arthritis, and worsening after starting antibiotics. In contrast, children with fever, severe pain, or other signs of systemic inflammation were more likely to respond quickly to treatment. Secondarily, low-dose amoxicillin and treatment nonadherence were also linked to higher risk of ARLA. Greater antibiotic use for children with ARLA was accompanied by higher rates of treatment-associated adverse events (37% vs 15%) and resultant hospitalization (6% vs 1%). Conclusion.: Older children and those with prolonged arthritis, arthritis limited to the knees, or poor initial response to antibiotics are more likely to have antibiotic-refractory disease and treatment-associated toxicity. Children with severe symptoms of systemic inflammation have more favorable outcomes. For children with persistently active Lyme arthritis after 2 antibiotic courses, pediatricians should consider starting antiinflammatory treatment and referring to a pediatric rheumatologist."

Here we present the case of a 24-year-old Second Lieutenant, a recent graduate from the United States Military Academy, with a history of Lyme disease who developed recurrent knee effusions following surgery to correct a hip impingement. Although gonococcal arthritis was initially suspected from preliminary laboratory results, a comprehensive evaluation contradicted this diagnosis. Despite antibiotic therapy, aspiration of the effusions, and steroid treatment to control inflammation, the condition of the patient deteriorated to the point where he was found to be unfit for duty and subsequently discharged from active military service. This case illustrates the profound effect that latent Lyme disease can have on the quality of life and the career of an active duty military member. It highlights the need for increased surveillance for Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) in military training areas and for the early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of military personnel who present with the symptoms of acute Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Objective.: To determine whether second-line intraarticular glucocorticoid (IAGC) injection improves outcomes in children with persistently active Lyme arthritis after initial antibiotics. Methods.: We conducted an observational comparative effectiveness study through chart review within 3 pediatric rheumatology centers with distinct clinical approaches to second-line treatment of Lyme arthritis. We primarily compared children receiving second-line IAGC to children receiving a second course of antibiotics alone. We evaluated the risk of developing antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis (ARLA) using logistic regression and the time to clinical resolution of Lyme arthritis using Cox regression. Results.: Of 112 children with persistently active Lyme arthritis after first-line antibiotics, 18 children received second-line IAGC (13 with concomitant oral antibiotics). Compared to children receiving second-line oral antibiotics alone, children treated with IAGC had similar baseline characteristics but lower rates of ARLA (17% vs 44%; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1–0.95; p = 0.04) and faster rates of clinical resolution (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–3.9; p = 0.01). Children in IAGC and oral antibiotic cohorts did not differ in treatment-associated adverse events. Among children receiving second-line IAGC, outcomes appeared similar irrespective of use of concomitant antibiotics. Outcomes were also similar between intravenous (IV) and oral antibiotic-treated cohorts, but older children seemed to respond more favorably to IV therapy. IV antibiotics were also associated with higher rates of toxicity. Conclusion.: IAGC injection appears to be an effective and safe second-line strategy for persistent Lyme arthritis in children, associated with rapid clinical resolution and reduced need for additional treatment."

Methods:: A retrospective study in our university hospital between 1 May 2003 and 31 July 2016 on 1006 uveitis patients and review of Pubmed library. Results:: Seven patients (71.4% male, mean age = 53 (38–70)) were diagnosed with a Lyme-associated uveitis. All anatomical types of uveitis were found (four intermediate, three anterior, and three posterior uveitis); most were unilateral (n = 6; 85.7%), one granulomatous and two with synechiae. Peripheral retinal vasculitis was present in four patients. They all had a risk of exposure or extra-ophthalmological symptoms. Antibiotic and steroid treatment was rapidly effective in all patients. Four patients presented recurrences of uveitis, of whom two received a second antibiotic treatment, which is quite common in literature. Persistent or recurrence of symptoms can be explained by three hypotheses: (1) reinfection, (2) relapse of original infection, and (3) autoimmune reaction. Conclusion:: Lyme-associated uveitis appears varied. Hyalitis and involvement of the posterior segment and retinal vasculitis seem to be rather frequent. Its prognosis is mainly good, even if inflammation can be resistant or recurring."

		"abstract": "The aim was to determine the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in patients with Lyme disease (LD), and to estimate the contribution of factors that may identify TMD among LD patients. In seventy-six (N = 76) adult patients with LD (mean age 57.6 ± 14.6 years) and 54 healthy non-Lyme volunteers with a mean age of 56.4 ± 13.5 years, possible function (i.e., non-pain) diagnoses were established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria of Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Pain diagnoses were established by means of the function-dependent dynamic and static tests. The two groups did not significantly differ in the frequency of disc displacements diagnoses and function-dependent pain diagnoses. LD showed a significantly higher frequency (p < 0.001) of osteoarthrosis than the control group. For the prediction of pain diagnoses in LD patients, the single regression analyses pointed out an association with age, sleep bruxism (SB), and awake bruxism (AB). Two predictors (i.e., SB (p = 0.002) and AB (p = 0.017)) were statistically significant in the final multiple variable model. The frequency of TMD in patients with LD based on function-dependent tests was not significantly different from that in the control group. This investigation suggests that the contribution of bruxism to the differentiation between patients with Lyme and TMD is high."

		"abstract": "Objective:: This study explores a suspected increasing incidence of Lyme arthritis in the Western New York pediatric population. In addition, we aim to describe a clinical picture of Lyme arthritis and the clinical features that distinguish it from other forms of arthritis. Methods:: Patients diagnosed with Lyme arthritis between January 2014 and September 2018 were identified using International Classification of Diseases—10th Revision (ICD 10) codes for Lyme disease and Lyme arthritis. Patients were included in the study if they (1) exhibited arthritis, (2) tested positive for Lyme antibodies, and (3) exhibited a positive Western blot. Results:: A total of 22 patients were included in the study. There was a general trend toward an increasing number of cases of Lyme arthritis over the 45-month observation period. We identified 1 case in each 2014 and 2015, 4 cases in 2016, 7 in 2017, and 9 in the first 9 months of 2018. In total, 17 patients had arthritis as their only symptom at the time of diagnosis and 10 patients had a rash or a history that prompted suspicion of Lyme disease. The knee was the most frequent joint (86.4% of patients), and patients typically had 2 or fewer joints affected (86.4% of patients). Conclusions:: A significant increase ( P = .02) in Lyme arthritis cases was observed at Oishei Children’s Hospital of Buffalo. Lyme arthritis may clinically present similarly to other forms of arthritis, such as oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so health care providers should be aware of distinguishing clinical features, which include rapid onset of swelling and patient age. Because the geographic area of endemic Lyme disease is expanding, all health care providers need to be aware of Lyme arthritis as a possible diagnosis."

Treatment lengths in clinical practice tend to exceed the recommendations. Most patients experience a rapid improvement of symptoms and neurological findings within days of treatment, but some report long-term complaints. The underlying mechanisms of remaining complaints are debated, and theories as ongoing chronic infection with Methods and analysis: The trial has a multicentre, non-inferiority, double-blinded design. One hundred and twenty patients diagnosed with LNB according to European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS)guidelines will be randomised to 6 or 2 weeks treatment with oral doxycycline. The patients will be followed for 12 months. The primary endpoint is improvement on a composite clinical score (CCS) from baseline to 6 months after inclusion. Secondary endpoints are improvements in the CCS 12 months after inclusion, fatigue scored on Fatigue Severity Scale, subjective symptoms on the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 scale, health-related quality of life scored on RAND 36-item short form health survey and safety as measured by side effects of the two treatment arms. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are collected from inclusion and throughout the follow-up and a biobank will be established. The study started including patients in November 2015 and will continue throughout December 2019. Ethics and dissemination: The study is approved by the Norwegian regional committees for medical and health research ethics and the Norwegian Medicines Agency. Data from the study will be published in peer-reviewed medical journals. Trial registration number: 2015-001481-25"

Methods: Data were collected during the Persistent Lyme Empiric Antibiotic Study Europe (PLEASE) trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Study participants passed performance-validity testing (measure for detecting suboptimal effort) and had persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis. All patients received a 2-week open-label regimen of intravenous ceftriaxone before the 12-week blinded oral regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline and after 14, 26, and 40 weeks with neuropsychological tests covering the cognitive domains of episodic memory, attention/working memory, verbal fluency, speed of information processing, and executive function. Results: Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled (n = 239) were comparable in all treatment groups. After 14 weeks, performance on none of the cognitive domains differed significantly between the treatment arms ( Conclusions: A 2-week treatment with ceftriaxone followed by a 12-week regimen of doxycycline or clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine did not lead to better cognitive performance compared to a 2-week regimen of ceftriaxone in patients with Lyme disease–attributed persistent symptoms. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01207739. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that longer-term antibiotics in patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms does not increase cognitive performance compared to shorter-term antibiotics."

However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory / attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% ( Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment.

On the other hand, intracellular bacteria, such as Borrelia burgdorferi, utilize host lipids to survive and disseminate within the host. Recent data suggest that elevated lipids are a contributing factor to the maintenance and severity of Lyme disease and its complications. Here we review and discuss the role of lipids in Borreliosis and report on a pilot trial to examine the potential roles of circulating lipids and lipoproteins in patients with Borrelia infection. In this analysis we assessed the clinical and lipid profiles of 519 patients (319 women, 200 men) with a proven history of Lyme disease, before and after an extracorporeal double membrane filtration. Lipid profiles pre- and post-apheresis were analyzed in conjunction with clinical symptoms and parameters of inflammation. Circulating cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, LP(a), and other inflammatory lipids were significantly reduced after the apheresis, while symptoms of the disorder and bioindexes of inflammation such as CRP improved. Further studies should be initiated to investigate the possibly causal relation between Lyme disease and circulating lipids and to design appropriate therapeutic strategies."

The study objective was to assess incidence and patient characteristics of facial palsy due to LNB. Hospital records were reviewed of adult patients with facial palsy visiting the departments of neurology and/or otorhinolaryngology of Gelre hospitals between June 2007 and December 2017. Gelre hospitals are located in an area endemic for Lyme borreliosis. Patients with LNB had pleocytosis and intrathecal antibody production or pleocytosis with positive IgG serology. Patients with IFP had negative serology. Clinical characteristics were compared between patients with LNB and patients with IFP. Five hundred and fifty-nine patients presented with facial palsy, 4.7% (26) had LNB and 39.4% (220) IFP. The incidence of facial palsy due to LNB was 0.9/100 000 inhabitants/year. Over 70% of patients with facial palsy due to LNB did not report a recent tick bite and/or erythema migrans (EM). Patients with facial palsy due to LNB presented more often in July to September (69.2%"

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease, but its clinical consequences remain uncertain. We conducted a systematic review of the long-term sequelae and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with LD in North America and Europe. We performed searches in 6 electronic databases up to December 2018 following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including observational studies reporting long-term sequelae, HRQoL, and prognostic factors. We included 46 studies, published between 1994 and 2019. Based on 21 studies reporting attributable outcomes, higher proportions of sequelae reported from exposed patients were: neck pain, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, sleep disorder, poor appetite, and concentration difficulties. Patients with PTLDS reported impaired HRQoL compared to the general US population. Included studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study design, settings, patient characteristics, and quality. Patients with LD are more likely to report nonspecific long-term sequelae, especially those experiencing persistent symptoms posttreatment. Opportunities exist for prospective longitudinal studies to better understand LD outcomes."

		"abstract": "Understanding risk factors for the spread of infectious diseases over time and across the landscape is critical for managing disease risk. While habitat connectivity and characteristics of local and neighboring animal (i.e., host) assemblages are known to influence the spread of diseases, the interactions among these factors remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a county-level analysis to test the effects of forest connectivity, together with the suitability of local assemblage (measured by the similarity of local host assemblage with neighboring assemblages) and the infection intensity of neighboring counties on the spatial expansion of Lyme disease in the United States. Our results suggested that both the similarity of local host assemblage and the infection intensity of neighboring counties were positively correlated with the probability of disease spread. Moreover, we found that increasing forest connectivity could facilitate the positive effect of neighbor infection intensity. In contrast, the effect size of the host assemblage similarity decreased with increasing connectivity, suggesting that host assemblage similarity was less effective in well-connected habitats. Our results thus indicate that habitat connectivity can indirectly influence disease spread by mediating the effects of other risk factors."

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of patients referred to an academic center with a presumed diagnosis or concern for Lyme disease between 2000 and 2013 was performed to analyze diagnoses and treatments. Characteristics of those with Lyme disease and those misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease were compared. Results: Of 1261 patients, 911 (72.2%) did not have Lyme disease, 184 (14.6%) had active or recent Lyme disease, 150 (11.9%) had a remote history of Lyme disease, and 16 (1.3%) were identified as having possible Lyme disease. Patients without current Lyme disease were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–2.45), to have had symptoms for &gt;3 months (OR, 8.78; 95% CI, 5.87–13.1), to have higher symptom counts (OR per additional symptom, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13), to have had more Lyme-related laboratory testing (OR per additional laboratory test, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.32), and to have been diagnosed with what were regarded as coinfections (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14–8.57). Of the 911 patients without Lyme disease, 764 (83.9%) had received antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease or their coinfections. The percentage of patients established to have Lyme disease was lower than in earlier studies of referred populations. Conclusions: Among patients referred to an academic Infectious Diseases practice for Lyme disease, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment were common, both for Lyme disease and for coinfections."

Maine, USA, is a high Lyme disease incidence state, with rising incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses associated with increasing I. scapularis abundance and northward range expansion. Members of the public submitted ticks to a tick identification program (1990–2013). From these passive surveillance data, we characterized temporal trends in I. scapularis submission rate (an index of abundance), comparing Maine’s northern tier (seven counties) versus southern tier (nine counties). In the northern tier, the I. scapularis submission rate increased throughout the duration of the time series, suggesting I. scapularis was emergent but not established. By contrast, in the southern tier, submission rate increased initially but leveled off after 10–14 yr, suggesting I. scapularis was established by the mid-2000s. Active (field) surveillance data from a site in the southern tier—bird tick burdens and questing adult tick collections—corroborated this leveling pattern. Lyme disease incidence and I. scapularis submission rate were temporally correlated in the northern but not southern tier. This suggested a decoupling of reported disease incidence and entomological risk."

However, the socio-demographics and geographic distribution of the population affected in England and Wales are poorly understood. Therefore, the proposed study was designed to describe the demographics and distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease from a national testing laboratory. Design: An ecological study of routinely collected laboratory surveillance data. Setting: Public Health England’s national Lyme disease testing laboratory. Participants: 3986 laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease between 2013 and 2016. Results: In England and Wales, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed Lyme disease rose significantly over the study period from 1.62 cases per 100 000 in 2013 to 1.95 cases per 100 000 in 2016. There was a bimodal age distribution (with peaks at 6–10 and 61–65 years age bands) with a predominance of male patients. A significant clustering of areas with high Lyme disease incidence was located in southern England. An association was found between disease incidence and socioeconomic status, based on the patient’s resident postcode, with more cases found in less deprived areas. Cases were disproportionately found in rural areas compared with the national population distribution. Conclusions: These results suggest that Lyme disease patients originate from areas with higher socioeconomic status and disproportionately in rural areas. Identification of the Lyme disease hotspots in southern England, alongside the socio-demographics described, will enable a targeted approach to public health interventions and messages."

The majority of cases occur in the Northeast and upper-Midwest, and the number and geographic distribution of cases is steadily increasing. The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say) is the principal vector of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto) in eastern North America. Although Lyme disease risk has been studied in residential and recreational settings across rural to urban landscapes including metropolitan areas, risk within U.S. cities has not been adequately evaluated despite the presence of natural and undeveloped public parkland where visitors could be exposed to B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis. We studied the occurrence of I. scapularis and infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in four insular regional parks within the city of Pittsburgh to assess Lyme disease risk of exposure to infected adults and nymphs. We found that the density of I. scapularis adults (1.16 ± 0.21 ticks/100 m2) and nymphs (3.42 ± 0.45 ticks/100 m2), infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in adults (51.9%) and nymphs (19.3%), and density of infected adults (0.60 ticks/100 m2) and nymphs (0.66 ticks/100 m2) are as high in these city parks as nonurban residential and recreational areas in the highly endemic coastal Northeast. These findings emphasize the need to reconsider, assess, and manage Lyme disease risk in greenspaces within cities, especially in high Lyme disease incidence states."

In the Midwest, an additional Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia mayonii, was recorded from naturally infected I. scapularis and P. leucopus. However, an experimental demonstration of reservoir competence was lacking for a natural tick host. We therefore experimentally infected P. leucopus with B. mayonii via I. scapularis nymphal bites and then fed uninfected larvae on the mice to demonstrate spirochete acquisition and passage to resulting nymphs. Of 23 mice fed on by B. mayonii-infected nymphs, 21 (91%) developed active infections. The infection prevalence for nymphs fed as larvae on these infected mice 4 wk post-infection ranged from 56 to 98%, and the overall infection prevalence for 842 nymphs across all 21 P. leucopus was 75% (95% confidence interval, 72–77%). To assess duration of infectivity, 10 of the P. leucopus were reinfested with uninfected larval ticks 12 wk after the mice were infected. The overall infection prevalence for 480 nymphs across all 10 P. leucopus at the 12-wk time point was 26% (95% confidence interval, 23–31%), when compared with 76% (95% confidence interval, 71–79%) for 474 nymphs from the same subset of 10 mice at the 4-wk time point. We conclude that P. leucopus is susceptible to infection with B. mayonii via bite by I. scapularis nymphs and an efficient reservoir for this Lyme disease spirochete."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), caused by the tick-borne spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, has been suggested to be associated with a range of neurological disorders. In a nationwide, population-based cohort study, we examined the associations between LNB and dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, motor neuron disease, epilepsy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Methods: We used national registers to identify all Danish residents diagnosed during 1986–2016 with LNB (n = 2067), created a gender- and age-matched comparison cohort from the general population (n = 20 670), and calculated risk estimates and hazard ratios. Results: We observed no long-term increased risks of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, motor neuron diseases, or epilepsy. However, within the first year, 8 (0.4%) of the LNB patients developed epilepsy, compared with 20 (0.1%) of the comparison cohort (difference, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, .02–.6%). In the LNB group, 11 (0.5%) patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome within the first year after LNB diagnosis, compared with 0 (0.0%) in the comparison cohort. After the first year, the risk of Guillain-Barré was not increased. Conclusions: LNB patients did not have increased long-term risks of dementia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, motor neuron diseases, epilepsy, or Guillain-Barré. Although the absolute risk is low, LNB patients might have an increased short-term risk of epilepsy and Guillain-Barré syndrome."

Based on data on the density of host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks and pathogen prevalence and using a variety of environmental data, we have created an acarological risk model for a region where both diseases are endemic (Czech Republic—South Bohemia and Germany—Lower Bavaria, Upper Palatinate). The data on tick density were acquired by flagging 50 sampling sites three times in a single season. Prevalence of the causative agents of LB and TBE was determined. Data on environmental variables (e.g., altitude, vegetation cover, NDVI, land surface temperature) were obtained from various sources and processed using geographical information systems. Generalized linear models were used to estimate tick density, probability of tick infection, and density of infected ticks for the whole area. A significantly higher incidence of human TBE cases was recorded in South Bohemia compared to Bavarian regions, which correlated with a lower tick density in Bavaria. However, the differences in pathogen prevalence rates were not significant. The model outputs were made available to the public in the form of risk maps, indicating the distribution of tick-borne disease risk in space."

All the ticks that showed either positive or negative reactions to attractants in the experiment were individually PCR-tested for B. burgdorferi s.l DNA.The percent of Borrelia - positive specimen among hungry active adult I. ricinus and I. persulcatus ticks was higher than that among hungry passive ones. The discovered infection of I. persulcatus females by B. burgdorferi s. l. was 56% from which 67% were active and 36% were passive ticks. Total infection of adult ticks was 45% (61% active, 24% passive ticks). Infection of I. ricinus females was 60%, 69% in active individuals and 48% in passive, total infection of adult ticks was 56% (70% in active, 43% in passive). Synthetic kyromonas (attractant) composed of 1-octen-3-ol and a mixture of ethyl myristate-methyl salicylate (1:1), simulated the odour of the host in the experiment, attracted up to 70% of adults of I. ricinus and up to 80% of I. persulcatus. It can be assumed that this percent of adult ticks reflect an overall number of individuals searching for a hosts during the season of activity in natural biotopes."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease, caused by some Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, is the most common tick-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere and the number of cases, and geographic spread, continue to grow. Previously identified B. burgdorferi proteins, lipid immunogens, and live mutants lead the design of canonical vaccines aimed at disrupting infection in the host. Discovery of the mechanism of action of the first vaccine catalyzed the development of new strategies to control Lyme disease that bypassed direct vaccination of the human host. Thus, novel prevention concepts center on proteins produced by B. burgdorferi during tick transit and on tick proteins that mediate feeding and pathogen transmission. A burgeoning area of research is tick immunity as it can unlock mechanistic pathways that could be targeted for disruption. Studies that shed light on the mammalian immune pathways engaged during tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection would further development of vaccination strategies against Lyme disease."
