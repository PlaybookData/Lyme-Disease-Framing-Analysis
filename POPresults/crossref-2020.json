		"abstract": "<p>Lyme borreliosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> sensu lato, a spirochaetal agent transmitted by certain species of <italic>Ixodes</italic> ticks. Small rodents and birds serve as reservoirs. It is the most common vector-borne infection in the United States of America and an important infection in many countries throughout the temperate regions of Europe and northern Asia, where a wider variety of borrelia species account for differences in clinical manifestations in Eurasia compared with the United States. The most common and earliest clinical manifestation is erythema migrans, a distinctive cutaneous lesion that occurs at the site of deposition of the spirochaete by the vector tick. Most people treated for Lyme borreliosis respond well to a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for patients who have or develop subjective complaints of unclear aetiology despite successful resolution of the objective manifestation of Lyme borreliosis following antibiotic therapy.</p>"

At the completion of therapy, all three patients major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25-30 months. In conclusion, Double dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS, especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement ‘I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves ‘outdoorsy’, results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

		"abstract": "Three patients with multi-year histories of relapsing and remitting Lyme disease and associated co-infections despite extended antibiotic therapy were each given double-dose dapsone combination therapy (DDD CT) for a total of 7–8 weeks. At the completion of therapy, all three patients’ major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25–30 months. A retrospective chart review of 37 additional patients undergoing DDD CT therapy (40 patients in total) was also performed, which demonstrated tick-borne symptom improvements in 98% of patients, with 45% remaining in remission for 1 year or longer. In conclusion, double-dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), caused by infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne infection in many regions of Eurasia. Antibody detection is the most frequently used laboratory test, favoring a two-step serodiagnostic algorithm; immunoenzymatic detection of antibodies to C6 has been shown to perform similarly to a standard two-step workflow. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of the C6 Lyme ELISA kit compared to a standard two-step algorithm in three laboratories located in the northeastern region of Italy which cater to areas with different LD epidemiology. A total of 804 samples were tested, of which 695 gave concordant results between C6 testing and routine workflow (564 negative, 131 positive). Wherever available, clinical presentation and additional laboratory tests were analyzed to solve discrepancies. The C6 based method showed a good concordance with the standard two-step algorithm (Cohen’s κ = 0.619), however, the distribution of discrepancies seems to point towards a slightly lower specificity of C6 testing, which is supported by literature and could impact on patient management. The C6 ELISA, therefore, is not an ideal stand-alone test; however, if integrated into a two-step algorithm, it might play a part in achieving a sensitive, specific laboratory diagnosis of LD."

		"abstract": "Infections with spirochetes (Borelia burgdoferi) occur through contact with ticks (Ixodes ricinus) found in forests, meadows, lawns, in bushes, most often from May to September. The risk of developing Lyme disease after a single tick bite does not exceed 1%. Clinically overt disease develops usually after 0.3-1.4% bites. Lyme disease may affect many organs and is chronic. Symptoms may include skin, eyes, nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive and urogenital system. Cardiovascular system involvement occurs, according to va­rious reports, in 0.5 to 10% of cases. Men are sick more often than women, young patients predominate, < 50 years old. The clinical onset is acute and atrioventricular conduction disturbances are most commonly diagnosed (80-90% of cases). Atrioventricular blocks: first (>70%), second (30%) and third (70%) degree may occur. There are also descriptions of cardiac arrhythmias – both supraventricular and ventricular – as well as cases of prolonged QT interval, especially in children. Identification of patients who are more likely to have a third degree atrioventricular block in Lyme disease is critical to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. In most patients, antibiotic treatment helps to avoid the use of permanent cardiac pacing, but 20-50% of patients may need temporary pacing. In patients quickly, correctly diagnosed and treated – the prognosis is good."

		"abstract": "Over the past four decades, Lyme disease has remained a virulent and pervasive illness, persisting throughout North America and many other regions of the world. Recent increases in illness in many countries has sparked a renewed interest in improved Lyme diagnostics. While current standards of diagnosis are acceptable for the late stages of the disease, it remains difficult to accurately diagnose early forms of the illness. In addition, current diagnostic methods tend to be relatively expensive and require a large degree of laboratory-based analysis. Biosensors represent the fusion of biological materials with chemical techniques to provide simple, inexpensive alternatives to traditional diagnostic methods. Lyme disease biosensors have the potential to better diagnose early stages of the illness and provide possible patients with an inexpensive, commercially available test. This review examines the current state of Lyme disease biosensing, with a focus on previous biosensor development and essential future considerations."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden."

		"abstract": "Introduction: The incidence of tick-borne diseases in Poland and Europe is increasing which is considered to be due to climate warming which promotes the growth of tick populations. Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent leptospirosis in the US and Europe. Due to the potential for serious complications and the lack of specific prevention, diagnostic vigilance is essential so as to ensure early diagnosis and implementation of treatment. The main pathogen-transmitting vector is the tick species Ixodex ricinus. The suborder of ticks (Ixodida) belongs to the Acari subclass of arachnids. The natural reservoir of B. burgdorferi consists of small and medium-sized mammals and birds. Around ¾ of patients with Lyme disease report complaints and present disease symptoms within in the head and neck. The symptoms are diverse and may occur at all stages of the disease. These include headaches, neck pain and stiffness, sore throat, dizziness, cervical lymphadenopathy, otalgia, tinnitus, sudden hearing loss, and facial muscle paresis. Despite numerous papers being published on neurological manifestations of Lyme disease, the issues regarding the location of damage within the course of the auditory pathway and the balance system remain unanswered. In some cases hearing disorders may be due to central damage while others may be due to peripheral damage. Objective: The article provides an overview of reports on the clinical course and manifestation of Lyme borreliosis."

This tick-borne zoonosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and, worldwide, presents with at least 20 different types of rashes. Certain cutaneous rashes are inherently interconnected to various stages of Lyme disease. In this study, five Canadian Lyme disease patients from a multi-age range presented various phases of the acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) rash. In each case of ACA, the underlying etiological pathogen was the Lyme disease spirochete. Although ACA rashes are normally found on the lower extremities, this study illustrates that ACA rashes are not directly correlated with a tick bite, geographic area, age, Bbsl genospecies, exercise, or any given surface area of the body. Case 4 provides confirmation for an ACA rash and gestational Lyme disease. One patient (Case 5) puts forth a Bbsl and Bartonella sp. co-infection with a complex ACA rash. This study documents ACA rashes on Lyme disease patients for the first time in Canada."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-based disease with over 300,000 new cases each year. The current diagnostic system for those with Early Lyme disease is only about 40% accurate. Since the severity of symptoms and probability of recurrence significantly increases as time progresses, there is a need to find a new alternative diagnostic system for Early Lyme disease. Many solutions to this problem are considered within this document, most notably: polymerase chain reaction detection, metabolic biosignature testing, and OspC targeting serological testing. After further analysis, metabolic biosignature testing is considered the best alternative since it yields the highest diagnosis sensitivity with around 89% accuracy. Additionally, metabolic biosignature testing is both cost effective and widely applicable since it does not require the Erythema migran rash to be used. Once in place, Lyme disease will be able to be diagnosed quicker, thus reducing the number of cases of Chronic Lyme disease which significantly reduces personal quality of life and is often costly.

		"abstract": "Despite the constant development of biotechnology, laboratory diagnostics of Lyme disease in children still poses a significant challenge. The aim of this article is to present the current methods of Lyme disease diagnosis and its future perspectives. A serological test is often the first step in supporting clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Recently, a new generation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays has been created. These assays use recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides in their antigenic spectrum. It is postulated that these tests may replace the classic immunoblot as the second step in the Lyme disease diagnostic protocol. Direct detection methods based on bacterial culture techniques or using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have inadequate sensitivity, which prevents their widespread use in clinical practice. Recently, a number of other tools have been developed that are of supportive importance. Among them, measuring of the CXCL13 chemokine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has the potential to become a routine procedure in the diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Future diagnostic strategies of Lyme disease might include: innovative immunological tests using new antigens, combining serology with direct methods in order to increase sensitivity, standardization of selected unconventional tests, identification of host response biochemical metabolic markers or linking clinical symptoms reported by patients with appropriate test panels. In the absence a vaccine which protects against the disease, the preventive recommendations given to parents to prevent tick bites in children remain valid."

		"abstract": "Nowadays Lyme disease (systemic tick-borne borreliosis, Lyme borreliosis) remains one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases with inoculable transmission mechanism, with ixodid ticks as carriers and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato as the causative agent. The disease is characterized by a staged course and severe damage to various organs and systems. In Ukraine, the natural foci of this disease are almost throughout the country. Sumy region occupies a leading place in terms of morbidity. In Ukraine, the most affected regions are Kyiv (29.00 cases per 100 thousand population), Cherkasy (25.4), Vinnytsia (23.9), Sumy (25.89) regions, and Kyiv city (22.54). Lyme disease is mainly registered in the spring-autumn period, this may be due to increased visits to recreation areas and seasonal activity of ticks (May–June, September–October). Scientific data about etiology, epidemiology, clinical course, diagnostics, therapy, and disease preventive measures were analyzed. It was found that B. burgdorferi s. l. is one of the most widespread agents with inoculable transmission mechanism on the European continent, including Ukraine. There is no single worldwide conception concerning preventive measures, diagnostics, and treatment, which necessitates the further study of this problem. Detection of antibodies to B. Burgdorferi s. l. in the human blood serum is not evidence of infection but testifies the previous contact with these pathogens and the presence of high risk of Lyme disease development. To improve the epidemiologic situation concerning Lyme disease it is required to study sites of the disease in Ukraine more thoroughly, to improve epidemiological surveillance system by creating disease spread map for diseases which are transferred by ticks in Sumy region, to plan a series of anti-epidemic and preventive measures, which are of practical use for population, to prevent asymptomatic disease course and chronization."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a vector-borne illness caused by Borrelia spp. bacterium spread by ticks to humans and other mammals. Despite being prevalent in many regions of the world, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the disease, and consensus on the most appropriate and effective means of treating the illness remains to be achieved. Recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), the primary guidelines followed by health care professionals treating Lyme disease, diverge in many of their key recommendations, including treatment duration. Given this lack of consensus, surprisingly little research has been conducted on patient outcomes following different treatment approaches. In this study, patient outcomes were evaluated from a cohort of 210 Canadian Lyme disease patients seeking treatment at one US Lyme disease clinic following a treatment regimen conforming to the ILADS treatment guidelines. It was found that the majority of Lyme disease patients at the clinic responded positively to treatment and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in symptoms was observed over time. This study, along with related studies, may help to guide physicians to provide their patients with the most effective care."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme borreliosis is the most common vectorborne disease in the northern hemisphere. It usually begins with erythema migrans; early disseminated infection particularly causes multiple erythema migrans or neurologic disease, and late manifestations predominantly include arthritis in North America, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) in Europe. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, complemented by serological confirmation of infection once an antibody response has been mounted. Manifestations usually respond to appropriate antibiotic regimens, but the disease can be followed by sequelae, such as immune arthritis or residual damage to affected tissues. A subset of individuals reports persistent symptoms, including fatigue, pain, arthralgia, and neurocognitive symptoms, which in some people are severe enough to fulfil the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of such persistent symptoms following antimicrobial treatment varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Persistent active infection in humans has not been identified as a cause of this syndrome, and randomized treatment trials have invariably failed to show any benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment. For prevention of Lyme borreliosis, post-exposure prophylaxis may be indicated in specific cases, and novel vaccine strategies are under development."

		"abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is at the forefront of global health issues and contributes to myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. Lyme disease (LD), spread by ticks of the genus Ixodes, is a contributing factor to the potential development of abnormalities in the heart. The bacterial agents Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi are known to cause a variety of infections and we speculate that infection with Borrelia is a contributing factor to cardiac abnormalities, especially Lyme carditis (LC). Patients who demonstrate undiagnosed cardiac abnormalities should be monitored for potential infection with Lyme disease and, consequently LC. Lyme carditis affects up to 10% of patients that have been diagnosed with LD and additionally, it indiscriminately manifests across a range of ages, from the pediatric populace to the elderly. Given the grave cardiac abnormalities that can arise from LC and the propensity for misdiagnosis, it is critical that medical professionals be aware of the cardiovascular signs and symptoms of Atrioventricular Heart Block (AHB). AHB can lead to third degree heart block in patients and potentially lead to death if left not properly diagnosed and treated. Essential treatments are readily available for Lyme carditis, which include a range of antibiotics and surgical procedures. In this review, we highlight not only the true nature of Lyme disease, but more importantly, the positive correlation between LD and a variety of undiagnosed heart complications."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a rapidly growing illness that remains poorly understood within the medical community. Critical questions about when and why patients respond to treatment or stay ill, what kinds of treatments are effective, and even how to properly diagnose the disease remain largely unanswered. We investigate these questions by applying machine learning techniques to a large scale Lyme disease patient registry, MyLymeData, developed by the nonprofit LymeDisease.org. We apply various machine learning methods in order to measure the effect of individual features in predicting participants’ answers to the Global Rating of Change (GROC) survey questions that assess the self-reported degree to which their condition improved, worsened, or remained unchanged following antibiotic treatment. We use basic linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks, entropy-based decision tree models, and k-nearest neighbors approaches. We first analyze the general performance of the model and then identify the most important features for predicting participant answers to GROC. After we identify the “key” features, we separate them from the dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of these features at identifying GROC. In doing so, we highlight possible directions for future study both mathematically and clinically."

The aim of this review was to summarize published data on clinical and economic outcomes associated with LD. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify all studies of LD that incorporate both clinical outcomes and costs. Included studies were described and categorized based on costs consistent with best practices used in economic evaluation. Results: The most frequent costs identified focused on formal health costs and productivity losses were the most common costs identified outside of the health system. Travel and informal care costs were less frequently reported. Clinical and economic outcomes of LD are primarily studied through economic models or observational analyses and focus on formal health care. Conclusions: This review provides and overview of existing evidence and recommendations for future economic analyses in LD."

Lyme optic neuritis  is a rare ocular manifestation of Lyme Disease. We report a case of a 13-year-old male patient, previously healthy, with decreased central visual acuity on his both eyes . On examination, best-corrected visual acuity on both eyes was 0,3 LogMar. Anterior segment biomicroscopy showed no inflammatory signs and the intraocular pressure was normal. A fundus examination performed under mydriasis revealed a swollen optic disk on both eyes confirmed by fluorescein angiography. The cerebrospinal fluid examination and Lyme Disease blood findings were positive. The diagnosis of Lyme disease-related optic neuritis was made. Treated with Ceftriaxone and Doxicycline, there was a vision recovery. We can state that isolated bilateral optic neuritis is uncommon and exceptional especially in children during Lyme disease."

With a wide spectrum of possible symptoms, the microbiological diagnosis of this disease is associated with a wide variety of ideas, divergent approaches and much uncertainty. The aim of the article is to introduce the treating physicians to a meaningful microbiological diagnostic procedure. Most important messages include that (I) the suspected diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is first based on anamnestic data and clinical symptoms (compare “case definitions”) which is substantiated by microbiological examinations; (II) microbiological diagnostics – primarily antibody detection, downstream PCR and culture – are only indicated if there are indicative symptoms, with typical erythema migrans not requiring microbiological diagnostics; (III) keep in mind: The more unspecific the symptoms are the lower the positive and the higher the negative predictive value of microbiological testing; (IV) serological diagnosis should follow a two-step procedure: a sensitive ELISA as first step, if reactive followed by immunoblot (IgM and IgG). Detection rates are ca. 50 % in localized, 70– > 90 % in disseminated early and nearly 100 % (only IgG relevant) in late disease; (V) in the immunoblot early forms of disease show a narrow band spectrum, late forms show a broad spectrum; (VI) methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes include lymphocyte activation or transformation tests (LTT, MELISA, ELISPOT), PCR or antigen detection from urine or blood, lymphocyte subpopulations, or direct detection of borreliae from patient material using dark field- or focus floating microscopy."

		"abstract": "Background and objective: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB), is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia. The risk of infection depends on the geographical area, ecological factors, and human behavior. Clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have a wide range, but the most frequent clinical symptom, which is also a diagnostic symptom, is a skin rash called erythema migrans (EM). The disease is very common worldwide. In Lithuania, the disease frequency is 99.9 cases per 100,000 population (Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Lithuania, 2017). The main aim of this study was to obtain the baseline characteristics of the disease regarding the infected Lithuanian population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS about all Lyme disease (A69.2) diagnosed patients over a three-year period (from 2014 to 2016) in Lithuania. Results: In 2014–2016, 7424 (crude incidence rate 85.4) cases with LB were diagnosed in Lithuania. Most of them (4633 (62.4%)) were identified in women. Older people were more likely to suffer from LB. Urban residents were 2.6 times more often affected that those living in villages. Tick bites were primarily observed in high season months, from May to September (90%), with the highest peak in July. There was a higher number of observed tick bites (p = 0.003) in the urban residents. Erythema migrans occurred in 75.6% LB cases, while other symptoms did not exceed a quarter of all LB cases. There were 7353 (99.6%) cases where LB was confirmed via clinical symptoms and/or laboratory tests. Also, 1720 (23.2%) patients were tested for LB immunoglobulins. Conclusions: This study found a high incidence of Lyme disease in Lithuania. We elucidated the baseline characteristics regarding the infected Lithuanian population which may ease medical clinicians’ work on new Lyme diagnoses."

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neuroaxis and a whole body 18F-FDG PET-CT was performed within 48 hours. The MRI revealed a strong contrast enhancement of the conus medullaris and fibers of the cauda equina, while the 18F-FDG PET/CT was without pathological findings. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid led to the definitive diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis with monocytic pleocytosis and a positive intrathecal test for Borrelia burgdorferi. The patient became pain-free after 10 days of ceftriaxone, and the paralysis slowly regressed the following month. This case highlights the difficulty of the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis and discusses the relevant imaging findings."

Sus manifestaciones clínicas son muy variables y se presentan de acuerdo con el estadio clínico de la enfermedad, teniendo así el compromiso ocular un espectro clínico muy variado que incluye manifestaciones desde la superficie ocular hasta la inflamación del segmento posterior. Se presenta el caso de un paciente de 72 años con un viaje reciente a los Estados Unidos (EE. UU.), atendido en la consulta particular por un oftalmólogo supraespecialista en uveítis de la ciudad de Medellín. El paciente hacía un mes refería una disminución de la agudeza visual (AV) en su ojo izquierdo y al examen oftalmológico presentó signos clínicos de panuveítis no granulomatosa asociada a un edema macular y vasculitis retinal. Se confirmó la enfermedad de Lyme en fase tardía por la presencia de anticuerpos en sangre por Western blot. Se realizó tratamiento exitoso con antibióticos (doxiciclina), con recuperación de la AV y la mejoría completa de los signos inflamatorios intraoculares."

Methods: Participants were 82 individuals who had a confirmed diagnosis of Lyme disease and had been experiencing symptoms for 6 months or more. They were recruited through various online mechanisms (e.g., social media, online support groups), and they completed the consent form and questionnaires via Qualtrics. Participants completed questions about their demographics and health status as well as the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (Moss-Morris et al., 2002), the Brief COPE (Carver, 1997), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). Results: Illness perceptions and coping explained a significant amount of variance in HRQOL. Among the illness perceptions, the consequences and identity dimensions were most strongly associated with HRQOL. Behavioral disengagement and substance use were the coping strategies most strongly associated with the emotional health outcomes. Discussion: Illness perceptions and coping are related to HRQOL among individuals with CLD. Given the increase in Lyme disease incidence and the chronicity of symptoms in some cases, it is critical to continue to examine the psychosocial factors associated with HRQOL in this population."

Serology is insensitive during the first days to weeks of infection, and blood polymerase chain reaction (PCR) offers similarly poor performance. Here, we demonstrate that detection of Borrelia burgdorferi (B.b.) cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in plasma can improve diagnosis of early LB. Methods: B.b. detection in plasma samples using unbiased metagenomic cfDNA sequencing performed by a commercial laboratory (Karius Inc) was compared with serology and blood PCR in 40 patients with physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM), 28 of whom were confirmed to have LB by skin biopsy culture (n = 18), seroconversion (n = 2), or both (n = 8). B.b. sequence analysis was performed using investigational detection thresholds, different from Karius’ clinical test. Results: B.b. cfDNA was detected in 18 of 28 patients (64%) with laboratory-confirmed EM. In comparison, sensitivity of acute-phase serology using modified 2-tiered testing (MTTT) was 50% (P = .45); sensitivity of blood PCR was 7% (P = .0002). Combining B.b. cfDNA detection and MTTT increased diagnostic sensitivity to 86%, significantly higher than either approach alone (P ≤ .04). B.b. cfDNA sequences matched precisely with strain-specific sequence generated from the same individual’s cultured B.b. isolate. B.b. cfDNA was not observed at any level in plasma from 684 asymptomatic ambulatory individuals. Among 3000 hospitalized patients tested as part of clinical care, B.b. cfDNA was detected in only 2 individuals, both of whom had clinical presentations consistent with LB. Conclusions: This is the first report of B.b. cfDNA detection in early LB and a demonstration of potential diagnostic utility. The combination of B.b. cfDNA detection and acute-phase MTTT improves clinical sensitivity for diagnosis of early LB."

Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (sNPH) based on chronic infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi (Bb) is an even rarer entity, that with the right treatment is potentially curable. Case presentation: A 67-year-old male with a slow onset of progressive balance problems, also presented unspecified dizziness, urge feeling, neck soreness and discrete cognitive complaints. An MRI scan revealed an enlarged ventricular system compatible with NPH. After further liquor dynamic procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed with the surprising results of lymphocytic pleocytosis, and signs of increased antibody production. Microbiology revealed chronic neuroborreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics accordingly. At the one-year follow-up no symptoms remained and the ventricular system almost normalized. Conclusions: We describe the 7th published case of sNPH secondary to chronic Borreliosis in a previous healthy adult. Existing published literature has been reviewed and previous cases showed similarly nearly full clinical recovery. Primary/idiopathic NPH (iNPH) is treated with the surgical intervention of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and can be mistaken for a sNPH. The awareness of rare causes of sNPH like chronic Borreliosis is important as it is easily treated non surgically."

		"abstract": "Background. Lyme disease, the most common anthropozoonosis, is a transmissible natural focal infection affecting various organs and systems. Also known as Lyme borreliosis, it is caused by Borrelia spirochetes, which are distributed by ticks of the genus Ixodes. Early diagnosis is difficult due to frequent occurrence of atypical symptoms, unnoticed tick bites, the absence of migratory erythematous lesions, and symptoms occurring during the nontick season. If not diagnosed and treated in time, dissemination of the infection occurs and various complications develop since borrelias damage not only the skin but also the nervous system, joints, and, in rare cases, the heart and eyes. Materials and methods. This article presents a clinical case of Lyme borreliosis-induced myocarditis, which led to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and, consequently, urgent cardiac transplantation. According to our data, this is one of the first described cases of this complication in the world. Results and conclusions. When diagnosed in time and treated properly, the prognosis of Lyme myocarditis is usually good. In most cases, the atrioventricular block disappears within 1–2 weeks of antibiotic treatment and the implantation of a temporary pacemaker is rarely needed. In those rare cases of a chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection, dilated cardiomyopathy may develop; thus if a sudden atrioventricular block occurs, the physician should be vigilant and perform the necessary tests to exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease."

We report a case of acute neuroborreliosis that manifested as extended isolated cervical myelitis. Not only the manifestation as isolated myelitis in the early stages of borreliosis represents a rarity, but also the strong contrast between mild clinical symptoms and pronounced imaging findings in this case is remarkable."

Enhancements provided by molecular assays, including speed, throughput, sensitivity, and specificity, have resulted in a rapid increase in the number of newly characterized tick-borne agents. The use of unbiased high throughput sequencing has enabled the prompt identification of new pathogens and the examination of tick microbiomes. These efforts have led to the identification of hundreds of new tick-borne agents in the last decade alone. However, little is currently known about the majority of these agents beyond their phylogenetic classification. Our article outlines the primary methods involved in tick-borne agent discovery and the current status of our understanding of tick-borne agent diversity."

Early manifestations are erythema migrans, multiple erythemata migrantia, and (less frequently) borrelial lymphocytoma. A typical late manifestation is acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Lyme neuroborreliosis is much less common with an incidence of about 0.8/100 000 inhabitants in Germany. Bannwarth’s syndrome (painful radiculoneuritis) is the most common manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis in adults followed by meningitis. International case definitions exist regarding the likelihood of Lyme neuroborreliosis on the basis of diagnostic test results. A CSF analysis should be performed in patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis. The first line treatment for dermatological manifestations of Lyme borreliosis is doxycycline, in children and pregnant women amoxicillin. Doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics show similar efficacy regarding neurological symptoms and adverse effects for treatment of neurological manifestations. Treatment duration for early manifestations is 10 to 14 days, in Lyme neuroborreliosis it should not exceed 21 days. All manifestations, also Lyme neuroborreliosis, usually show a favourable prognosis after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment does not show any efficacy in patients with unspecific symptoms and concurrent positive anti-borrelial serology."

One of the typical manifestations of LB are musculoskeletal symptoms; they may appear in any of the three LB stages. The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and confirmed by serological tests. One course of antibiotic therapy is sufficient for LB to dissipate in most cases, although for some patients, the symptoms subside gradually even after completion of therapy. Patients who have been demonstrated to have specific antibodies but are symptomless should not be treated. In instances where the advised treatment proved to be unsuccessful, patients should be referred to rheumatologist for additional diagnostics. The goal of this review is to update physicians on current scientific knowledge on musculoskeletal manifestations of LB."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is a spirochetal disease. Lyme disease-related ocular findings may also provide important clues. Ocular involvement is most commonly seen as uveitis, chorioretinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, papillitis, panuveitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, and retinal vasculitis. Case:: A 27-year-old male patient was admitted with a history of fatigue, malaise, and sudden loss of vision in his left eye for 3 days. The best visual acuity was found 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed no pathological findings in the right eye; but hyperfluorescence that was compatible with choroiditis foci was seen in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening in the left eye compared to the right eye. Lyme IgM antibody was found to be positive, explaining choroiditis etiology, while IgG values were found to be negative. Western blot verification test was positive. The patient was treated with 2 × 100 mg doxycycline (21 days) with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, prednol 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) for choroiditis. Omeprazole tablets were given 1 × 1 during the period of cortisone intake. On the third day of treatment, visual acuity increased to 20/200 and continued to increase until reaching 20/20 in the second week. Conclusions:: Lyme disease is rare, but must be kept in mind when investigating the etiology of chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The patient reported here is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in literature that shows atypical clinic for Lyme disease with unilateral chorioretinitis without Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore blood digestion is very important for tick survival. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. However, most of these studies have focused on partially engorged ticks. In other hematophagous arthropods, the serine proteases play an important role in blood protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of four I. scapularis serine proteases with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. An in vitro hemoglobinolytic assay was performed with or without serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 day post host detachment, respectively. The knockdown of three previously identified serine proteases by RNAi negatively impacted blood intake, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the gut and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation in vitro. A trypsin inhibitor, PMSF, blocked the action of trypsin in the gut extract resulting in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Our data also demonstrated that in addition to blood digestion, these serine proteases might have a role in blood feeding success in I. scapularis."

		"abstract": "Serological diagnosis of Lyme disease suffers from considerable limitations. Yet, the technique cannot currently be replaced by direct detection methods, such as bacterial culture or molecular analysis, due to their inadequate sensitivity. The low bacterial burden in vasculature and lack of consensus around blood-based isolation of the causative pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, are central to this challenge. We therefore addressed methodological optimization of Borrelia recovery from blood, first by analyzing existing protocols, and then by using experimentally infected human blood to identify the processing conditions and fractions that increase Borrelia yield. In this proof-of-concept study, we now report two opportunities to improve recovery and detection of Borrelia from clinical samples. To enhance pathogen viability and cultivability during whole blood collection, citrate anticoagulant is superior to more commonly used EDTA. Despite the widespread reliance on serum and plasma as analytes, we found that the platelet fraction of blood concentrates Borrelia, providing an enriched resource for direct pathogen detection by microscopy, laboratory culture, Western blot, and PCR. The potential for platelets to serve as a reservoir for Borrelia and its diagnostic targets may transform direct clinical detection of this pathogen."

A total clinical assessment is critical in diagnosis, especially since controversy surrounds the reliability of laboratory testing. The clinical findings of one hundred Lyme disease patients with chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms were entered into a database. The prevalence of each clinical finding pre-infection and post-infection was compared and calculated within the 95% confidence interval. Patients had minimal symptoms pre-infection, but a high post-infection prevalence of a broad spectrum of acquired multisystem symptoms. These findings included impairments of attention span, memory, processing, executive functioning, emotional functioning, behavior, psychiatric syndromes, vegetative functioning, neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, upper respiratory, dental, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and other symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms included sustained attention impairments, brain fog, unfocused concentration, joint symptoms, distraction by frustration, depression, working memory impairments, decreased school/job performance, recent memory impairments, difficulty prioritizing multiple tasks, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, multitasking difficulties, sudden mood swings, hypersomnia, mental apathy, decreased social functioning, insomnia, tingling, word finding difficulties, name retrieval, headaches, sound hypersensitivity, paresis, anhedonia, depersonalization, cold intolerance, body temperature fluctuations, light sensitivity and dysfluent speech. The average patient had five symptoms pre-infection and 82 post-infection. Pattern recognition is critical in making a diagnosis. This study was used to develop three clinical assessment forms."

Here, we report a case of Lyme carditis complicated by heart block in a pediatric patient admitted to our children’s hospital. What is unique about this case is that the complaint of chest palpitations is an infrequent presentation of LD, and what it adds to the scientific literature is an improved understanding of LD in the pediatric population. Case presentation: The patient was a 16-year-old male who presented with the main concerns of acute onset of palpitations and chest pain. An important clinical finding was Conclusions: Lyme carditis occurs in < 5% of LD cases, but the “take-away” lesson of this case is that carditis can be the presenting manifestation of"

		"abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding treatment of Lyme disease patients who do not respond fully to initial short-term antibiotic therapy. Choosing the best treatment approach and duration remains challenging because treatment response among these patients varies: some patients improve with treatment while others do not. A previous study examined treatment response variation in a sample of over 3500 patients enrolled in the MyLymeData patient registry developed by LymeDisease.org (San Ramon, CA, USA). That study used a validated Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale to identify three treatment response subgroups among Lyme disease patients who remained ill: nonresponders, low responders, and high responders. The present study first characterizes the health status, symptom severity, and percentage of treatment response across these three patient subgroups together with a fourth subgroup, patients who identify as well. We then employed machine learning techniques across these subgroups to determine features most closely associated with improved patient outcomes, and we used traditional statistical techniques to examine how these features relate to treatment response of the four groups. High treatment response was most closely associated with (1) the use of antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and alternative treatments, (2) longer duration of treatment, and (3) oversight by a clinician whose practice focused on the treatment of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Background: Current literature presents conflicting results regarding the clinical manifestations of coinfection with Babesia microti (Babesiosis) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease). The aim of this study is to investigate the effect that coinfection with Babesiosis and Lyme Disease has on standard and novel biomarkers markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (Pc), which may assist in elucidating how these pathogens interact within human hosts. Methods: Babesia cases were collected from Stony Brook University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. Cases of Babesia were included if parasites were detected by peripheral blood smear and confirmed by PCR. Lyme disease diagnosis criteria involved 2-tier testing per CDC guidelines. Cases were divided into three cohorts based on if they had CRP, ESR or Pc tested. Cohorts were divided into two groups: Babesiosis alone vs coinfection with Lyme Disease. Median values were analyzed for the following biomarkers across both groups: parasitemia, hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, indirect bilirubin (IB), lactate dehydrogenase, ESR, CRP and Pc. Fisher Exact and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were used and P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: ESR values trended higher in monoinfection compared to coinfection (50 vs 36 mm/hr, p=0.63). Within this cohort, the coinfection group had significantly lower platelet values compared to monoinfection (52 vs. 75.5 K/uL, p=0.04, Table 1). Within the CRP and Pc cohorts, monoinfection had higher trends of parasitemia compared to coinfection (CRP group: 1.6 vs 0.7%, p=0.14, Pc group: 1.4 vs 0.7% p=1.0, Table 2&3). Pc levels were similar in both groups (1.1 vs 1.2 ng/mL, p=1.0, Table 3). Conclusion: Coinfection had significantly lower platelets within the ESR cohort but not in other cohorts. While not statistically significant, monoinfection showed greater trends of ESR and parasitemia, which is consistent with previous studies that suggest that Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease (LD) is caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Over the past ten years, robust local public health data indicates that the incidence of LD has increased significantly in the eastern region of Ontario due to the spread of its vector, the blacklegged tick. As a result, we have seen an increase in the number of cases of LD in children at our tertiary paediatric centre, at all stages of infection. Familiarity with Lyme disease is important as incidence increases. We sought to characterize the cases at our centre. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of LD in children at our centre from 2009-2018, as well as the variety of clinical presentations of paediatric LD. Design/Methods: We completed a retrospective chart review from 2009-2018 of all cases admitted or seen in the Infectious Disease (ID) clinic or the Emergency Department (ED) with a diagnosis of LD. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, including geographic location where infection occurred and resource utilization. We used descriptive statistics to describe cases and comparative statistics to determine changes in number of cases over time. Results: There were 171 LD cases managed at our centre during this period. Mean age was 7.4 (SD 4.5) years, 89 (52.0%) were male. The annual number of cases from 2009 - 2018 increased from 1 to 44 and peaked in 2017 (47 cases). The highest number of cases occurred among children &lt;6, the lowest in children ≥11. Most cases occurred in summer (60%), with the fewest in winter months (4%). Stage of LD was not documented in 1 case. Of the remainder, 98 (57.6%) cases were early localized, 41 (25.7%) early disseminated and 31 (19.7%) late disseminated LD. Conclusion: Cases of LD managed at our paediatric centre have increased in keeping with population trends, with all LD stages experienced. Severe cases of meningitis, carditis, and arthritis resulted in hospitalization, with increasing numbers over the study period."

Single populations of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, were revealed in southwestern Québec, Canada. Blacklegged tick nymphs and, similarly, larval and nymphal rabbit ticks were tested for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), using PCR and the flagellin (flaB) gene, and 14 (42%) of 33 of blacklegged tick nymphs tested were positive. In contrast, larval and nymphal H. leporsipalustris ticks were negative for Bbsl. The occurrence of Bbsl in I. scapularis nymphs brings to light the presence of a Lyme disease endemic area at this songbird nesting locality. Because our findings denote that this area is a Lyme disease endemic area, and I. scapularis is a human-biting tick, local residents and outdoor workers must take preventive measures to avoid tick bites. Furthermore, local healthcare practitioners must include Lyme disease in their differential diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Background: Demonstration of intrathecal production of Borrelia-specific antibodies (ITAb) is considered the most specific diagnostic marker of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Limitations include delayed detectability in early infection and continued presence long after successful treatment. Markers of active inflammation—increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocytes, protein, and CXCL13—provide nonspecific markers of active infection. To assess the utility of CSF CXCL13, we measured its concentration in 132 patients with a broad spectrum of neuroinflammatory disorders, including LNB. Methods: CSF CXCL13 was measured by immunoassay. Spearman rank correlation test was performed to explore its relationship to conventional markers of neuroinflammation and Borrelia-specific ITAb production. Results: In non-LNB neuroinflammatory disorders, CSF CXCL13 elevation correlated with CSF immunoglobulin G (IgG) synthesis and leukocyte count. In LNB, CXCL13 concentration was far greater than expected from overall CSF IgG synthesis, and correlated with Borrelia-specific ITAb synthesis. Median CSF CXCL13 concentration in ITAb-positive LNB patients was &gt; 500 times greater than in any other group. Conclusions: Intrathecal CXCL13 and IgG production are closely interrelated. CXCL13 is disproportionately increased in “definite LNB,” defined as having demonstrable Borrelia-specific ITAb, but not “probable LNB,” without ITAb. This disproportionate increase may help identify patients with very early infection or those with active vs treated LNB, or may help to differentiate ITAb-defined active LNB from other neuroinflammatory disorders. However, its reported specificity is closely related to the diagnostic requirement for ITAb. It may add little specificity to the demonstration of a pleocytosis or increased overall or specific IgG production in the CSF."

		"abstract": "Introduction/Background: Lyme disease, a tick-borne zoonosis caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, has emerged in Nova Scotia (NS) as a common illness. Since 2002 when Lyme disease was first diagnosed in NS, &gt;1000 cases have been reported. Seventh cranial nerve palsy (CNP-7) is said to be the most common presentation of early disseminated Lyme disease in children in endemic areas. Objectives: We aimed to determine the frequency of CNP-7 in NS and if physicians are considering Lyme disease as an etiology. Design/Methods: A retrospective review of health records of children seen at the IWK Health Centre from 2000-2018 who were ≤18 years of age with an ICD-9 or 10 diagnosis of Bell’s palsy (CNP-7) was conducted. CNP-7 due to local infection, trauma, malignancy, or systemic neurologic disease was excluded. Results: Of 237 ICD “Bell’s palsy” diagnoses, 66 cases were eligible, of which 60.6 % (n=40) were female. The median age was 10 years (range 0-16). Five cases of Lyme disease-associated CNP-7 were recognized (7.6%), all since 2013. No bilateral CNP-7 occurred; 59.1% of cases were on the left. Most children presented within 3 days of symptom onset (84.8%) to the emergency department (95.4%), and 56.1% subsequently saw a pediatric neurologist. The most common associated symptom with CNP-7 was headache (22.7%). Lyme disease was considered in the differential diagnosis in 34.8 % (n=23) of cases, and only since 2012. Systemic steroids were prescribed to 51.5 % (34/66) of children in the emergency department, for durations varying from 1 to 10 days. The most common steroid course length was 5 days. Antimicrobials were prescribed for 18 (27.3%) children including acyclovir, beta lactams and tetracyclines. Conclusion: There does not appear to be a standard approach to diagnosis and management of CNP-7 in this pediatric health centre. Lyme disease is not regularly considered in the differential diagnosis, which is surprising given the high incidence of Lyme disease in NS. These findings will be shared with health care providers most likely to see CNP-7 in order to develop a standard algorithm to the initial presentation of 7th cranial nerve palsy in children."

This has created a need to understand the environmental and human components of LD risk in open habitats. This study quantified both elements of LD risk and compared these between treeless islands with high and low LD incidence. We found high LD incidence was linked to higher prevalence in ticks (6.4% vs 0.4%) and increased human tick bite exposure. Most reported tick bites (72.7%) were within 1km of the home address and commonly in gardens. Residents on islands with high LD incidence reported increasing problems with ticks and suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. This study highlights the benefits to public health of an integrated approach to understand the factors contributing to LD emergence and a need to evaluate LD ecology in treeless habitats more broadly."

Clinical manifestations vary greatly, with localized skin findings functioning as early signs of the disease, followed by disseminated disease. The rarest dermatologic presentation of Lyme is a borrelial lymphocytoma, occurring distinctly in Europe and caused typically by Case presentation: We report a case of a Caucasian 5-year-old European-American boy with slowly progressing, painless edema and erythema of his right pinna. Travel history revealed significant exposure to ticks during a recent trip to Eastern Europe. Laboratory testing for Conclusions: Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease in North America, although not uncommon in Europe. Diagnosis is made by the presence of a painless erythematous swelling typically found on the ear lobe, nipples, or testes. Laboratory tests are available but with low sensitivity, therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a clinical diagnosis to be made. Treatment for isolated borrelial lymphocytoma is doxycycline 4 mg/kg up to 100 mg twice daily, whereas for children less than 8 years of age amoxicillin 50 mg/kg divided three times daily, for 3–4 weeks, is preferred."

The current study compared the level of knowledge and the knowledge needs about Lyme disease among individuals that spend time outdoors for work and for recreational purposes. Between December 2018 and February 2019, a survey was distributed to outdoor organizations across New Brunswick, Canada. Within the current sample of 137 individuals, 36% spent time outdoors for their occupation and 64% for recreational activities. Results showed no significant difference between these groups with regard to their level of knowledge, perceived efficacy and performance of various methods of prevention, and educational needs. Overall, the entire sample reported a low level of knowledge about Lyme disease. Participants perceived each prevention behavior to be at least somewhat effective, and behaviors perceived to be more effective were more likely to be carried out, but the performance of the behaviors varied. The most frequently performed behaviors included wearing long pants and protective footwear. Participants identified several aspects of Lyme disease about which they would like to have more information. The findings call attention to the specific needs of at-risk groups that must be considered when developing educational interventions."

For each species, we measured the rate of attachment to a common rodent host, the engorgement weight, and the efficiency of pathogen acquisition (host to tick) and pathogen transmission (tick to host) from laboratory mice. In measuring pathogen acquisition and transmission, we used two different pathogen strains, one sympatric with Results: We found Conclusions: This study identified species-specific vector traits as a potential driver of broad scale variation in Lyme disease risk in the USA.

In total, 62 of 67 (92.5%) patients treated with disulfiram were able to endorse a net benefit of the treatment with regard to their symptoms. Moreover, 12 of 33 (36.4%) patients who completed one or two courses of “high-dose” therapy enjoyed an “enduring remission”, defined as remaining clinically well for ≥6 months without further anti-infective treatment. The most common adverse reactions from disulfiram treatment in the high-dose group were fatigue (66.7%), psychiatric symptoms (48.5%), peripheral neuropathy (27.3%), and mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes (15.2%). We observed that although patients on high dose experienced a higher risk for adverse reactions than those on a low dose, high-dose patients were significantly more likely to achieve enduring remission."

The results were compared with headspace gas chromatography carried out in parallel. This technique was also applied to investigate the efficacy of chemical antibiotics and of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties. Antibiotics added to the sample cultures are apparently effective if the emission of hydrogen is suppressed, or if not, are either ineffective or the related bacteria are even resistant. The sensor approach was applied to prove bacterial contamination in food, animals, medical specimens and in ticks infected by Borrelia bacteria and their transfer to humans, thus causing Lyme disease. It is a unique advantage that the progress of an antibiotic therapy can be examined until the emission of hydrogen is finished. The described technique cannot identify the related bacteria but enables bacterial contamination by hydrogen emitting anaerobes to be recognized. The samples are incubated with the proper culture broth in closed septum vials which remain closed during the whole process. The personnel in the lab never come into contact with pathogens and thus safety regulations are guaranteed."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is a significant public health problem. The use of non-standard antibiotic treatment regimens for LD has been associated with adverse effects; however, the overall landscape of treatment has not been described previously. We aimed to describe real-world antibiotic prescribing patterns for LD. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the MarketScan commercial claims database of outpatient encounters from 2016-2018 in the United States. We identified all individuals with a visit that included an LD diagnosis code and a prescription within 30 days of the visit for one or more of 12 antibiotics that may be prescribed for LD. We then categorized each individual as having received either standard or non-standard treatment during the two-year period. Standard treatment was defined as treatment with a first, second or third-line antibiotic for LD, for no longer than 30 days, and for no more than two episodes during the study period. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed to compare characteristics of people who received standard vs non-standard treatment for LD. Results: A total of 84,769 prescriptions met criteria for inclusion, written for 45,926 unique patients. The mean duration of prescriptions was 21.4 days (SD 10.8). Most individuals (84.5%) treated for LD received standard treatment during the study period. Female gender (OR 1.5, p&lt; 0.0001) and age 19-45 (p=0.0003) were significantly associated with being prescribed non-standard LD treatment. Treatment in low-incidence states (OR 2.2 compared to high-incidence states, p&lt; 0.0001) and during non-summer months (OR 2.2, p&lt; 0.0001) was more likely to be non-standard. Conclusion: In this population of employed, young, and insured patients, young and middle-aged women were at the highest risk of receiving non-standard LD treatment. Treatments prescribed in states with low incidence of LD or during non-summer months were also more likely to be non-standard, a trend which likely reflects misdiagnosis or overtreatment of LD. Future studies are needed to further define prescriber and patient factors associated with non-standard LD treatment and related adverse outcomes. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Background: Research is currently lacking on the interplay between Babesiosis and Lyme disease (LD) and how this coinfection may translate into morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical features of patients with single-infection with Babesia microti to those co-infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. Methods: A retrospective review of all adult patients diagnosed with babesiosis and tested for LD at Stony Brook University Hospital between 2014 and 2019 was performed (n=40). Patients with single babesia infection (Group 1, n=22) were compared to those with Babesia and LD (Group 2, n=18). Babesiosis diagnosis was determined by microscopic visualization of Babesia spp under peripheral blood smear, and confirmed by PCR for B. microti. LD inclusion criteria included a positive screened ELISA test for lyme followed by positive IgM antibody by western blot per CDC criteria (2-3 positive bands). Statistical analysis of the data involved Fisher exact test, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Statistical significance was considered as a p-value less than 0.05. Results: There was no significant difference in gender, race, and age (p &gt;.75) between both groups as well as comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, heart conditions, and immunocompromised state (p=1.0). Maximum parasitemia (Group 1: 1.1%, Group 2: 1.7%, p= 0.26) and percentage admitted to the ICU (Group 1: 18.18%, Group 2: 22.22%, p=1.0) were similar among both groups. While lab values on admission including WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, LDH, ALT, and AST did not significantly differ (p &gt;.09), the length of hospital stay in group 2 was significantly longer than group 1 (Group 1: 3.0 days, Group 2: 5.5 days; p=0.03). There was a 0% mortality rate among both groups. Conclusion: It is remarkable that despite no differences in lab values on admission, comorbidities, and demographics, patients with a coinfection had a longer hospital stay than those with only babesiosis. This suggests that having a coinfection with babesiosis and LD may lead to a more severe illness than a single infection with babesiosis. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Background: With more than 300,000 new cases reported each year in the United States of America (USA), Lyme disease is a major public health concern. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) is considered the primary agent of Lyme disease in North America. However, multiple genetically diverse Borrelia species encompassing the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex and the Relapsing Fever Borrelia (RFB) group are capable of causing tickborne disease. We report preliminary results of a serological survey of previously undetected species of Bbsl and RFB in California and Mexico using a novel immunoblot technique. Methods: Serum samples were tested for seroreactivity to specific species of Bbsl and RFB using an immunoblot method based on recombinant Borrelia membrane proteins, as previously described. A sample was recorded as seropositive if it showed immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or IgG reactivity with at least two proteins from a specific Borrelia species. Results: The patient cohort consisted of 90 patients residing in California or Mexico who met the clinical case definition of chronic Lyme disease. Immunoblot testing revealed that 42 patients were seropositive for Bbsl (Group 1), while 56 patients were seropositive for RFB (Group 2). Eight patients were seropositive for both Bbsl and RFB species. Group 1 included patients who were seropositive for Bbss (14), B. californiensis (eight), B. spielmanii (10), B. afzelii/B. garinii (10), and mixed infections that included B. mayonii (three). Group 2 included patients who were seropositive for B. hermsii (nine), B. miyamotoi (seven), B. turicatae (nine), and B. turcica (two). In the remaining Group 1 and Group 2 patients, the exact Borrelia species could not be identified using the immunoblot technique. Conclusions: Lyme disease is associated with a diverse group of Borrelia species in California and Mexico. Current testing for Lyme disease focuses on detection of Bbss, possibly resulting in missed diagnoses and failure to administer appropriate antibiotic therapy in a timely manner. The genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes must be considered in future Lyme disease test development."

Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore efficient blood digestion is critical for survival. Studies in partially engorged ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. In this study, we investigated the potential role of serine proteases in blood digestion in replete ticks. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. Hemoglobinolytic activity was determined in vitro, with or without a serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after repletion. Knockdown of serine proteases negatively impacted blood feeding, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the midgut, and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation. Incubation of midgut extract with a trypsin inhibitor resulted in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Understanding the digestive profile of trypsin during blood meal digestion in I. scapularis improves our understanding of the basic biology of ticks and may lead to new methods for tick control."

		"abstract": "This study was designed to determine the quality of life, diagnostic, and illness-related experiences of patients who self-report a diagnosis with Lyme disease (LD) and/or who are experiencing chronic illness in Texas, a state considered non-endemic for tick-borne illness. This exploratory study found that self-reported LD respondents have multisystem health problems that result in very poor quality of life. Lyme disease respondents experience multiple and severe symptoms, particularly flu-like illness, extreme fatigue, back and neck pain, and anxiety and depression. These symptoms were present at similar levels among all LD respondents, whether their diagnosis was clinical or serological. For all LD respondents, this study points to quality of life experiences that are powerfully negative. Practitioners and disease surveillance experts may consider LD when multisystem symptoms are severe, other etiologies are ruled out, and quality of life is threatened."

		"abstract": "Background: Although the prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBD) continues to increase, there remains significant confusion regarding treatment for Lyme and other TBDs. We conducted a chart review of all new patients that came to an academic center for Lyme and TBDs. We then initiated a quality improvement project for feedback from a small subset of patients with Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Methods: Charts of patients visiting the clinic between March and November 2018 were reviewed. Data abstracted from the electronic health record included demographics, laboratory and clinical data. A small subset of patients who reported a history of Lyme and at least 6 months of symptoms after antibiotic treatment were enrolled in a phone survey to evaluate their experience with treatment for PTLDS. Results: Symptoms most commonly seen in 218 new patients included fatigue (66.5%), joint pain (58.2%), cognitive difficulty (32.1%), headache (27.9%) and sleep disturbance (27.5%). 87% had already received tick-borne disease directed antibiotic treatment. Over half (60.5%) of patients report having symptoms for more than 6 months. More than half of patients (54.8%) who had more than 6 months of Lyme-related symptoms had positive serological testing. Common themes identified in the 16 phone surveys of patients with PTLDS conducted so far included significant frustration related to the dismissive attitudes from medical professionals (n=9/16), and many sought alternative or complementary therapies (n=11/16). Six patients reported receiving very long-term antibiotic regimens from other Lyme specialists. Many patients expressed satisfaction with the visit and medical advice even in the absence of curative therapy (n=9/16), although a significant number continued to seek care elsewhere (n=6/16). Conclusion: More than half of new patients reported symptoms lasting more than 6 months after targeted antibiotic therapy. Further research is needed to develop interventions for the common symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, cognitive difficulty and sleep disturbance. Treatments to improve sleep, diet, and physical activity and decrease inflammation among patients who suffer from PTLDS are needed. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

As risk areas expand further north, the population can adopt specific preventive behaviors to limit chances of infection. The objectives of this study were to (1) create an index of Lyme disease prevention behaviors (LDPB), and (2) use the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explain the decision-making process of people who choose to adopt LDPB. Methods: A sample of 1959 adults living in a Lyme disease risk area completed a questionnaire by phone ( Results: Our findings led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index consisting of 10 behaviors, down from the 19 behaviors initially considered for inclusion in the index. Rates of adoption of each behavior varied tremendously, from 4.30 to 83.80%. All variables of the TPB model (attitude, social norms, and perceived control) were significantly associated with intention to adopt preventive behaviors. Intention itself was significantly associated with adoption of LDPB. Likewise, risk perception was positively correlated with the adoption of LDPB. Conclusions: This study led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index that can be used by public health agencies, researchers, and professionals to monitor the evolution over time of individuals’ LDPB adoption rates. It also showed the usefulness of the TPB in understanding the adoption of LDPB and how intention to adopt such behaviors is formed."

Since the territory of the Western Urals is widely known for its high morbidity and mortality rates associated with tick-borne infections, including ixodic tick-borne borreliosis, the study was aimed at estimation of the role of specific prevention in the prevalence of ITB. Materials and methods. A continuous retrospective clinical and laboratory analysis of 1214 adult patients admitted to Perm Regional Clinical Infectious Disease Hospital with lyme - borreliosis in 2012-2019 was carried out. Results. The disease is registered more often in persons over 50 years old, infection mainly occurs while visiting forests and park zones that requires the use of means of protection to reduce the number of the carriers of infection. Every third patient has mixed infection, where pathogens circulating in the ticks of the given territory of the Western Urals are combined. The increase in the number of non-erythemic forms in the recent years is probably associated with the development of immunodeficiency in the population of the industrial center, as well as with the use of more sensitive and informative methods of laboratory diagnostics. Conclusions. Specific prophylaxis is highly effective, helping to prevent infection in more than 90% of cases."

Case presentation: We hereby report a case of Lyme neuroborreliosis in a 9-year-old boy with abdominal pain as first symptom and subsequent onset of attention deficit and ataxia. Diagnosis was made by detection of specific antibody in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid with neuro-radiological images suggestive for this infectious disease. A 12-months follow-up was performed during which no relevant neurological sequelae were revealed. Conclusion: This case report shows that abdominal radiculitis, although extremely rare, could be the first manifestation of early Lyme neuroborreliosis in pediatric patients. Pediatricians must consider Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin in children, especially in countries where the infection is endemic."

One outcome of this is that increasing numbers of people are turning to medical crowdfunding to support access to alternative therapies, non-local health care providers and assist with managing the costs of everyday life. In this analysis, we qualitatively explore the narratives shared in Canadians’ crowdfunding campaigns to support Lyme disease treatment or diagnosis to identify whether or not any common elements shared in these narratives exist, and if so, what they are. We identified 238 campaigns for inclusion from three prominent crowdfunding platforms. Thematic analysis of the campaign narratives shows four consistent themes shared in these campaigns: what is lost (e.g. bodily ability), what is missing (e.g. local care options), what is sought (e.g. funds to cover treatment abroad) and what is hoped for (e.g. return to wellbeing). These themes demonstrate the highly personal and emotional nature of medical crowdfunding, particularly in the context of a contested illness that may lead some to question the legitimacy of one’s financial need. This analysis contributes valuable new insights to the nascent scholarship on medical crowdfunding, and particularly to our understanding of how people communicate about their health and bodily needs on this public platform. It also identifies important directions for future research, including the potential for crowdfunding narratives to be used for advocacy."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases affecting humans and animals are on the rise worldwide. Vaccines constitute an effective control measure, but very few are available. We selected Lyme borreliosis, a bacterial infection transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes, to validate a new concept to identify vaccine candidates. This disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Although attempts to develop a vaccine exist, none have been successfully marketed. In tick-borne diseases, the skin constitutes a very specific environment encountered by the pathogen during its co-inoculation with tick saliva. In a mouse model, we developed a proteomic approach to identify vaccine candidates in skin biopsies. We identified 30 bacterial proteins after syringe inoculation or tick inoculation of bacteria. Discovery proteomics using mass spectrometry might be used in various tick-borne diseases to identify pathogen proteins with early skin expression. It should help to better develop sub-unit vaccines based on a cocktail of several antigens, associated with effective adjuvant and delivery systems of antigens. In all vector-borne diseases, the skin deserves further investigation to better define its role in the elaboration of protective immunity against pathogens."

In addition, we have well established national health care registers where countrywide data from patient visits in public health care units are collected. In our previous study based on these registers, we reported an increasing incidence of both microbiologically confirmed and clinically diagnosed LB cases in Finland during the past years. Here, we evaluated our register data, refined LB incidence estimates provided in our previous study, and evaluated treatment practices considering LB in the primary health care. Methods: Three national health care registers were used. The Register for Primary Health Care Visits (Avohilmo) and the National Hospital Discharge Register (Hilmo) collect physician-recorded data from the outpatient and inpatient health care visits, respectively, whereas the National Infectious Diseases Register (NIDR) represents positive findings in LB diagnostics notified electronically by microbiological laboratories. We used a personal identification number in register-linkage to identify LB cases on an individual level in the study year 2014. In addition, antibiotic purchase data was retrieved from the Finnish Social Insurance Institution in order to evaluate the LB treatment practices in the primary health care in Finland. Results: Avohilmo was found to be useful in monitoring clinically diagnosed LB (i.e. erythema migrans (EM) infections), whereas Hilmo did not add much value next to existing laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB. However, Hilmo gave valuable information about uncertainties related to physician-based surveillance of disseminated LB and the total annual number of EM infections in our country. Antibiotic purchases associated with the LB-related outpatient visits in the primary health care indicated a good compliance with the recommended treatment guidelines. Conclusions: Avohilmo and laboratory-based NIDR together are useful in monitoring LB incidence in Finland. A good compliance was observed with the recommended treatment guidelines of clinically diagnosed LB in the primary health care. In 2018, Avohilmo was introduced in the routine surveillance of LB in Finland next to laboratory-based surveillance of disseminated LB."

In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis. Currently, many studies have been conducted to identify factors influencing Lyme disease risk in the Northeast, however, relatively few studies focused on the Upper Midwest. In this study, we explored and compared the climatic and landscape factors that shape the spatial patterns of human Lyme cases in these two regions, using the generalized linear mixed models. Our results showed that climatic variables generally had opposite correlations with Lyme disease risk, while landscape factors usually had similar effects in these two regions. High precipitation and low temperature were correlated with high Lyme disease risk in the Upper Midwest, while with low Lyme disease risk in the Northeast. In both regions, size and fragmentation related factors of residential area showed positive correlations with Lyme disease risk. Deciduous forests and evergreen forests had opposite effects on Lyme disease risk, but the effects were consistent between two regions. In general, this study provides new insight into understanding the differences of risk factors of human Lyme disease risk in these two regions."

Treating Lyme disease during its initial stages with traditional tetracycline antibiotics is effective. However, 10–20% of patients treated with antibiotic therapy still shows prolonged symptoms of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and perceived cognitive impairment. When these symptoms persists for more than 6 months to years after completing conventional antibiotics treatment are called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Though the exact reason for the prolongation of post treatment symptoms are not known, the growing evidence from recent studies suggests it might be due to the existence of drug-tolerant persisters. In order to identify effective drug molecules that kill drug-tolerant"

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT Lyme disease, an infectious multisystemic disease is caused by \"Borrelia burgdorferi\". It is a spirochete transmitted by the Ixodes tick. Until today, only one case has been reported from Nepal. Here we report case of a 50-year female from Gulmi, who presented with a history of fever, multiple joint pain, tiredness, tingling sensation, and a painful brownish raised lesion over the neck and anterior chest. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by histological findings typical of erythema chronicum migrans and by serology. The patient was treated successfully with doxycycline. This is the second case report of Lyme disease from Nepal and the first documented case who presented with typical erythema chronicum migrans. We suspect that Lyme disease might not have been considered in the differential diagnosis of fever with rash and joint pain in Nepal and suggest that it is to be kept as a differential in the given scenario.  "

However, ecological solutions to the spread of the disease are rarely pursued. Drawing on interviews with Lyme activists, politicians, and state and local administrators dealing with Lyme disease related issues as well as an analysis of Lyme disease legislation in the state of Virginia, we examine why solutions to Lyme disease most often focus on expanding individual choices for diagnosis and treatment over changing the environments that enhance the risk of Lyme disease. We argue that the emergence of Lyme disease in a neoliberal society pushed debates on how to best deal with the disease away from its underpinning environmental causes and into individual human bodies."

		"abstract": "Case series summary: Two cats were presented for investigation of bradyarrhythmia detected by their referring veterinarians during routine examination. Both cats had extensive investigations, including haematology, serum biochemistry with electrolytes and thyroxine concentrations, systolic blood pressure measurement, echocardiography, electrocardiography and infectious disease testing. Infectious disease testing included serology for Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, and PCR for B burgdorferi antigen in both cats. Case 1 was also assessed by PCR for Bartonella henselae antigen and case 2 was assessed for Dirofilaria immitis by serology. All infectious disease tests, other than for B burgdorferi, were negative. Case 1 was diagnosed with Lyme carditis based on marked bradydysrhythmia, positive B burgdorferi serology, a structurally normal heart and clinical resolution with appropriate treatment with a 4-year follow-up. Case 2 was diagnosed with Lyme carditis based on marked bradydysrhythmia and positive B burgdorferi PCR; however, this cat had structural heart disease that did not resolve with treatment. Relevance and novel information: This small case series describes two B burgdorferi positive cats presenting with newly diagnosed cardiac abnormalities consistent with those found in humans and dogs with Lyme carditis. Both cats were asymptomatic as perceived by their owners; the arrhythmia was detected by their veterinarians."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The current therapeutic approach to this disease is limited to antibiotics. However, after their administration, about 20% of patients experience delayed onset of this illness manifesting as lingering persistent symptoms. Methods:: To determine a suitable approach that would help reduce this number, we examined the efficacy of a composition of polyphenolic compounds (baicalein, luteolin, and rosmarinic acid) with fatty acids (monolaurin and cis-2-decenoic acid), and iodine/kelp in a Lyme disease animal model and volunteers. Results:: The results showed that 4 weeks of dietary intake of this composition reduced the spirochete burden in animal tissues by about 75%. Basic and differential blood parameters did not show significant differences between control animals and the animals fed with this composition. Also, hepatic and renal toxicity markers were not changed and apoptosis was not observed. Relevant inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were elevated in infected animals but normalized in infected and treated animals. A small observational study revealed that after administration of this composition to 17 volunteers three times per day for 6 months, 67.4% of the volunteers with late or persistent LD, and not receptive to previous antibiotic application, responded positively, in terms of energy status as well as physical and psychological wellbeing to supplementation with this composition, while 17.7% had slight improvement, and 17.7% were none responsive. Conclusion:: We concluded that this specific composition revealed feasible benefits in late or persistent LD management, although double-blind controlled clinical trials are warranted."

The current study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of various algorithms of MTTT in European patients with erythema migrans (EM) as a model disease for early Lyme borreliosis, and in appropriate controls. Four different immunoassays were used in the first tier, followed by either an immunoblot or the C6-EIA, or were used as standalone single-tier test. These tests were performed on consecutively collected sera of 228 Dutch patients with physician-diagnosed EM in the setting of general practice, 231 controls from the general population, and 50 controls with potentially cross-reactive antibodies. All the variants of MTTT that were studied had significantly higher sensitivity compared with their equivalent STTT, while retaining comparable specificity. Within the MTTT algorithms, classifying equivocal results as positive yielded better diagnostic parameters than classifying equivocal results as negative. The best diagnostic parameters were found using the Enzygnost-2 assay in the first tier, followed by a C6-ELISA in the second tier (sensitivity 77.6%, 95% CI 71.7–82.9; specificity 96.1%, 95% CI 92.7–98.2). This algorithm performed significantly better than the equivalent STTT algorithm in terms of sensitivity ("

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is especially important in the spring–autumn period, despite the fact that its clinical manifestations may be throughout the year. Awareness of general practitioners with this problem is insufficient, it requires additional knowledge about diagnosis and treatment. In pediatric practice, the fact of a child being bitten by an Ixodes mite that carries the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, in addition to babesiosis, anaplasmosis, often goes unnoticed. Therefore, parents seek medical help only when various problems arise, often the thought of Lyme disease does not even arise. Lyme disease has a wide polymorphism of clinical symptoms, is characterized by multisystem lesions, cyclical course — all this complicates the diagnostic search. The difficulty also lies in the fact that there are no domestic clinical recommendations. This publication presents approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, prevention of Lyme disease based on the experience of experts from different countries. Modern approaches to two-stage laboratory diagnostics, tactics of patient management from the moment of bite, treatment at different stages of Lyme borreliosis are analyzed. Attention is paid to the need for epidemiological research in Ukraine and the beginning of educational programs to prevent the disease. The differentiated approach to the treatment of Lyme disease in children due to age aspects, concomitant pathology, safety of long_term antibacterial therapy should be studied more. No conflict of interest was declared by the authors. Key words: Lyme disease, children, diagnosis, treatment, prevention."

One hundred and twenty three consecutive patients with Bannwarth’s syndrome, of whom 18 (14.6%) were being treated with statins, were included in the study. To assess the influence of statin use on the course and outcome of the disease, univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. No statistically significant association was found between statin pre-treatment and the clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and outcome of Bannwarth’s syndrome. In conclusion, pre-existing use of statins did not significantly impact either the clinical presentation or the outcome of Bannwarth’s syndrome."

Despite this, there is limited published data regarding Lyme disease patients accessing primary care in the UK. We aim to describe trends in the incidence of a new diagnosis, and demographics of patients identified in a primary care electronic health database. Methods: A descriptive epidemiological study of Lyme disease coded patients in UK primary care. 3725 patients coded for Lyme disease during 1998–2016 were identified within The Health Improvement Network (THIN). Incidence rates and the demographics of cases identified were described. Poisson regression was used to analyse socio-demographic characteristics of the cases. Results: There was an increase in annual crude incidence rates, peaking in 2015 at 5.47 (95% CI 4.85–6.14) cases per 100,000 population per year. Multivariable analysis showed there were significant differences in the ages of those affected, incidence of a new diagnosis rose as deprivation levels improved, and that there was a higher incidence of cases living in rural areas compared to urban areas. There was no significant difference between sexes for the UK. Cases were significantly more likely to identify with being white compared to the national population. Conclusions: An increasing incidence of patients newly coded with Lyme disease related Read codes was identified using data from a UK national primary care database. By comparing these incidence figures with national laboratory-confirmed surveillance data, a multiplication factor of 2.35 (95%CI 1.81–2.88) can be calculated in order to estimate the annual number of cases seen in primary care. The significant socio-demographic variables associated with a Lyme disease diagnosis likely reflect a complex interplay of socio-economic issues, which needs to be further explored. Future work is needed to examine the treatment and management of patients within this database."

Objectives: (i) Describe the process of trialing different modalities of patient engagement as a means to integrate a diversity of patient perspectives and (ii) Describe the learning process of INESSS regarding the integration of the patient perspective. Methodology: All documents were analyzed, and a survey with all advisory committee members and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted. Each interview was transcribed verbatim and imported into QDA miner software for the purposes of analysis. Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data collection to allow for an iterative approach between data collection and analysis. Results: Five methods to integrate the perspectives of patients were used: (i) interviews with patients, (ii) inclusion of patient partners within the advisory committee, (iii) literature review, (iv) focus groups with one patient association, and (v) feedback from patient associations on recommendations intended for decision makers and other targeted stakeholders. The patient partners influenced decisions by sharing their experiential knowledge. The patient interviews and the literature review added an in-depth perspective on the disease and experience with the healthcare system. The patient association members shared their perspectives and helped disseminate the recommendation to sustain a practice change. Conclusion: The combination of methods to collect and integrate patients’ knowledge and patient associations’ perspectives helped develop a comprehensive understanding of a controversial object of evaluation."

Long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing has demonstrated high initial protection against bites from blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), in laboratory settings, and sustained protection against bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in field tests. However, long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has not been field tested among outdoor workers who are frequently exposed to blacklegged ticks. We conducted a 2-yr randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial among 82 outdoor workers in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Participants in the treatment arm wore factory-impregnated permethrin clothing, and the control group wore sham-treated clothing. Outdoor working hours, tick encounters, and bites were recorded weekly to assess protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin-impregnated garments. Factory-impregnated clothing significantly reduced tick bites by 65% in the first study year and by 50% in the second year for a 2-yr protective effect of 58%. No significant difference in other tick bite prevention method utilization occurred between treatment and control groups, and no treatment-related adverse outcomes were reported. Factory permethrin impregnation of clothing is safe and effective for the prevention of tick bites among outdoor workers whose primary exposure is to blacklegged ticks in the northeastern United States."

		"abstract": "Background: To monitor the adoption of climate change adaptive behaviors in the population, public health authorities have to conduct national surveys, which can help them target vulnerable subpopulations. To ensure reliable estimates of the adoption of these preventive behaviors, many data collection methods are offered by polling firms. The aim of this study was to compare a telephone survey with a web survey on Lyme disease with regard to their representativeness. Methods: The data comes from a cross-sectional study conducted in the Province of Québec (Canada). In total, 1003 people completed the questionnaire by telephone and 956 filled in a web questionnaire. We compared the data obtained from both survey modes with the census data in regard to various demographic characteristics. We then compared the data from both samples in terms of self-reported Lyme disease preventive behaviors and other theoretically associated constructs. We also assessed the measurement invariance (equivalence) of the index of Lyme disease preventive behaviors across the telephone and web samples. Results: Findings showed that neither the telephone nor the web panel modes of data collection can be considered more representative of the target population. The results showed that the proportion of item non-responses was significantly higher with the web questionnaire (5.6%) than with the telephone survey (1.3%), and that the magnitude of the differences between the two survey modes was nil for 19 out of the 30 items related to Lyme disease, and small for 11 of them. Results from invariance analyses confirmed the measurement invariance of an index of adaptation to Lyme disease, as well as the mean invariance across both samples. Conclusions: Our results suggested that both samples provided similar estimates of the level of adaptation to Lyme disease preventive behaviors. In sum, the results of our study showed that neither survey mode was superior to the other. Thus, in studies where adaptation to climate change is monitored over time, using a web survey instead of a telephone survey could be more cost-effective, and researchers should consider doing so in future surveys on adaptation to climate. However, we recommend conducting a pretest study before deciding whether to use both survey modes or only one of them."

Commonly found in soil and decomposing organic material [1, 2], P. variotii can also be isolated from drinking water [3] and indoor and outdoor air [4–6]. In immunocompetent hosts, P. variotii has been reported as a cause of locally invasive disease including prosthetic valve endocarditis [7, 8], endophthalmitis [9, 10], rhinosinusitis [11, 12], and dialysis-associated peritonitis [13, 14]. In contrast, disseminated infections are more commonly reported in immunocompromised patients, including those with chronic granulomatous disease [15], solid malignancy [16], acute leukemia [17], lymphoma [18], multiple myeloma [19], and after stem cell transplant for myelodysplasia [20]. In 1 case series examining invasive infections by non-Aspergillus molds, P. variotii was the most common cause after Fusarium spp. [21]. Here, we present the case of an immunocompetent patient with extensive intravascular infection involving prosthetic material. We describe successful induction therapy with combination antifungals and extended suppression with posaconazole with clinical quiescence and eventual normalization of serum fungal biomarkers."

Despite antibiotic therapy, typically at least 10% of adult patients with erythema migrans experience persistence of at least 1 subjective symptom for ≥6 months (posttreatment Lyme disease symptoms [PTLDS]). Methods: This study was designed to determine whether the frequency and severity (based on a visual analogue scale) of 12 particular symptoms in patients with erythema migrans (n = 52) differed from matched control subjects (n = 104) followed prospectively for 12 months. Results: At baseline, patients with Lyme disease were more likely than controls to have at least 1 symptom (P = .006). Among symptomatic subjects, Lyme disease patients had a higher mean number of symptoms (P &lt; .001) and a higher mean total symptom severity score (P &lt; .001). At both 6 and 12 months, however, there were no significant differences for these variables and no significant differences in the frequency or severity of any of the 12 individual symptoms assessed. However, 10 patients were clinically assessed as having possible PTLDS. Conclusions: Patients with erythema migrans were more likely than matched control subjects to be symptomatic at baseline with a greater symptom severity score, but this was not found at ≥6 months. Use of symptom survey data alone, however, was less likely to identify patients with possible PTLDS compared with individual clinical assessments. Because it is very challenging to be certain that the presence of long-term symptoms in a particular patient is correctly attributable to having had Lyme disease, an objective biomarker would be highly desirable."

Therefore, we evaluated the potential of macrophage imaging using 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT for detection of Bb activity in a murine model of LA. LA was established in C3H/HeNRj mice infected with Bb B31 strain ML23 pBBE22luc. Bioluminescence imaging was performed to detect migration of spirochetes and inflammatory phagocytes to the joints. Three weeks post-infection 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging was performed at an early (3 h) and late (48 h) time point. Plasma levels of a systemic macrophage marker in plasma CD163 were measured. 64Cu-DOTATATE uptake in infected joints was increased at the early (p < 0.0001) and late time points (p = 0.0005) compared with uptake in non-infected controls. No significant difference in plasma levels of CD163 was measured. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET allows for in vivo detection and quantification of LA locally in the joints through non-invasive visualization of macrophages. In contrast, measurement of a systemic macrophage marker in plasma, CD163, did not allow to detect disease. We suggest that 64Cu-DOTATATE PET could become a valuable diagnostic tool for in situ detection of Bb infection-related inflammation."

According to the parameter estimates of our models, (i) the annual density of nymphs almost doubled over the 15-year study period, (ii) changing the beech tree seed production index from very poor mast (1) to full mast (5) increased the abundance of nymphs by 86.2% two years later, and (iii) increasing the field-collected mean annual relative humidity from 50.0 to 75.0% decreased the abundance of nymphs by 46.4% in the same year. Climate variables collected in the field were better predictors of tick abundance than those from nearby weather stations indicating the importance of the microhabitat. Conclusions: From a public health perspective, the increase in nymph abundance is likely to have increased the risk of tick-borne disease in this region of Switzerland. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that seed production by deciduous trees is a critical driver of the abundance of"

Biomarkers or specific clinical symptoms to identify patients with PTLDS do not currently exist and the PTLDS classification is based on the report of persistent, subjective symptoms for ≥6 months following antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Methods: Untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomics was used to determine longitudinal metabolic responses and biosignatures in PTLDS and clinically cured non-PTLDS Lyme patients. Evaluation of biosignatures included (1) defining altered classes of metabolites, (2) elastic net regularization to define metabolites that most strongly defined PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at different time points, (3) changes in the longitudinal abundance of metabolites, and (4) linear discriminant analysis to evaluate robustness in a second patient cohort. Results: This study determined that observable metabolic differences exist between PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at multiple time points. The metabolites with differential abundance included those from glycerophospholipid, bile acid, and acylcarnitine metabolism. Distinct longitudinal patterns of metabolite abundance indicated a greater metabolic variability in PTLDS versus non-PTLDS patients. Small numbers of metabolites (6 to 40) could be used to define PTLDS versus non-PTLDS patients at defined time points, and the findings were validated in a second cohort of PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that an objective metabolite-based measurement can distinguish patients with PTLDS and help understand the underlying biochemistry of PTLDS."

The medical records of patients with positive serology were consulted to identify which patients were finally diagnosed with LD along with their clinical manifestations, treatment and outcome. Results:: A total of 574 serological tests were included and 78 (13.59%) of them were positive. Only 1.04% (6) of all serological tests belonged to patients finally diagnosed with LD. The department that made most requests was Neurology (37.3%) followed by Infectious Diseases (21%), Internal Medicine (14.5%), Emergency Medicine (4.7%), Dermatology (4.5%), Critical Care Medicine (2.3%) and Rheumatology (2.1%). 50% of the diagnosed patients were women with a mean age of 57.7±7.7DE years. In 50% of diagnosed cases, patients remembered a tick bite during activities in the mountain or rural areas. The most common clinical manifestations were erythema migrans (67%), non-inflammatory arthralgias (50%), fatigue and malaise (67%), together with one case of meningoencephalitis and one of knee monoarthritis. All diagnosed patients received antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone (33%) or doxycycline (66%). Only one patient presented post-Lyme syndrome. Conclusion:: Our study indicates the overuse of diagnostic testing for LD with implications for patient care and cost-effective health management. In the absence of a history of potential exposure to infected vector ticks or characteristic clinical manifestations, unnecessary microbiological tests should not be performed.

We evaluated the efficacy of oral doxycycline in comparison to ceftriaxone in the treatment of LNB. Methods: Patients with neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB without other obvious reasons were recruited. The inclusion criteria were (1) production of Borrelia burgdorferi–specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum; (2) B. burgdorferi DNA in the CSF; or (3) an erythema migrans during the past 3 months. Participants were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 4 weeks, or intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily for 3 weeks. The participants described their subjective condition with a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 (0 = normal; 10 = worst) before the treatment, and 4 and 12 months after the treatment. The primary outcome was the change in the VAS score at 12 months. Results: Between 14 September 2012 and 28 December 2017, 210 adults with suspected LNB were assigned to receive doxycycline (n = 104) or ceftriaxone (n = 106). The per-protocol analysis comprised 82 patients with doxycycline and 84 patients with ceftriaxone. The mean change in the VAS score was −3.9 in the doxycycline group and −3.8 in the ceftriaxone group (mean difference, 0.17 [95% confidence interval, −.59 to .92], which is within the prespecified equivalence margins of −1 to 1 units). Participants in both groups improved equally. Conclusions: Oral doxycycline is equally effective as intravenous ceftriaxone in the treatment of LNB.

		"abstract": "Aim: to determine the association between clinical laboratory parameters, the production of cytokines (IL-17A, -23, -33, -35), and specific IgM and IgG in the serum of patients with Lyme borreliosis without erythema migrans. Patients and Methods: complete blood count, the concentrations of IL-17A, -23, -33, -35, and the levels of specific IgM and IgG were measured during acute infection and convalescence (n=30). The control group included age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (n=30). Statistical analysis was performed using the StatSoft Statistica v 10.0 software (parametric and non-parametric methods and multifactorial analysis, i.e., principal component analysis). Results: most (80%) patients with Lyme borreliosis without erythema migrans are the people of working age. In most patients, the combination of the specific antibodies against Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii (76.7%) and severe intoxication and inflammatory process (100%) were detected. Moderate and severe disease associated with meningism was diagnosed in 90% and 10%, respectively. The mean duration of hectic period was 8.3±1.27 days. Abnormal ECG was reported in 40% of patients, i.e., conduction abnormalities in 20%, sinus bradycardia in 16.7%,and sinus tachycardia in 3.3%. The clinical laboratory signs of hepatitis without jaundice were identified in 26.7%. During treatment, the significant reduction in band and segmented neutrophil counts as well as the significant increase in platelet count were revealed compared to these parameters at admission. Abnormal cytokine levels (i.e., the increase in IL-17A, -23, -33 and the deficiency of IL-35) were detected. Conclusions: multifactorial analysis has demonstrated that the severity of immunological abnormalities in patients with Lyme borreliosis without erythema migrans is associated with fever, cardiac and liver disorders, the high levels of IL-23 and IL-33, and the lack of IL-35 and specific IgM and IgG.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease or borreliosis is presumed one of the most significant vector-borne diseases globally. The disease is re-emerging in numerous parts of world. It has expanded dramatically in newer areas in recent decades. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi yet additionally by other borrelial species, B. afzelii and B. garini which cause diverse clinical syndromes. Spatial distribution and clinical presentations differ depending on the causative species. Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease can be delineated in three stages. The first stage is presented in the form of erythema migrans at the site of tick bite. Early dispersed stage can lead to multiple lesions of erythema migrans, neuroborreliosis, lymphocytoma, arthritis or carditis. The manifestation at later stage shows acordermatitis chronica atrophicans, arthritis and neurological involvement. Diagnosis is challenging owing the several clinical presentations and could require multiple tests. The antibiotics that are currently under use, help in the clearance of bacteria from the affected host and stop further spread of the disease. Although several antibiotics are being used for Lyme disease, doxycycline is the widely used antimicrobial in early stage of the disease. Several attempts have been made to develop a vaccine against Lyme disease, however, none of them have been successfully marketed. The present review discusses clinical manifestations, and advances in diagnosis and control of Lyme disease."

PRR binding sets off a cascade of events that activates immune responses. We now show that, in addition to activating immune responses, PRR signaling also initiates an immunosuppressive response, probably to limit inflammation. The importance of the current findings is that blockade of immunomodulatory signaling, which is mediated by the upregulation of the CD47 molecule, can lead to enhanced immune responses to any pathogen that triggers PRR signaling. Since most or all pathogens trigger PRRs, CD47 blockade could be used to speed up and strengthen both innate and adaptive immune responses when medically indicated. Such immunotherapy could be done without a requirement for knowing the HLA type of the individual, the specific antigens of the pathogen, or, in the case of bacterial infections, the antimicrobial resistance profile."
