The Chikungunya virus which is responsible of several epidemics since 2005 seems to be a virus with a cutaneous tropism. Sexually transmitted diseases are still a public health problem and we shall review the situation for syphilis, lymphogranuloma venereum and the new dynamic profile of HIV in France. Lyme disease has been the subject of consensus conference in France and in the United States. Original clinical presentations in relation with infectious agent will be also presented. We shall give a large place to what I call the toxidermatology. During the year 2007, the role of gadolinium in the nephrogenic systemic fibrosis has been confirmed, many publications have reported the side effects of biotherapies on the skin and we shall emphasize the paradoxical of some of them. Hypersensitivity syndrome and notably the controversial role of viral reactivations has been reported. The relationship between psoriasis and metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular risks has been discussed since 2006. New clinical features have been described and will be presented during this session."

		"abstract": "Whether studying an autoimmune disease directed to the central nervous system (CNS), such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, 1), or the immune response to an infection of the CNS, such as poliomyelitis, Lyme neuroborreliosis, or neurosyphilis, it is often necessary to isolate the CNS-infiltrating immune cells.In this video-protocol we demonstrate how to isolate mononuclear cells (MNCs) from the CNS of a rat with EAE. The first step of this procedure requires a cardiac perfusion of the rodent with a saline solution to ensure that no blood remains in the blood vessels irrigating the CNS. Any blood contamination will artificially increase the number of apparent CNS-infiltrating MNCs and may alter the apparent composition of the immune infiltrate. We then demonstrate how to remove the brain and spinal cord of the rat for subsequent dilaceration to prepare a single-cell suspension. This suspension is separated on a two-layer Percoll gradient to isolate the MNCs. After washing, these cells are then ready to undergo any required procedure. Mononuclear cells isolated using this procedure are viable and can be used for electrophysiology, flow cytometry (FACS), or biochemistry. If the technique is performed under sterile conditions (using sterile instruments in a tissue culture hood) the cells can also be grown in tissue culture medium. A given cell population can be further purified using either magnetic separation procedures or a FACS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the northern hemisphere, producing a wide range of disabling effects on multiple human targets, including the skin, the nervous system, the joints and the heart. Insufficient clinical diagnostic methods, the necessity for prompt antibiotic treatment along with the pervasive nature of infection impel the development and establishment of new clinical diagnostic tools with increased accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The goal of this article is 4-fold: (i) to detail LD infection and pathology, (ii) to review prevalent diagnostic methods, emphasizing inherent problems, (iii) to introduce the usage of in vivo induced antigen technology (IVIAT) in clinical diagnostics and (iv) to underscore the relevance of a novel comprehensive LD diagnostic approach to practitioners of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). Utilization of this analytical method will increase the accuracy of the diagnostic process and abridge the time to treatment, with antibiotics, herbal medicines and nutritional supplements, resulting in improved quality of care and disease prognosis."

		"abstract": "A heart involvement known as Lyme carditis (LC), a consequence of Lyme borreliosis (LB), is relatively rare in contrast to the involvement of skin, joints and nervous system; it accounts for < 4% of all these patients in European countries. However, the diagnosis of the disease belongs to the most difficult challenges. While various forms of AV blocks dominate in the USA as confirmed by the literature, there is a clear predominance of arrhythmias of various incidence in the Czech Republic. The authors of this article focused on the form belonging to the rarest manifestations of LC, namely dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). The goal was to elucidate the etiological participation of Borrelia infection in the development of DCMP, which has attracted controversial opinions so far. In total, 33 patients with DCMP were enrolled in the study, 23 males and 10 females, with mean age 57.7 years (range 24-76 years). ELISA NRLB KC 90 method was used in all blood samples for detection of Borrelia infection (BI), Western blot method was used for confirmation, followed by identification of DNA of pathogenic Borreliae using PCR method. Bioptic material was examined by electronmicroscopy with an attempt to detect Spirochaetae in myocardium. 16 patients were excluded from the study owing to the absence of signs of LB. The study group included 17 patients (3 females, 13 males) with mean age 58 years (range 43-76 years), in whom the presence of Bb was proved by identification of DNA of pathogenic Borreliae or by electronmicroscopic detection of Spirochetae in myocardial bioptic sample. The findings obtained during the study confirmed that BI very probably participated in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. It may be concluded that most of cases were either unapparent forms of LB or insufficiently treated cutaneous forms of this disease."

		"abstract": "Infectious diseases are a part of the history of this region. Devastating epidemics of plague, smallpox, and cholera were frequent during the 18th and the 19th centuries. Other infectious diseases were a serious problem as well: alimentary tract infections, scarlet fever, diphtheria, whooping cough. Geographic position, climate, migrations, as well as the tradition and lack of medical staff and medications, affected the frequency and outcome of infections. Patients with infectious diseases were first treated at home. Later, a hospital in Visarion street was opened as an isolation facility and a hospital for homeless patients. The development of science and the education of medical personnel exerted the greatest influence on the control and later treatment of infectious diseases. These measures resulted in the establishment of the first specialized medical institutions in Novi Sad during the cholera outbreak in 1884. After that, temporary pediatric units were organized for the treatment of scarlet fever, diphtheria and smallpox. A ward for infectious diseases was founded in the The Great City Hospital in the second half of the 19th century (1892). The 20th century was a period of control and eradication of infectious diseases in Vojvodina (smallpox, malaria, diphtheria, polio). Nowdays, major infectious deseases include respiratory, alimentary and parasitic infections. However, new diseases are being registered as well - hemorrhagic fevers, Lyme disease, HIV infection. The Infectologic Service in Novi Sad was developed from an Infectology Departement as part of the Departement of Internal Diseases in the new Provincial Hospital (1909) to the independent Departement for Infectious Diseases (1945). Today, Clinic of lnfectious Diseases is an integral part of the Clinical Center of Vojvodina. The Department of Infectious Diseases of the Faculty of Medicine in Novi Sad was founded in 1960. Undergraduate studies started in 1963/64 for students of medicine and in 1978/79 jor dentistry students. Today. the faculty of the Department takes part in undergraduate studies of medicine, dentistry, health care, as well as in graduate programs. The faculty members are also taking part in specialization programs at the Faculty of Medicine. Infectious disease physicians are involved in the activities of the Infectology Section (founded in 1979) of the Society of Physicians of Vojvodine of the Medical Society of Serbia. The first president of the Infectology Section was Dr. Vera Mudrić, professor, infectologists, whereas Dr. Grozdana Canak, professor, was the vice-president from 2000-2004. The Infectology Section collaborates with various national and international societies for infectious diseases."

Diagnostic criteria, important comorbidities, and principles of management are summarized with identification of antiinflammatory, immunosuppressive, and cytokine-specific biological agents and their relative uses. Other categories of chronic arthritis are also discussed, including infection-associated reactive arthritis, Lyme disease, joint disease of inflammatory bowel disease, as well as chronic arthritis as a dimension of other autoimmune diseases. In addition to the biomedical dimension of these disorders, the psychological impact and developmental context of persistent pain and musculoskeletal abnormality in adolescents are commented on."

One of the immunodominant Borrelia antigens that elicit a strong and early immune response is FlaB, making it appropriate for recombinant protein based serological diagnostic tests. Borrelia burgdorferi genomic DNA was isolated and used as a template for the amplification of the flaB gene. The gene was cloned in the expression vector pGEX-2T. The amplified flaB gene was cloned in the expression vector yielding a GST-FlaB fusion gene. The gene ligated in-frame was expressed as the recombinant GST-FlaB protein. After visualization by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis the successful expression of the FlaB protein was confirmed by immunoblotting. The expression and purification of the recombinant FlaB protein is a prerequisite for obtaining large amounts of the product through a simple and labour-free procedure, which will facilitate the diagnosis of Lyme disease."

Children with neuroborreliosis and other neurological diseases were admitted to the University Hospital during 2005-2006 without any selection. Of these 9 patients, there were seven males and two females, ranging in age between 3-17 years. Neurological diagnostic was performed using ELISA Biomedica kit and western blot bands. A 2-6 week sequential treatment with either i.v. ceftazidime or amoxicillin and oral doxycycline or amoxicillin was provided. Children were monitored regularly during the next 4-24 months. The 9 children with borreliosis constitute 0.53% of the pediatric neurology department's patients. The clinical manifestation of LD were usual and unusual from patient to patient. They included three cases of facial nerve paralysis (with bilateral paralysis in one case). In two cases, they included transverse myelitis and in a single case, hemiparesis, meningitis and acute ataxia. Typically, other patients with early stage borreliosis first manifest focal seizures, raising the suspicion that borreliosis could be responsible for triggering seizures. The antibiotic treatment was successful in 7 patients and only partially effective in 2 children with facial nerve paralysis. The most common symptom of neuroborreliosis in children is motor dysfunction. Acute ataxia may be a clinical presentation of neuroborreliosis. It is probable that borreliosis_triggers seizures in children with EEG abnormalities."

Relevant recent articles were searched using PubMed and Google search tools. This is a review of the biological, genetic and physiological features of the spirochete species group, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In spite of a lot of recent articles focused on B. burgdorferi sensu lato, many features of Borrelia biology remain obscure.

The only clinical cardiac abnormality found was that of second-degree atrioventricular block. At autopsy, a diffuse carditis, characterized by infiltrates of macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils and primarily in an interstitial, endocardial, and perivascular distribution, was found. Serologic testing from blood drawn on the day before his death demonstrated IgG and IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi, confirmed by Western blot. Postmortem polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed in myocardial tissue amplified B. burgdorferi DNA encoding outer-surface protein A.

The incidence rate per year per 1,000,000 population was 0.36 for dengue fever, 0.04 for Japanese encephalitis, 0.38 for Japanese spotted fever, 0.08 for Lyme disease, 0.74 for malaria, and 3.50 for scrub typhus. There were no cases of dengue fever or malaria derived from domestic infections. The yearly incidence rate increased for dengue fever and Japanese spotted fever, and declined for malaria and scrub typhus. The proportion of cases reported in Tokyo was 44% for dengue fever and 37% for malaria. The number of prefectures reporting one or more cases of Japanese spotted fever increased in western Japan. The cases of scrub typhus increased in autumn-winter in prefectures of eastern Japan, and increased both in autumn-winter and spring in western prefectures. The study reveals the epidemiologic features of both temporal and geographic distributions of cases of 6 vector-borne diseases in Japan, 2000-2005."

A total of 1699 ticks Ixodes ricinus, including 1422 nymphs, 277 adult forms and 2862 mosquito females representing the genera Aedes (89.6%) and Culex (10.4%) were collected between the years 2004 and 2005. A further 3746 larvae and 1596 pupae of Culex pipiens pipiens were colleted from water bodies. Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. was detected in the arthropods by the method of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). A positive immunological reaction was detected in 16.6% of the adult forms and in 16.5% of the nymphs of Ixodes ricinus. Spirochetes were also detected in 1.7% of mosquito females, 3.2% of larvae and in 1.6% of pupae of Culex pipiens pipiens. The results of the present study confirm that contact with ticks constitutes the main risk of contracting Lyme disease, although mosquitoes play a role as vectors as well."

Therefore, it is often wrongly diagnosed and unnecessarily treated. In this paper we analyzed the latest data on Lyme disease diagnostic methods, paying much attention to their limitations and correct interpretation of results. In routine diagnosis of this diseases, indirect tests, based on the detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies, are most useful. The Lyme disease diagnosis should begin with screening tests, which are highly sensitive but not specific enough and sometimes yield false positive results, then all positive results should be verified by confirmation tests, which allow to distinguish between true positive results and healthy individuals with false positive ones."

In a dense woodland, human behaviors involving contact with wood were recently found to pose greater risk for encountering I. pacificus nymphs than behaviors entailing exclusive exposure to leaf litter. A four-year follow-up study was undertaken in the same woodland and, as a comparison area in one year only, in a nearby woodland-grass habitat to explore the biotic and abiotic factors that might elevate human exposure to host-seeking nymphs. Nymphs were active in the dense woodland throughout the daytime, but no consistent pattern of activity was observed with respect to time of day, temperature, or relative humidity. Significantly more nymphs were collected from the southern aspects of dense-woodland trunks than from other aspects, and more nymphs quested at a height of < or = 1 m vs 1-2 m aboveground. The prevalence of bacterial infection in ticks from the dense woodland was highly variable among years, with maxima of 22.6% and 42.9% for Bb, and 15.6% and 1.8% for Ap, in nymphs from logs and trunks, respectively. The mean densities of nymphs, and of Bb- or Ap-infected nymphs, were typically higher on logs and trunks than in adjoining leaf litter or grass in both habitats. The acarologic risk of encountering an infected nymph on dense-woodland logs or trunks was 2.8 to 11 times higher for Bb than for Ap in two of three years, and it was usually higher in dense woodland than in woodland-grass for both agents. Coinfections were rare (0.27%, n = 369 nymphs from both habitats). Individuals having prolonged contact with logs or trunks in spring would be well advised to employ personal protective measures to minimize exposure to I. pacificus nymphs and their attendant bacterial zoonotic agents."

Lack of reliable data for probable pathogen exposure site has emerged as a major obstacle to the development of predictive spatial risk models. Although plague case investigations can serve as a model for how to ideally generate needed information, this comprehensive approach is cost-prohibitive for more common and less severe diseases. New methods are urgently needed to determine probable pathogen exposure sites that will yield reliable results while taking into account economic and time constraints of the public health system and attending physicians. Recent data demonstrate the need for a change from use of the county spatial unit for presentation of incidence of vectorborne diseases to more precise ZIP code or census tract scales. Such fine-scale spatial risk patterns can be communicated to the public and medical community through Web-mapping approaches."

Recent finding of ospE genes also in B. garinii isolates has raised the question whether, under in vivo-conditions, B. garinii also expresses OspE proteins and consequently induces an antibody response. We set up an IgG ELISA by using recombinant OspE as an antigen. Sixty percent of acute and 64% of convalescent 25 erythema migrans patient samples were positive for anti-OspE antibodies. Anti-OspE antibodies were also found in the sera (83.6%) and cerebrospinal fluids (36%) of patients with neuroborreliosis. Since B. garinii is the major causative agent of neuroborreliosis, the result suggests that OspE is expressed by B. garinii in vivo. Of the 10 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans patients, 80% had anti-OspE antibodies. Anti-OspE antibody positive sera inhibited factor H binding to Borrelia more efficiently than normal control sera (65% vs. 33.7%). Our results indicate that Borrelia spirochetes, including B. garinii, can induce the production of anti-OspE antibodies. This implies that OspE protein is produced in vivo by B. garinii possibly enabling it to escape complement and cause a CNS infection."

		"abstract": "Little is known about the long-term persistence of specific antibodies (Ab) in natural host-parasite systems despite its potential epidemiological and ecological importance. In long-lived species, knowledge of the dynamics of individual immunological profiles can be important not only for interpreting serology results, but also for assessing transmission dynamics and the potential selective pressures acting on parasites. The aim of this paper was to investigate temporal variation in levels of specific Ab against the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in adults of a long-lived colonial seabird, the Black-legged Kittiwake Rissa tridactyla. In wild populations, adults are naturally exposed each breeding season to a Borrelia vector, the tick Ixodes uriae. Breeding birds were captured during four consecutive breeding seasons, and parasite infestation quantified. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblots, we found that the immunological profiles of anti-Borrelia Ab were highly repeatable among years, reflecting the interannual persistence of Ab levels. We nevertheless also observed that year-to-year changes of Ab levels were related to exposure to ticks in the previous year. The long-term persistence of Ab levels may be an important mechanism of individual protection against future exposure to the microparasite. It will also affect the availability of susceptible hosts, and thus the transmission dynamics of the bacterium. These results illustrate the need to consider the dynamics of the immune response in order to better understand the evolutionary ecology of host-parasite interactions in natural populations."

The purpose of this study was to determine the production of antibodies in a defined group of patients. The study analysed antibodies in the group of 25 patients with erythema migrans. For the detection of antibodies Immunofluorescence methods, ELISA and Western blot were used. The detection of antibodies by Imunoflorescence methods proved positivity of the titre 1:256 in 14 patients and 9 patients were borderline, with the titre 1:128. Majority of the antibodies detected were of IgM class. The ELISA IgM test found positive reaction in 12 patients and 2 borderline results. IgG antibodies were found significantly more often by ELISA test than by Immunofluorescence. The Western blotting results were IgM positive in 9 patients, 6 were borderline. Only 5 patients have positive IgM results in all tests (Immunofluorescence, ELISA and at least one positive result out of three IgM Western blots). The tests which detect Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies are not standardized. They have variable sensitivity and specificity and their standardization is complicated with respect to great heterogenicity of Borrelia burgdorferi strains circulating in individual regions of Europe. The high specificity of antibodies to individual borrelia antigens are presently pointing towards the need to use, when in diagnostic confusion, more tests, which could detect antibodies also to other borrelia antigens (Tab. 3, Ref. 14).

Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1) is an important anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine and its deficient synthesis is linked to exaggerated inflammation and immune response. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 25 patients with Lyme borreliosis and 6 controls were incubated for 7 days with suspension of Borrelia afzeli, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto spirochetes. TGF-beta1 concentration in culture supernatants was measured with ELISA. Results were analyzed according to disease duration (group I--chronic borreliosis, n=20; group II--early borreliosis, n=5) and clinical form (LA--arthritis, NB--neuroborreliosis). TGF-beta1 concentration was increased in supernatants of PBMC cultures of patients with early neuroborreliosis, in comparison with chronic borreliosis and controls. In chronic, but not in early borreliosis, there was a tendency for decrease of TGF-beta1 synthesis under stimulation with B. burgdorferi spirochetes. Impaired synthesis of TGF-beta1 by mononuclear cells seems to be present in patients with chronic forms of Lyme borreliosis when compared to those with early stage of the disease. It may be a factor contributing to the persistence of inadequate inflammatory response in patients in whom chronic form of the disease develops."

Using gene array-based differential analysis of B. burgdorferi gene expression and quantitative reverse trancription-polymerase chain reaction, we identified two paralogous spirochete genes, bmpA and bmpB, that are preferentially up-regulated in mouse joints compared with other organs. Transfer of affinity-purified antibodies against either BmpA or BmpB into B. burgdorferi-infected mice selectively reduced spirochete numbers and inflammation in the joints. B. burgdorferi lacking bmpA/B were therefore generated to further explore the role of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi lacking bmpA/B were infectious in mice, but unable to persist in the joints, and they failed to induce severe arthritis. Complementation of the mutant spirochetes with a wild-type copy of the bmpA and bmpB genes partially restored the original phenotype. These data delineate a role for differentially produced B. burgdorferi antigens in spirochete colonization of mouse joints, and suggest new strategies for the treatment of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Host complement is widely distributed throughout mammalian body fluids and can be activated immediately as part of the first line of defense against invading pathogens. The agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), is naturally resistant to that innate immune defense system of its hosts. One resistance mechanism appears to involve binding fluid-phase regulators of complement to distinct borrelial outer surface molecules known as CRASPs (complement regulator acquiring surface proteins). Using sensitive molecular biology techniques, expression patterns of all three classes of genes encoding the CRASPs of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (BbCRASPs) have been analyzed throughout the natural tick-mammal infection cycle. Each class shows a different expression profile in vivo and the results are summarized herein. Studies on the expression of B. burgdorferi genes using animal models of infection have advanced our knowledge on the ability of the causative agent to circumvent innate immune defenses, the contributions of CRASPs to spirochete infectivity, and the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Serological diagnosis of Lyme disease may be complicated by antigenic differences between infecting organisms and those used as test references. Accordingly, it would be helpful to include antigens whose sequences are well conserved by a broad range of Lyme disease spirochetes. In the present study, line blot analyses were performed using recombinant complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 2 (BbCRASP-2) from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 and serum samples from human Lyme disease patients from throughout the United States and Germany. The results indicated that a large proportion of the patients had produced antibodies recognizing recombinant BbCRASP-2. In addition, Lyme disease spirochetes isolated from across North America and Europe were found to contain genes encoding proteins with high degrees of similarity to the B. burgdorferi type strain B31 BbCRASP-2, consistent with the high percentage of serologically positive patients. These data indicate that BbCRASP-2 may be valuable for use in a widely effective serological assay."

Neuroimaging studies revealed tiny calcifications with atrophy of the cerebrum, pons, and midbrain in 1 patient, cerebral atrophy in another, and cerebral atrophy and periventricular white matter hyperintensities in the third. Clinical diagnoses included cortico-pontine-cerebellar degeneration, mixed neurodegenerative disorder, progressive supranuclear palsy, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Lyme disease. One atrophic brain revealed widely disseminated, millimeter-sized gray lesions in cerebral white matter and obscured anatomic markings of the basis pontis. The most conspicuous microscopic feature in all was capillaries with focally piled up endothelial nuclei, some of which appeared to be multinucleated, or enlarged, hyperchromatic crescentic single nuclei. Although seen mostly without associated damage, they were also noted with white matter lesions displaying vacuolation, demyelination, spheroids, necrosis, vascular fibrosis, and mineralization; these were most severe in the basis pontis. Immunostains and probes to herpes simplex virus-I, -II, and -8; adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr virus, measles, JC virus, and herpes hominis virus-6 were negative. Electron microscopy revealed no virions in endothelial cells with multilobed or multiple nuclei and duplicated basal laminae. However, mycoplasma-like bodies, mostly 400 to 600 nm in size, were found in endothelial cell cytoplasm and capillary lumina. Platelets adhered to affected endothelial cells. Polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry of fixed samples for Mycoplasma fermentans were negative; other species of Mycoplasma remain viable pathogenic candidates."

This suggested a requirement for lymphocytes in the development of subacute Lyme arthritis in TLR2(-/-) mice, a feature not commonly associated with this arthritis. The increased pathology of B. burgdorferi-infected TLR2(-/-) mice was also accompanied by an increase in mononuclear cell infiltration. In this study, T cells were found to be responsible for the increase in mononuclear cells in infected TLR2(-/-) C3H mice. Accordingly, transcripts for the IFN-inducible T cell chemokines, CXCL9 and CXCL10, were greatly enhanced in joint tissue from TLR2(-/-) mice, as were transcripts for a prototypical IFN-inducible gene IFN-gamma-induced GTPase (igtp). Treatment of murine synovial cells with sonicated B. burgdorferi resulted in induction of transcripts for chemokines and other IFN-inducible genes, irrespective of the presence of TLR2. The presence of T lymphocytes greatly enhanced the transcriptional response of synovial cells. These results suggest that the increased inflammatory cell infiltration in TLR2(-/-) C3H mice is the result of localized overproduction of T cell attracting chemokines."

Lack of selectins or their ligands causes severe complications, such as chronic inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of selectins sL, sE and sP in the development and course of neuroborreliosis in the form of meningitis. We have also analyzed the influence of treatment on changes of selectins' concentration in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. We have analyzed 17 patients with neuroborreliosis presenting as meningitis, in whom we measured by immunoenzymatic method concentration of selectins sL, sP and sE in blood and cerebrospinal fluid before and after 4-week therapy with cefotaxim. We used Human sL-selectin, Human sE-selectin and Human sP-selectin kits produced by Bender Med. Systems, Austria. Control group for measurement of concentration of selectins in serum consisted of 8 healthy patients. Control group for measurement of concentration of selectins in cerebrospinal fluid consisted of 8 patients, in whom lumbar puncture excluded inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. In serum concentration of selectins sL and sP was significantly higher comparing to control group. After treatment concentration of these selectins decreased, but still was significantly higher than in control group. Only concentration of selectin sE was significantly lower than in control group and after treatment decreased further remaining lower comparing to control group. In cerebrospinal fluid concentration of selectin sL was significantly higher comparing to control group and increased after treatment. Concentration of selectins sE and sP increased before treatment and decreased after treatment, but still remained elevated comparing to control group. Persistence of increased concentration of selectins sP and sL in serum and also of selectin sE in cerebrospinal fluid in patients with neuroborreliosis after completed antibiotic therapy and regression of clinical symptoms can suggest permanence of chronic inflammatory state in consequence of survival of B. burgdorferi spirochetes in affected tissues."

The target of the RFLP-genotyping was the heterogeneous plasmid located ospA gene, thus we developed a method able to detect and differentiate between six clinically relevant Borrelia genospecies circulating in Europe, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. bissettii and B. spielmanii. In this study Borrelia DNA could be detected by PCR in at least one specimen of each patient, except in one case of neuroborreliosis (NB); blood samples gave the highest sensitivity in all patient groups. The genotyping indicated that B. afzelii was present in 8 patients with skin involvement, B. garinii in 2 cases of NB and 4 cases with skin involvement, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto was detected in one patient with skin involvement and another with Lyme arthritis. Different Borrelia species in distinct specimens were identified in one patient with EM. The RFLP analysis of 11 patients revealed mixed patterns, which suggested pluri-infection with different Borrelia species."

Tissues from 74 red deers were evaluated and the presence of B. burgdorferi s.1 DNA was identified using nested PCR technique based on fla gene. The identification of species belonging to B. burgdorferi s.1 complex was performed after restriction digestion of nested PCR product with Ddel enzyme and sequencing of nested PCR product. The study included also 55 isolates of I. ricinus females removed from red deer and 466 ticks (73 adult and 393 nymphs) collected from the vegetation in the area where the red deer lives. There were no DNA of B. burgdorferi s.1 complex in the red deer tissues and in ticks removed from deer, however in one tick removed from deer the DNA of other Borrelia species--B. miyamotoi was identified. In ticks collected from vegetation 3 species belonging to B. burgdorferi s.1. complex were identified: B. garinii (3.2% ticks studied), B. afzelii (6.9%) and B. valaisiana (3.6%), however DNA of B. miyamotoi was absent. These results confirm inability of survival of B. burgdorferi s.1. species in tick I. ricinus feeding on red deer blood. However there is a possibility of survival of B. miyamotoi in presence of deer blood at least in ticks feeding on red deer. The main role of red deer in keeping the constant infection level of B. burgdorferi s.1. in the whole population of I. ricinus ticks does not concern B. miyamotoi."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (BL) is a multisystem infectious tick-transmitted disease. The diversity of Borrelia burgdorferi is the reason for a wide spectrum of dermatological and ophthalmologic presentations between patients from Europe and from other countries. In Europe, the main manifestations are dermatological. During the early stage, the diagnosis is clinical: finding erythema migrans (EM) a few days after a tick bite is sufficient; several EM mean an early-disseminated disease. Borrelial lymphocytoma (only in Europe) is a solitary nodule or plaque (earlobe, nipple, scrotum), which appears during the second stage. The diagnosis relies on clinical and histological findings (B-cell infiltration) and a positive serological test. It is sometimes difficult to make the difference between BL and B-cell lymphoma and pseudo lymphoma; an empirical antibiotic trial period will be helpful for the diagnosis in this case. During the late stage, the clinical evolution of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is progressive: inflammatory then atrophic lesions appear, often on the hands, limbs, or feet. The diagnosis is made on histological findings (T-cell infiltration) and a positive serological test. The relationship between BL and morphea or lichen sclerosus was not demonstrated according to the latest reports. Ocular manifestations are rare events occurring during every stage of the disease. A wide spectrum of presentations is possible (uveitis and optic neuritis). BL is responsible for ocular infection or inflammation. A neurological presentation is often associated with the ocular manifestation. Proving the diagnosis is often difficult because of these polymorphous manifestations."

Months after Bb infection, approximately 60% of patients experience intermittent arthritic attacks, a condition that in some individuals progresses to chronic joint inflammation. Although mice develop acute arthritis in response to Bb infection, the joint inflammation clears after 2 wk, despite continuous infection, only very rarely presenting with chronic Lyme arthritis. Thus, the lack of an animal system has so far prevented the elucidation of this persistent inflammatory process that occurs in humans. In this study, we report that the majority of Bb-infected CD28-/- mice develop chronic Lyme arthritis. Consistent with observations in chronic Lyme arthritis patients, the infected mutant, but not wild-type mice present recurring monoarticular arthritis over an extended time period, as well as anti-outer surface protein A of Bb serum titers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that anti-outer surface protein A Abs develop in these mice only after establishment of chronic Lyme arthritis. Thus, the Bb-infected CD28-/- mice provide a murine model for studying chronic Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Turkey's tick fauna is composed of about 32 species in two families and ten genera in mammals, reptiles, and birds. The ticks of veterinary significance in the family Ixodidae comprise seven genera with 28 different species. Ixodes spp. are mostly seen in northern Turkey. It is likely that the high rainfall and the intensive forest in this area may contribute to this observation. To date, the following species have been found to be sporadically present: Amblyomma variegatum in Hatay province (border to Syria), Boophilus kohlsi in southeastern Turkey (border of Syria), Ornithodorus in Central and East Anatolia, and Otobius megnini in East Anatolia (Malatya Province). Ticks of the genera Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, Boophilus, Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, and Argas are widespread throughout Anatolia. Thus, their role in the epidemiology of important human and livestock diseases such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Lyme disease, and diseases caused by hemoparasites needs to be examined in greater detail."

At least 3 serial serum samples from 41 patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis and 23 patients with antibiotic-responsive arthritis, and samples from 10 non-antibiotic-treated, historical control patients were tested for IgG reactivity with B burgdorferi sonicate and 4 differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins of the spirochete, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among non-antibiotic-treated patients, antibody titers to B burgdorferi antigens remained high throughout a 2-5-year period of arthritis. In contrast, in patients with antibiotic-responsive arthritis, in whom joint swelling usually resolved during a 1-month course of oral antibiotic therapy, the median antibody titers to most of the spirochetal antigens remained steady or decreased during the first 1-3 months after starting antibiotic therapy. In patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis, who had persistent joint swelling for a median duration of 10 months despite 2-3 months of oral or intravenous antibiotics, the median titers to most antigens increased slightly during the first 1-3 months. However, by 4-6 months after starting antibiotic therapy, reactivity with all antigens declined similarly in both antibiotic-treated groups. Whereas the antibody titers to B burgdorferi remained high in non-antibiotic-treated patients, the titers declined similarly 4-6 months after starting therapy in patients with antibiotic-responsive or antibiotic-refractory arthritis, suggesting that synovial inflammation persisted in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis after the period of infection."

Registers exist in Norway on all reported communicable diseases (The Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases [MSIS]) and disability pension diagnoses (The Norwegian Directorate of Labour and Welfare). Geographic distributions of borreliosis and changes over time are presented. Disability pensions (coded by International Classification of Diseases [ICD]) in the period 1998-2005, in which borreliosis was used as the primary or secondary diagnosis (ICD-10), were compared with MSIS-data for borreliosis on municipal and county levels. Borreliosis was the cause of disability pensions in 55 cases. The Vestfold and Agder counties had the highest number of cases. Larvik municipality had 9 cases, Arendal had four and Kristiansand had nine cases. The annual rates of new disability pensions caused by borreliosis were low but increasing in the period 1998-2005. The disability pension rates tended to reflect changes in the number of MSIS-reported cases, with pensions changing 1-2 years after MSIS-changes. Most MSIS-reported cases are in the Agder and Telemark counties. Disability pension are rarely caused by borreliosis. The annual incidence of disability pensions seems to reflect the number of MSIS-reported cases of borreliosis. The Agder and Vestfold counties have the highest incidence."

This article summarizes data from 18 continuous years of tick submissions during which >24,000 ticks of 14 species were identified. Data provided include tick stage, degree of engorgement, seasonal abundance, geographical location, host, and age of the person from whom the tick was removed. Maps depict the distributions of the three major species submitted. I. scapularis emerged first along the coast, and then it advanced inland up major river valleys, Dermacentor variabilis Say slowly expanded centrifugally from where it was initially reported in southwestern Maine, and the distribution of long-established Ixodes cookei Packard remained unchanged. Submissions of nymphal I. scapularis closely correlated with reported Lyme diseases cases at the county level. Annual fluctuations of nymphal submissions in Maine correlated with those of Lyme disease cases for New England, supporting the possibility of a regional influence on tick abundance. More ticks were removed from people < or =14 and > or =30 yr of age, and their degree of engorgement was greatest in people < or =20 yr of age and progressively increased in people > or =30 yr of age. This study demonstrates the usefulness and potential of tick identification programs."

Arthritis is one of the common manifestations of B. burgdorferi infection. The pathomechanism of articular changes in Lyme arthritis has not yet been elucidated. Histopathological studies of synovia and immunological changes are similar to rheumatoid arthritis. In the early stage of inflammation B. burgdorferi interact with polynuclear granulocytes and epithelial cells, triggering production of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation products and other inflammatory mediators. The imbalance between anabolic and catabolic processes in inflamed joints results in the progressive destruction of articular cartilage and disintegration of extracellular matrix. Molecular mimicry between OspA (outer surface protein A) and adhesion molecule LFA-1alpha seems to be responsible for chronic arthritis."

In group Lyme arthritis coincidence (p < 0.0002), with IgM antibodies was stated. Test ELISA C6 (with protein VlsE-C6) in group of patients with Lyme borreliosis had statistically essential predictive values of presence antibodies in IgM i IgG class, stated in tests performed separately for IgM and IgG classes with recombinant antigens. Tests based on conservative part of protein VlsE (C6), detecting antibodies in both classes are very promising in diagnosis of early stages Lyme borreliosis."

At the same time, the world wide climate effects of the \"El Niño Southern Oscillation\" are amplified. Global warming enhances the growth of tropical pathogens (malarial plasmodia, leishmania, yellow fever virus, dengue virus, West Nile virus, Vibrio cholerae) and vectors (anopheles, aedes, culex, and phlebotomus mosquitos; hard ticks). Global warming may lead to the emergence of diseases which at present are not endemic in Germany, like West Nile fever, Dengue fever, or Leishmaniases, and to enhanced transmission of borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis. Malaria and cholera, in contrast, are influenced more strongly by socioeconomic factors. Improved surveillance and intensified research on the relationship between climate change and infectious diseases is needed."

In a cohort of 45 patients with neuroborreliosis, diagnosed between January 1998 and January 2005, 3 had acute myelitis. Clinical, biological and radiological data were studied. The three patients had motor, sensorial and sphincter involvement. Extra-spinal involvement, such as fever and headache for one, facial nerve palsy for the second and subarachnoid hemorrhage for the third, was also noted. Pleocytosis varied from 10 to 520 white cells per mm3. Lyme serology was positive in CSF for all. Intrathecal anti-Borrelia antibody index was positive or intermediate for all three patients. Spinal cord MRI revealed a large hyperintense zone involving more than 3 vertebral segments. Myelitis was central, posterior or transverse in the axial plane. The clinical course was favorable after a three-week course of appropriate antibiotics. These 3 cases and the others from the literature show the diversity of the clinical and radiological features of acute myelitis: transverse, central or posterior myelitis. Thus, Lyme serology in CSF in indicated for patients presenting acute myelitis, particularly in endemic areas."

Etiological verification of Lyme borreliosis (LB) was performed using immune-enzyme test systems for detection of IgG and IgM antibodies to Borellia burgdorferi (NOVATEC Immunodiagnostica, Germany). Thirty-eight subjects constituted the meningeal TBE group; the febrile TBE group consisted of 25 subjects. NELB was diagnosed in 20 subjects. Immunological tests were performed on days 1-7, 8-14, 15-21, and 22-28 of the disease. The study found that primary T-lymphocytes prevailed at early stages during the acute period of febrile TBE. In NELB, secondary T-lymphocytes were registered beginning from days 15-21. Meningeal TBE was characterized by a deep reduction in IFNgamma-producing CD3+ lymphocyte reserve."

		"abstract": "Numerous vertebrate reservoirs have been described for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), which includes the etiological agents of Lyme Borreliosis (LB). The Siberian chipmunk (Tamias sibiricus) is a rodent originating from Asia, where it is suspected to be a B. burgdorferi reservoir. It has been intentionally released into the wild in Europe since the 1970s, but has not yet been subject to any study regarding its association with the LB agent. In this paper we studied Siberian chipmunk infestation with the LB vector (Ixodes ricinus) and infection prevalence by LB spirochetes in a suburban introduced population. We compared these findings with known competent reservoir hosts, the bank vole (Myodes [clethrionomys] glareolus) and wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). All Siberian chipmunks were infested with larvae and larval abundance was higher in this species (mean number of larvae [95% Confidence Interval]: 73.5 [46.0, 117.2]) than in the two other rodent species (bank voles: 4.4 [3.0, 6.3] and wood mice: 10.2 [4.9, 21.2]). Significant factors affecting abundance of larvae were host species and sampling season. Nymphs were most prevalent on chipmunks (86.2%, mean: 5.1 [3.3, 8.0]), one vole carried only two nymphs, and none of the mice had any nymphs. Nymph abundance in chipmunks was affected by sampling season and sex. Furthermore, the infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi sl in the Siberian chipmunk was the highest (33.3%) and predominantly of B. afzelii. The infection prevalence was 14.1% in bank voles, but no wood mouse was found to be infected. Our results suggest that the Siberian chipmunk may be an important reservoir host for LB."

		"abstract": "Human contact with cats, dogs, and other pets results in several million infections each year in the United States, ranging from self-limited skin conditions to life-threatening systemic illnesses. Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common pet-related parasitic infections. Although toxoplasmosis is usually asymptomatic or mild, it may cause serious congenital infection if a woman is exposed during pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Common pet-borne fungal infections include tinea corporis/capitis (ringworm); campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis are among the most common bacterial infections associated with pet ownership. Less commonly, pets can transmit arthropod-borne and viral illnesses (e.g., scabies, rabies). Infection in a pet can provide sentinel warning of local vectors and endemic conditions, such as Lyme disease risk. Treatment is infection-specific, although many infections are self-limited. Prevention involves common sense measures such as adequate hand washing, proper disposal of animal waste, and ensuring that infected animals are diagnosed and treated. Special precautions are indicated for immunocompromised persons. Increased communication between primary care physicians and veterinarians could improve treatment and prevention of these conditions."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes scapularis is an efficient vector for microbes, including the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi. Ticks engorging on vertebrates induce recruitment of inflammatory cells to the bite site. For efficient transmission to the vector, pathogens have to traffic through this complex feeding site while avoiding the deleterious effects of immune cells. We show that a tick protein, Salp25D, plays a critical role-in the mammalian host-for acquisition of Borrelia burgdorferi by the vector. Silencing salp25D in tick salivary glands impaired spirochete acquisition by ticks engorging on B. burgdorferi-infected mice. Immunizing mice against Salp25D also decreased Borrelia acquisition by I. scapularis. Salp25D detoxified reactive oxygen species at the vector-pathogen-host interface, thereby providing a survival advantage to B. burgdorferi at the tick feeding site in mice. These data demonstrate that pathogens can exploit arthropod molecules to defuse mammalian responses in order to successfully enter the vector."

		"abstract": "The detection of antibody to the Borrelia burgdorferi C6 peptide by use of enzyme-linked immunoassays is a widely accepted method for the diagnosis of Lyme disease spirochete infection in dogs and in humans. Antibody to the C6 peptide is highly specific for B. burgdorferi and declines following treatment of dogs and humans exposed to B. burgdorferi. A quantitative assay for determining C6 antibody levels was developed and used to measure changes in antibody levels following antibiotic treatment of B. burgdorferi antibody-positive nonclinical dogs. One hundred thirty-two client-owned dogs were used in the study; 64 were negative, 53 of 68 positive animals received treatment, and 15 were untreated controls. Test sera were collected at 3, 6, and 12 months from seropositive dogs receiving treatment and untreated controls. Dogs in the treated group were assigned to moderate-to-high (> or =29 U/ml)- and low (<29 U/ml)-C6-level groups because the change in the C6 level after treatment was dependent on the level prior to treatment. There were significant declines in the 30 dogs with moderate-to-high initial C6 levels that exceeded the maximal declines of the untreated control dogs in all cases at 6 months (16 data points) and 12 months (29 data points) posttreatment. There was little change in C6 level following antibiotic therapy in the 23 dogs with low initial C6 levels. The quantitative C6 antibody test can be used to measure changes in C6 antibody levels following treatment of antibody-positive nonclinical dogs."

The value for inflammatory joint diseases without standardized rating mechanisms was, however, unknown until recently. The exemplary use of the synovitis score in four cases all including recurrent bruises of the knee joint portrays its value for diagnosis and therapy. Usage of the score includes assessing the enlargement of the lining layer, cellular density of synovial stroma and leucocyte infiltration by giving each a score of 0-3 points and adding them. Presence of high-grade synovitis (>or=4 points) in all cases displayed the reason for the joint bruises within a primarily inflammatory, rheumatoid circle. In this report we show the broad variety of uses for the synovitis score dealing with cases of Lyme arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, seronegative monarthritis and HLA-B27-positive peripheral arthritis."

Invasive plants and animals such as Scotch broom, zebra mussels, and gypsy moths continue to cause environmental damage and economic losses in agriculture and forestry. Rodents transmit diseases and cause major pre- and postharvest losses, especially in less affluent countries. Each of these problems might benefit from the developing field of Genetic Pest Management that is conceptually based on principles of evolutionary biology. This article briefly describes the history of this field, new molecular tools in this field, and potential applications of those tools. There will be a need for evolutionary biologists to interact with researchers and practitioners in a variety of other fields to determine the most appropriate targets for genetic pest management, the most appropriate methods for specific targets, and the potential of natural selection to diminish the effectiveness of genetic pest management. In addition to producing environmentally sustainable pest management solutions, research efforts in this area could lead to new insights about the evolution of selfish genetic elements in natural systems and will provide students with the opportunity to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the role of evolutionary biology in solving societal problems."

The presence of tick mouthparts in an insect bite lesion is also evocative of a tick bite. If the diagnosis of lymphocytoma cutis is based on histology, only pathological clinical and biological findings will rule out a Centro follicular cutaneous B cell lymphoma. Plasma cells and ectatic vessels of cutaneous sclerous lesions may suggest acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Articular lesions are characterized by non-specific hypertrophic synovitis and peripheral nervous lesions by axonal neuropathy. Moreover, in situ characterization of spirochetes by silver stains or immunohistochemistry is not available in routine."

The odds ratio for the co-exposure of individual dogs to B vinsonii berkhoffii and A phagocytophilum was 18.2. None of the diseases was associated with the sex of the dogs, whether they slept out of doors, or whether tick-preventive measures were taken. When the villages were assessed for landscape risk factors, a particularly high seroprevalence for B vinsonii berkhoffii and A phagocytophilum was observed in a village at a relatively high altitude and greater distance from the Pacific coast, and montane hardwood conifer woodland was most associated with a high seroprevalence for these two pathogens."

Cases with leptomeningeal involvement reported in the literature mostly do not discuss the definition of CLL-associated meningeosis and the exclusion of neuroborreliosis. We present the case of a 75-year-old male patient who was admitted to a rural hospital with ataxia, disorientation, and signs of progressive CLL disease. He was diagnosed of suspicious meningeosis leukemica, and treatment was started with dexamethasone for leukemic CNS involvement. When referred to our center, careful immunophenotyping of the CNS lymphocytes as well as assessment for infectious causes of lymphocytic meningitis led to the diagnosis of Lyme disease/neuroborreliosis. An antibiotic regimen with ceftriaxone for 3 weeks resulted in complete remission of all symptoms. There was no need for CLL treatment. In conclusion, this case report should alert clinicians that lymphocytic meningeal involvement in CLL patients accounts for the rare leukemic meningeosis only if cerebrospinal fluid cells show a predominating immunophenotype of typical BCLL cells, i.e. by flow cytometry, and if any infectious cause including Lyme disease has been ruled out."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, undergoes rapid adaptive gene expression in response to environmental signals encountered during different stages of its life cycle in the arthropod vector or the mammalian host. Among all the plasmid-encoded genes of B. burgdorferi, several linear plasmid 54 (lp54)-encoded open reading frames (ORFs) exhibit the greatest differential expression in response to mammalian host-specific temperature, pH, and other uncharacterized signals. These ORFs include members of the paralogous gene family 54 (pgf 54), such as BBA64, BBA65, and BBA66, present on lp54. In an attempt to correlate transcriptional up-regulation of these pgf 54 members to their role in infectivity, we inactivated BBA64 and characterized the phenotype of this mutant both in vitro and in vivo. There were no major differences in the protein profiles between the BBA64 mutant and the control strains, while immunoblot analysis indicated that inactivation of BBA64 resulted in increased levels of BBA65. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the ability of the BBA64 mutant to infect C3H/HeN mice compared to that of its parental or complemented control strains as determined by culturing of viable spirochetes from infected tissues. However, enumeration of spirochetes using quantitative real-time PCR revealed tissue-specific differences, suggesting a minimal role for BBA64 in the survival of B. burgdorferi in select tissues. Infectivity analysis of the BBA64 mutant suggests that B. burgdorferi may utilize multiple determinants to establish infection in mammalian hosts."

Given the pronounced strain structure of B. burgdorferi in the northeastern United States, we asked whether the fitness of the different genotypes varies among susceptible vertebrate hosts. The transmission dynamics of two genetically divergent human isolates of B. burgdorferi, BL206 and B348, were analyzed experimentally in white-footed mice and in C3H/HeNCrl mice over a time period of almost 3 months. We found that the initially high transmission efficiency from white-footed mice to ticks declined sharply for isolate B348 but remained considerably high for isolate BL206. In contrast, in C3H/HeNCrl mice, high transmission efficiency persisted for both isolates. Our findings provide proof-of-principle evidence for intrinsic fitness variation of B. burgdorferi strains in vertebrate host species, perhaps indicating the beginnings of adaptive radiation."

A dysfunctional synergism with other predisposing and contributing factors may contribute to autism spectrum disorders by provoking innate and adaptive immune reactions to cause and perpetuate effects in susceptible individuals that result in inflammation, molecular mimicry, kynurenine pathway changes, increased quinolinic acid and decreased serotonin, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and excitotoxicity that impair the development of the amygdala and other neural structures and neural networks resulting in a partial Klüver-Bucy Syndrome and other deficits resulting in autism spectrum disorders and/or exacerbating autism spectrum disorders from other causes throughout life. Support for this hypothesis includes multiple cases of mothers with Lyme disease and children with autism spectrum disorders; fetal neurological abnormalities associated with tick-borne diseases; similarities between tick-borne diseases and autism spectrum disorder regarding symptoms, pathophysiology, immune reactivity, temporal lobe pathology, and brain imaging data; positive reactivity in several studies with autistic spectrum disorder patients for Borrelia burgdorferi (22%, 26% and 20-30%) and 58% for mycoplasma; similar geographic distribution and improvement in autistic symptoms from antibiotic treatment. It is imperative to research these and all possible causes of autism spectrum disorders in order to prevent every preventable case and treat every treatable case until this disease has been eliminated from humanity."

Symptoms associated with Lyme disease have been reported in Brazil, but no Borrelia sp. has been definitively related to these events. Here we have identified a B. lonestari/B. theileri-related spirochete DNA in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus from Brazil. Four hundred R. microplus and 80 Amblyomma cajennense ticks were screened, and only 1 horse-fed R. microplus was infected. A Borrelia sp. 16S rDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the total tick DNA with 99% similarity to B. theileri and B. lonestari. Partial flaB sequence was also obtained, demonstrating 96% similarity to the B. lonestari flagellin gene, and the resultant putative amino acid sequence demonstrated 97% identity to B. lonestari flagellin. Moreover, partial glpQ sequence demonstrated 92% similarity to the B. lonestari gene, with a putative amino acid sequence 90% identical to the B. lonestari glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. Phylogenetic analyses clearly include this Brazilian Borrelia sp., denoted \"Borrelia,\" sp-BR in a group of spirochetes aligned with B. theileri and B. lonestari. Thus, hard tick relapsing fever group spirochetes represent a clade of widespread bacteria and herein we describe the first molecular identification of a Borrelia sp. in South America."

The incidence of Lyme borreliosis decreased from 156 to 109/100,000 inhabitants in Meuse and from 117 to 76/100,000 inhabitants in Puy-de-Dôme in 2004 and 2005, respectively, corresponding to a decrease in the density of Ixodes ricinus nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi sl. During the same period, the density of adult ticks increased. Interestingly, B. valaisiana, a nonpathogenic species, infected adult ticks more often than nymphs. These results confirmed the correlation between the Lyme borreliosis incidence and the density of infected nymphs, a stage preferentially infected with B. afzelii. In contrast, we found a low rate of infection by A. phagocytophilum, ranging from 0% to 0.4% in Puy-de-Dôme and from 0.8% to 1.4% in Meuse, suggesting a low risk for humans."

		"abstract": "Bell's palsy is a peripheral palsy of the facial nerve that results in muscle weakness on one side of the face. Affected patients develop unilateral facial paralysis over one to three days with forehead involvement and no other neurologic abnormalities. Symptoms typically peak in the first week and then gradually resolve over three weeks to three months. Bell's palsy is more common in patients with diabetes, and although it can affect persons of any age, incidence peaks in the 40s. Bell's palsy has been traditionally defined as idiopathic; however, one possible etiology is infection with herpes simplex virus type 1. Laboratory evaluation, when indicated by history or risk factors, may include testing for diabetes mellitus and Lyme disease. A common short-term complication of Bell's palsy is incomplete eyelid closure with resultant dry eye. A less common long-term complication is permanent facial weakness with muscle contractures. Approximately 70 to 80 percent of patients will recover spontaneously; however, treatment with a seven-day course of acyclovir or valacyclovir and a tapering course of prednisone, initiated within three days of the onset of symptoms, is recommended to reduce the time to full recovery and increase the likelihood of complete recuperation."

Plasma from normal individuals yields a characteristic, reproducible thermogram that appears to represent the weighted sum of denaturation profiles of the most abundant constituent plasma proteins. Plasma from diseased individuals yields dramatically different signature thermograms. Thermograms from individuals suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, and Lyme disease were measured. Each disease appears to have a distinctive and characteristic thermogram. The difference in thermograms between normal and diseased individuals is not caused by radical changes in the concentrations of the most abundant plasma proteins but rather appears to result from interaction of as yet unknown biomarkers with the major plasma proteins. These results signal a novel use for calorimetry as a diagnostic tool."

		"abstract": "Synovitis in patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis persists for months to several years after antibiotic therapy. This course, which may result from infection-induced autoimmunity, is associated with T cell recognition of Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA(161-175)) and with HLA-DR molecules that bind this epitope, including the DRB1*0401 molecule. In this study, we used tetramer reagents to determine the frequencies of OspA(161-175)-specific T cells in samples of PBMC and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) from 13 DRB1*0401-positive patients with antibiotic-responsive or antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Initially, three of the six patients (50%) with antibiotic-responsive arthritis and four of the seven patients (57%) with antibiotic-refractory arthritis had frequencies of OspA(161-175)-specific CD4(+) T cells in peripheral blood above the cutoff value of 4 per 10(5) cells. Among the five patients with concomitant PBMC and SFMC, four (80%) had OspA tetramer-positive cells at both sites, but the mean frequency of such cells was 16 times higher in SFMC, reaching levels as high as 1,177 per 10(5) cells. In the two patients in each patient group in whom serial samples were available, the frequencies of OspA(161-175)-specific T cells declined to low or undetectable levels during or soon after antibiotic therapy, months before the resolution of synovitis in the two patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Thus, the majority of patients with Lyme arthritis initially have increased frequencies of OspA(161-175)-specific T cells. However, the marked decline in the frequency of such cells with antibiotic therapy suggests that persistent synovitis in the refractory group is not perpetuated by these cells."

		"abstract": "To confidently diagnose and treat Lyme disease, the clinician must first understand the natural history of this disease, especially its protean early manifestations. Emergency physicians, primary care physicians, and other providers need to be vigilant in terms of the timely recognition of erythema migrans (EM), the unique marker of early localized stage 1 disease. The classic EM, originally described as a slowly expanding bull's eye lesion, is now recognized to be present in only the minority of cases (9%); the dominant morphologic lesion of EM is now recognized to be the diffusely homogenous red plaque or patch, which occurs in over 50% of cases. This update will define the current morphologic features of early Lyme disease, the indication for serologic studies, and the most recent treatment guidelines, including therapeutic pitfalls."

Although the large joints are most typically affected in Lyme borreliosis, there are also periods of disease activity with arthritis or arthralgias involving smaller joints, including the temporo-mandibular joint. During the years between 2000 and 2003, two patients with Lyme borreliosis affecting the temporo-mandibular joints were treated. The patients presented with fatigue and pain in diverse muscle groups accompanied by arthralgia, which was most pronounced in the temporomandibular joint area. None of the patients were febrile or had joint effusions. Both patients were examined by means of biochemical and serological examinations for Borrelia burgdorferi using ELISA assay and Western blot test (both for IgM and IgG), plain radiographs, MR and CT scans, and scinti-scan of the temporo-mandibular joints They both had positive serum markers for an acute B. burgdorferi infection and were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone. None of the patients had clinical or laboratory signs of chronic Lyme disease activity two and four years following therapy, respectively. Roentgenographic and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the temporo-mandibular joints had not shown any persistent sign of acute inflammation. There are only few reports of patients with manifest temporo-mandibular joint involvement of Lyme borreliosis in the literature. This report emphasizes the importance of differential diagnosis of acute temporo-mandibular joint arthralgia, of early diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, and of the necessity for prompt antibiotic treatment."

Few arthropod borne diseases are preventable by immunization or chimioprophylaxis. Prevention of most of them is based on personal protection against arthropod bites. The evidence of its efficacy has been established by the use of impregnated bed nets, impregnated clothes with permethrin or mosquito repellent which reduced significantly child malaria morbidity and mortality in endemic countries. These personal protective measures are able to minimize arthropod bites and prevent Chikungunya infection, dengue fever and Lyme disease. The choice of a repellent among the commercialised products need to be efficacy and safety evidence based. This article propose to raise this issue and to give pragmatic recommendations, with a focus to children below 30 months who are at a high toxicological risk. Severity of these diseases allowed to use potentially toxic repellents if misused."

To assess the evidence for infection with B. burgdorferi in patients with morphoea by focus-floating microscopy (FFM). Using standard histological equipment, tissue sections stained with a polyclonal B. burgdorferi antibody were simultaneously scanned through in two planes: horizontally as in routine cytology, and vertically by focusing through the thickness of the section, i.e. FFM. Part of the material was also investigated with a Borrelia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One hundred and twenty-two cases of morphoea and 68 controls (58 negative and 10 positive by PCR) were investigated for the presence of Borrelia within tissue specimens. Using FFM Borrelia was detected in 84 cases (68.9%) of morphoea and in all positive controls, but was absent in all negative controls. Borrelia was significantly more frequent in early inflammatory-rich (75%) than late inflammatory-poor (53%) cases (P = 0.018). What seemed to be vital microorganisms were mostly found close to the active border, while degenerated forms were more common in fibrosclerotic parts. The presence of B lymphocytes determined by CD20 staining proved to be a good positive predictor of the microorganism (correlation 0.85, P < 0.001). Borrelia-specific DNA was detected in only one of 30 cases of morphoea analysed by PCR. FFM is a reliable and highly sensitive method to detect Borrelia in tissue sections. The frequent detection of this microorganism in morphoea points to a specific involvement of B. burgdorferi or other similar strains in the development of or as a trigger of this disease."

		"abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that phagocytosed Borrelia burgdorferi induces activation programs in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that differ qualitatively and quantitatively from those evoked by equivalent lipoprotein-rich lysates. Here we report that ingested B. burgdorferi induces significantly greater transcription of proinflammatory cytokine genes than do lysates and that live B. burgdorferi, but not B. burgdorferi lysate, is avidly internalized by monocytes, where the bacteria are completely degraded within phagolysosomes. In the course of these experiments, we discovered that live B. burgdorferi also induced a dose-dependent decrease in monocytes but not a decrease in dendritic cells or T cells and that the monocyte population displayed morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Particularly noteworthy was the finding that apoptotic changes occurred predominantly in monocytes that had internalized spirochetes. Abrogation of phagocytosis with cytochalasin D prevented the death response. Heat-killed B. burgdorferi, which was internalized as well as live organisms, induced a similar degree of apoptosis of monocytes but markedly less cytokine production. Surprisingly, opsonophagocytosis of Treponema pallidum did not elicit a discernible cell death response. Our combined results demonstrate that B. burgdorferi confined to phagolysosomes is a potent inducer of cytosolic signals that result in (i) production of NF-kappaB-dependent cytokines, (ii) assembly of the inflammasome and activation of caspase-1, and (iii) induction of programmed cell death. We propose that inflammation and apoptosis represent mutually reinforcing components of the immunologic arsenal that the host mobilizes to defend itself against infection with Lyme disease spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Optimal treatment remains uncertain for patients with cognitive impairment that persists or returns after standard IV antibiotic therapy for Lyme disease. Patients had well-documented Lyme disease, with at least 3 weeks of prior IV antibiotics, current positive IgG Western blot, and objective memory impairment. Healthy individuals served as controls for practice effects. Patients were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of double-masked treatment with IV ceftriaxone or IV placebo and then no antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was neurocognitive performance at week 12-specifically, memory. Durability of benefit was evaluated at week 24. Group differences were estimated according to longitudinal mixed-effects models. After screening 3368 patients and 305 volunteers, 37 patients and 20 healthy individuals enrolled. Enrolled patients had mild to moderate cognitive impairment and marked levels of fatigue, pain, and impaired physical functioning. Across six cognitive domains, a significant treatment-by-time interaction favored the antibiotic-treated group at week 12. The improvement was generalized (not specific to domain) and moderate in magnitude, but it was not sustained to week 24. On secondary outcome, patients with more severe fatigue, pain, and impaired physical functioning who received antibiotics were improved at week 12, and this was sustained to week 24 for pain and physical functioning. Adverse events from either the study medication or the PICC line were noted among 6 of 23 (26.1%) patients given IV ceftriaxone and among 1 of 14 (7.1%) patients given IV placebo; these resolved without permanent injury. IV ceftriaxone therapy results in short-term cognitive improvement for patients with posttreatment Lyme encephalopathy, but relapse in cognition occurs after the antibiotic is discontinued. Treatment strategies that result in sustained cognitive improvement are needed."

While the aetiology is unknown, some observations suggest an infectious origin. We report the association of eosinophilic fasciitis with an infection involving Borrelia burgdorferi. A 54 year-old man consulted for a hardened oedema and stiffness of the calves associated with an oedema of the left hand evolving for 4 months. Routine blood tests showed hypereosinophilia at 1.01 G/l and moderate inflammatory syndrome. Diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis was confirmed by MRI and muscle biopsy. Since the patient had reported previous tick bites some months before onset, he was tested for Lyme disease. An ELISA test revealed IgG directed against Borrelia burgdorferi and this was confirmed by Western blot analysis. The association of eosinophilic fasciitis with Lyme disease raises the question of a real link or a fortuitous association between the two conditions. Similar cases have been described in the literature with or without isolation of the spirochete from skin or fascia lesions. The incidence of eosinophilic fasciitis remains low compared to the prevalence of the infection in endemic areas. We suggest that in some patients, perhaps genetically predisposed, infection with B. burgdorferi may be at the origin of fasciitis."

A thorough understanding of the intracranial compartment anatomy and characteristic imaging findings of specific pathogens, as well incorporation of the clinical information, is essential to establish correct diagnosis. Specific types of infections have certain propensities for different anatomical regions within the brain. In addition, the imaging findings must be placed in the context of the clinical setting, particularly in immunocompromised and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients. This paper describes and depicts infections within the different compartments of the brain. Pathology-proven infectious cases are presented in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients, with a discussion of the characteristic findings of each pathogen. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) characteristics for several infections are also discussed."

		"abstract": "Bacterial lipoproteins play crucial roles in host-pathogen interactions and pathogenesis and are important targets for the immune system. A prominent example is the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi, which has been efficiently used as a vaccine for the prevention of Lyme disease. In a previous study, OspA could be produced in tobacco chloroplasts in a lipidated and immunogenic form. To further explore the potential of chloroplasts for the production of bacterial lipoproteins, the role of the N-terminal leader sequence was investigated. The amount of recombinant OspA could be increased up to ten-fold by the variation of the insertion site in the chloroplast genome. Analysis of OspA mutants revealed that replacement of the invariant cysteine residue as well as deletion of the leader sequence abolishes palmitolyation of OspA. Also, decoration of OspA with an N-terminal eukaryotic lipidation motif does not lead to palmitoylation in chloroplasts. Strikingly, the bacterial signal peptide of OspA efficiently targets the protein to thylakoids, and causes a mutant phenotype. Plants accumulating OspA at 10% total soluble protein could not grow without exogenously supplied sugars and rapidly died after transfer to soil under greenhouse conditions. The plants were found to be strongly affected in photosystem II, as revealed by the analyses of temporal and spatial dynamics of photosynthetic activity by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. Thus, overexpression of OspA in chloroplasts is limited by its concentration-dependent interference with essential functions of chloroplastic membranes required for primary metabolism."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in North America and Europe and, if untreated, has significant arthritic, cardiac, dermatological and neurological sequelae. There is no currently available human Lyme disease vaccine. Outer surface protein C, because of its antigenicity, protective ability, and expression characteristics has emerged as a promising second generation vaccine candidate; however, significant sequence heterogeneity has impeded its development. Analyses of OspC sequences have revealed the existence of stable phylogenetic clusters or types, and that the type-defining sequence variation occurs within defined domains of the protein. Recent data indicating that immunodominant, and potentially protective OspC epitopes are located in these hypervariable regions has allowed development of a tetravalent, epitope-based, chimeric vaccine. In this report, we have extended that previously described tetravalent construct to include four additional OspC types. We demonstrate that the construct is highly immunogenic, and elicits type-specific antibodies that recognize each of the eight incorporated OspC type-specific epitopes. Antibody raised to the octavalent construct readily binds to the surface of strains expressing each component OspC type, indicating that the incorporated epitopes are presented on the surface of intact cells. In addition, the construct elicits antibody isotypes associated with complement-dependent bactericidal activity. These results represent an important step forward in the design of a broadly protective polyvalent OspC-based Lyme disease vaccine."

After three seasons, the estimated deer population was reduced by 46.7%, from the 2002 postfawning estimate of 2,899 deer (45.6 deer per km2) to a 2005 estimate of 1,540 deer (24.3 deer per km2). There was no apparent effect of the deer culling program on numbers of questing I. scapularis subadults in the culling areas, and the overall numbers of host-seeking ticks in the culling areas seemed to increase in the second year of the program. The Lyme disease incidence rate generated by both passive and active surveillance systems showed no clear trend among years, and it did not seem to vary with declining deer density. Given the resources required to mount and maintain a community-based program of sufficient magnitude to effectively reduce vector tick density in ecologically open situations where there are few impediments to deer movement, it may be that deer reduction, although serving other community goals, is unlikely to be a primary means of tick control by itself. However, in concert with other tick control interventions, such programs may provide one aspect of a successful community effort to reduce the abundance of vector ticks."

Low-passage isolates were resistant to high levels (>100 microg/mL) of erythromycin, spiramycin and the lincosamides but were sensitive to dalfopristin, an analogue of streptogramin B. Interestingly, the high-passage erythromycin-resistant strain B31 was resistant to quinupristin, an analogue of streptogramin A (25 microg/mL). Biochemical analysis revealed that resistance was not due to antibiotic inactivation or energy-dependent efflux but was instead due to modification of ribosomes in these isolates. Interestingly, we were able to demonstrate high-frequency transfer of the resistance phenotype via conjugation from B. burgdorferi to Bacillus subtilis (10(-2)-10(-4)) or Enterococcus faecalis (10(-5)). An intergeneric conjugal system in B. burgdorferi suggests that horizontal gene transfer may play a role in its evolution and is a potential tool for developing new genetic systems to study the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

Four different strains were chosen as antigens: two strains of B. afzelii and two strains of B. garinii which differed in their expression of the outer proteins OspA, OspB and OspC. Each individual strain was used as antigen in immunofluorescence test (IFT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (EIA) with whole borrelial cells, and EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells. With these 12 different tests, 100 samples were examined for the presence of specific IgM and IgG antibodies: 50 sera of blood donors and 50 sera of patients with erythema migrans. The latter were further subdivided into skin culture-positive and -negative subgroups. A commercial Western blot (WB) test was performed for 26 sera of the control group and 25 sera of patients with erythema migrans. The four different methods had distinct specificity and sensitivity. The most specific approaches were IFT (100% for IgM and 90-92% for IgG) and the WB test (100% for IgM and 73% for IgG), followed by EIA with whole borrelial cells (80-98% for IgM and 76-84% for IgG) and EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells (76-94% for IgM and 72-80% for IgG). The sensitivity levels of all these tests were low. The most sensitive were EIA tests with whole borrelial cells (28-36% for IgM and 32-42% for IgG) followed by EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells (22-32% for IgM and 24-36% for IgG), the WB test (16% for IgM and 32% for IgG) and IFT (0-2% for IgM and 14-20% for IgG). The following methods gave significant differences between patients and negative controls in detecting IgM antibodies: EIA with whole borrelial cells with both B. afzelii antigens and with antigen B. garinii that expressed OspA and OspC, EIA with ultrasonicated borrelial cells with antigen B. afzelii that expressed OspA, OspB and OspC. In detecting IgG antibodies, significant differences were observed between EIA with whole borrelial cells and with antigen B. afzelii that expressed OspA and OspB. Borreliae were isolated from the skin of 34/50 (68%) patients with erythema migrans: two strains failed to grow, while 26/32 (81%) strains were identified as B. afzelii, 5/32 (16%) as B. garinii and 1/32 (3%) as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. No statistically significant differences in serologic test results between culture-positive and -negative patients with erythema migrans were found."

		"abstract": "The immunogenicity of peptides and small protein fragments can be considerably enhanced by their presentation on particulate carriers such as capsid-like particles (CLPs) from hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV CLPs are icosahedral nanoparticles formed by 90 or 120 core protein dimers. Insertions into the immunodominant c/e1 B cell epitope, a surface-exposed loop on the HBV capsid protein, are especially immunogenic. Here we investigated whether the HBV core protein can be exploited as a vaccine carrier for whole-chain protein antigens, using two clinically relevant proteins derived from a bacterial human pathogen, the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi. For this purpose we analyzed CLP formation by core fusions with the entire 255-amino-acid ectodomain of outer surface lipoprotein A (OspA), and with two distinct, 189 amino acid long variants of the dimeric OspC (OspC(a), OspC(b)) of B. burgdorferi. OspA appropriately inserted into the HBV core protein yielded a multimerization-competent fusion protein, termed coreOspA. Although only partially assembling into regular CLPs, coreOspA induced antibodies to OspA, including the Ig isotype profile and specificity for the protective epitope \"LA-2\", with an efficiency similar to that of recombinant lipidated OspA, the first generation vaccine against Lyme disease. Moreover, coreOspA actively and passively protected mice against subsequent challenge with B. burgdorferi. Fusions with the two OspC variants were found to efficiently form regular CLPs, most probably by OspC dimerization across different core protein dimers. In mice, both coreOspC preparations induced high-titered antibody responses to the homologous but also to the heterologous OspC variant, which conferred protection against challenge with B. burgdorferi. The data demonstrate the principal applicability of HBV CLPs to act as potent immunomodulator even for structurally complex full-length polypeptide chains, and thus open new avenues for novel vaccine designs."

We developed a streptavidin-modified biochip-based immunodiagnosis and compared it with conventional methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB). The diagnostic sensitivity of the coated biochips was demonstrated to be identical, and the results of conventional assays such as ELISA and WB were confirmed. Flagellar antigens lead to better diagnosis because of a higher discriminative value. By contrast, OspC8, a peptide derived from the outer surface antigen, is less sensitive to identify immunity in LB. The inferior antigenicity of OspC8 may be due to epitope masking. Overall, this system is open to simultaneously analyze a larger family of peptides differing in length. Thus, an array approach is generally more advantageous to extend the pattern of antigens to be tested for antigenicity in LB. Serial analysis during ongoing disease may be valuable to learn more about the course of the disease and intermittent reactivation of infection. Protein biochip as a potential substitution of ELISA and WB method offers the opportunity to study serum immunity in a multiplicity of patients simultaneously."

There is evidence of direct involvement of nerves by the infective agent, from the immune reaction of the patient or secondary to the toxicity of the drugs used during treatment. This group of neuropathies is often treatable or preventable. There is a complex clinical picture of the neuropathy of leprosy, different pathological features and immunological mechanisms. If the skin is unaffected in leprosy it is not always easy to demonstrate that the neuropathy is due to leprosy. Peripheral neuropathy in patients with chronic infection with hepatitis C virus may be due to the virus, the development of vasculitis or direct neurotoxic effects of the treatment. Peripheral neuropathy has become the chief neurological syndrome in individuals infected with HIV-1. The antiretroviral therapies themselves can cause peripheral neuropathies clinically indistinguishable from those caused by the virus. The occurrence of chronic polyneuropathy as a late manifestation in Lyme disease is extremely rare and is not well understood. Although infectious neuropathies are very frequent, mainly in developing countries, further studies are needed to elucidate their mechanisms of action, focusing on preventive interventions."

		"abstract": "Lyme arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis share common clinical features and synovial histology. It is unclear whether they also share similar pathogenesis. Previous studies have shown that the severity and duration of Lyme arthritis correlate directly with serum concentrations of antibody against outer surface protein A (OspA) of the causative pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. We tested the sera of 68 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis, 147 subjects with other autoimmune diseases, and 44 healthy subjects who had never had Lyme disease, as well as sera of 16 patients who had Lyme disease, for reactivity against the B. burgdorferi OspA protein. The sera of about a quarter of the rheumatoid arthritis patients and a 10th of the autoimmune disease and Lyme disease patients reacted against OspA antigen. Of 50 rheumatoid arthritis patients who could be evaluated for disease severity, a 28-joint count disease activity score of >2.6 was noted for 11 of 15 (73%) patients whose sera reacted against OspA antigen and 13 of 35 (37%; P < 0.05) whose sera were nonreactive. Serum reactivity against OspA antigen is associated with the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infection in the United States and Europe. A surprising number of patients experience a subsequent episode of Lyme disease after the first episode has resolved. Reinfection has been well-documented only after successfully treated early infection (nearly always erythema migrans) and can often be recognized clinically by the development of a repeat episode of erythema migrans occurring at a different location on the skin during months when the principal tick vectors are abundant in the environment. Limited data suggest that the clinical and laboratory manifestations of reinfection in patients with Lyme disease with erythema migrans are not very different from those of initial infection. Patients with recurrent infections afford an opportunity to study the role of the immune response in this illness. Because patients with early Lyme disease continue to remain at high risk for reinfection, this population should be targeted for education about prevention of Lyme disease."

Of these subjects, 137 had tested seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi. For control purposes, sera from 161 healthy blood donors were examined. A total of 10/397 samples (2.6%) showed IgG-antibodies to R. helvetica at or above a titre of 1/80 as cut-off. 6/137 (4.4%) belonged to the Borrelia positive group, 3/99 (3.0%) to the tick-bitten but Borrelia negative group and 1/161 (0.6%) to the control group. The difference between the tick-exposed groups and the control group was significant in Pearson's 2-sided chi(2) test. In 1 serum sample the presence of antibodies to R. helvetica was further confirmed by Western immunoblot. The study shows that infection with Rickettsia spp. as well as coinfection with Lyme borreliosis needs to be considered in the diagnosis of tick-transmitted infections in Sweden. Owing to a known occurrence of immunological cross-reactivites, however, the results must be cautiously interpreted with regard to species of Rickettsia involved."

		"abstract": "This paper discusses the problem of diagnosing borreliosis (Lyme disease) in dogs. A prospective cohort study in the Kempen district, a known Borrelia focus in The Netherlands, showed that dogs with the presumptive symptoms of borreliosis, episodic malaise and lameness, had significantly higher and longer lasting anti-Borrelia IgG titers than asymptomatic dogs. A small part of these dogs also had antibodies directed against the IR6 (C6) antigen which indicates persistent active Borrelia infection. A few typical case histories are presented. Dogs with episodic malaise and lameness with persistent high IgG titers are suspect of suffering from borreliosis. IR6 antibodies make this diagnosis likely. Initially, such patients should be treated with doxycyclin (10 mg/kg 1dd) for 10 days. If the symptoms recurr within a few months, a longer treatment (eg 6 weeks) should be considered. Bernese mountain dogs were strongly over-represented among the borreliosis patients in the cohort study and most high titered samples among those submitted for--diagnostic--serology appear to come from this breed, which suggests that these dogs have difficulties with clearing this tick-borne infection."

		"abstract": "Two infectious diseases, and one presumably infectious disease, each vectored by or associated with the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), were identified and characterized by clinicians and scientists in the United States during the 1980s and 1990s. These three conditions-human monocytic (or monocytotropic) ehrlichiosis (HME), Ehrlichia ewingii ehrlichiosis, and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI)-undoubtedly existed in the United States prior to this time. However, the near-simultaneous recognition of these diseases is remarkable and suggests the involvement of a unifying process that thrust multiple pathogens into the sphere of human recognition. Previous works by other investigators have emphasized the pivotal role of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the emergence of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. Because whitetails serve as a keystone host for all stages of lone star ticks, and an important reservoir host for Ehrlichia chaffeensis, E. ewingii, and Borrelia lonestari, the near-exponential growth of white-tailed deer populations that occurred in the eastern United States during the twentieth century is likely to have dramatically affected the frequency and distribution of A. americanum-associated zoonoses. This chapter describes the natural histories of the pathogens definitively or putatively associated with HME, E. ewingii ehrlichiosis, and STARI; the role of white-tailed deer as hosts to lone star ticks and the agents of these diseases; and the cascade of ecologic disturbances to the landscape of the United States that have occurred during the last 200 years that provided critical leverage in the proliferation of white-tailed deer, and ultimately resulted in the emergence of these diseases in human populations."

In this report we assess the conservation, distribution, properties, and ligand binding abilities of CspZ from the three main Borrelia species associated with Lyme disease infections in humans. CspZ (also referred to as BbCRASP-2 in the literature) was found to be highly conserved at the intraspecies level but divergent at the interspecies level. All CspZ orthologs that originated from B. burgdorferi isolates bound FH from a diverse group of mammals. In contrast, CspZ derived from B. garinii and B. afzelii did not. Regardless of the Borrelia species of origin, all CspZ proteins tested bound to unknown approximately 60-kDa serum proteins produced by different mammals. To further define the molecular basis for the differential binding of CspZ orthologs to host proteins, DNA sequence, truncation, and site-directed mutagenesis analyses were performed. DNA sequence analyses revealed that B. garinii and B. afzelii CspZ orthologs possess a 64-amino-acid N-terminal domain that is absent from B. burgdorferi CspZ. However, binding analyses of recombinant proteins revealed that this domain does not in and of itself influence ligand binding properties. Truncation and mutagenesis analyses further revealed that the key determinants required for ligand binding are discontinuous and that the presentation of the ligand binding pocket is dependent on alpha helices with high coiled-coil formation probability. The data presented here provide insight into the molecular basis of CspZ-ligand interactions and suggest that CspZ orthologs from diverse Borrelia species can contribute to the host-pathogen interaction through their interaction with serum proteins."

Conduct a review of all cases of babesiosis reported to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health with onsets during 1996-2005. For case patients with onsets during 2004, pertinent medical records were reviewed and patient interviews were performed. Increase awareness of the occurrence and recent trends and facilitate prompt, appropriate diagnosis and treatment of babesiosis. Increase awareness among clinicians of the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the management of babesiosis, Lyme disease, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis. The study represents an analysis of data received through passive surveillance of a disease that is officially reportable to the Wisconsin Division of Public Health. Other than the description of the occurrence of babesiosis among Wisconsin residents, there were no planned outcome measures. Of the 32 cases of babesiosis reported to the DPH during the study interval, 23 (72%) occurred during 2004 and 2005. The majority of cases occurred in northwestern and west-central Wisconsin. At least 6 patients were co-infected with other tick-borne pathogens. Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevation of liver transaminase levels were the most notable laboratory abnormalities among case patients. The apparent increased incidence in babesiosis among Wisconsin residents should impact clinicians' workups for acute febrile illness with known tick exposure, especially in northwest and west central Wisconsin. Babesiosis should now also be considered in patients diagnosed with Lyme disease who have marked constitutional symptoms, especially those with anemia or thrombocytopenia."

Locating cases of PCBCL that are related to B. burgdorferi infection could be really important for therapeutic implications; in fact, there are several reports of PCBCL responding to antibiotic therapy against B. burgdorferi. We report a case of B. burgdorferi-associated primary cutaneous marginal-zone B-cell lymphoma that, after specific antimicrobial therapy, did not show any clinical regression. We can conclude that additional studies are necessary in order to establish the use of antimicrobial therapy in B. burgdorferi-associated PCBCL."

Binding of B. burgdorferi to integrin alpha(3)beta(1) on human chondrocytes activates signalling leading to release of several pro-inflammatory mediators, but the B. burgdorferi protein that binds integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and elicits this response has remained unknown. A search of the B. burgdorferi genome for a canonical integrin binding motif, the RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) tripeptide, revealed several candidate ligands for integrins. In this study we show that one of these candidates, BBB07, binds to integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and inhibits attachment of intact B. burgdorferi to the same integrin. BBB07 is expressed during murine infection as demonstrated by recognition by infected mouse sera. Recombinant purified BBB07 induces pro-inflammatory mediators in primary human chondrocyte cells by interaction with integrin alpha(3)beta(1). This interaction is specific, as P66, another integrin ligand of B. burgdorferi, does not activate signalling through alpha(3)beta(1). In summary, we have identified a B. burgdorferi protein, BBB07, that interacts with integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and stimulates production of pro-inflammatory mediators in primary human chondrocyte cells."

It is the first time B. lusitaniae is documented in Denmark. Even though, the highest infection rate was discovered for B. afzelii and B. garinii, mixed infections are more common than single infections. Fifty-one percent (29/56) of these were infected with two genospecies, 7.1% (4/56) with three, and 5.3% (3/56) with four.

In vivo selection of filamentous phage expressing B. burgdorferi protein fragments on the phage surface identified several new candidate adhesins, and verified the activity of one adhesin that had been previously characterized in vitro. P66, a B. burgdorferi ligand for beta(3)-chain integrins, OspC, a protein that is essential for the establishment of infection in mammals, and Vls, a protein that undergoes antigenic variation in the mammal, were all selected for binding to the murine endothelium in vivo. Additional B. burgdorferi proteins for which no functions have been identified, including all four members of the OspF family and BmpD, were identified as candidate adhesins. The use of in vivo phage display is one approach to the identification of adhesins in pathogenic bacteria that are not easily grown in the laboratory, or for which genetic manipulations are not straightforward."

		"abstract": "Ixodes persulcatus Schultze ticks are traditionally associated with transmission of Lyme disease, babesiosis, and tick-borne encephalitis. Here we compared the prevalence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, and rickettsial and ehrlichial agents in I. persulcatus ticks collected in different locations of the North Western administrative region of Russia. Altogether, 27.7% of ticks were infected with at least one organism, while the DNA of two or more bacteria was found in 11.8% of ticks tested. The highest average prevalence of Anaplasmataceae (20.8%) was detected in ticks from Arkhangel'sk province, while the prevalence in ticks from Novgorod province and St. Petersburg, respectively, was 7.3% and 12.2%. Only Ehrlichia muris DNA was identified by DNA sequencing. In comparison, the prevalence of B. burdorferi DNA was 16.6%, 5.8%, and 24.5% in the respective locations. The 382-bp amplicon of gltA from Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae was detected in 2.75% and 1.6%, respectively, of ticks from Arkhangel'sk and Novgorod provinces, extending further west and north the area where this rickettsia is known to be present. DNA of the rickettsia-like endosymbiont Montezuma was primarily associated with female ticks, 8-28% of which were infected. Since I. persulcatus is so commonly infected with multiple agents that may cause human diseases, exposure to these ticks poses significant risk to human health in this region."

		"abstract": "In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is the most common disease communicated by ticks and especially affects the skin, nervous system, joints, and heart. It is caused by at least four species of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The various pathologies are classified as early forms (erythema migrans, borrelia lymphocytom, early neuroborreliosis, carditis) or late forms (arthritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, chronic neuroborreliosis). The accuracy of serodiagnosis is 20-50% with erythema migrans, 70-90% with early neuroborreliosis, and nearly 100% with Lyme arthritis. Following special indications, the agent is confirmed by skin biopsy or spinal or joint puncture. Oral therapy is performed with amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cefuroxime, and intravenous therapy uses ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. All in all, the prognosis of treated Lyme borreliosis is good. In childhood permanent defects are extremely rare, even following long-term manifestation at an early age."

To evaluate brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in chronic NB, to compare the findings with healthy controls, and to correlate MRI findings with disease duration. Sixteen well-characterized patients with chronic NB and 16 matched controls were examined in a 1.5T scanner with a standard head coil. T1- (with and without gadolinium), T2-, and diffusion-weighted imaging plus fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging were used. White matter lesions and lesions in the basal ganglia were seen in 12 patients and 10 controls (no significant difference). Subependymal lesions were detected in patients down to the age of 25 and in the controls down to the age of 43. The number of lesions was correlated to age both in patients (rho = 0.83, P<0.01) and in controls (rho = 0.61, P<0.05), but not to the duration of disease. Most lesions were detected with FLAIR, but many also with T2-weighted imaging. A number of MRI findings were detected in patients with chronic NB, although the findings were unspecific when compared with matched controls and did not correlate with disease duration. However, subependymal lesions may constitute a potential finding in chronic NB."

The determination of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato susceptibility to antibiotics is difficult, especially because of the lack of standardization in the methods used. In vitro data is helpful to determine Lyme treatment but discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results highlight the need to confirm this data by clinical trials. The second part is an analysis of the literature made to evaluate the current strategies of treatment and follow up of early Lyme disease characterized by erythema migrans (EM). beta-lactams (penicillin G and V, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (doxycycline), and macrolides (mainly azithromycin) are the drugs most frequently used during clinical trials. The comparison between treatments is difficult because of the lack of reliable clinical and biological criteria to identify complete recovery. However the prognosis of treated EM is good in most trials. If a clinical follow-up remains necessary after the treatment of an EM, prolonged antibody production among asymptomatic patients reduces the interest of a serological follow-up."

However, the role of the vls locus as a virulence factor during mammalian infection has not been clearly defined. We report the successful removal of the vls locus through telomere resolvase-mediated targeted deletion, and demonstrate the absolute requirement of this lp28-1 component for persistence in the mouse host. Moreover, successful infection of C3H/HeN mice with an lp28-1 plasmid in which the left portion was deleted excludes participation of other lp28-1 non-vls genes in spirochete virulence, persistence and the process of recombinational switching at vlsE. Data are also presented that cast doubt on an immune evasion mechanism whereby VlsE directly masks other surface antigens similar to what has been observed for several other pathogens that undergo recombinational antigenic variation."

In LB mean sFasL concentration was increased significantly under stimulation with phytohemaglutinine, Ba and Bg, and, with borderline significance, with Bss, in comparison with unstimulated culture. sFas also tended to increase, which was significant with phytohemaglutinine and borderline with Bg. In K sFas and sFasL was not significantly increased under antigenic stimulation. Increased synthesis of antiapoptotic factors by PBMC from patients with late borreliosis incubated with B. burgdorferi antigens may suggest impaired apoptosis of T lymphocytes contributing to persistent inflammatory response in this patients."

Antibodies to DbpB seemed to be associated with lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF and short duration of the disease, whereas antibodies to DbpA in the CSF were observed irrespective of the duration of the disease and lymphocytic pleocytosis. Among the variant antigens, CSF reactivity was mainly with the DbpB from B. garinii, whereas positivity with the DbpA from B. afzelii or B. garinii predominated.

Tick salivary secretion has been shown as important for both blood-meal completion and pathogen transmission. Here we report a duplication event of cystatin genes in its genome that results in a transcription-regulated boost of saliva inhibitory activity against a conserved and relatively limited number of vertebrate papain-like cysteine proteases during blood feeding. We further show that the polypeptide products of the two genes differ in their binding affinity for some enzyme targets, and they display different antigenicity. Moreover, our reverse genetic approach employing RNA interference uncovered a crucial mediation in tick-feeding success. Given the role of the targeted enzymes in vertebrate immunity, we also show that host immunomodulation is implicated in the deleterious phenotype of silenced ticks making I. scapularis cystatins attractive targets for development of anti-tick vaccines."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the Northern hemisphere and is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes. Lyme disease commonly begins with a characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans. Weeks or months later, the patients may have neurologic, joint, or cardiac abnormalities. Some patients may still present persistent deep fatigue and various unspecific symptoms after standard courses of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. This constellation of symptoms has been variously referred to as \"chronic Lyme disease\", or \"post-Lyme disease syndrome\". The first French National Consensus Conference on Lyme Disease was the reason to review all aspects of articular and cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease after a synthesis of recent literature. The involvement of Borrelia species in chronic Lyme disease and other pathologies is discussed."

		"abstract": "Questing Ixodes ricinus L. ticks were collected monthly from 2003 to 2005 on the north- and south-facing slopes of Chaumont Mountain in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, at altitudes varying from 620 to 1,070 m. On the south-facing slope, questing tick density was higher than on the north-facing slope, and it decreased with altitude. Density tended to increase with altitude on the north-facing slope. Saturation deficit values higher than 10 mmHg and lasting for >2 mo were often recorded on the south-facing slope, explaining seasonal patterns of questing tick activity. The overall prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was 22.4%, and prevalence differed according to exposure and among years. No difference was noticed between nymphs and adults. Four Borrelia species were identified. Mixed infections were detected in 52 ticks, B. garinii and B. valaisiana (n = 21) and B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi s.s. (n = 20) were the most frequent associations observed. The density of infected ticks varied from 3.6 to 78.7 infected nymphs per 100 m2 and from 0.6 to 16.9 infected adults per 100 m2, both slopes combined. The study on the south-facing slope was a follow-up of a previous study carried out at the same location during 1999-2001. Comparison of climatic data between the two periods showed a marked increase in saturation deficit. Substantial differences in density and phenology of ticks also were observed. At high elevations, ticks were significantly more abundant during the current study. This can be explained by rising temperatures recorded during summer at altitude, reaching values similar to those registered in the first study beneath. At the lowest altitude, adults were significantly less abundant, probably due to long-lasting high saturation deficits that impaired nymphal survival. The density of Borrelia-infected ticks was higher than in the previous study."

In more formal terms, vaccination lowers risk perception, and people compensate for their lower perceived risk by reducing other preventive behaviors. We test several predictions from the risk compensation hypothesis in the context of vaccination behavior. We obtained a random sample of adults (N=705), interviewing them by phone just as the Lyme disease vaccine first became available to the public and again 18 months later. Analyses controlled for age, sex, education, and race. Vaccinated respondents were less likely to continue engaging in two of five protective behaviors after vaccination. The frequency of these protective behaviors did not dip below that among the unvaccinated respondents. We found some evidence of regression (protective behaviors dropping, after vaccination, to levels reported by the unvaccinated cohort). However, we did not find disinhibition (exceeding the risk taking of the unvaccinated cohort), the greater threat to public health. Although we will not know for several years what effect HPV vaccination has on other behaviors, if any, data on other vaccinations can offer critically important information in the interim."

		"abstract": "Pathogenesis of Lyme disease, including neuroborreliosis, remains unclear. However, pro-inflammatory cytokines seem to be involved and might be used to monitor the course of the disease. It has been also shown that B. burgdorferi protects itself from elimination by modulating function of the host's immune system. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of selected cytokines in patients with neuroborreliosis and their change during antibiotic treatment. The group of 25 patients was examined, all undergoing antibiotic therapy due to meningitis caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The group included 10 (40%) females and 15 (60%) males in the mean age x = 42,3 years. The control group for serum measurements consisted of 25 healthy individuals (mean age x =43, 1) while control group for CSF study included 10 patients (aged x = 53,5 years) from whom CSF with normal parameters was taken during diagnostic procedures neurosurgical. We examined serum and CSF before and after antibiotics for concentrations of interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interleukin-15 (IL-15). In the first examination the significant increase of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-2, IL-15 serum and CSF concentration was detected in comparison to control group. After 4-weeks antibiotic treatment the concentrations of studied cytokines decreased significantly in serum as well as in CSF but remained increased in comparison with controls. Although antibiotic treatment leads to withdrawal of clinical symptoms of neuroborreliosis and normalization of CSF general parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines' concentrations in serum and CSF remain elevated. It may be explained by the persistence of inflammatory conditions, perhaps related to surviving of a fraction of Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes within CNS tissue. This phenomenon might lead to development of chronic CNS lesions."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a complex infection, where some individuals develop so-called 'chronic borreliosis'. The pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown, but the type of immune response is probably important for healing. A strong T helper cell type 1 (Th1)-like response has been suggested as crucial for eradication of Borrelia and for avoiding development of chronic disease. Many studies aimed at altering the Th1/Th2 balance in Lyme arthritis employed mice deficient in cytokine genes, but the outcome has not been clear-cut, due possibly to the high redundancy of cytokines. This study aimed at studying the importance of the Th1/Th2 balance in murine Borrelia arthritis by using the Th2-deviating effect of subtoxic doses of inorganic mercury. Ninety-eight C3H/HeN mice were divided into four groups: Borrelia-infected (Bb), Borrelia-infected exposed to HgCl(2) (BbHg), controls exposed to HgCl(2) alone and normal controls. Mice were killed on days 3, 16, 44 and 65 post-Borrelia inoculation. Arthritis severity was evaluated by histology, spirochaetal load determined by Borrelia culture, IgG2a- and IgE-levels analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbemt assay (ELISA) and cytokine-secreting cells detected by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT). BbHg mice showed less severe histological arthritis, but delayed eradication of spirochaetes compared to Bb mice, associated with increased levels of IgE (Th2-induced) and decreased levels of IgG2a (Th1-induced), consistent with a Th2-deviation. Both the numbers of Th1 and Th2 cytokine-secreting cells were reduced in BbHg mice, possibly explained by the fact that numbers of cytokine-secreting cells do not correlate with cytokine concentration. In conclusion, this study supports the hypothesis that a Th1-like response is required for optimal eradication of Borrelia."

		"abstract": "The regulation of innate immune responses to pathogens occurs through the interaction of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) with pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the activation of several signaling pathways whose contribution to the overall innate immune response to pathogens is poorly understood. We demonstrate a mechanism of control of murine macrophage responses mediated by TLR1/2 heterodimers through c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) activity. JNK controls tumor necrosis factor alpha production and TLR-mediated macrophage responses to Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and the TLR1/TLR2-specific agonist PAM(3)CSK(4). JNK1, but not JNK2, activity regulates the expression of the tlr1 gene in the macrophage cell line RAW264.7, as well as in primary CD11b(+) cells. We also show that the proximal promoter region of the human tlr1 gene contains an AP-1 binding site that is subjected to regulation by the kinase and binds two complexes that involve the JNK substrates c-Jun, JunD, and ATF-2. These results demonstrate that JNK1 regulates the response to TLR1/2 ligands and suggest a positive feedback loop that may serve to increase the innate immune response to the spirochete."

Interestingly, B. burgdorferi also enhances expression of specific Ixodes scapularis genes, such as TROSPA and salp15. The importance of these genes and their products for B. burgdorferi survival within the tick, and during the transmission process, will also be reviewed. Moreover, we discuss how such vector molecules could be used to develop vector-antigen-based vaccines to prevent the transmission of B. burgdorferi and, potentially, other arthropod-borne microbes."

Four samples (10.8%) showed a mixed population of these genospecies. Two samples produced atypical RFLP pattern which were detected by sequence analysis as B. valaisiana (5.4%).

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) adapts to its arthropod and mammalian hosts by altering its transcriptional and antigenic profiles in response to environmental signals associated with each of these milieus. In studies presented here, we provide evidence to suggest that mammalian host signals are important for modulating and maintaining both the positive and negative aspects of mammalian host adaptation mediated by the alternative sigma factor RpoS in Bb. Although considerable overlap was observed between genes induced by RpoS during growth within the mammalian host and following temperature-shift, comparative microarray analyses demonstrated unequivocally that RpoS-mediated repression requires mammalian host-specific signals. A substantial portion of the in vivo RpoS regulon was uniquely upregulated within dialysis membrane chambers, further underscoring the importance of host-derived environmental stimuli for differential gene expression in Bb. Expression profiling of genes within the RpoS regulon by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed a level of complexity to RpoS-dependent gene regulation beyond that observed by microarray, including a broad range of expression levels and the presence of genes whose expression is only partially dependent on RpoS. Analysis of Bb-infected ticks by qRT-PCR established that expression of rpoS is induced during the nymphal blood meal but not within unfed nymphs or engorged larvae. Together, these data have led us to postulate that RpoS acts as a gatekeeper for the reciprocal regulation of genes involved in the establishment of infection within the mammalian host and the maintenance of spirochetes within the arthropod vector."

		"abstract": "Borrelia spielmanii sp. nov. has recently been shown to be a novel human pathogenic genospecies that causes Lyme disease in Europe. In order to elucidate the immune evasion mechanisms of B. spielmanii, we compared the abilities of isolates obtained from Lyme disease patients and tick isolate PC-Eq17 to escape from complement-mediated bacteriolysis. Using a growth inhibition assay, we show that four B. spielmanii isolates, including PC-Eq17, are serum resistant, whereas a single isolate, PMew, was more sensitive to complement-mediated lysis. All isolates activated complement in vitro, as demonstrated by covalent attachment of C3 fragments; however, deposition of the later activation products C6 and C5b-9 was restricted to the moderately serum-resistant isolate PMew and the serum-sensitive B. garinii isolate G1. Furthermore, serum adsorption experiments revealed that all B. spielmanii isolates acquired the host alternative pathway regulators factor H and factor H-like protein (FHL-1) from human serum. Both complement regulators retained their factor I-mediated C3b inactivation activities when bound to spirochetes. In addition, two distinct factor H and FHL-1 binding proteins, BsCRASP-1 and BsCRASP-2, were identified, which we estimated to be approximately 23 to 25 kDa in mass. A further factor H binding protein, BsCRASP-3, was found exclusively in the tick isolate, PC-Eq17. This is the first report describing an immune evasion mechanism utilized by B. spielmanii sp. nov., and it demonstrates the capture of human immune regulators to resist complement-mediated killing."

		"abstract": "Cardiac manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis are relatively infrequent, occurring within weeks after the infectious tick bite (median of 21 days), and resulting at this stage from a direct borrelial infection of the myocardium, as indicated by reports of spirochete isolation from pericardium and myocardium. They may persist or appear in the late, tertiary phase of the illness, being then more likely due to infection-triggered autoimmunity. Lyme carditis typically presents with a fluctuating degree of atrioventricular block that spontaneously resolves in several days. Rarely, myocarditis may occur with or without pericardial involvement, in patients presenting with chest pain, ST depression or T wave inversion, mimicking an acute myocardial infarction, and various arrhythmias are reported, as well as pericardial effusion or heart failure. A complete recovery is usually observed, spontaneous or after antibiotherapy. Severe myocarditis or Pericarditis leading to death is exceptional. The diagnosis of Lyme carditis is based on the same association of clinical and laboratory features as in Lyme disease without cardiac involvement. But the occurrence of conduction disturbances in healthy young people suggests screening for other criteria of Lyme disease. The management of Lyme carditis does not differ from the treatment of Lyme disease without carditis and is mainly based upon the use of doxycycline or ceftriaxone."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi has a complex chemotaxis signal transduction system with multiple chemotaxis gene homologs similar to those found in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. The B. burgdorferi genome sequence encodes two cheA, three cheY, three cheW, two cheB, two cheR, but no cheZ genes. Instead of cheZ, B. burgdorferi contains a different CheY-P phosphatase, referred to as cheX. The multiple B. burgdorferi histidine kinases (CheA1 and CheA2) and response regulators (CheY1, CheY2, and CheY3) possess all the domains and functional residues found in E. coli CheA and CheY, respectively. Understanding protein phosphorylation is critical to unraveling many biological processes, including chemotaxis signal transduction, motility, growth control, metabolism, and disease processes. E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and B. subtilis chemotaxis systems have been studied extensively, providing models to understand chemotaxis signaling in the Lyme disease spirochete B. burgdorferi. Both genetic approaches and biochemical analyses are essential in understanding its complex two-component chemotaxis systems. Specifically, gene inactivation studies assess the importance of specific genes in chemotaxis and motility under certain conditions. Furthermore, biochemical approaches help determine the following in vitro reactions: (1) the extent that the histidine kinases, CheA1 and CheA2, are autophosphorylated using ATP; (2) the transfer of phosphate from CheA1-P and CheA2-P to each CheY species; and (3) the dephosphorylation of each CheY-P species by CheX. We hypothesize that characterizing protein phosphorylation in the B. burgdorferi two-component chemotaxis system will facilitate understanding of how the periplasmic flagellar bundles located near each end of B. burgdorferi cells are coordinately regulated for chemotaxis. During chemotaxis, these bacteria run, pause (stop/flex), and reverse (run again). This chapter describes protocols for assessing B. burgdorferi CheA autophosphorylation, transfer of phosphate from CheA-P to CheY, and CheY-P dephosphorylation."

		"abstract": "Constructing mutants by targeted gene inactivation is more difficult in the Lyme disease organism, Borrelia burgdorferi, than in many other species of bacteria. The B. burgdorferi genome is fragmented, with a large linear genome and 21 linear and circular plasmids. Some of these small linear and circular plasmids are often lost during laboratory propagation, and the loss of specific plasmids can have a significant impact on virulence. In addition to the unusual structure of the B. burgdorferi genome, the presence of an active restriction-modification system impedes genetic transformation. Furthermore, B. burgdorferi is relatively slow growing, with a 7- to 12-h generation time, requiring weeks to obtain single colonies. The beginning part of this chapter details the procedure in targeting specific B. burgdorferi genes by allelic exchange mutagenesis. Our laboratory is especially interested in constructing and analyzing B. burgdorferi chemotaxis and motility mutants. Characterization of these mutants with respect to chemotaxis and swimming behavior is more difficult than for many other bacterial species. We have developed swarm plate and modified capillary tube assays for assessing chemotaxis. In the modified capillary tube chemotaxis assay, flow cytometry is used to rapidly enumerate cells that accumulate in the capillary tubes containing attractants. To assess the swimming behavior and velocity of B. burgdorferi wild-type and mutant cells, we use a commercially available cell tracker referred to as \"Volocity.\" The latter part of this chapter presents protocols for performing swarm plate and modified capillary tube assays, as well as cell motion analysis. It should be possible to adapt these procedures to study other spirochete species, as well as other species of bacteria, especially those that have long generation times."

In Bernese Mountain Dogs with glomerulonephritis antibodies against B. burgdorferi have been found in most dogs, raising the question if the breed is predisposed to infections with B. burgdorferi. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato in a well defined population of Bernese Mountain Dogs and to compare this prevalence with data from dogs of other breeds. 160 Bernese Mountain Dogs and 62 control dogs (large breed dogs with long hair) were included. All dogs were considered healthy according to a questionnaire filled out by the owner, complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis and urine culture. Bernese Mountain Dogs and control dogs were kept in similar environments. Seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi was assessed by ELISA and Western blot and was 58% in Bernese Mountain Dogs compared to 15% in control dogs. This difference was significant. Neither antibodies against leptospires nor vaccination or hair coat color influenced the results. The cause of the considerably higher prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in Bernese Mountain Dogs and it's consequences are not known. A breed predisposition can be suspected."

We collected data on vector tick infestations, measured lizard \"realized\" reservoir competence for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, and estimated lizard population density. These data were incorporated into a model that predicts a host's ability to influence the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in the tick population, a primary risk factor in the epidemiology of Lyme disease. Published data on other northeastern hosts were included in the model to provide a reference for interpreting the importance of lizards as hosts. The model results indicate that 5-lined skinks (Eumeces fasciatus) are dilution hosts, capable of reducing infection prevalence in the tick population by 10.7-51.5 percentage points, whereas eastern fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) are not dilution hosts in the areas studied. Owing to moderate burdens of larval ticks, relatively high population densities, and reservoir incompetence, E. fasciatus may play an important role in the ecology of Lyme disease by reducing vector infection prevalence and associated human risk of infection."

We now directly show that ospD expression is generally elevated within Ixodes scapularis compared with mice. We then assessed the importance of OspD throughout the spirochete life cycle by generating OspD-deficient B. burgdorferi and examining the mutant in the murine model of tick-transmitted Lyme borreliosis. The lack of OspD did not influence B. burgdorferi infectivity in mice or the acquisition of spirochetes by I. scapularis. OspD adhered to tick gut extracts in vitro, and the OspD-deficient B. burgdorferi strain had a threefold decrease in colonization of the tick gut in vivo. This decrease, however, did not alter subsequent spirochete transmission during a second blood meal. These data suggest that B. burgdorferi can compensate for the lack of OspD in both ticks and mice and that OspD may have a nonessential, secondary, role in B. burgdorferi persistence within I. scapularis."

Due to persistent pain and swelling of the entire forefoot, after two weeks of conventional treatment, magnet resonance images (MRI) and a blood sample were taken. The laboratory investigation showed raised levels of white blood cell count and C-reactive protein. The MRI showed up oedema in the metatarsal heads II-IV, as well as soft tissue swelling of the forefoot without any signs of decomposition.Because of this atypical inflammation of the forefoot a laboratory investigation to check for rheumatology disease was done and revealed borrelia burgdorferi infection.

Chemokine patterns in lesional skin in each of the three skin disorders included low but significant mRNA levels of the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1 and the dendritic cell chemoattractant CCL20 and intermediate levels of the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2. Erythema migrans and particularly acrodermatitis lesions had high mRNA expression of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 and low levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL13, whereas lymphocytoma lesions had high levels of CXCL13 and lower levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. This pattern of chemokine expression was consistent with leukocyte marker mRNA in lesional skin. Moreover, using immunohistologic methods, CD3(+) T cells and CXCL9 were visualized in erythema migrans and acrodermatitis lesions, and CD20(+) B cells and CXCL13 were seen in lymphocytoma lesions. Thus, erythema migrans and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans have high levels of the T-cell-active chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10, whereas borrelial lymphocytoma has high levels of the B-cell-active chemokine CXCL13."

In this study, we analyzed patients who presented to our rheumatology unit with previous suspected or diagnosed Lyme borreliosis. Eighty-six patients from a 3.5-year period were evaluated. The mean age of patients was 49.2 +/- 17.2 years; 60% (n = 52) reported a tick bite and 33% (n = 28) an erythema. Forty-seven percent (n = 39) had positive enzyme-linked immunoassay results and Western blots (Mikrogen, Martinsried, Germany). All but 12 patients had already received antibiotic treatment previously. Nine percent (n = 8) had ongoing or recent Lyme borreliosis. Twenty-nine percent (n = 25) showed clinical symptoms and radiographic changes compatible with degenerative disorders of the cervical and/or lumbar spine. These patients were significantly older when compared to the other patients (59.3 +/- 13.7 years vs 46.1 +/- 17.2 years, p = 0.001). Seventeen percent (n = 16) had arthropathies related to psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. Twelve percent (n = 10) were positive for the HLA B27 antigen. Other diseases were less frequent. Six patients (7%) could not be diagnosed conclusively, and four of these patients had negative Borrelia immunoassay results. In conclusion, Borrelia-associated diseases were rare in this study. Differential diagnoses helped to initiate a successful disease-specific therapeutic strategy."

Better knowledge of the genetic and structural bases for these interactions of B. burgdorferi with the extracellular matrix will be required before an understanding of the persistence of B. burgdorferi in the tissues and development of chronic infections can be achieved."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, produces the LuxS enzyme both in vivo and in vitro; this enzyme catalyses the synthesis of homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD) from a by-product of methylation reactions. Unlike most bacteria, B. burgdorferi is unable to utilize homocysteine. However, DPD levels alter expression levels of a subset of B. burgdorferi proteins. The present studies demonstrate that a single B. burgdorferi operon encodes both of the enzymes responsible for synthesis of DPD, as well as the enzyme for production of the Lyme spirochaete's only activated-methyl donor and a probable phosphohydrolase. Evidence was found for only a single transcriptional promoter, located 5' of the first gene, which uses the housekeeping sigma(70) subunit for RNA polymerase holoenzyme function. All four genes are co-expressed, and mRNA levels are growth-rate dependent, being produced during the exponential phase. Thus, high metabolic activity is accompanied by increased cellular levels of the only known borrelial methyl donor, enhanced detoxification of methylation by-products, and increased production of DPD. Therefore, production of DPD is directly correlated with cellular metabolism levels, and may thereby function as an extracellular and/or intracellular signal of bacterial health."

		"abstract": "Road traffic injuries constitute one of the main causes of death and disability in Italy and in the European Union. Although much scientific evidence exists on the important role of complete loss of consciousness in the dynamics of motor vehicle accidents, at present there is no specific legislation in Italy. Occupational medicine should take particular care in this field, because every year a large number of accidents with fatal outcomes occur among truck drivers. Via health surveillance, the occupational physician can play an important role in the prevention of such events. The aim of this article is to discuss some possible strategies of health surveillance, comparing the current Italian regulations with the recent guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Task Force regarding the association of syncope and road transport. Current Italian legislation does not include specific prescriptions in case of syncope in truck drivers. This deficiency leads to a lack of information for occupational physicians in order to define unanimous judgements of work fitness. The authors attempted to apply the ESC guidelines on syncope and truck driving to the Italian situation. Four cases of syncope were described, in which the judgement of work fitness for truck drivers proved to be especially complex and stressed the need for cooperation between occupational health physicians and cardiologists."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, employs several immune-evasive strategies to survive in mammals. Unlike mice, major reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi, rabbits are considered to be nonpermissive hosts for persistent infection. Antigenic variation of the VlsE molecule is a probable evasion strategy known to function in mice. The invariable region 6 (IR6) and carboxyl-terminal domain (Ct) of VlsE elicit dominant antibody responses that are not protective, perhaps to function as decoy epitopes that protect the spirochete. We sought to determine if either of these characteristics of VlsE differed in rabbit infection, contributing to its reputed nonpermissiveness. VlsE recombination was observed in rabbits that were given inoculations with either cultured or host-adapted spirochetes. Early observations showed a lack of anti-C6 (a peptide encompassing the IR6 region) response in most rabbits, so the anti-Ct and anti-C6 responses were monitored for 98 weeks. Anti-C6 antibody appeared as late as 20 weeks postinoculation, and the anti-Ct response, evident within the first 2 weeks, oscillated for prolonged periods of time. These observations, together with the recovery of cultivable spirochetes from tissue of one animal at 98 weeks postinoculation, challenge the notion that the rabbit cannot harbour a long-term B. burgdorferi infection."

Research conducted in endemic areas, shows not only that the population, which lives or works in tick habitats, is in a high risk for getting infected by LD cause, but also that every enviroment itself is specific in regard to both vectors and B. burgdoferi species. In our enviroment, research of seropositivity to B. bugdorferi in persons exposed to vectors of LD have not been conducted. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was a higher risk for getting B. burgdofei infection in the fieldworks of JKP \"Zelenilo Beograd\" than in other persons. Risk for getting LD in the fieldworkers of JKP \"Zelenilo Beograd\" (park-maintanance company) was determined according to seropositivity, the number and infection rate of LD vectors, and entomological risk index (ERI) value. Serum samples of 34 fieldworkers ofJKP \"Zelenilo Beograd\", and 35 persons of the control group, were tested for the presence of specific IgM and IgG anti-B. burgdofedi antibodies by using ELISA test In the research localities, the number of ticks was estimated by using the flag hours method, and tick infection rate was determined by dark field microscopy, with magnification rate of 400x. The data were analyzed statistically using chi(2) test, and Pearson's correlation analysis. Out of 34 fieldworkes serum samples, 8 (23.5%) were positive on anti-B. buagdorfei antibody presence, while in the control group only one (2.9%/0) sample was positive (p < 0,05). Seropositivity rate varied from 0-66.6% among localities. Flag hours value among the localities ranged from 8.2-29.9, and tick infection rate ranged from 10.8-22.3%. ERI value was 0.03-0.15. Correlation between flag hour rate and seropositivity, tick infection rate and seropositivity, and also ERI and seropositivity was established. Frequency of B. burgdorferi seropositivity was significantly higher in green-surface maintenance workers, than in the control group not exposed to these habitats. A significant correlation was found between anti-B. burgdofedi antibodies findings and the number of ticks, tick infection rate, and ERI. The results obtained in our study indicate that there was a significantly higher risk for getting LD cause in the fieldworkers than in the control group."

Accurate diagnosis of this rash is essential to initiating appropriate antibiotic therapy. To determine the sensitivity of history and physical examination characteristics for the diagnosis of erythema migrans. Structured MEDLINE searches of articles written only in English, 1966 through March 2007. Studies were included if they enrolled at least 15 consecutive patients with the diagnosis of erythema migrans and reported original data regarding the history and physical examination characteristics of the patients. One author abstracted data from the studies. We separately analyzed the studies from Europe and analyzed both Lyme-endemic and nonendemic areas of the United States to search for potential differences in the clinical presentation. Thirty-two studies from Europe, 20 studies from the United States, and 1 from Europe and the United States met inclusion criteria for a total of 8493 patients. Sensitivity was calculated for each of the variables. No studies included patients without erythema migrans, so specificity data and likelihood ratios could not be determined. Many patients do not recall a tick bite. Associated systemic symptoms, such as fever and headache, are frequently reported. Nausea and vomiting are rare. A solitary lesion is the most frequent presentation in both US (81%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 72%-87%) and European patients (88%; 95% CI, 81%-93%). Central clearing is less common in the endemic United States (19%; 95% CI, 11%-32%) vs Europe (79%; 95% CI, 69%-86%) and the nonendemic United States (80%; 95% CI, 63%-90%). Our analysis of the current available literature suggests that there is no single element in the history or physical examination that is highly sensitive by itself for the diagnosis of erythema migrans. Clinicians should be aware of the wide variability in the clinical presentation of erythema migrans and the need to factor in multiple components of the clinical examination and epidemiological context."

Patients with persistent symptoms after standard (2-4-week) antibiotic therapy for this tickborne illness have been denied further antibiotic treatment as a result of the perception that long-term infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, and associated tickborne pathogens is rare or nonexistent. I review the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi infection and the peer-reviewed literature on diagnostic Lyme disease testing, standard treatment results, and coinfection with tickborne agents, such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species. I also examine uncontrolled and controlled trials of prolonged antibiotic therapy in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease. The complex \"stealth\" pathology of B. burgdorferi allows the spirochete to invade diverse tissues, elude the immune response, and establish long-term infection. Commercial testing for Lyme disease is highly specific but relatively insensitive, especially during the later stages of disease. Numerous studies have documented the failure of standard antibiotic therapy in patients with Lyme disease. Previous uncontrolled trials and recent placebo-controlled trials suggest that prolonged antibiotic therapy (duration, >4 weeks) may be beneficial for patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms. Tickborne coinfections may increase the severity and duration of infection with B. burgdorferi. Prolonged antibiotic therapy may be useful and justifiable in patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease and coinfection with tickborne agents."

Some practitioners use the term \"chronic Lyme disease\" and order prolonged courses of oral and parenteral antibiotics, believing that persistent infection with Borrelia burgdorferi is responsible. However, well-performed prospective studies have found neither evidence of chronic infection nor a benefit worthy of long-term antibiotic therapy for these patients. Such extended antibiotic therapy poses hazards and cannot be viewed as acceptable. The term \"chronic Lyme disease\" should be discarded as misleading; rather, the term \"post-Lyme disease syndrome\" better reflects the postinfectious nature of this condition. Further research is necessary to understand possible mechanisms of these chronic symptoms following Lyme disease as well as to find effective therapies."

Two cases of LD with a different course of complete heart block (CHB) are described. In a 43-year-old man admitted due to episodes of syncope, the diagnosis of LD was delayed -- after pacemaker implantation -- when he developed joint and neurological symptoms. Following ceftriaxone treatment atrioventricular conduction returned to normal. In the second case of a 26-year-old woman, presenting on admission with fatigue and flu-like symptoms, ECG showed CHB with a stable escape rhythm of about 52/min. Unlike the first case, she could recall neither a tick bite nor skin rash, but epidemiological history and serologic test results were indicative of LD. In this case, antibiotic therapy did not influence atrioventricular block, which was well tolerated. This suggested the coexistence of borreliosis and previously unrecognised congenital CHB."

Ticks were caught by flagging method and Direct immunofluorescence method was used to detect the rate of bacteria borne by the tick. BSK UI culture medium was used to isolate the agent and Specific McAbs were used to identify the bacteria. SDS-PAGE protein profile and PCR-RFLP method were also used to identify the species of Spirochetes. Ticks, collected from China-Russia border of east Heilongiiang province were classified including Ixodes persulcatus Schulze, Dermacentor sivarum Olener, Haemaphysalis concinna Kock,and Haemaphysalis japonica Kock. We found that the distributon of ticks was different under different circumstances and the predominant species were also different in different ports. The rate of bacteria borne by Iodes persulaatus Schulze was 31.4% ,by Dermacentor sivarum Olener and Haemaphysalis concinna Kock were 2.2% and 3.8%, respectively. However,it was negative for Haenaphysalis japonica Kock. Spirochetes isolated from Ixodes persulcatus Schulze were collected from Dongning and Tongjiang while Genomic species of Spirochetes, isolated from ticks of the border belonged to B. garinii. All the results showed that the east border of Heilongjiang province was the natural focus of lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks (Ixodes spp.). Early manifestations of infection include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. Left untreated, late manifestations involving the joints, heart, and nervous system can occur. A Healthy People 2010 objective (14-8) is to reduce the annual incidence of Lyme disease to 9.7 new cases per 100,000 population in 10 reference states where the disease is endemic (Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin). This report summarizes surveillance data for 64,382 Lyme disease cases reported to CDC during 2003-2005, of which 59,770 cases (93%) were reported from the 10 reference states. The average annual rate in these 10 reference states for the 3-year period (29.2 cases per 100,000 population) was approximately three times the Healthy People 2010 target. Persons living in Lyme disease--endemic areas can take steps to reduce their risk for infection, including daily self-examination for ticks, selective use of acaricides and tick repellents, use of landscaping practices that reduce tick populations in yards and play areas, and avoidance of tick-infested areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a disease for which antibody-based detection assays are often required for diagnosis. The variable surface molecule VlsE and IR6, one of its invariable regions, are commonly targeted by the antibody response in infected individuals. A series of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays was performed to comparatively examine the antibody responses of North American LB patients (n = 37) to VlsE and invariable segments of this molecule. Both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG responses to full-length VlsE and to peptides reproducing invariable regions 2, 4, and 6, as well as the invariable domains at the amino and carboxyl termini of VlsE, were assessed. The proportions and specificities of reactivity to the invariable segments were tested by using cognate peptides as competitors for VlsE binding by patient serum antibodies. IR6 epitopes (by the C6 peptide) were found to dominate the response to invariable segments. IR6 (C6)-specific antibodies were detected in 78% of the serum specimens, whereas <40% of patients generated antibodies that bound the N- or C-terminal domain and <12% of patients responded to either IR2 or IR4. Interestingly, 15 of 37 patients generated IgG antibodies that reacted with C6 but not with VlsE. Conversely, IgM responses were frequent for VlsE but not for invariable segments. A representative number of the serum specimens (n = 8) that contained IgG antibodies reacting with both C6 and VlsE was assessed in competition experiments, using C6 as a competitor. Only half of these specimens contained IgG antibodies whose binding to VlsE could be inhibited >50% by competition with the added C6 peptide. The median percent inhibition was 45.5%. These findings indicate that IR6 epitopes are largely concealed from the VlsE molecular surface and that full-length VlsE-based diagnosis likely detects antibodies to conformational and/or variable region epitopes."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is largely resistant to being killed by its hosts' alternative complement activation pathway. One possible resistance mechanism of these bacteria is to coat their surfaces with host complement regulators, such as factor H. Five different B. burgdorferi outer surface proteins having affinities for factor H have been identified: complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 1 (BbCRASP-1), encoded by cspA; BbCRASP-2, encoded by cspZ; and three closely related proteins, BbCRASP-3, -4, and -5, encoded by erpP, erpC, and erpA, respectively. We now present analyses of the recently identified BbCRASP-2 and cspZ expression patterns throughout the B. burgdorferi infectious cycle, plus novel analyses of BbCRASP-1 and erp-encoded BbCRASPs. Our results, combined with data from earlier studies, indicate that BbCRASP-2 is produced primarily during established mammalian infection, while BbCRASP-1 is produced during tick-to-mammal and mammal-to-tick transmission stages but not during established mammalian infection, and Erp-BbCRASPs are produced from the time of transmission from infected ticks into mammals until they are later acquired by other feeding ticks. Transcription of cspZ and synthesis of BbCRASP-2 were severely repressed during cultivation in laboratory medium relative to mRNA levels observed during mammalian infection, and cspZ expression was influenced by culture temperature and pH, observations which will assist identification of the mechanisms employed by B. burgdorferi to control expression of this borrelial infection-associated protein."

		"abstract": "Tight regulation of surface antigenic expression is crucial for the pathogenic strategy of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. Here, we report the influence of increasing expression of decorin-binding protein A (DbpA), one of the most investigated spirochetal surface adhesins, on the 50% infectious dose (ID(50)), dissemination, tissue colonization, pathogenicity, and persistence of B. burgdorferi in the murine host. Our in vitro assays showed that increasing DbpA expression dramatically increased the interaction of B. burgdorferi with decorin and sensitivity to growth inhibition/killing by anti-DbpA antibodies; however, this increased interaction did not affect spirochetal growth and replication in the presence of decorin. Increasing DbpA expression significantly reduced ID(50) values and severely impaired dissemination in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and immunocompetent mice. During infection of SCID mice, B. burgdorferi with increased DbpA expression was able to effectively colonize heart and skin tissues, but not joint tissues, completely abrogating arthritis virulence. Although increasing DbpA expression did not affect spirochetal persistence in the skin, it diminished the ability of B. burgdorferi to persist in the heart and joint tissues during chronic infection of immunocompetent mice. Taken together, the study highlights the importance of controlling surface antigen expression in the infectivity, dissemination, tissue colonization, pathogenicity, and persistence of B. burgdorferi during mammalian infection."

		"abstract": "Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, which may result from infection-induced autoimmunity, is associated with HLA-DR molecules that bind an epitope of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) outer-surface protein A (OspA(165-173)) and with T cell reactivity with this epitope. One potential mechanism to explain these associations is molecular mimicry between OspA(165-173) and a self-peptide. Here, we searched the published human genome for peptides with sequence homology with OspA(165-173). The two peptides identified with the greatest sequence homology with the OspA epitope were MAWD-BP(276-288), which had identity at eight of the nine core amino acid residues, and T-span7(58-70), which had identity at six residues. MAWD-BP mRNA was expressed by synoviocytes, while T-span7 mRNA was not. However, neither peptide bound all of the HLA-DR molecules associated with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. Among 11 patients, 9 had T cell reactivity with OspA(161-170), 6 had responses to MAWD-BP(276-288), and 3 had reactivity with T-span7(58-70), but reactivity with the self-peptides was lower than that induced by the spirochetal epitope. Thus, there remains an association between OspA(165-173) and antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, and infection-induced autoimmunity is an attractive hypothesis to explain this outcome. However, molecular mimicry due to sequence homology between OspA(165-173) and a human peptide seems unlikely to be the critical mechanism."

		"abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness with significant morbidity and mortality. A variety of medical and psychiatric conditions occur concurrently with bipolar disorder. These conditions have been more frequently reported in adults. There prevalence in pediatric bipolar disorder is less known. This report is particularly relevant and timely due to the chronic nature of bipolar disorder and the profound impact on health that its treatments can bring. This evolving area needs to be understood to maximize clinical outcomes. While little has been published about pediatric bipolar disorder and its concurrent medical conditions specifically, many reports that focused on adults included pediatric subjects. Concurrent medical conditions fall into a small number of groupings. (1) Those that are related to bipolar disorder or its treatment. (2) Medical conditions that mimic mania. (3) Conditions that occur more commonly in patients with bipolar disorder, but do not appear to be related to its treatment. (4) Those that may be related to risk behaviors associated with bipolar disorder. Many medical conditions that occur concurrently with bipolar disorder in adults are also present in youth. The premature (iatrogenic) initiation of some conditions related to its treatment may pose specific ethical dilemmas for those treating psychiatric conditions."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, follows a life cycle that involves passage between the tick vector and the mammalian host. To investigate the role of the 36 kb linear plasmid, lp36 (also designated the B. burgdorferi K plasmid), in the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi, we examined a clone lacking this plasmid, but containing all other plasmids known to be required for infectivity. Our results indicated that lp36 was not required for spirochete survival in the tick, but the clone lacking lp36 demonstrated low infectivity in the mammal. Restoration of lp36 to the mutant strain confirmed that the infectivity defect was due to loss of lp36. Moreover, spirochetes lacking lp36 exhibited a nearly 4-log increase in ID(50) relative to the isogenic lp36(+) clone. The infectivity defect of lp36-minus spirochetes was localized, in part, to loss of the bbk17 (adeC) gene, which encodes an adenine deaminase. This work establishes a vital role for lp36 in the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi and identifies the bbk17 gene as a component of this plasmid that contributes to mammalian infectivity."

By use of ligand affinity blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, surface plasmon resonance, and functional complement assays, we have identified factor H-related protein 1 (FHR-1) as a novel protein that binds to the bacterium via CRASP-3, -4, and -5. When incubated in serum, serum-resistant Borrelia burgdorferi strain LW2 bind FHR-1, an additional member of the human factor H protein family, and, similarly, 2 mouse FHR proteins bind to the surface. Recombinant FHR-1 binds to 3 borrelial surface proteins (CRASP-3, -4, and -5) but not to CRASP-1 and -2. A comparative analysis of the individual CRASPs revealed common as well as distinct binding profiles for the 3 human regulators. FHR-1 binds to 3 CRASPs, and factor H binds to all 5 CRASPs. In addition, factor H-like protein 1 interacts with CRASP-1 and -2 but with no other borrelial proteins. Thus, by expressing multiple surface proteins with different binding properties, the pathogen can attach a unique combination of host complement regulators to its surface. For the pathogen, this type of surface decoration and specific acquisition of different host plasma proteins allows fine-tuning of the host immune attack."

The C6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, based on the IR6 region of VlsE, has become widely used in both the United States and Europe. We mapped the antigenic epitopes of IR6 to a shorter sequence that is equivalent in sensitivity and specificity to the full-length IR6 25-residue peptide. In addition, we observed significant differences in sensitivity between serum panels (60 to 100%), indicating that the selection of the serum panels can shape the apparent overall sensitivity of the assay. Contrary to prior reports, the assay sensitivity is greater when the IR6 peptide is derived from the sequence of the same infecting Borrelia genospecies. Using our North American panels and the two panels obtained from European Lyme disease patients, we determined that the IR6 assay that is based on a single genospecies of Borrelia spp. is not optimal for use as a universal diagnostic assay for Lyme disease."

One anemic dog had a positive Coombs' test. In 1 dog, Western blot analysis of serum yielded multiple positive bands with B turicatae lysate, indicating the spirochetemia most likely was due to B turicatae infection. In 2 dogs, spirochetes were cultured from the blood and identified using DNA analysis as Borrelia turicatae; 1 of these dogs also was seropositive for Ehrlichia canis and B burgdorferi. In 2 cases, spirochetemia was more prominent in blood smears prepared immediately after sample collection than in smears prepared from EDTA blood. Two dogs recovered with doxycycline treatment; 1 dog declined clinically despite treatment and was euthanized. B turicatae is the agent of tick-borne (endemic) relapsing fever in humans and is distinct from B burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease; however, serologic cross-reactivity may occur. B turicatae is transmitted by the soft tick, Ornithodoros turicata, and infection should be considered in dogs with spirochetemia and possible exposure to the tick vector."

Three questions were addressed: 1) Which antimicrobial agents are effective? 2) Are different regimens preferred for different manifestations of nervous system Lyme disease? 3) What duration of therapy is needed? The authors analyzed published studies (1983-2003) using a structured review process to classify the evidence related to the questions posed. The panel reviewed 353 abstracts which yielded 112 potentially relevant articles that were reviewed, from which 37 articles were identified that were included in the analysis. There are sufficient data to conclude that, in both adults and children, this nervous system infection responds well to penicillin, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline (Level B recommendation). Although most studies have used parenteral regimens for neuroborreliosis, several European studies support use of oral doxycycline in adults with meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculitis (Level B), reserving parenteral regimens for patients with parenchymal CNS involvement, other severe neurologic symptomatology, or failure to respond to oral regimens. The number of children (> or =8 years of age) enrolled in rigorous studies of oral vs parenteral regimens has been smaller, making conclusions less statistically compelling. However, all available data indicate results are comparable to those observed in adults. In contrast, there is no compelling evidence that prolonged treatment with antibiotics has any beneficial effect in post-Lyme syndrome (Level A)."

		"abstract": "Neuroborreliosis (NB) is a chronic infectious disease of the central nervous system (CNS) caused by a tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi. In addition to direct effects of the causative infectious agent, additional immunity-mediated mechanisms are thought to play a role in the CNS pathology of NB. In order to further understand the involvement of humoral immune mechanisms in NB, we dissected the intrathecal antibody responses down to the single-plasma-cell level. Starting with single-cell reverse transcription-PCR of fluorescence-activated cell sorter-sorted cerebrospinal fluid plasma cells from an NB patient, we identified expanded clones and resurrected the antigen specificity of their secreted antibodies through recombinant expression of the correctly paired immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes as monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). As expected, we found specificity for the causative infectious agent, B. burgdorferi, among the clonally expanded plasma cell (cePC)-derived MAbs. However, from an independent cePC of the same patient, we could derive MAbs specific for human CNS myelin, without detectable cross-reactivity with B. burgdorferi antigens. While reactivity against B. burgdorferi is a known feature of humoral immune responses in NB, we show (i) that immune responses specific for self antigens may be a distinct feature of CNS infections independent of pathogen reactivity and (ii) that humoral autoimmunity in NB (since found in cePC) is the result of a truly antigen-driven immune response. Our findings indicate that in NB mechanisms may be at play that induce distinct immune responses specific for pathogen and self antigens independent from \"molecular mimicry.\""

Thus, serological testing (Elisa, immunoblotting) is essential for a biological diagnosis. Specific antibody detection is usually done in serum and CSF of patients suspected of Lyme borreliosis. Laboratories must follow European recommendations to validate these assays in routine practice. Antibody detection lacks sensitivity in the early cutaneous phase of the infection. Therefore, serological testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of erythema migrans. The interpretation of serology must take into account the variability of Elisa sensitivity and specificity and the lack of standardization for Western-blotting in Europe. Besides these indirect diagnosis techniques, there is also direct detection of spirochetes by culture or by in vitro DNA amplification but these require adequate samples. These molecular tests must not be performed routinely, but only for specific clinical situations and in specialized laboratories only."

We demonstrate, using a guinea pig model of I. scapularis feeding and B. burgdorferi transmission, that immunity directed against salivary proteins expressed in the first 24 h of tick attachment - and not later - is sufficient to evoke all the hallmarks of acquired tick-immunity, to thwart tick feeding and also to impair Borrelia transmission. Defining this subset of proteins will promote a mechanistic understanding of novel I. scapularis proteins critical for the initiation of tick feeding and for Borrelia transmission."

Recent comprehensive guidelines have been published for the diagnosis and management of pediatric Lyme disease.

Controversy continues about the diagnosis and management of \"chronic Lyme disease\", despite the current medical literature. Recently published studies in the US have also better described southern tick-associated rash illness, an entity that may present a similar clinical picture to Lyme disease. Guidelines have also been published on the management and diagnosis of other tick-borne illnesses often seen as co-infections with Lyme disease. Finally, case reports have been published describing new cardiac manifestations associated with Lyme disease. Controversies persist about the diagnosis and management of Lyme disease. Recently published guidelines and primary research can aid clinicians in diagnosing Lyme properly."

The relapsing fever spirochetes contained six open reading frames that are absent from the B. burgdorferi genome. These genes included those for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hpt), adenylosuccinate synthase (purA), adenylosuccinate lyase (purB), auxiliary protein (nrdI), the ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase alpha subunit (nrdE), and the ribonucleotide-diphosphate reductase beta subunit (nrdF). Southern blot assays with multiple Borrelia species and isolates confirmed the presence of these genes in the relapsing fever group of spirochetes but not in B. burgdorferi and related species. TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that the chromosomal genes (hpt, purA, and purB) were transcribed in vitro and in mice. Phosphoribosyltransferase assays revealed that, in general, B. hermsii exhibited significantly higher activity than did the B. burgdorferi cell lysate, and enzymatic activity was observed with adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine as substrates. B. burgdorferi showed low but detectable phosphoribosyltransferase activity with hypoxanthine even though the genome lacks a discernible ortholog to the hpt gene in the relapsing fever spirochetes. B. hermsii incorporated radiolabeled hypoxanthine into RNA and DNA to a much greater extent than did B. burgdorferi. This complete pathway for purine salvage in the relapsing fever spirochetes may contribute, in part, to these spirochetes achieving high cell densities in blood."

		"abstract": "The alternative sigma factor RpoS (sigma38 or sigmaS) plays a central role in the reciprocal regulation of the virulence-associated major outer surface proteins OspC and OspA in Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete. Temperature is one of the key environmental signals controlling RpoS, but the molecular mechanism by which the signal is transduced remains unknown. Herein, we identify and describe a small non-coding RNA, DsrABb, that regulates the temperature-induced increase in RpoS. A novel 5' end of the rpoS mRNA was identified and DsrABb has the potential to extensively base-pair with the upstream region of this rpoS transcript. We demonstrate that B. burgdorferi strains lacking DsrABb do not upregulate RpoS and OspC in response to an increase in temperature, but do regulate RpoS and OspC in response to changes in pH and cell density. Analyses of the rpoS and ospC steady-state mRNA levels in the dsrABb mutant indicate that DsrABb regulates RpoS post-transcriptionally. The 5' and 3' ends of DsrABb were mapped, demonstrating that at least four species exist with sizes ranging from 213 to 352 nucleotides. We hypothesize that DsrABb binds to the upstream region of the rpoS mRNA and stimulates translation by releasing the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and start site from a stable secondary structure. Therefore, we postulate that DsrABb is a molecular thermometer regulating RpoS in Borrelia burgdorferi."

Thus, diagnostic PCR tests on blood samples have to be performed using methods which are optimised and validated for such conditions. There is a low probability that the organisms Toxoplasma gondii and Borrelia burgdorferi will be present. To confirm that robotic extraction methods followed by real time PCR will detect as little as one organism/test sample in postal specimens. Human blood samples spiked with decreasing numbers of each organism (range 10(5)-1/per extract) were extracted using two commercial kits on a Qiagen BioRobot EZ1 Workstation. Extracts of whole blood and blood fractions were tested by real time PCR. The effect of storage of blood for 1-6 days at room temperature was also investigated. Maximum sensitivity (1 organism/test sample) was achieved for T gondii with either extraction method; the sensitivity for B burgdorferi was between 1 and 10 organisms/test. Whole blood was the most suitable sample to extract, as both organisms were as likely to be detectable in the red cell as the white cell fraction. Sensitivity was not reduced by storing spiked samples at room temperature for up to 6 days. Inhibitory effects on PCR were not a significant problem provided that samples were extracted using the blood extraction kit. Using appropriate robotic extraction methods, both T gondii and B burgdorferi can be detected by real time PCR with near maximum possible sensitivity in whole blood samples. Blood samples can be transferred to reference laboratories by post without loss of sensitivity over the likely transit period."

The results indicated that expression of MCP-1 was significantly increased in U937 cells by B. burgdorferi. The activity of MMP-9 could be elevated by recombinant MCP-1 (rMCP-1) in U937 cells. MMP-9 was not upregulated by B. burgdorferi in fibroblasts. However, the expression of MCP-1 was significantly increased in the presence of B. burgdorferi in fibroblasts.

Land cover and land use influence disease transmission by controlling both the spatial distribution of vectors or hosts, and the probability of contact with susceptible human populations. The objective of this study was to combine environmental and socio-economic factors to explain the spatial distribution of two emerging human diseases in Belgium, Puumala virus (PUUV) and Lyme borreliosis. Municipalities were taken as units of analysis. Negative binomial regressions including a correction for spatial endogeneity show that the spatial distribution of PUUV and Lyme borreliosis infections are associated with a combination of factors linked to the vector and host populations, to human behaviours, and to landscape attributes. Both diseases are associated with the presence of forests, which are the preferred habitat for vector or host populations. The PUUV infection risk is higher in remote forest areas, where the level of urbanisation is low, and among low-income populations. The Lyme borreliosis transmission risk is higher in mixed landscapes with forests and spatially dispersed houses, mostly in wealthy peri-urban areas. The spatial dependence resulting from a combination of endogenous and exogenous processes could be accounted for in the model on PUUV but not for Lyme borreliosis. A large part of the spatial variation in disease risk can be explained by environmental and socio-economic factors. The two diseases not only are most prevalent in different regions but also affect different groups of people. Combining these two criteria may increase the efficiency of information campaigns through appropriate targeting."

In this study, we examined the effects of MZB cell depletion on the immune response to the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, an extracellular pathogen for which T-cell-independent antibody is an important host defense. MZB cell depletion of C3H/HeJ mice using monoclonal antibody to LFA-1 and alpha(4)beta(1) integrins reduced B. burgdorferi-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) titers, enhanced pathogen burden, and led to more severe arthritis assessed within the first 2 weeks of infection. In addition, MZB cell-depleted mice had reduced levels of B. burgdorferi-specific IgG, which correlated with diminished splenic CD4+ T-cell-activation, proliferation, and cytokine production. Passive transfer of immune mouse serum from infected control mice into infected MZB cell-depleted mice reduced pathogen burden but did not alter the expression of T-cell activation markers on splenic CD4+ T cells. These findings demonstrate that MZB cells not only are a source of pathogen-specific IgM important for limiting spirochete burden and pathology but also play a prominent role in the priming of splenic T-cell responses to a blood-borne pathogen."

		"abstract": "Acute facial nerve palsy in children may be caused by infection by Borrelia burgdorferi, but the incidence of facial nerve palsy and the proportion of facial nerve palsy caused by Lyme borreliosis may vary considerably between areas. Furthermore, it is not well known how often facial nerve palsy caused by Lyme borreliosis is associated with meningitis. In this population-based study, children admitted for acute facial nerve palsy to Stavanger University Hospital during 9 y from 1996 to 2004 were investigated by a standard protocol including a lumbar puncture. A total of 115 children with facial nerve palsy were included, giving an annual incidence of 21 per 100,000 children. 75 (65%) of these were diagnosed as Lyme borreliosis, with all cases occurring from May to November. Lymphocytic meningitis was present in all but 1 of the children with facial nerve palsy caused by Lyme borreliosis where a lumbar puncture was performed (n = 73). In this endemic area for Borrelia burgdorferi, acute facial nerve palsy in children was common. The majority of cases were caused by Lyme borreliosis, and nearly all of these were associated with lymphocytic meningitis."

		"abstract": "Results of previous immunological studies suggested that Borrelia burgdorferi regulates synthesis of the IpLA7 lipoprotein during mammalian infection. Through combined use of quantitative reverse transcription PCR, immunofluorescence analyses, ELISA and immunoblotting, it is now demonstrated that IpLA7 is actually expressed throughout mammalian infection, as well as during transmission both from feeding ticks to naïve mice and from infected mice to naïve, feeding ticks. However, proportions of IpLA7-expressing B. burgdorferi within tick midguts declined significantly with time following completion of blood feeding. Cultured bacteria differentially expressed IpLA7 in response to changes in temperature, pH and concentration of 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, the precursor of autoinducer 2, indicative of mechanisms governing IpLA7 expression. Previous studies also reported mixed results as to the cellular localization of IpLA7. It is now demonstrated that IpLA7 localizes primarily to the borrelial inner membrane and is not surface-exposed, consistent with the ability of these bacteria to produce IpLA7 throughout mammalian infection despite being the target of a robust immune response."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, a causative agent of Lyme disease, has a highly unusual segmented genome composed of both circular molecules and linear DNA replicons terminated by covalently closed hairpin ends or telomeres. Replication intermediates of the linear molecules are processed into hairpin telomeres via the activity of ResT, a telomere resolvase. We report here the results of limited proteolysis and mass spectroscopy to identify two main structural domains in ResT, separated by a chymotrypsin cleavage site between residues 163 and 164 of the 449 amino acid protein. The two domains have been overexpressed and purified. DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that the C-terminal domain (ResT(164-449)) displays sequence-specific DNA binding to the box 3,4,5 region of the telomere, while the N-terminal domain (ResT(1-163)) exhibits sequence-independent DNA binding activity. Further analysis by DNase I footprinting supports a model for telomere resolution in which the hairpin binding module of the N-terminal domain is delivered to the box 1,2 region of the telomere through its tethering to ResT(164-449). Conversely, ResT(1-164) may play an important regulatory role by modulating both sequence-specific DNA binding activity and catalysis by the C-terminal domain."

Lyme nephritis is a poorly characterized syndrome associated with severe glomerular and tubular renal injury and poor clinical outcome in young to middle-aged dogs positive for exposure to B. burgdorferi. The aims of this study were to identify associations between natural exposure to B. burgdorferi and the presence of microalbuminuria in nonclinical young Labrador and Golden Retrievers and to compare two commonly used serologic tests available to document B. burgdorferi exposure: the Western blot and the commercial point-of-care C6 peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Microalbuminuria was assessed using a commercial point-of-care ELISA specific for canine albumin. Blood and urine samples from 268 asymptomatic Labrador and Golden Retrievers were included. Of these, 18.7% were positive for B. burgdorferi exposure according to the C6 ELISA; 21.2% were positive for natural exposure to B. burgdorferi and 11.5% for vaccinal antibodies according to the Western blot. The agreement rate was 93% between the two tests (kappa = 0.78, P < 0.0001) for natural exposure. Urine from 6.1% of the dogs was positive for microalbuminuria. There was no association between microalbuminuria and exposure to B. burgdorferi based on results of a Western blot (P = 0.57) or C6 ELISA (P = 0.53). Microalbuminuria is likely not a consequence of B. burgdorferi exposure in young nonclinical Labrador and Golden Retrievers."

		"abstract": "One of the major lipids in the membranes of Borrelia burgdorferi is monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGalDAG), a glycolipid recently shown to carry antigenic potency. Herein, it is shown that the gene mgs (TIGR designation bb0454) of B. burgdorferi encodes for the protein bbMGS that, when expressed in Escherichia coli, catalyzes the glycosylation of 1,2-diacylglycerol with specificity for the donor substrate UDP-Gal yielding MGalDAG. Related lipid enzymes were found in many Gram-positive bacteria. The presence of this galactosyltransferase activity and synthesis of a cholesteryl galactoside by another enzyme were verified in B. burgdorferi cell extract. Besides MGalDAG, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol were also found as major lipids in the cell envelope. The high isoelectric point of bbMGS and clustered basic residues in its amino acid sequence suggest that the enzyme interacts with acidic lipids in the plasma membrane, in agreement with strong enzymatic activation of bbMGS by phosphatidylglycerol. The membrane packing and immunological properties of MGalDAG are likely to be of great importance in vivo."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most common tick-borne, infectious disease in the northern hemisphere. Disease manifestations in the United States and Europe vary as a result of geographic distribution of different species within the genospecies Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which in turn are host-specific. Certain toxigenic B. burgdorferi strains cause early disseminated disease. The ability of Borrelial organisms to break down the extracellular matrix also promotes dissemination. B. burgdorferi are eliminated by complement-mediated lysis and by T and B cell activity of the specific immune response. Yet, B. burgdorferi can evade humoral immunity by means of type of protective mechanism by which it adheres to the proteoglycan decorin in the joints and skin. A further factor in the persistence of the pathogen is altered antigen expression. Re-infection usually occurs with a different strain, although repeated infection with the same strain is also possible after a certain period of latency. New developments in serologic testing include the use of recombinant native antigen as well as antigens produced in vivo such as VlsE (variable major protein-like sequence, expressed) or decorin-binding protein A. Diagnosis continues to be complicated by seropositivity of healthy individuals, the persistence of antibodies after therapy, and a lacking humoral immune response in patients with erythema migrans."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a disease, which can affect several organs and cause a variety of symptoms. In some patients, the infection may become chronic, even after antibiotic therapy, and cause persisting damage. Dendritic cells (DC) are involved in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. To study interactions between Borrelia garinii (Bg), one of the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, and human DC, we used a cDNA microarray to compare the Bg-induced DC transcriptional response with the response induced by LPS. The Bg-induced response consisted of a smaller number of genes than the LPS-induced response. The microarray showed that the ectoenzyme CD38, which has an important role in DC chemotaxis and migration to lymph nodes, was strongly up-regulated by LPS but practically not at all by Bg. This finding was confirmed with quantitative RT-PCR and with flow cytometry at the protein level. In addition, RT-PCR showed that CCR7 expression was 11-fold greater in LPS-stimulated than in Bg-stimulated cells. These findings suggest that Bg may affect crucial DC functions by blocking the up-regulation of important molecules in DC migration to lymph nodes, thus affecting further immune responses in Lyme borreliosis infection."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia burgdorferi infectious cycle requires that the organism adapt to vast differences in environmental conditions found in its tick and mammalian hosts. Previous studies have shown that B. burgdorferi accomplishes this accommodation in part by regulating expression of its surface proteins. Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a borrelial protein important in colonization of the tick midgut. OspA is up-regulated when the organism is in its tick host and down-regulated when it is in a mammalian host. However, little is known about how it is up-regulated again in a mammalian host in preparation for entry into a feeding tick. Here, we report that the host neuroendocrine stress hormones, epinephrine and norepinephrine, are specifically bound by B. burgdorferi and result in increased expression of OspA. This recognition is specific and blocked by competitive inhibitors of human adrenergic receptors. To determine whether recognition of catecholamines, which are likely to be present at the site of a tick bite, may play a role in preparing the organism for reentry into a tick from a mammalian host, we administered a beta-adrenergic blocker, propranolol, to infected mice. Propranolol significantly reduced uptake of B. burgdorferi by feeding ticks and decreased expression of OspA in B. burgdorferi recovered from ticks that fed on propranolol-treated mice. Our studies suggest that B. burgdorferi may co-opt host neuroendocrine signals to inform the organism of local changes that predict the presence of its next host and allow it to prepare for transition to a new environment."

At 2 weeks of infection, one group was treated simultaneously with ceftriaxone and anti-TNF-alpha, whereas another received ceftriaxone at 2 weeks and anti-TNF-alpha 4 weeks later. One group received ceftriaxone treatment only. Infected and noninfected control groups were sham treated. At 14 weeks of infection, B. burgdorferi could not be detected by cultivation or by polymerase chain reaction in tissue samples of any mouse treated with ceftriaxone only. However, spirochetes grew from the tissue samples of one-third of the mice treated with anti-TNF-alpha simultaneously or 4 weeks after ceftriaxone. These activated spirochetes showed ceftriaxone sensitivity rates, plasmid profiles, and virulence rates similar to those of bacteria used to infect the mice. All infected control mice and mice given anti-TNF-alpha only were culture positive. This report shows that, after ceftriaxone treatment for 5 days, a portion of B. burgdorferi-infected mice still have live spirochetes in their body, which are activated by anti-TNF-alpha treatment."

The evolution of antibody rates is such that it doesn't constitute the best element to rely on for follow-up. Indeed, after a sometimes transitory increase of this rate during or after antibiotherapy, the decrease is very slow, sometimes several months, and often incomplete. The follow-up should thus be made according to clinical symptoms and their resolution. Resolution of some but not all symptoms must lead to discussing two options. The first is that of administrating a complementary antibiotherapy with a different mode of action than the first antibiotic used. The second is that this may be due to recontamination, especially in highly endemic zones, given that antibodies present have no protecting effect. In this case, a new antibiotherapy must of course be initiated."

Several different borrelial outer surface proteins have been identified as being able to bind host factor H, a regulator of the alternative pathway, leading to a hypothesis that such binding is important for borrelial resistance to complement. To test this hypothesis, the development of B. burgdorferi infection was compared between factor H-deficient and wild-type mice. Factor B- and C3-deficient mice were also studied to determine the relative roles of the alternative and classical/lectin pathways in B. burgdorferi survival during mammalian infection. While it was predicted that B. burgdorferi should be impaired in its ability to infect factor H-deficient animals, quantitative analyses of bacterial loads indicated that those mice were infected at levels similar to those of wild-type and factor B- and C3-deficient mice. Ticks fed on infected factor H-deficient or wild-type mice all acquired similar numbers of bacteria. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis of B. burgdorferi acquired by feeding ticks from the blood of infected mice indicated that none of the bacteria had detectable levels of factor H on their outer surfaces, even though such bacteria express high levels of surface proteins capable of binding factor H. These findings demonstrate that the acquisition of host factor H is not essential for mammalian infection by B. burgdorferi and indicate that additional mechanisms are employed by the Lyme disease spirochete to evade complement-mediated killing."

Tick density and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were monitored. Ticks were collected by flagging vegetation at three different altitudes (750 m, 880 m, and 1020 m above sea level). Ticks were examined for Borrelia by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse line blot. At the three altitudes, questing tick activity was not observed under 10 degrees C and was reduced when saturation deficit was higher than 5 mm Hg, most questing tick activity was occurred between 2 mm Hg and 7 mm Hg. Tick density and peak tick density were highest at 1020 m. High saturation deficits at the lowest altitudes appear to impair the tick population. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi infection in nymphs and adults decreased with altitude. The prevalence of infection was higher in adult ticks (47%) than in nymphs (29%). Four B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies were detected: B. afzelii (40%), B. garinii (22%), B. valaisiana (12%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (6%). Mixed infections were detected in 13% of infected ticks."

Women 40 years or older had a 48% higher risk than men 40 years or older and 42% higher risk than women younger than 40 years of attracting tick bites (0.0188 versus 0.0127 and 0.0188 versus 0.0132 tick bites respectively per hour). Additionally they had a 96% higher risk than men younger than 40 years of attracting tick bites (0.0188 versus 0.0096). The annual incidence rate of EM in women was 506 and in men 423 cases per 100,000 inhabitants (p<0.001). Significant differences in incidence rates occurred in those 40 years or older. Odds ratios for males infected with Borrelia afzelii developing nonannular EM were 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.33) in comparison to females infected by Borrelia afzeli. Significant gender differences in the risk of contracting tick bites, incidence rates, and clinical picture of EM have been observed. Exposure to tick bites alone may not explain these observations and further studies need to be done to clarify the biologic, immunologic, and sociological mechanisms causing these differences."

The outcome measures are the clearance of erythema migrans and associated symptoms of early localized Lyme disease and the prevention rate of late complications, with a low risk of adverse effects. Design. The reviewed studies were selected by Medline with the keywords: \"erythema migrans, treatment\". Sixteen studies comparing treatment or duration of treatment were analyzed. Amoxicillin, doxycycline, and cefuroxim axetil are equally efficacious for early-localized Lyme disease. Azithromycin is an alternative. Most patients respond completely and less than 10% fail to respond. All antibiotics are associated with a low frequency of adverse effects, with the exception of Jarisch Herxheimer reaction which occurs in about 15% of the patients. We recommend treating adults with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day in 3 intakes) or doxycycline (100 mg bid) for 14 days (erythema migrans) to 21 days (early localized Lyme disease with associated symptoms). For children, we recommend amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day in 3 intakes) or doxycycline (4 mg/kg/day in 2 intakes, maximum 100 mg/dose) above 8 years of age. Cefuroxim axetil (500 mg twice daily for adults or 30 mg/kg/day in 2 intakes, maximum 500 mg/dose, for children), and azithromycin (500 mg/day for adults and 20 mg/kg/day for children for 7-10 days) are second line treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick borne disease and is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors that transmit the infection to host mammals in endemic foci. Ixodes is infected by Borrelia at larval stage when it feeds on infected mammals. Man is an occasional host. The infection risk is linked to interaction between human and the natural environment. Strategies for prevention are closely related to the enzootic cycle of the Ixodes tick. Environmental measures to reduced tick density or host mammals are expensive, need to be repeated annually and cannot be applied to large areas. The primary prevention could be reduced to personal preventive measures such as reducing the amount of exposed skin and frequent checking for ticks. The risk of Lyme disease transmission after a tick bite is relatively low, and remains under 4%. The transmission rate depends on the duration of feeding. A rapide tick removal with fine tweezers or preferably special forceps and disinfection of the bite site appear to be the best technique. The absence of scientific evidence, and the risk of adverse events does not lead to recommending antimicrobial prophylaxis. Follow-up and educating the patients on the disease, clinical manifestation, and later primary prevention should be undertaken."

A very good basis to clarify this nosological and clinical entity is the study published by the \"European Concerted Action on Lyme Borreliosis\" (EUCALB). In fact, only few studies were performed on cohorts of patients including all clinical forms of LB. For Erythema migrans, serology sensitivity is low (20% to 50%), while the sensitivity of culture or PCR reaches 50%. In early-complicated forms, serology is more sensitive (70 to 90%) with the presence of concomitant IgG and IgM. Screening for antibodies in CSF is very useful for the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. For this clinical form, culture or PCR sensitivity is disappointing (10 to 30%). In arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA), IgG serology is 100% positive with very high titers; however IgM serology is only positive in 5 to 10% of the cases. In ACA, culture sensitivity ranges from 20 to 60% and PCR sensitivity from 60 to 90%. Specificity of antibodies, natural exposure to the etiologic agent, and cross-reactivity are critical for the final interpretation of serological assessment. Only the use of \"serological profiles\" allows the exploitation of detailed results (isotypes, intensity). In this approach, IgG avidity could be constructive. The western-blot is intended to confirm the specificity of antibodies found in screening methods (Elisa)."

EM results from the inflammatory response triggered by spirochete replication and likely develops to contain the initial infection but allows bacterial dissemination to occur. The essential lack of neutrophil involvement in EM histopathology prompted us to examine the consequence of increasing their recruitment in the inflammatory response to the Lyme disease agent. B. burgdorferi was modified genetically to constitutively express and secrete the chemokine KC, a neutrophil chemoattractant. After inoculation into the dermis of the murine host, control spirochetes induced an infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and basophils within 6 h; however, the recruited neutrophils and basophils were quickly substituted by eosinophils, and the inflammatory response became macrophage dominant by 16 h. Such a response failed to contain the initial infection and allowed the spirochetes to disseminate. In contrast, B. burgdorferi with KC secretion induced an intensive neutrophil infiltration at the inoculation site, and as a result, the host's ability to control the initial infection was greatly enhanced. Taken together, this study suggests that the failure of sufficient neutrophil recruitment and activation during the initial inflammatory response may allow B. burgdorferi to effectively colonize the mammalian host."

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) was selectively upregulated in the erythema migrans skin lesions of patients with acute Lyme disease. In this study, the mechanism of upregulation of MMP-9 was investigated in vitro and in vivo. The concentrations of MMP-9 and soluble CD14 were markedly elevated in serum from patients with acute Lyme disease and were also upregulated in U937 cells by B. burgdorferi in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. MMP-9 mRNA was expressed at baseline in fibroblasts in the presence or absence of B. burgdorferi. However, when fibroblasts were incubated with supernatants from U937 cells with B. burgdorferi or recombinant CD14, the expression of MMP-9 was significantly increased. This effect was completely abolished by the anti-CD14 antibody. These data suggest that the upregulation of MMP-9 by B. burgdorferi involves the CD14 pathway in infiltrating inflammatory cells. Fibroblasts could be recruited to amplify local production of MMP-9 by acquiring CD14 from macrophages."

Seventeen patients of 163 with arthritis, which were routinely examined by needle arthroscopy during 1995-2001 with a positive parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR of synovial biopsy were reevaluated. Investigations included medical history, clinical examination and blood tests. Joint fluid was taken on patients with joint effusion. The observation period of the 17 patients (F:M = 11:6) was 2-8 years (Ø = 6.5 years). In 8 of 17 patients the arthritis could not be classified neither at entry nor during the follow up of the study. The arthritis could be diagnosed in six patients early in the onset of the disease and included three cases of lyme arthritis of the knee joint, two cases with arthritis following a gastrointestinal infection (one with Salmonella typhimurium--positive faecal test--and the other one with a culture negative agent), one patient probably had an infection-associated arthritis after a gastrointestinal infection with Entamöeba histolytica (Schirmer et al. in Rheumatol Int 18:37-38, 1998; Kasliwal in Am J Proctol Gastroenterol Colon Rectal Surg 32:12, 16, 28, 1981; Haslock and Wright in J R Coll Phys Lond 8:1554-162, 1974; Than-Saw et al. in Trop Geogr Med 44:355-358, 1992) with remission after antibiotic therapy.

One patient with polyarthritis developed psoriasis of the skin 22 months later. From the nine patients with unclassified arthritis 4 (45%) got into complete remission with no symptoms or signs of joint inflammation after a disease course of 9-45 months, whereas 5 (55%) still demonstrate active non erosive arthritis (disease duration between 3 and 10 years). The presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in synovial tissue of patients with joint inflammation does not allow the diagnosis of parvovirus induced arthritis. If the arthritis remains unclassified and without erosions over time a virus associated aetiology may be assumed. However, no definitive diagnosis is possible even in the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in synovial tissue."

Due to etiological and laboratory particularities it is named LD-like syndrome or LD imitator syndrome. The condition is considered to be a zoonosis transmitted by ticks of the genus Amblyomma, possibly caused by interaction of multiple fastidious microorganisms originating a protean clinical picture, including neurological, osteoarticular and erythema migrans-like lesions. When peripheral blood of patients with LD-like syndrome is viewed under a dark-field microscope, mobile uncultivable spirochete-like bacteria are observed. PCR carried out with specific or conservative primers to recognize Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto or the genus Borrelia has been negative in ticks and in biological samples. Two different procedures, respectively involving hematoxylin and eosin staining of cerebrospinal fluid and electron microscopy analysis of blood, have revealed spirochetes not belonging to the genera Borrelia, Leptospira or Treponema. Surprisingly, co-infection with microorganisms resembling Mycoplasma and Chlamydia was observed on one occasion by electron microscopy analysis. We discuss here the possible existence of a new tick-borne disease in Brazil imitating LD, except for a higher frequency of recurrence episodes observed along prolonged clinical follow-up."

The transmission depends on several factors, especially on the duration of the tick's presence in the host body (the nymph which is smaller than the adults and thus less visible, is in this case the most frequently involved) and on whether the tick is infected or not. The interpretation of results in the few available studies is made difficult by the lack of information obtained (due to difficulty to collect information and examination costs). The comparison is made even more difficult by the difference between Borrelia ticks species in various regions. Today, the best methods are preventive: protective clothing, tick repellents, checking and removal of ticks after a journey in an endemic zone, and in case of tick bite, regular examination of the bite site during the following weeks in order to initiate an early curative treatment if ECM is diagnosed. The currently available data seems to be insufficient to suggest systematic antimicrobial prophylaxis in case of tick bite."

It has previously been shown that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signalling pathways are activated by B. burgdorferi in cultured human chondrocytes. Protein kinase C (PKC) signalling pathways are potential candidates that may control these downstream signalling pathways. Here we show that B. burgdorferi infection leads to phosphorylation and activation of novel PKC isoforms (PKC delta, epsilon, eta and theta) in a time-dependent manner. A specific inhibitor of novel PKC isoforms blocked the induction of pro-inflammatory molecules in response to B. burgdorferi infection as did transient transfection of novel PKC dominant-negative plasmids into chondrocytes. B. burgdorferi-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was also significantly inhibited by an inhibitor of novel PKC isoforms, suggesting that PKC activation occurs upstream of p38 activation. In vivo, administration of an inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isoforms to C3H/HeN mice infected with B. burgdorferi resulted in significantly reduced ankle inflammation and swelling. In conclusion, these data suggest that novel PKC isoforms are specifically activated by B. burgdorferi infection and this can contribute to the regulation of inflammation in vitro and in vivo."

We merged the information contained in the Delaware Electronic Reporting Surveillance System (DERSS) with an existing database containing case reports of Lyme disease collected at the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) for 2000-2004. The 2000 United States Census Bureau data relevant to Delaware was used to calculate incidence rates. Annual incidence rates by age, sex, county, race, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) were calculated. Frequency of EM and other late manifestations of Lyme disease as well as antibiotic and median duration of use were calculated. During 2000-2004, a total of 962 confirmed cases of Lyme disease were reported to DPH, for a crude mean incidence rate of 24.6 cases/100,000 persons/year (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.8-26.3). The annual incidence rate remained approximately constant during 2000-2004, with no statistically significant rate difference among the reporting years. Highest incidence rates were observed in Kent County, at 27.8 cases/ 100,000 persons/year (95% CI, 23.0-32.3). Age-related incidence followed a bimodal distribution, with the initial peak among children aged 5-14 years, followed by a second peak among adults aged 60-64 years. Males were disproportionately represented among the age ranges of 5-19 years, 60-69 years, 75-79 years, and >85 years. Lyme disease was most commonly diagnosed during June, July, and August. Fifty-one percent of reported cases had physician-diagnosed EM. Lyme disease prevention programs should specifically target populations at high risk, as defined in this report. A substantial percentage of reported cases lacked physician-diagnosed EM. Physicians should be aware of the spectrum of Lyme disease clinical manifestations and the local Lyme disease epidemiology to best serve their patient population."

Using cytometric bead array and flow cytometry techniques, chemokine and cytokine levels were determined in 65 synovial fluid (SF) samples and 7 synovial tissue (ST) samples from 17 patients with antibiotic-responsive Lyme arthritis and 35 patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis seen during the past 18 years. In the ST samples, expression of chemokine receptors was measured using immunohistochemistry. Before or during antibiotic therapy, when the majority of patients had positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for Borrelia burgdorferi DNA, SF from patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis contained exceptionally high levels of Th1 chemoattractants and cytokines, particularly CXCL9 and interferon-gamma (IFNgamma). Compared with the patients whose arthritis was responsive to antibiotic treatment, those with antibiotic-refractory arthritis had significantly higher levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10 (both P<or=0.001) and CCL3, CCL4, CXCL8, IFNgamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and IL-6 (all P<or=0.01). During the post-antibiotic period, when the results of PCR for B burgdorferi DNA in SF and ST were uniformly negative, patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis continued to exhibit high SF and ST levels of these chemokines and cytokines. In addition, synovial samples showed marked expression of the receptors for T cell or macrophage chemokines, CXCR3 and CCR5. Patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis have high synovial fluid levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, especially CXCL9 and IFNgamma, throughout the illness. Thus, even when antibiotic treatment reduces or completely clears the infection in these patients, the inflammatory response in synovium persists."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne zoonosis due to bacterial infection by Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato The disease presents differently in Europe or North America and may be called European borreliosis when acquired in Europe. Lyme borreliosis evolves in 3 stages. The main manifestations include cutaneous, neurological, and joint involvement. Erythema migrans (EM) is the most specific and most frequent finding in patients with Lyme borreliosis. It is the hallmark of early-localized borreliosis. EM is a slowly expanding red macula that occurs in about 60-80% of patients contracting Lyme borreliosis. Central clearing of the red patch can occur. It appears at the site of the tick bite, 7 to 20 days after the bite. Borrelial lymphocytoma (BL) occur rarely in patients with the early-disseminated stage of the disease. BL is a red or brown nodule or plaque located on the nipple, the earlobe, the scrotum, or the face. It should not be confused with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is the cutaneous manifestation of late borreliosis. It starts as a violaceous patch, usually located on the extensor surface of a limb. Periarticular nodules and cords can also be present. Without treatment, it will evolve over weeks or months to the typical atrophic stage with extensive dermo-epidermal atrophy and visibility of superficial veins. Only these 3 manifestations are clearly related to an infection with B. burgdorferi. The relationship between infection with B. burgdorferi and other dermatoses, especially morphea, lichen sclerosus, and interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is still debated."

Serum immunoglobulin levels, presence of IgG and IgE anti-B. burgdorferi components, and distributions of blood T, B and natural killer lymphocyte subsets were studied in B. burgdorferi-infected and -uninfected children (nephelometry, UniCAP Total IgE Fluoroenzymeimmunoassay, Western blot, flow cytometry). Total serum IgM, IgG, IgE and IgA levels, and distributions of blood lymphocytes (CD4(+), CD8(+), CD19(+)) of both groups, excluding CD8(+)CD60(+) T cells, were within normal ranges. However, infected, but not uninfected children made IgG anti-B. burgdorferi proteins p18, p31, p34, p41, p45, but not IgG anti-p60, and IgE anti-B. burgdorferi proteins p31, p34, p41, p45, p60, but not IgE anti-p18. These proteins were also detected in an infected child 1 year post-infection. Interestingly, CD8(+)CD60(+) T-cell numbers were significantly increased (fourfold) in infected, compared with uninfected, patients (P=0.001). These results demonstrate that specific IgE anti-B. burgdorferi Abs are generated and persist in children with Lyme disease and that CD8(+)CD60(+) T cells may play an important role in these responses."

There are reports of secondary parvovirus infection in immunocompromised persons, but no reports of symptomatic secondary infection in healthy persons. We describe a healthy 39-year-old woman who presented with fever, rash, and arthralgia. Her symptoms were thought most compatible with parvovirus B19 infection, but she reported prior positive parvovirus antibody 2 years earlier during prenatal care. Tests were therefore also sent for HIV, streptococcal infection, hepatitis C, and Lyme disease. Testing revealed both elevated IgG and IgM antibodies for parvovirus B19; previously, the patient was positive only for IgG. On a subsequent visit she related that a community outbreak of parvovirus developed in her town and church group. We believe this case demonstrates that a symptomatic secondary infection with parvovirus can occur in healthy persons, and that prior positive antibody test does not preclude the development of acute infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is characterized by cellular inflammatory responses at multiple body sites. Recently, an association of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and Lyme arthritis was suggested. In this context, it is of special interest that the heterodimeric cytokine IL-23 can act on T cells and initiate the up-regulation of effector cytokines such as IL-17. To determine the role of this specific cytokine cascade for the induction of subsequently induced proinflammatory events we developed an in vitro system to investigate the IL-23-inducing capacity of Borrelia burgdorferi and the potential of the spirochete for inducing the IL-23/IL-17 axis. We used cells derived from mice deficient for IL-23 or IL-12 only or deficient for both IL-12 and IL-23 to define precisely the function of these cytokines. Experiments with bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) identified these cells as sources for IL-23 but not for IL-12 after B. burgdorferi exposure. Subsequent investigations with T cell-depleted splenocyte fractions revealed a tight IL-23/IL-17 axis in response to the spirochetes. Monoclonal antibodies that block IL-23 showed further that BMDC-derived IL-23 was required for production of IL-17 in this experimental model. These in vitro data describing a spirochete-induced release of IL-23 may help to define IL-17-dependent inflammatory responses in the disease."

		"abstract": "Non-antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis is only indicated in a few specific clinical situations. In chronic Lyme arthritis, intra-articular steroids are useful to immediately relieve symptomatic joint effusion. Nevertheless, 4 studies with weak methodological evidence were convergent enough to recommend not proposing intra-articular injection before or even immediately after antibiotic treatment. The injection can only be recommended in the treatment of patients whose joint effusion persists despite 2 courses of oral antibiotherapy or one course of IV antibiotherapy. For some experts, the injection can only be made after negative PCR assessment of the joint fluid for spirochetes. This recommendation, although logical, has never been evaluated. Radiation synovectomy may be indicated in persistent synovitis after antibiotherapy and before surgical synovectomy. Further studies are mandatory to confirm the role of radiation synovectomy in the local therapy. Arthroscopic synovectomy can reduce the period of joint inflammation when persistent synovitis is associated with significant pain or limited function. Several experts recommend using the procedure only if synovitis persists after 2 months of antibiotherapy and a negative PCR joint fluid assessment. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often prescribed for their symptomatic effects. Experimental data is consensual on the deleterious consequences of systemic corticosteroid therapy. Corticosteroids are not indicated in Lyme's disease. In post Lyme's disease syndrome, patient complaints may lead to a multidisciplinary therapeutic management and the use of neuro-psychiatric drugs."

Most of ocular manifestations occur during the late phase of the disease. The infection needs to be considered along with more conventional causes of ocular inflammation, particularly in regions where Lyme disease is common. The pathogenesis of this condition remains controversial. Direct ocular infection and a delayed hypersensitivity mechanism may be involved at different disease stages. Uveitis and optic neuritis are the most common ocular complications. Serological testing lacks sensitivity and specificity. In atypical cases, ocular fluids sampling and analysis may be proposed. PCR seems to be an interesting diagnostic tool, allowing genotypic analysis. In the majority of cases, therapeutic strategy should be based on the association of antibiotics and corticosteroids. A new course of antibiotics may be prescribed to patients with chronic or relapsing inflammation due to bacterial persistence in ocular tissues."

The pathogen abundantly expresses OspC during initial infection when the antigen is required, but downregulates when its presence poses a threat to the spirochetes once the anti-OspC humoral response has developed. Here, we show that a large palindromic sequence immediately upstream of the ospC promoter is essential for the repression of ospC expression during murine infection and for the ability of B. burgdorferi to evade specific OspC humoral immunity. Deletion of the sequence completely diminished the ability of B. burgdorferi to avoid clearance by transferred OspC antibody in SCID mice. B. burgdorferi lacking the regulatory element was able to initiate infection but unable to persist in immunocompetent mice. Taken together, the regulatory element immediately upstream of the ospC promoter serves as an operator that may interact with an unidentified repressor(s) to negatively regulate ospC expression and is essential for the immune evasion of B. burgdorferi."

To explore the activities of these genes in vivo, a comprehensive analysis of pgf 54 genes BBA64, BBA65, and BBA66 was performed to assess the genetic stability, host antibody responses, and kinetics of gene expression in the murine model of persistent infection. DNA sequencing of pgf 54 genes obtained from re-isolates at 1 year postinfection demonstrated that all genes of this family are stable and do not undergo recombination to generate variant antigens during persistent infection. Antibodies against BBA64 and BBA66 appeared soon after infection and were detectable throughout the infection, suggesting that there was gene expression during infection. However, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed that BBA64 gene expression was considerably decreased in Borrelia residing in the mouse ear tissue compared to the expression in cultured spirochetes by 20 days postinfection and that the levels of expression remained low throughout the infection. Conversely, transcription of the BBA65 and BBA66 genes was increased, and both of these genes were continuously expressed until 100 days postinfection; this was followed by periods of differential expression late in infection. The expression profile of the BBA64 gene suggests that this gene has an important role during tick-to-host transmission and early infection, whereas the expression profile of the BBA65 and BBA66 genes suggests that these genes have a role in persistent infection. The differential regulation of pgf 54 genes observed during infection may help confer a survival advantage during persistent infection, influencing mechanisms for B. burgdorferi dissemination, tissue tropism, or evasion of the adaptive immune response."

OspA, which is a receptor for attaching spirochetes to the tick gut, is down regulated as the spirochetes leave the tick and enter the mammalian host. Although OspA is not a major antigen produced in the mammal, the protein appears to be produced under some conditions and production has been linked to more severe disease. A Lyme disease vaccine based on recombinant OspA has been approved for human use. However, the vaccine is no longer available, in part because of fears that OspA causes arthritis in people. To further understand the consequences of OspA production in the host, we created a Borrelia burgdorferi mutant that was unable to down regulate OspA. C3H/HeN mice infected with this mutant developed a specific anti-OspA immune response, and the spirochetes were unable to persist in these mice. In contrast, immunodeficient SCID mice were persistently infected with the mutant. We conclude that spirochetes producing OspA and B from the flaB promoter in immunocompetent mice stimulate an immune response that clear the bacteria without any signs of disease development in the mice."

Painful meningoradiculitis, encephalomyelitis and encephalitis, and symptoms of depression are the most characteristic at this stage. The diagnosis should be based on the association of clinical, epidemiological, and biological features. Adequate treatment usually leads to recovery. In stage 3 of the disease, the link between neurological manifestations and initial infection is uncertain.

		"abstract": "The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in case of joint and muscular presentations is generally suggested by epidemiological factors. However, as a rule, laboratory testing is required to confirm the diagnosis. When considering the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis in France, the only areas free of ticks infected by Borrelia burgdorgeri sl, are those close to the Mediterranean sea or at high altitude. The risk is greatest in the Alsace region. Exposure is particularly high among forest workers and people who use the countryside for their leisure activities. The likelihood of infection following a tick bite is difficult to assess; indeed, the bite site may remain unnoticed. A medical history of erythema migrans, if untreated, is a major diagnostic clue, although the association appears to be less consistent in France than in the US. Lyme arthritis generally arises apparently spontaneously. It is characteristically mono- or oligo-articular, asymmetrical, predominantly affects the knee, and has an intermittent course. Synovial cysts and enthesitis are common. Myositis is rare, polymorphic, and has been linked to other symptoms in the same localizations. Minor arthralgia and myalgia frequently occur, principally early in the course of the infection. It was suggested that sequels of the disease include so-called fibromyalgic syndromes. The principal differential diagnosis as far as arthritis is concerned, is made on spondylarthropathy and chronic juvenile arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is another pathology, although Lyme arthritis does sometimes evolve to chronicity."

		"abstract": "Arthropod-borne diseases are a real public health problem. One of these, Lyme disease, is a bacterial infection due to Borrelia spp., transmitted by a hard tick, Ixodes spp.. The infection is particularly prevalent in the Northern Hemisphere and primary prevention relies on the use of repellents for cloth impregnation (pyrethroids) or for skin application (DEET). Pyrethroids and DEET are the two most studied repellents. The concentration of the active principle is essential to get a real repellent efficiency. The most efficient are: DEET at 30-50%, picaridin or KBR3023 at 20%, citriodiol at 30-50%, and IR35/35 at 20-35%. These molecules may induce adverse-effects. Considered for some time as cosmetics, a new European regulation now defines these molecules as biocides."

This fact may be explained by several factors: the specific pathophysiology, involving not only the presence of bacteria, but also immunological reactions. There is no specific method of diagnosis resulting in difficulties for good indication of treatment and to evaluate treatment efficacy. The literature review shows that ceftriaxone and doxycycline are the two most efficient antibiotics in this indication. Even if the methodology of the published studies is not always convincing, these two antibiotics proved their efficacy in articular as well as in neurological forms of the disease. In the late stage of borreliosis, antibiotics are less efficient. Various treatment modalities with different dosage or duration of treatment cannot let us conclude on a convincing regimen."

		"abstract": "Considerable effort has been made to elucidate the mechanism of Lyme arthritis. We focused on p19, a cell cycle-regulating molecule, because it is known to inhibit cell cycle division of T lymphocytes which may be responsible for the induction of arthritis. We show that anti-p19 antibody treatment enhances the inflammatory response normally detected at the tibiotarsal joints of Borrelia burgdorferi-vaccinated and Borrelia bissettii-challenged mice. Specifically, anti-p19 antibody treatment augmented the severity of inflammation within the synovial and subsynovial tissue. Moreover, treatment with anti-p19 antibody caused severe erosion of cartilage and bone with ankle joint destruction. In addition, anti-p19 antibody treatment of Borrelia-vaccinated and -challenged mice enhanced the borreliacidal antibody response, especially against the vaccine isolate. The novel activities of anti-p19 antibody show that p19 may be an important therapeutic site for the treatment of Lyme arthritis."

In the secondary stage, LB diagnosis is established with an Elisa serology confirmed by a Western blot. The interpretation criteria of these laboratory tests should follow European recommendations (EUCALB). LB with neurological involvement should be confirmed by screening for intrathecal synthesis of borrelia antibodies in CSF. LB with rheumatologic expression could be confirmed by screening for borrelia in joint fluid by PCR. There is no strong marker of activity of the disease. Follow-up for LB is difficult, because antibodies may persist for years and LB does not confer immunization."

Outer surface protein (Osp) A participates in spirochete adherence to the tick gut. As ospB is expressed on a bicistronic operon with ospA, we have now investigated the role of OspB by generating an OspB-deficient B. burgdorferi and examining its phenotype throughout the spirochete life cycle. Similar to wild-type isolates, the OspB-deficient B. burgdorferi were able to readily infect and persist in mice. OspB-deficient B. burgdorferi were capable of migrating to the feeding ticks but had an impaired ability to adhere to the tick gut and survive within the vector. Furthermore, the OspB-deficient B. burgdorferi bound poorly to tick gut extracts. The complementation of the OspB-deficient spirochete in trans, with a wild-type copy of ospB gene, restored its ability to bind tick gut. Taken together, these data suggest that OspB has an important role within Ixodes scapularis and that B. burgdorferi relies upon multiple genes to efficiently persist in ticks."

After excluding Lyme borreliosis and cerebellopontine angle tumour, a diagnosis of idiopathic familial peripheral facial palsy was made. Peripheral facial nerve palsy is commonly seen in children and young adults. Obtaining a family history is helpful in these patients: a positive family history is found in 2.4-28.6% of the cases. In the absence of other symptoms, a diagnosis of idiopathic familial peripheral facial palsy should be considered.

We specified every time on which basis each disorder was attributed to Lyme disease, particularly if European or American criteria were met. Every part of the nervous system can be involved: from central to peripheral nervous system, and even muscles. In endemic areas, Lyme serology must be assessed in case of unexplained neurological or psychiatric disorder. In case of positive serology, CSF assessment with intrathecal anti-Borrelia antibody index will be more efficient to prove the diagnosis."

We present a case where a final etiologic diagnosis is not possible, in spite of an exhaustive study. A 34-year-old man presented with a 5-year history of transient neurological deficits. Examination disclosed a cortico-subcortical dementia, but no other deficits. Laboratory evaluation was unremarkable, including the basic vascular study, homocystein, immunologic study, ACE, serology for Lyme, syphilis and HIV, tests for mitochondrial cytopathy, CADASIL and Fabry's disease, and CSF study. Prothrombotic study was normal except for a heterozygous mutation for factor V Leiden and for methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase. Cardiac exams (electrocardiogram, transesophagic echocardiography and 24 h-ECG) were normal. Cervical and transcranial duplex ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)-were normal, except for a hypoplasic right vertebral artery. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed corticosubcortical atrophy and multiple infarcts. The patient was prescribed antiplatelet and statin therapy, and is presently clinically stabilized after 3 years of follow-up, scoring 2 in modified Rankin scale. Differential diagnosis of young onset vascular dementia is wide, including a number of rare sporadic and hereditary diseases. Although our case has a heterozygotic mutation for factor V Leiden, this might not explain the whole clinical picture; furthermore, there is no history of other vascular events, as venous thrombosis. An extensive investigation did not lead to a final etiological diagnosis. Nevertheless, even in these cases prevention with antiplatelet and statin might lead to clinical stabilization."

		"abstract": "Tick bites are best prevented by people avoiding tick-infested areas. When this is not possible, tick bites may be prevented by the wearing of long trousers that are tucked into boots. The best method to avoid tick bites is twofold: application of a topical deet (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) repellent to exposed skin, and treatment of clothing with permethrin. This system is currently used by the US Army to protect soldiers. Ticks can crawl underneath clothing and bite untreated portions of the body; therefore, treating clothing is imperative. Permethrin is nontoxic to humans, and can be used in any age group. Permethrin is commercially available. Checking clothing regularly while in tick-infested areas is highly recommended to back up the few hours of protection provided by the insect repellents. It is also recommended that the entire body be carefully screened for ticks and other parasites by campers and hunters while they are staying in and after leaving infested areas. Any tick found should be removed immediately. Removing ticks may not be easy. It is best to use blunt, rounded forceps, and a magnifying glass to remove ticks, especially when immature ticks are found. The forceps are used to grasp the mouthparts of the tick as close as possible to the skin, and then the tick is pulled upward, perpendicular to the skin, with a continuous and steady action. Usually any mouth parts of the tick retained in the skin are eliminated uneventfully by the body. Other methods of removing ticks, such as using fingers, lighted cigarettes, petroleum jelly, or suntan oil, should be avoided. Killing the tick in situ may increase the risk of regurgitation by the tick and the transmission of infectious agents. Most stick bites are uncomplicated, and result only in benign cutaneous inflammatory reactions that may be pruritic for a few days. As a result of mouthparts being retained at the feeding site, a granuloma may rarely develop. There are no data to indicate that antimicrobial prophylaxsis is beneficial to the tick-bitten patient to prevent disease. It must be kept in mind that the risk of transmission of disease increases with the duration of attachment and generally requires greater than 24 to 48 hours. The degree of tick engorgement or the time since tick exposure and discovery of the tick may be used to establish the likely duration of attachment and the risk of disease transmission. Reducing and controlling tick populations is difficult. Habitat modifications, including vegetation management by cutting, burning, and herbicide treatment, and drainage of wet areas are one strategy for tick control, but their effects are often short-lived, and they can cause severe ecologic damage. Chemicals used to control ticks may cause environmental contamination, and therefore, toxicity for humans and animals. Biologic control methods for ticks include the promotion of natural predators. Natural predators of ticks are beetles, spiders, and ants, and parasites such as insects, mites and nematodes. Tick control is best based on the concept of integrated pest management, in which different control methods are adapted to one area or against one tick species with due consideration to their environmental effects. Tick-borne diseases are increasing in prevalence. Perhaps it is because people are undertaking more outdoor activities, which result in contact with ticks and their pathogens. Clinicians should be aware of the clinical sign of tick-transmitted diseases, because morbidity and mortality as a result of these diseases increases substantially if there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. Tick-borne illness occur in distinctive geographic areas. The reporting of these illnesses and diseases to the health department enables the gathering of information and statistics. The public should be informed about the risks of disease in tick-infested areas and the means of preventing infections. The most common diseases are caused by Rickettsia, Borrelia, and Ehrichia, but with continued study, new pathogens and diseases will continue to emerge."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus ticks and mice can be infected with both Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia garinii. The effect of coinfection with these two Borrelia species on the development of murine Lyme borreliosis is unknown. Therefore, we investigated whether coinfection with the nonarthritogenic B. garinii strain PBi and the arthritogenic B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain B31 alters murine Lyme borreliosis. Mice simultaneously infected with PBi and B31 showed significantly more paw swelling and arthritis, long-standing spirochetemia, and higher numbers of B31 spirochetes than did mice infected with B31 alone. However, the number of PBi spirochetes was significantly lower in coinfected mice than in mice infected with PBi alone. In conclusion, simultaneous infection with B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto results in more severe Lyme borreliosis. Moreover, we suggest that competition of the two Borrelia species within the reservoir host could have led to preferential maintenance, and a rising prevalence, of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in European I. ricinus populations."

		"abstract": "The role of molecular detection, identification and typing or fingerprinting of microorganisms has shifted gradually from the academic world to the routine diagnostic laboratory. Molecular methods have been used increasingly over the past decade to improve the sensitivity, specificity and turn-around time in the clinical laboratory. Molecular methods have also been used to identify new and nonculturable agents. Many high-throughput molecular tests are now available commercially, which impacts on the infrastructure in many of the diagnostic laboratories. In this paper, we take an overall look at the use of molecular methods (prospects vs. pitfalls) based on our clinical and public health experience, particularly as they related to Borrelia burgdorferi, a vector-borne pathogen, Treponema pallidum, a re-emerging sexually transmitted global pathogen, and West Nile virus, a newly recognized virus in North America."

Manifestations of the cases reviewed were similar to those of non-transplant patients. There appeared to be no obvious correlation between immunosuppression and the occurrence of the illness in the transplant recipients. Serologic testing failed to make a diagnosis in 1 patient with HME in the literature and in our patient with HGA, but molecular tests established the diagnosis in both cases.

		"abstract": "Chronic, antibiotic treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis develops in a subset of patients following infection with the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and persists after apparent microbial clearance. IgG responses to Outer Surface Protein (Osp) A, an abundant spirochetal lipoprotein, correlate with both severity and duration of joint inflammation. Characterization of this OspA-directed antibody response is, therefore, important for understanding some of the mechanisms that sustain persistent pathology. Such analyses in Lyme arthritis patients have been previously hampered by relatively small amounts of clinical blood samples, as well as the general intractability and low success rates of B-cell immortalization procedures. Here we describe a robust method for generation of OspA-specific monoclonal antibody fragments from archival cell samples employing a three-step procedure -- isolation of single OspA-specific B-cells, their ex vivo clonal expansion and production of expressed immunoglobulins as single chain variable region fragments (scFvs). Interestingly, two of three scFvs generated from a single patient were of a common clonal origin, additional somatic mutations in the downstream member resulting in a concomitant modulation of antigen binding affinity. Computational docking of OspA into corresponding Fv domains, generated by molecular modeling, reveals subtle binding site differences which could account for the observed alteration in ligand binding. Besides their utility as standards in routine diagnostic assays, being the first described OspA-specific human monoclonal reagents, these scFvs are useful tools for analysis of the anti-OspA repertoire in patients and for identification of putative human mimics of the bacterial protein."

The resulting disorders, known collectively as neuroborreliosis or nervous system Lyme disease, generally respond well to antimicrobial therapy. Definitive treatment of nervous system infection typically consists of 2 to 4 weeks of parenteral ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or high-dose penicillin (Class III). However, numerous European studies have shown that oral doxycycline is equally effective in patients with Lyme meningitis and cranial neuritis (Class II and III). This may be equally valid in patients infected with the strains prevalent in the United States, but this remains to be established."

Borrelia burgdorferi can induce the production of several proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The aim of our study was to find out whether the balance between inflammatory and regulatory mechanisms is important in determining the course of Lyme borreliosis. 13 patients with early Lyme borreliosis, 8 patients with chronic Lyme disease with neurological or joint manifestations, and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Chronic forms of Lyme borreliosis were characterized by stronger TNF-alpha response by monocytes to lipopolysaccharide as well as to borrelia antigen compared to early Lyme borreliosis and the healthy state. The percentage of IL-10-secreting monocytes in response to borrelia lysate was lower in the Lyme borreliosis patients than in healthy controls. The percentage of CD4(+) CTLA-4(+) regulatory T cells showed the highest values in early Lyme borreliosis. We conclude that chronic forms of Lyme borreliosis can evolve due to an aberrant innate proinflammatory response."

For the development of diagnostic tools, the heterogeneity of the causative agents must be considered. The serological diagnosis should follow the principle of a two-step procedure: a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent analysis as the first step, followed by immunoblot (IgM and IgG) if reactive. The sensitivity and standardization of immunoblots have been enhanced by the use of recombinant antigens instead of whole cell lysates. Improved sensitivity has resulted from the use of recombinant proteins primarily expressed in vivo (e.g. VlsE) and the combination of homologous proteins from different strains (e.g. DbpA). At present, detection rates for serum antibodies are 20-50% in localized, 70-90% in disseminated early and nearly 100% in late disease. Detection of the borreliae by culture or PCR should be confined to specific indications. The best results are obtained from skin biopsies (50-70% with culture or PCR) and synovial tissue or fluid (50-70% with PCR). Cerebrospinal fluid is positive in only 10-30%. Methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes include antigen tests in body fluids, PCR of urine and lymphocyte transformation tests."

		"abstract": "Infectious diseases are common diseases all over the world. A recent World Health Organization report indicated that infectious diseases are now the world's biggest killer of children and young adults. Infectious diseases in non-industrialized countries caused 45% in all and 63% of death in early childhood. In developed countries, the emergence of new, rare or already-forgotten infectious diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, Lyme disease and tuberculosis, has stimulated public interest and inspired commitments to surveillance and control. Recently, it is reported that infectious diseases are responsible for more than 17 million deaths worldwide each year, most of which are associated with bacterial infections. Hence, the control of infectious diseases control is still an important task in the world. The ability to control such bacterial infections is largely dependent on the ability to detect these aetiological agents in the clinical microbiology laboratory. Diagnostic medical bacteriology consists of two main components namely identification and typing. Molecular biology has the potential to revolutionise the way in which diagnostic tests are delivered in order to optimise care of the infected patient, whether they occur in hospital or in the community. Since the discovery of PCR in the late 1980s, there has been an enormous amount of research performed which has enabled the introduction of molecular tests to several areas of routine clinical microbiology. Molecular biology techniques continue to evolve rapidly, so it has been problematic for many laboratories to decide upon which test to introduce before that technology becomes outdated. However the vast majority of diagnostic clinical bacteriology laboratories do not currently employ any form of molecular diagnostics but the use such technology is becoming more widespread in both specialized regional laboratories as well as in national reference laboratories. Presently molecular biology offers a wide repertoire of techniques and permutations of these analytical tools, hence this article wishes to explore the application of these in the diagnostic laboratory setting."

Both had acute inflammatory back pain, resistant to the usual analgesic treatment. Both patients responded negatively to questions about tick bites and erythema migrans. Laboratory tests revealed an inflammatory process in only one patient. Lyme disease was confirmed by lymphocytic meningitis and serological tests positive for Borrelia in blood (both cases) and cerebrospinal fluid (one case). Antibiotic treatment led to the disappearance of pain and the normalization of laboratory tests. Inflammatory back pain, even without radiculitis, may be related to Lyme disease in endemic areas."

We have constructed an inducible promoter system to study the function and regulation of OspC by integrating regulatory elements from the Escherichia coli lac operon into the B. burgdorferi genome. An inducible promoter (flacp) was constructed by inserting a synthetic lac operator sequence between the transcriptional start site and the ribosomal binding site of the B. burgdorferi flgB promoter; flacp was then used to replace the native ospC and rpoS promoters in B. burgdorferi derivatives that constitutively express the E. coli Lac repressor protein (LacI). In vitro, the expression of ospC and rpoS from flacp was dependent on the inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and was unaffected by temperature or pH, conditions commonly used to mimic different aspects of the B. burgdorferi life cycle. Our results suggest that OspC is essential immediately upon injection into a mouse and OspC expression must be maintained during the early stages of infection. In addition, the mouse infectivity experiment indicates that this system can be used to regulate B. burgdorferi genes in vivo, within the context of an experimental tick-mouse infectious cycle. RpoS is an alternative sigma factor that is required for ospC transcription. However, the role of other temperature-dependent factors has not previously been addressed. Our results with the inducible rpoS strain demonstrate that RpoS alone is sufficient to activate OspC expression, even at 23 degrees C. This is the first functional inducible promoter system developed for use in B. burgdorferi and, for the first time, will provide researchers with the ability to artificially regulate the expression of genes in this pathogenic spirochaete."

DNABII proteins induce large bends in DNA and serve as architectural factors in a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes. We have solved the crystal structure of an Hbb-DNA complex in which the DNA is bent by over 180 degrees . We find that like IHF, Hbb relies exclusively on indirect readout to recognize its cognate site. Additional binding studies show that the sequence preferences of Hbb are related to, yet distinct from those of IHF. Defining these binding characteristics may help to uncover additional roles for Hbb in Borrelia DNA metabolism as well as further our understanding of the mechanism of indirect readout."

		"abstract": "The segmented genome of Borrelia burgdorferi, a causative agent of Lyme disease, contains a mixture of over 20 linear and circular plasmids. Genes encoding five paralogous families of plasmid replication proteins are located on both circular and linear DNA molecules. The effect of DNA topology on the transcription of replication proteins from two B. burgdorferi plasmids, cp9 and lp17, was examined using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Circular to linear conversion of a cp9-derived plasmid resulted in a 160-fold decrease in transcript levels of bbc01, believed to encode the replication initiator. A 14.9-fold reduction in plasmid copy number was also observed, resulting in a net 10.7-fold lower transcription level per gene copy on a linear versus a circular plasmid. In contrast, expression of the bbd14 replication initiator for the linear plasmid lp17 was 7.2 times higher per gene copy on a linear versus a circular plasmid. Topology-dependent transcription of these genes may help to block topological interconversions during genome evolution, offers a new avenue for global gene regulation and also has important implications for the design of genetic complementation experiments in B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "There is currently no Lyme disease vaccine commercially available for use in humans. Outer surface protein C (OspC) of the Borrelia has been widely investigated as a potential vaccinogen. At least 38 OspC types have been defined. While the antibody response to OspC is protective, the range of protection is narrow due to the localization of protective epitopes within OspC type-specific domains. To develop a broadly protective vaccine, we previously constructed a tetravalent chimeric vaccinogen containing epitopes from OspC types A, B, K, and D. While this construct elicited bactericidal antibody against strains bearing each of the four OspC types, its solubility was low, and decreasing IgG titer to epitopes near the C-terminus of the construct was observed. In this report, construct solubility and immunogenicity were increased by dialysis against an Arg/Glu buffer. We also demonstrate the immunogenicity of the construct in alum. To further optimize epitope-specific immune responses, several constructs were generated with differing epitope organization or with putative C-terminal protective motifs. Analyses of murine antibody titers and isotype profiles induced by these constructs revealed that while the C-terminal tags did not enhance antibody titer, specific epitope reorganization and reiteration did. These analyses provide important information that can be exploited in the development of chimeric vaccinogens in general."

In recent studies, a novel VlsE protein IR(6) peptide-based assay has been introduced. Our aim was to evaluate the IR(6) peptides from three Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies in the serodiagnosis of European and North American patients. Five VlsE protein IR(6) peptide variants representing sequences from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii were used as antigens in both IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Serum antibodies of 187 patients at different stages of LB from Europe and the United States were evaluated for serodiagnosis. For comparison samples were tested with one of the commercial IR(6) ELISAs. Three B. afzelii IR(6) variant peptides revealed antibodies that were concordant with each other. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto peptide antibodies mostly paralleled B. afzelii peptide antibodies, and positive values were also obtained in the majority of European sera. For several sera, B. garinii IR(6) peptide antibodies were discordant to B. afzelii peptide antibodies. The commercial IR(6) peptide antibody assay (C6 ELISA) results correlated better with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto IR(6) than with B. garinii IR(6) peptide IgG results, especially in sera from patients with facial palsy. Thus, antibody specificity to IR(6) peptides may vary according to the infecting Borrelia species. In some manifestations of the disease, C6 ELISA may not cover all LB cases. Evidently, the methodological aspects in ELISA design for peptide antibody measurements are important as well as the amino acids sequence of the antigen."

The P66 protein was also inactivated in two other channel-forming protein mutant strains, P13-18 (Deltap13) and Deltabba01, and then compared with the channel-forming activities of wild-type and various p66 mutant strains.

Before treatment, urine samples from patients with erythema migrans showed a positive PCR in 27/34 samples (79%), and those from patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans in 7/11 (63%). The specificity of bands was proven by hybridization with GEN-ETI-KTM-DEIA kit in 40/41 samples. Borrelia DNA in urine decreased gradually within the observation period of one year in both patients with erythema migrans and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and persisted without clinical symptoms in 4/45 patients with erythema migrans (8%) after 12 months.

Although recent advancements have been made in the genetic manipulation of B. burgdorferi, there still remains a paucity of basic molecular systems for assessing differential gene expression in this pathogen. Herein, we describe the adaptation of two powerful genetic tools for use in B. burgdorferi. The first is a Photinus pyralis firefly luciferase gene reporter that was codon optimized to enhance translation in B. burgdorferi. Using this modified reporter, we demonstrated an increase in luciferase expression when B. burgdorferi transformed with a shuttle vector encoding the outer surface protein C (OspC) promoter fused to the luciferase reporter was cultivated in the presence of fresh rabbit blood. The second is a lac operator/repressor system that was optimized to achieve the tightest degree of regulation. Using the aforementioned luciferase reporter, we assessed the kinetics and maximal level of isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-dependent gene expression. This lac-inducible expression system also was used to express the gene carried on lp25 required for borrelial persistence in ticks (bptA). These advancements should be generally applicable for assessing further the regulation of other genes potentially involved in virulence expression by B. burgdorferi."

Infections (West Nile virus, Lyme disease), neoplasms (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, renal adenocarcinoma), celiac disease, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can cause opsoclonus. Newly identified autoantibodies include antineuroleukin, antigliadin, antiendomysial, and anti-CV2. Evidence suggests that the autoantigens of opsoclonus reside in postsynaptic density, or on the cell surface of neurons or neuroblastoma cells (where they exert antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects). Most patients, however, are seronegative for autoantibodies. Cell-mediated immunity may also play a role, with B and T-cell recruitment in the cerebrospinal fluid linked to neurological signs. Rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, seems efficacious as an adjunctive therapy. Although changes in synaptic weighting of saccadic burst neuron circuits in the brainstem have been implicated, disinhibition of the fastigial nucleus in the cerebellum, or damage to afferent projections to the fastigial nucleus, is a more plausible pathophysiologic mechanism which is supported by functional magnetic resonance imaging findings in patients. There is increasing recognition that both humoral and cell mediated immune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of opsoclonus. Further studies are needed to further elucidate its immunopathogenesis and pathophysiology in order to develop novel and efficacious therapy."

In this study, a new immunohistochemical method, focus floating microscopy (FFM), was developed to detect B burgdorferi in tissue sections and was compared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). By using standard histologic equipment, tissue sections stained with a polyclonal B burgdorferi antibody were simultaneously scanned through 2 planes: horizontally in serpentines and vertically by focusing through the thickness of the section. Borrelia were detected in 47 of 71 ticks, 34 of 66 tick bites, 30 of 32 erythema chronicum migrans cases, 41 of 43 borrelial lymphocytomas, and 50 of 51 acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans cases. FFM proved to be more sensitive than PCR (96.0% vs 45.2%) and nearly equally specific (99.4% vs 100%). All 169 control cases, except 1 false-positive case of secondary syphilis, were negative with FFM. FFM is an easy, quick, and inexpensive method to reliably detect Borrelia in cutaneous tissue sections."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (borreliosis) incidence continues to increase despite a growing knowledge of primary and secondary prevention strategies. Primary prevention aims to reduce the risk of tick exposure and thereby decrease the incidence of new Lyme disease cases. Secondary prevention targets the development of disease or reduces disease severity among people who have been bitten by infected ticks. Numerous prevention strategies are available, and although they vary in cost, acceptability and effectiveness, uptake has been universally poor. Research in areas where Lyme disease is endemic has demonstrated that despite adequate knowledge about its symptoms and transmission, many people do not perform behaviors to reduce their risk of infection. New prevention strategies should aim to increase people's confidence in their ability to carry out preventive behaviors, raise awareness of desirable outcomes, and aid in the realization that the necessary skills and resources are available for preventive measures to be taken. In this article we evaluate the prevention and treatment strategies for Lyme disease, and discuss how these strategies can be implemented effectively. As many patients with Lyme disease develop arthritis and are referred to rheumatologists it is important that these health-care providers can educate patients about disease-prevention strategies."

The host immune response to infection results in increased levels of IFN-gamma in the serum and lesions of Lyme disease patients that correlate with greater severity of disease. Therefore, the effect of IFN-gamma on the gene expression profile of primary human endothelial cells exposed to B. burgdorferi was determined. B. burgdorferi and IFN-gamma synergistically augmented the expression of 34 genes, 7 of which encode chemokines. Six of these (CCL7, CCL8, CX3CL1, CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11) attract T lymphocytes, and one (CXCL2) is specific for neutrophils. Synergistic production of the attractants for T cells was confirmed at the protein level. IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and LPS also cooperated with IFN-gamma to induce synergistic production of CXCL10 by the endothelium, indicating that IFN-gamma potentiates inflammation in concert with a variety of mediators. An in vitro model of the blood vessel wall revealed that an increased number of human T lymphocytes traversed the endothelium exposed to B. burgdorferi and IFN-gamma, as compared with unstimulated endothelial monolayers. In contrast, addition of IFN-gamma diminished the migration of neutrophils across the B. burgdorferi-activated endothelium. IFN-gamma thus alters gene expression by endothelia exposed to B. burgdorferi in a manner that promotes recruitment of T cells and suppresses that of neutrophils. This modulation may facilitate the development of chronic inflammatory lesions in Lyme disease."

Many agents have fulfilled the broad definition of emerging blood-transmitted infections, including West Nile virus (WNV), Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium spp., Babesia spp., parvovirus B19, dengue virus, and the prions that cause variant Creutzfeld-Jacob disease (vCJD). Other agents such as human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8-Kaposi's sarcoma virus) and Borellia (Lyme disease) and, perhaps, avian flu virus, are known to have a viremic phase, but have not yet been proved to be transfusion-transmitted. In the wake of these threats, transfusion services use a variety of donor screening interventions, including serologic assays, nucleic acid assays, and geographic exclusions based on potential exposure. The ultimate safeguard may be a pre-emptive pathogen inactivation strategy that will disrupt all nucleic acid-containing agents (though not prions). Considerable effort and resources have been invested in this arena, but currently no single technique is effective for inactivation of both liquid and cellular blood products and toxicity issues have not been completely resolved. The blood supply is remarkably safe with the risk of major pathogens such as hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV now reduced to less than one transmission per 2 to 3 million exposures. However, to approach near-zero infectious disease risk for emerging and re-emerging pathogens, new strategies such as pathogen inactivation or multi-pathogen microarray technology will need to be developed or refined."

In the late period of Lyme disease demyelinating involvement of central nervous system can develop and MS can be erroneously diagnosed. A Lyme borreliosis can mimick central nervous system lymphoma. Also, B. burgdorferi has been implicated not only in etiology of MS, but also in etiology of lymphoma. Studies suggested that there is an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in patients, who had a history of autoimmune diseases such as MS and that both non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and Hodgkin's disease were associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. A small group of lymphomas called primary effusion lymphomas (PEL) is a recently individualized form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (WHO classification) that exhibit exclusive or dominant involvement of serous cavities, without a detectable solid tumor mass. These lymphomas have also been linked to Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus type 8 infections but virus negative cases have been described. Therefore, we propose that MS and neuroborreliosis are linked to central nervous system primary effusion lymphomas. As a first step in confirming or refuting our hypotheses, we suggest a thorough study of CSF in the patients suspected for the diagnosis of MS and Lyme borreliosis."

The lines tested for their ability to phagocytose the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi (Spirochaetales: Spirochaetaceae), were ISE6 and IDE12 from the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae) and DAE15 from the Rocky Mountain wood tick, Dermacentor andersoni Stiles. Rickettsia peacockii (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae), an endosymbiont of D. andersoni, was used as a representative tick endosymbiont. 70-80% of uninfected or R. peacocciz-infected IDE12 and DAE15 cells phagocytosed heat-killed borreliae and 80-90% of IDE12 and DAE15 cells phagocytosed viable spirochetes. ISE6 cells were permissive of spirochetes; less than 1% of these cells phagocytosed borreliae, and spirochetes remained adherent to the cells seven days after inoculation. Cytochalasin B blocked phagocytosis of killed and viable borreliae by IDE12 cells, and prevented phagocytosis of killed spirochetes by DAE15 cells, whereas viable spirochetes successfully invaded cytochalasin-treated DAE15. IDE12 and DAE15 cells degraded borreliae within phagolysosome-like compartments. Time-lapse microscopy showed that DAE15 cells phagocytosed borreliae more rapidly than IDE12 cells. IDE12 and DAE15 cells eliminated most adherent spirochetes within 7 days of inoculation. Thus, endosymbiont infection does not significantly interfere with the phagocytic activity of immunocompetent tick cells."

BBA74, a Borrelia burgdorferi plasmid-encoded protein, was proposed to be an integral outer membrane protein with putative porin function and designated as a 28-kDa outer membrane-spanning porin (Oms28). In this study, the biophysical properties of BBA74 and its subcellular localization were investigated. BBA74 is posttranslationally modified by signal peptidase I cleavage to a mature 25-kDa protein. The secondary structure of BBA74 as determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy consists of at least 78% alpha-helix with little beta-sheet structure. BBA74 in intact B. burgdorferi cells was insensitive to proteinase K digestion, and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy showed that BBA74 was not exposed on the cell surface. Triton X-114 extraction of outer membrane vesicle preparations indicated that BBA74 is not an integral membrane protein. Taken together, the data indicate that BBA74 is a periplasmic, outer membrane-associated protein that lacks properties typically associated with porins."

The role of a Dps homologue encoded by Borrelia in spirochaete survival was assessed. Dps-deficient spirochaetes were infectious in mice via needle-inoculation at the dose of 10(5) spirochaetes. Larval ticks successfully acquired Dps-deficient spirochaetes via a blood meal on mice. However, after extended periods within unfed nymphs, the Dps-deficient spirochaetes failed to be transmitted to a new host when nymphs fed. Our data suggest that Dps functions to protect the spirochaetes during dormancy in unfed ticks, and in its absence, the spirochaetes become susceptible during tick feeding. dps is differentially expressed in vivo- low in mice and high in ticks - but constitutively expressed in vitro, showing little change during growth or in response to oxidative stress. Borrelia Dps forms a dodecameric complex capable of sequestering iron. The Dps-deficient spirochaetes showed no defect in starvation and oxidative stress assays, perhaps due to the lack of iron in spirochaetes grown in vitro. Dps is critical for spirochaete persistence within ticks, and strategies to interfere with Dps could potentially reduce Borrelia populations in nature and thereby influence the incidence of Lyme disease."

The study population consisted of a prospective group (n = 200), a control group (n = 255), and a retrospective group (n = 29). The test panel consisted of the Immunetics Quick ELISA C6 Borrelia assay kit (Immunetics, Cambridge, MA, USA), the Virotech Borrelia burgdorferi ELISA (Genzyme Virotech, Rüsselsheim, Germany), and the Liaison Borrelia CLIA (DiaSorin, Saluggia, Vercelli, Italy). Seroprevalence among 200 healthy blood donors was significantly lower in the C6 test (8%) compared to the Virotech ELISA (14%) and the Liaison CLIA (12%). In convalescent sera (2-3 months and 6 months post infection) from 158 patients with erythema migrans, the seropositivity in the C6 test was also significantly lower compared to both the Virotech ELISA and the Liaison CLIA. Serosensitivity in the acute phase of erythema migrans and other clinical manifestations of borreliosis did not differ significantly between the C6 test and the Virotech ELISA or the Liaison CLIA. Overall, a positive C6 test seems to correlate well with acute borreliosis. Cross-reactivity was lower in the C6 test in sera positive for Epstein-Barr virus infection as compared to the Virotech ELISA. This study supports the use of the C6 test as a screening test for borreliosis, in endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) can, despite adequate antibiotic treatment, develop into a chronic condition with persisting symptoms such as musculoskeletal pain, subjective alteration of cognition and fatigue. The mechanism behind this is unclear, but it has been postulated that an aberrant immunological response might be the cause. In this study we investigated the expression of the T helper 1 (Th1) marker interleukin (IL)-12Rbeta2, the marker for T regulatory cells, forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) and the cytokine profile in patients with a history of chronic LB, subacute LB, previously Borrelia-exposed asymptomatic individuals and healthy controls. Fifty-four individuals (12 chronic LB, 14 subacute LB, 14 asymptomatic individuals and 14 healthy controls) were included in the study and provided a blood sample. Mononuclear cells were separated from the blood and stimulated with antigens. The IL-12Rbeta2 and FoxP3 mRNA expression was analysed with real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The protein expression of IL-12Rbeta2 on CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+) and CD56(+) cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12p70 and IL-13 was analysed by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Chronic LB patients displayed a lower expression of Borrelia-specific IL-12Rbeta2 on CD8(+) cells and also a lower number of Borrelia-specific IFN-gamma-secreting cells compared to asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, chronic LB patients had higher amounts of Borrelia-specific FoxP3 mRNA than healthy controls. We speculate that this may indicate that a strong Th1 response is of importance for a positive outcome of a Borrelia infection. In addition, regulatory T cells might also play a role, by immunosuppression, in the development of chronic LB."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. A number of other spirochetal diseases, if contracted in pregnancy, have been shown to cause fetal harm and there is concern over a similar effect with gestational borreliosis. Previously published individual case reports have suggested a possible association between gestational borreliosis and adverse pregnancy outcome; however, no specific pattern of teratogenicity has been shown, and a causal relationship has never been proven. In addition, larger epidemiological and serological series have consistently failed to demonstrate an increased risk to pregnant women who develop Lyme disease if they receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. We describe a favorable outcome in a 42-year-old woman who developed Lyme disease in the third trimester and was treated with a full course of oral amoxicillin. In addition, we offer a review of the relevant literature regarding Lyme disease and pregnancy. The appropriate investigation and management of a woman with gestational borreliosis are discussed. Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. After completion of this article, the reader should be able to recall that Lyme disease is not an uncommon disease during pregnancy and can occur in states outside of the Northeast, explain that the diagnosis is made clinically and may be confirmed by laboratory tests, state that treatment is recommended during pregnancy, and summarize that there is no consistent data of adverse fetal effects even though the placenta is infected."

Sera previously found to be positive and negative when tested by routine Western blots prepared from reference strain B. burgdorferi sensu stricto antigen had different outcomes with these isolates. Two isolates, E5 (Borrelia afzelii) and G4 (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto) performed well, reproducing Western blot-positive results in 90 and 95% of tests, respectively. When antigens from both isolates were incorporated into a single IgG Western blot, the results of a panel of sera were improved when compared to the routine reference strain IgG Western blot. All of the sera positive by the routine Western blot remained positive using the Scottish isolate antigen mix. Twenty-three of the 25 negative sera remained negative and two produced an equivocal result. Of the 15 samples that tested IgG Western blot equivocal with the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto reference strain, 11 (73%) became weak or strong positive when tested with the B. afzelii/B. burgdorferi sensu stricto antigen mix (chi(2)=14.35, Yates' correction, P<0.001). In seven of these, a clinical picture of Lyme disease was consistent with the new results. The use of Scottish strains of B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto to provide antigen for the IgG Western blot improves the diagnosis of Lyme disease for patients in Scotland."

		"abstract": "Measuring the chemotactic response of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial species that causes Lyme disease, is relatively more difficult than measuring that of other bacteria. Because these spirochetes have long generation times, enumerating cells that swim up a capillary tube containing an attractant by using colony counts is impractical. Furthermore, direct counts with a Petroff-Hausser chamber is problematic, as this method has a low throughput and necessitates a high cell density; the latter can lead to misinterpretation of results when assaying for specific attractants. Only rabbit serum and tick saliva have been reported to be chemoattractants for B. burgdorferi. These complex biological mixtures are limited in their utility for studying chemotaxis on a molecular level. Here we present a modified capillary tube chemotaxis assay for B. burgdorferi that enumerates cells by flow cytometry. Initial studies identified N-acetylglucosamine as a chemoattractant. The assay was then optimized with respect to cell concentration, incubation time, motility buffer composition, and growth phase. Besides N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, glucosamine dimers (chitosan), glutamate, and glucose also elicited significant chemoattractant responses, although the response obtained with glucose was weak and variable. Serine and glycine were nonchemotactic. To further validate and to exploit the use of this assay, a previously described nonchemotactic cheA2 mutant was shown to be nonchemotactic by this assay; it also regained the wild-type phenotype when complemented in trans. This is the first report that identifies specific chemical attractants for B. burgdorferi and the use of flow cytometry for spirochete enumeration. The method should also be useful for assaying chemotaxis for other slow-growing prokaryotic species and in specific environments in nature."

		"abstract": "Numerous infectious diseases caused by bacteria or viruses persist in developed and developing countries due to ongoing transmission among wildlife reservoir species. Such diseases become the target of control and management programmes in cases where they represent a threat to public health (for example rabies, sylvatic plague, Lyme disease), or livestock production (for example bovine tuberculosis, brucellosis, pseudorabies), or where they threaten the survival of endangered animal populations. In the majority of cases, lethal control operations are neither economically feasible nor publicly supported as a practical means for disease management. Prophylactic vaccination has emerged over the last 15 years as an alternative control strategy for wildlife diseases, mainly driven by the success of widescale oral rabies vaccination programmes for meso-carnivores in North America and Northern Europe. Different methods have been trialled for the effective delivery of wildlife vaccines in the field, however oral vaccination remains the most widely used approach. Successful implementation of an oral wildlife vaccine is dependent on a combination of three components: an efficacious immunogen, a suitable delivery vehicle, and a species-specific bait. This review outlines the major wildlife disease problems for which oral vaccination is currently under consideration as a disease management tool, and also focuses on the technological challenges that face wildlife vaccine development. The major conclusion is that attenuated or recombinant live microbes represent the most widely-used vaccines that can be delivered by the oral route; this in turn places major emphasis on effective delivery systems (to maintain vaccine viability), and on selective baiting systems, as the keys to wildlife vaccine success. Oral vaccination is a valuable adjunct or alternative strategy to culling for the control of diseases which persist in wildlife reservoirs."

B. burgdorferi isolates taken from infected humans can be categorized into specific genetic subtypes (designated RST1, -2, and -3) by restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the 16S to 23S rRNA spacer sequence. Many of these, usually categorized as RST2, retain only segments of the linear plasmid lp28-1, which encodes VlsE. The VlsE genetic region is retained, but altered expression of this molecule could affect diagnosis by the C6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum samples from patients infected with each of the three genotypes and from mice infected with three RST2 isolates were tested with the C6 ELISA. Such isolates elicited marked C6 responses in infected mice. The sensitivity of C6 antibody detection in patients infected with RST2 spirochetes was statistically indistinguishable from detection of RST1 and RST3 infections. These findings demonstrate that diagnosis by C6 ELISA remains effective for infection with all B. burgdorferi genotypes, including those with incomplete lp28-1 plasmids."

		"abstract": "Lyme arthritis, caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, can be recurrent or prolonged, whereas Lyme carditis is mostly nonrecurring. A prominent difference between arthritis and carditis is the differential representation of phagocytes in these lesions: polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are more prevalent in the joint, and macrophages predominate in the heart lesion. We have previously shown differential efficiency of B. burgdorferi clearance by PMN and macrophages, and we now investigate whether these functional differences at the cellular level may contribute to the observed differences in organ-specific pathogenesis. When we infected mice lacking the neutrophil chemokine receptor (CXCR2(-/-) mice) with spirochetes, we detected fewer PMN in joints and less-severe arthritis. Here we have investigated the effects of the absence of the macrophage chemokine receptor CCR2 on the development and resolution of Lyme carditis in resistant (C57BL/6J [B6]) and sensitive (C3H/HeJ [C3H]) strains of mice. In B6 CCR2(-/-) mice, although inflammation in hearts is mild, we detected an increased burden of B. burgdorferi compared to that in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting reduced clearance in the absence of macrophages. In contrast, C3H CCR2(-/-) mice have severe inflammation but a decreased B. burgdorferi burden compared to that in WT C3H mice both at peak disease and during resolution. Histopathologic examination of infected hearts revealed that infected C3H CCR2(-/-) animals have an increased presence of PMN, suggesting compensatory mechanisms of B. burgdorferi clearance in the hearts of infected C3H CCR2(-/-) mice. The more efficient clearance of B. burgdorferi from hearts by CCR2(-/-) versus WT C3H mice suggests a natural defect in the recruitment or function of macrophages in C3H mice, which may contribute to the sensitivity of this strain to B. burgdorferi infection."

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate samples from dogs suggestive of active canine borreliosis (group A) by culture and PCR and the detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in order to confirm a presumptive clinical diagnosis of canine borreliosis by laboratory results. Criteria for such a diagnosis were: history of tick exposure, lameness, neurological signs, nephropathy, lethargy, anorexia, and fever. A total of 302 samples comprising EDTA blood, urine, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissue (skin, synovial membrane, kidney) from 98 dogs (26 with arthritis, 46 with neurological signs, 21 with nephropathy, 5 with non-specific symptoms) were collected and examined. Moreover, 55 healthy dogs (group B) and 236 dogs with symptoms or injuries unlikely to be associated with borreliosis (group C) were included in this study. Blood serum samples collected from all individuals (n=389) were analysed by ELISA. Twenty-one (21%) out of 98 dogs from group A, 4 (7%) out of 55 from group B and 15 (6%) out of 236 dogs from group C were positive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The seroprevalences between groups A, B and C differed significantly. None of the corresponding samples investigated by PCR and culture were positive for spirochetal DNA or viable spirochetes. Borrelia afzelii was grown from one EDTA-blood sample but the corresponding blood serum sample remained antibody-negative. Consequently, the etiologic role of B. afzelii in this case is unclear. In approximately 40% of the presumptive canine borreliosis cases, other lesions have been found to be responsible for clinical signs. This study affirms that a definitive diagnosis of canine borreliosis cannot be made by clinical symptoms and serology based on a single consultation. Moreover, this study clearly revealed that the diagnostic sensitivity is enhanced by a thorough consideration and exclusion of other diseases."

		"abstract": "The etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, must adapt to the distinct environments of its arthropod vector and mammalian host during its complex life cycle. B. burgdorferi alters gene expression and protein synthesis in response to temperature, pH, and other uncharacterized environmental factors. The hypothesis tested in this study is that dissolved gases, including CO(2), serve as a signal for B. burgdorferi to alter protein production and gene expression. In this study we focused on characterization of in vitro anaerobic (5% CO(2), 3% H(2), 0.087 ppm O(2)) and microaerophilic (1% CO(2), 3.48 ppm O(2)) growth conditions and how they modulate protein synthesis and gene expression in B. burgdorferi. Higher levels of several immunoreactive proteins, including BosR, NapA, DbpA, OspC, BBK32, and RpoS, were synthesized under anaerobic conditions. Previous studies demonstrated that lower levels of NapA were produced when microaerophilic cultures were purged with nitrogen gas to displace oxygen and CO(2). In this study we identified CO(2) as a factor contributing to the observed change in NapA synthesis. Specifically, a reduction in the level of dissolved CO(2), independent of O(2) levels, resulted in reduced NapA synthesis. BosR, DbpA, OspC, and RpoS synthesis was also decreased with the displacement of CO(2). Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR indicated that the levels of the dbpA, ospC, and BBK32 transcripts are increased in the presence of CO(2), indicating that these putative borrelial virulence determinants are regulated at the transcriptional level. Thus, dissolved CO(2) may be an additional cue for borrelial host adaptation and gene regulation."

		"abstract": "Neurological manifestations of Lyme disease are usually accompanied by inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the recruitment of activated T cells into the CSF compartment. In order to characterize the phenotype and identify target antigens of CSF-infiltrating T cells in early neuroborreliosis with central nervous system (CNS) involvement, we combined T-cell cloning, functional testing of T-cell responses with positional scanning synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries, and biometric data analysis. We demonstrate that CD4+ gamma interferon-producing T cells specifically responding to Borrelia burgdorferi lysate were present in the CSF of a patient with acute Lyme encephalitis. Some T-cell clones recognized previously uncharacterized B. burgdorferi epitopes which show a specific enrichment for lysine, such as the heat shock-induced chaperone HSP90. Degenerate T-cell recognition that included T-cell responses to borrelia-specific and CNS-specific autoantigens derived from the myelin protein 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) could be demonstrated for one representative clone. Our results show that spirochetal antigen-specific and Th1-polarized CD4+ lymphocytes infiltrate the CSF during monophasic CNS symptoms of Lyme disease and demonstrate that cross-recognition of CNS antigens by B. burgdorferi-specific T cells is not restricted to chronic and treatment-resistant manifestations."

		"abstract": "Fitness of tick-borne pathogens may be determined by the degree to which their infection dynamics in vertebrate hosts permits transmission cycles if infective and uninfected tick stages are active at different times of the year. To investigate this hypothesis we developed a simulation model that integrates the transmission pattern imposed by seasonally asynchronous nymphal and larval Ixodes scapularis ticks in northeastern North America, with a model of infection in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) reservoir hosts, using the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum as examples. In simulations, survival of microparasites, their sensitivity to reduced rodent and tick abundance, and to 'dilution' by a reservoir-incompetent host depended on traits that allowed (i) highly efficient transmission from acutely-infected hosts, (ii) long-lived acute or 'carrier' host infections, and/or (iii) transmission amongst co-feeding ticks. Minimum values for transmission efficiency to ticks, and duration of host infectivity, necessary for microparasite persistence, were always higher when nymphal and larval ticks were seasonally asynchronous than when these instars were synchronous. Thus, traits influencing duration of host infectivity, transmission efficiency to ticks and co-feeding transmission are likely to be dominant determinants of fitness in I. scapularis-borne microparasites in northeastern North America due to abiotic forcings influencing I. scapularis seasonality."

Outer surface protein C (OspC) has antigenic and expression characteristics that make it an attractive vaccine candidate; however, sequence heterogeneity has impeded its use as a vaccinogen. Sequence analyses have identified 21 well defined OspC phyletic groups or \"types\" (designated A-U). In this report we have mapped the linear epitopes presented by OspC types B, K, and D during human and murine infection and exploited these epitopes (along with the previously identified type A OspC linear epitopes) in the development of a recombinant, tetravalent, chimeric vaccinogen. The construct was found to be highly immunogenic in mice and the induced antibodies surface labeled in vitro cultivated spirochetes. Importantly, vaccination induced complement-dependent bactericidal antibodies against strains expressing each of the OspC types that were incorporated into the construct. These results suggest that an effective and broadly protective polyvalent OspC-based Lyme disease vaccine can be produced as a recombinant, chimeric protein."

LD manifests itself as a multisystem inflammatory disease that affects the skin in its early localized stage and spreads to the joints, nervous system, heart, and, to a lesser extent, other organ systems in its later disseminated stages. If diagnosed and treated early with appropriate antibiotics, LD is almost always readily cured. Developing a highly sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay could be very useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy and decreasing turnaround time for results. We report the development of a LightCycler TaqMan assay targeting the OspA gene for clinical detection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in various types of biologic samples. This assay was validated by testing a variety of clinical samples including cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, skin biopsies, and blood and culture isolates from skin biopsies. The TaqMan testing results were 100% concordant with previously reported results. Reference strains representing isolates from other geographic regions were also successfully amplified. The developed assay is robust, is highly sensitive and specific for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and is suitable for clinical detection of the bacterium in biologic samples."

Lymphocyte transformation tests (LTTs) have been applied to detect specific cellular immune reactivity, but their clinical application has been severely hampered by the poorly defined Borrelia antigens and nonstandardized LTT formats used. In this study, we describe the development and clinical relevance of a novel LTT using a validated format (MELISA) together with well-defined recombinant Borrelia-specific antigens. From an initial screening of 244 patients with suspected Borrelia infection or disease, 4 informative recombinant antigens were selected: OspC (Borrelia afzelii), p41-1 (Borrelia garinii), p41-2 (B. afzelii), and p100 (B. afzelii). Thereafter, 30 seronegative healthy controls were tested in LTT-MELISA(R) to determine specificity, 68 patients were tested in parallel to determine reproducibility, and 54 lymphocyte-reactive symptomatic patients were tested before and after antibiotic therapy to assess clinical relevance. Most (86.2%) of the 36.9% (90/244) LTT-MELISA positive patients were seropositive and showed symptoms of active LB. Specificity was 96.7% and reproducibility 92.6%. After therapy, most patients (90.7%) showed negative or markedly reduced lymphocyte reactivity correlating with clinical improvement. This novel LTT-MELISA assay appears to correlate with active LB and may have diagnostic relevance in confirming LB in clinically and serologically ambiguous cases."

		"abstract": "Clinical and tick isolates of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the bacterial agent of Lyme disease, from the northeastern United States were sequenced at 12 loci located on the main chromosome and 7 plasmids (lp54, cp26, cp9, lp17, lp25, lp28-2, and lp38). The outer surface protein C gene (ospC) showed the highest number (12) of major alleles (defined as alleles differing by 5% or more in nucleotide sequence) while other ORFs had only two to four major alleles. A non-recombining chromosomal marker, the rrs-rrlA ribosomal RNA spacer, was used to infer the intraspecific phylogeny among these B. burgdorferi isolates. We were thus able to analyze the multilocus genotypes in the context of a B. burgdorferi intraspecific phylogeny. Except for ospC, sequence variations at plasmid-borne loci showed broad inconsistency with the intraspecific phylogeny, supporting DNA exchanges mediated by plasmid transfers. The multilocus linkage frequently observed in B. burgdorferi populations is due more likely to a \"founder effect\" than to a lack of recombination. The exceptional phylogenetic consistency of ospC, in conjunction with its selectively maintained high intraspecific diversity, suggested a dominant role ospC plays in the initiation and maintenance of adaptive differentiation in B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Tick borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is present in some European countries and it is transmitted by a tick bite. Ixodes ricinus is the main vector of the infection in Italy, where fortunately clinical neurological manifestations, typical of the more serious phase of the disease, are very rarely observed. This behaviour is different from other endemic Euroasiatic areas where numerous cases of encephalitis are described. However TBE transmission has not been widely investigated in Italy and available epidemiological data have been obtained only by studies performed in Central and Northern Regions of the country. In addition seroepidemiological researches were made prevalently on subjects at high risk of tick bite, such as hunters or forest guards from Trentin and Central Italy. No precise information about TBE virus diffusion was available in the Piedmont before our investigations. We found that hunters and wild boar breeders seem to be particularly exposed to the risk of TBE virus infection in Turin Province and in particular in the Susa valley, although no neurological involvement was observed in our population. In particular a seroprevalence of about 5% was detected by the use of purified antigens ELISA test, amongst the subjects at high risk of tick bite. Moreover low risk individuals showed a seroprevalence of below 2%. In addition a parallel seroepidemiological study was performed in Turin Province for Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, also transmitted by tick bite (e.g. Ixodes ricinus), for Dengue and Toscana (TOS) arboviruses, respectively transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and phlebotomes. Data reported here demonstrate only a sporadic presence in our population of antibodies against Borrelia and Dengue infection. Moreover using an ELISA test performed with viral purified nucleoprotein, we reported a total percentage of about 3% of subjects positive for TOSV."
