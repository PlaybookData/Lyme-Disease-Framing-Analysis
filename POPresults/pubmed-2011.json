		"abstract": "Vector repellent is one element in the prevention of vector-borne diseases. Families that neglect protecting their children against vectors risk their children contracting illnesses such as West Nile virus, eastern equine encephalitis, Lyme disease, malaria, dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, babesiosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Southern tick-associated rash illness, ehrlichiosis, tick-borne relapsing fever, tularemia, and other insect and arthropod related diseases (CDC, 2011). Identification of families at risk includes screening of the underlying basis for reluctance to apply insect repellent. Nurses and physicians can participate in a positive role by assisting families to determine the proper prophylaxis by recommending insect repellent choices that are economical, safe, and easy to use. A holistic alternative might include the suggestion of clove oil in cases where families might have trepidations regarding the use of DEET on children. This article will explore the safety and effectiveness of clove oil and its use as an insect repellent."

Nevertheless, we have to exclude a multiplicity of other aetiologies, less frequent, but with highest implications in the therapeutic conduct. Infections by Brucella and by Borrelia are rare causes of chronic arthritis, yet are diagnosis to consider, even when the clinical manifestations aren't the most typical, as there still exist endemic areas in Portugal. Here we report two clinical cases about patients with arthritis for more than one year, subject to ineffective exams ant treatments. Only the clinical history could put on evidence clinical-epidemiological data, suggestive of Brucellosis and Lyme Disease, namely the professional contact with infected animals, and the history of probable erythema migrans, that pointed toward the correct diagnosis. So, with directed therapeutic, there was complete resolution of the inflammatory symptoms."

		"abstract": "Chronic widespread pain (CWP) is a common symptom within the community, and may be part of or arise as a result of various diseases or conditions. Fibromyalgia (FM) is probably the most common and best known disease whose cardinal symptom is CWP. Many authors, however, indistinctively describe pain as 'widespread', 'diffuse' or 'generalised', and this may lead to misunderstandings about true clinical or scientific significance. Widespread pain has been variously defined, over the years, beginning from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for FM in 1990, and the CWP Manchester definition in 1996. A comprehensive and brief core sets for CWP was developed in 2003, by the WHO International Classification of Functioning Consensus Conference, and finally, the ACR proposed new preliminary diagnostic criteria for FM in 2010. Research into CWP and/or FM is therefore difficult and can lead to conflicting results. CWP and (particularly) FM are multifactorial disorders. There is increasing evidence that they may be triggered by environmental factors, and many authors have highlighted a relationship with various infectious agents and some have suggested that vaccinations may play a role. This review analyses the available data concerning the relationships between FM and widespread pain (in its various meanings) with infections and vaccinations, from the earliest report to the most recent contributions. Considering all scientific papers, various levels of possible associations emerge. There is no clear-cut evidence of FM or CWP due to infections or vaccinations, no correlations with persistent infection, and no proven relationship between infection, antimicrobial therapies and pain improvement. A higher prevalence of FM and chronic pain has been found in patients with Lyme disease, and HIV or HCV infection, and, perhaps, also in patients with mycoplasmas, HBV, HTLV I, and parvovirus B19 infections. Some unconfirmed evidence and case reports suggest that vaccinations may trigger FM or chronic pain."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most widespread vector-borne disease in temperate zones of Europe and North America. Although the infection is treatable, the symptoms are often overlooked resulting in infection of the neuronal system. In this work we uncover the underlying molecular mechanism of borrelial translocation across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that neuroinvasive strain of Borrelia readily crosses monolayer of brain-microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) in vitro and BBB in vivo. Using protein-protein interaction assays we found that CD40 of BMECs and OspA of Borrelia are the primary molecules in transient tethering of Borrelia to endothelium. OspA of neuroinvasive Borrelia, but not of non-neuroinvasive strain, binds CD40. Furthermore, only the neuroinvasive Borrelia and its recombinant OspA activated CD40-dependent pathway in BMECs and induced expression of integrins essential for stationary adhesion. Demonstration of the CD40-ligand interactions may provide a new possible perspective on molecular mechanisms of borrelial BBB translocation process."

Although no Ornithodoros spp. ticks were collected during this survey, published records of their existence in Ethiopia were found. An overwhelming infestation of Argas persicus was revealed in a village located adjacent to Dire Dawa. These ticks primarily were feeding on poultry, but were also biting humans. Furthermore, hard ticks were collected from livestock and companion animals in these regions. Collected ticks were assessed for Borrelia by real-time PCR followed by conventional PCR and sequencing to identify species present. A. persicus ticks were found to carry B. anserina in 3 of 40 (7.5%) A. persicus tick pools, whilst hard tick pools yielded 2 of 16 (12.5%) positive for B. theileri. Collectively, these borrelial species and their tick vectors are likely to have an important economic impact of particular relevance to subsistence farmers in Ethiopia."

PCR for amplification of the B. burgdorferi s.l.-specific 5S-23S intergenic spacer region as well as the outer surface protein A (ospA) gene were used. B. burgdorferi s.l. DNA was detected in 35 of the 259 E. europaeus and in 2 of 10 E. roumanicus. B. burgdorferi prevalences in E. europaeus ranged from 0% (U.K.) to 37.5% (Czech Republic), for E. roumanicus from 0% (Czech Republic) to 50.0% (Austria). Sequencing revealed the occurrence of 3 different B. burgdorferi genospecies in E. europaeus: B. afzelii was the dominant genospecies, followed by B. bavariensis (previously B. garinii OspA serotype 4) and B. spielmanii, the latter was detected for the first time in Hamburg (Germany). B. afzelii and B. bavariensis were also found in E. roumanicus. Our results suggest that hedgehogs modulate the epidemiology of certain species of the B. burgdorferi s.l. complex, potentially affecting the distribution and abundance of individual B. burgdorferi s.l. genospecies in various habitats. We hypothesise that juvenile or individuals with low immune competence in particular, have a high reservoir potential for the 3 genospecies identified here."

		"abstract": "OspC is the main target for IgM in early-stage Lyme disease. As such it is employed as its native or recombinant form in routine immunoassays for the determination of Borrelia-specific antibodies. However, recombinant OspC has so far not shown the antigenicity of the native protein. The latter contains an intrinsic signal sequence and an adjacent cysteine residue, the attachment site of the lipid membrane anchor which has been discussed to have an adjuvant effect on the immune reaction. In expression experiments, we have found a recombinant variant, an OspC covalently homodimerized via an N-terminal disulfide bridge, that shows a remarkably enhanced antigenicity without lipid attachment. Three such OspCs derived from different Borrelia strains were subsequently expressed in E. coli and purified under non-reducing conditions. In non-reducing SDS-PAGE, OspC(Δ1-18) exhibited a 48-kDa band of dimeric OspC. When incubated with IgM-OspC-positive human sera, the reaction at 48kDa was always stronger than at 24kDa of monomeric OspC(Δ1-18, C19G). A lineblot with OspC(Δ1-18) also showed a higher diagnostic accuracy than that obtained with OspC(Δ1-18, C19G) based on a higher affinity of IgM for the dimeric form. When used for the immunization of mice, dimeric OspC(Δ1-18) induced consistent high-titre antibodies against OspC, whereas OspC(Δ1-18, C19G) failed to provoke significant titres in some animals. We conclude that the disulfide-bridging of 2 OspC molecules via their N termini forms a complex that is more suitable for the determination of IgM-OspC and is a promising candidate for a monovalent vaccine."

A water load test was performed in a woman reactive for B-Burgdorferi with chronic fatigue whose symptoms did not improve despite three months of treatment with doxycycline. A water load test was performed. She failed the water load test by excreting only 50% ingested load standing for four hours. She showed marked improvement following treatment with dextroamphetamine sulfate. This very treatable disorder of the sympathetic nervous system should be considered in women with an unknown cause of chronic fatigue or if the symptoms persist despite treatment of another potential cause."

Sera were analyzed by an immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) followed by immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM Western blot (WB) assays. Both whole blood and sera were analyzed for detection of specific Borrelia spp. DNA using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Simultaneously, patients were tested for Babesia microti, Babesia duncani, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, and Bartonella henselae infection by IgG and IgM IFA serology, PCR, and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Most patients reported symptom onset in Australia without recent overseas travel. 28 of 51 (55%) tested positive for LD. Of 41 patients tested for tick-borne coinfections, 13 (32%) were positive for Babesia spp. and nine (22%) were positive for Bartonella spp. Twenty-five patients were tested for Ehrlichia spp. and (16%) were positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum while none were positive for Ehrlichia chaffeensis. Among the 51 patients tested for LD, 21 (41%) had evidence of more than one tick-borne infection. Positive tests for LD, Babesia duncani, Babesia microti, and Bartonella henselae were demonstrated in an individual who had never left the state of Queensland. Positive testing for these pathogens was found in three others whose movements were restricted to the east coast of Australia. The study identified a much larger tick-borne disease (TBD) burden within the Australian community than hitherto reported. In particular, the first cases of endemic human Babesia and Bartonella disease in Australia with coexisting Borrelia infection are described, thus defining current hidden and unrecognized components of TBD and demonstrating local acquisition in patients who have never been abroad."

Morgellons disease is an emerging human dermopathy characterized by the presence of filamentous fibers of undetermined composition, both in lesions and subdermally. While the etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, there is serological and clinical evidence linking this phenomenon to Lyme borreliosis and coinfecting tick-borne agents. Although the microscopy of Morgellons filaments has been described in the medical literature, the structure and pathogenesis of these fibers is poorly understood. In contrast, most microscopy of digital dermatitis has focused on associated pathogens and histology rather than the morphology of late-stage filamentous fibers.

Bioaerosols occurring in the agricultural work environments comprise: bacteria, fungi, high molecular polymers produced by bacteria (endotoxin) or by fungi (β-glucans), low molecular secondary metabolites of fungi (mycotoxins, volatile organic compounds) and various particles of plant and animal origin. All these agents could be a cause of allergic and/or immunotoxic occupational diseases of respiratory organ (airways inflammation, rhinitis, toxic pneumonitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and asthma), conjunctivitis and dermatitis in exposed workers. Very important among zoonotic agents causing occupational diseases are those causing tick-borne diseases: Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, bartonellosis. Agricultural workers in tropical zones are exposed to mosquito bites causing malaria, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the world. The group of agents causing other, basically not vector-borne zoonoses, comprises those evoking emerging or re-emerging diseases of global concern, such as: hantaviral diseases, avian and swine influenza, Q fever, leptospiroses, staphylococcal diseases caused by the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, and diseases caused by parasitic protozoa. Among other infectious, non-zoonotic agents, the greatest hazard for health care workers pose the blood-borne human hepatitis and immunodeficiency viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV). Of interest are also bacteria causing legionellosis in people occupationally exposed to droplet aerosols, mainly from warm water."

The resulting risk maps have proven value for highlighting areas for targeting public health programs. However, these methods generally only offer technical information on the spatial distribution of disease risk itself, which may be incomplete for making decisions in a complex situation. In prioritizing surveillance and intervention strategies, decision-makers often also need to consider spatially explicit information on other important dimensions, such as the regional specificity of public acceptance, population vulnerability, resource availability, intervention effectiveness, and land use. There is a need for a unified strategy for supporting public health decision making that integrates available data for assessing spatially explicit disease risk, with other criteria, to implement effective prevention and control strategies. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a decision support tool that allows for the consideration of diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria using both data-driven and qualitative indicators for evaluating alternative strategies with transparency and stakeholder participation. Here we propose a MCDA-based approach to the development of geospatial models and spatially explicit decision support tools for the management of vector-borne diseases. We describe the conceptual framework that MCDA offers as well as technical considerations, approaches to implementation and expected outcomes. We conclude that MCDA is a powerful tool that offers tremendous potential for use in public health decision-making in general and vector-borne disease management in particular."

		"abstract": "Although tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) has been recognized in Europe for more than 70 years and has been the topic of numerous reports, information on the involvement of facial nerves in the course of the disease is limited. Our study conducted at a single medical centre revealed that facial nerve involvement in the course of TBE in Central Europe is (i) infrequent--it was found in only 11 of 1218 (0.9%) consecutive adult patients diagnosed with TBE; (ii) manifests with unilateral or rarely bilateral peripheral facial palsy (PFP) (nine and two patients, respectively); (iii) appears late in the course of acute illness--in our patients 10-20 days after the onset of the meningoencephalitic phase of TBE, and often after defervescence (in 8/11 patients; 6-13 days after normalization of body temperature); (iv) develops more often in patients with more severe illness, i.e. more frequently in those with encephalitic than in those with meningitic clinical presentation, and more commonly in patients with monophasic than biphasic illness; and (v) has a favourable outcome--our patients had a clinically complete recovery from PFP within 7-90 (median 30) days after its onset. Moreover, the finding of Borrelia infection in 3/11 (27.3%) patients (diagnosis of confirmed Lyme neuroborreliosis was established in 1/11 patients and two patients fulfilled criteria for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis) suggests that in countries where TBE and Lyme borreliosis are endemic, concomitant infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato should be considered and searched for in patients who develop PFP in the course of TBE."

Therefore, we wanted to investigate adaptive and innate immune responsiveness to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in exposed Borrelia-antibody-positive asymptomatic children (n = 20), children with previous clinical LB (n = 24), and controls (n = 20). Blood samples were analyzed for Borrelia-specific interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-17 secretion by ELISPOT and Borrelia-induced IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12(p70), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion by Luminex. We found no significant differences in cytokine secretion between groups, but a tendency towards an increased spontaneous secretion of IL-6 was found among children with previous clinical LB. In conclusion, the adaptive or innate immune responsiveness to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was similar in Borrelia-exposed asymptomatic children and children with previous clinical LB. Thus, the immunological mechanisms of importance for eradicating the spirochete effectively without developing clinical manifestations of LB remain unknown."

The goal of this study was to test the performance of the Rule of 7's in a multicenter cohort of children with CSF pleocytosis. We performed a retrospective cohort study of children evaluated at 1 of 3 emergency departments located in Lyme disease-endemic areas with CSF pleocytosis and Lyme serology obtained. Lyme meningitis was defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria (either positive Lyme serology test result or an erythema migrans [EM] rash). We calculated the performance of the Rule of 7's in our overall study population and in children without physician-documented EM. We identified 423 children, of whom 117 (28% [95% confidence interval (CI): 24%-32%]) had Lyme meningitis, 306 (72% [95% CI: 68%-76%]) had aseptic meningitis, and 0 (95% CI: 0%-1%) had bacterial meningitis. Of the 130 classified as low risk, 5 had Lyme meningitis (sensitivity, 112 of 117 [96% (95% CI: 90%-99%)]; specificity, 125 of 302 [41% (95% CI: 36%-47%)]). In the 390 children without EM, 3 of the 127 low-risk patients had Lyme meningitis (2% [95% CI: 0%-7%]). Patients classified as low risk by using the Rule of 7's were unlikely to have Lyme meningitis and could be managed as outpatients while awaiting results of Lyme serology tests."

		"abstract": "IL-10 is a nonredundant inflammatory modulator that suppresses arthritis development in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected mice. Infected C57BL/6 (B6) IL-10(-/-) mice were previously found to have a prolonged IFN-inducible response in joint tissue. Infection of B6 IL-10 reporter mice identified macrophages and CD4(+) T cells as the primary sources of IL-10 in the infected joint tissue, suggesting that early local production of IL-10 dampened the proarthritic IFN response. Treatment of B6 IL-10(-/-) mice with anti-IFN-γ reduced the increase in arthritis severity and suppressed IFN-inducible transcripts to wild-type levels, thereby linking dysregulation of IFN-γ to disease in the B6 IL-10(-/-) mouse. Arthritis in B6 IL-10(-/-) mice was associated with elevated numbers of NK cell, NKT cell, α/β T cell, and macrophage infiltration of the infected joint. FACS lineage sorting revealed NK cells and CD4(+) T cells as sources of IFN-γ in the joint tissue of B6 IL-10(-/-) mice. These findings suggest the presence of a positive-feedback loop in the joint tissue of infected B6 IL-10(-/-) mice, in which production of inflammatory chemokines, infiltration of IFN-γ-producing cells, and additional production of inflammatory cytokines result in arthritis. This mechanism of arthritis is in contrast to that seen in C3H/He mice, in which arthritis development is linked to transient production of type I IFN and develops independently of IFN-γ. Due to the sustained IFN response driven by NK cells and T cells, we propose the B6 IL-10(-/-) mouse as a potential model to study the persistent arthritis observed in some human Lyme disease patients."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne diseases (VBD) make up a large number of emerging infectious and zoonotic diseases. Ticks, fleas, and mosquitoes are effective vectors parasitizing canines, making dogs adequate reservoirs for zoonoses. The U.S. military deploys personnel and government-owned animals around the world with possible risk of exposure to VBD. Canine VBD have veterinary and public health significance for the host nations as well as for the U.S. troops and its working animals deployed in the theater of operations. These factors make disease surveillance a great importance. The objective of this work was to survey canines from the cities of Manta and Guayaquil in Ecuador to determine prevalence of heartworm disease (D. immitis), ehrlichi os is (E. canis), Lyme disease (B. burgdorf eri), and anapl asmosis (A. phagocytophilum). Canine blood samples (1-3ml) collected from the cities of Manta (n=50) and Guayaquil (n=50) were tested on site using a SNAPR 4DxR Test Kit. Prevalence for single or multiple disease status was calculated for each city. In the city of Manta the overall prevalence of diseases was 78%; 52% for E. canis alone, and 26% for co-infection with E. canis and A. phagocytophilum. The overall prevalence for the city of Guayaquil was 88%; 40% for E. canis alone, 22% for A. phagocytophilum alone, and 26% for co-infection with E. canis and A. phagocytophilum. Neither heartworm disease nor Lyme disease was detected in any samp le. In conclusion, this study showed the extensive presence of E. canis and A. phagocytophilum in both cities in Ecuador, emphasizing the value of surveillance for zoonotic diseases to determine disease prevalence and risk assessments, as well as to implement control measures."

The area provides home for two Borrelia species (B. garinii and B. afzeli) and their natural carrier Ixodes persulcatus. 23 isolate of B.garnii were obtained from skin biopsies and blood samples taken in patients with borreliosis. The isolates were studied by sequencing rrf(5S)-rrr(23S) spacer. The term genetic variant (genovariant) is proposed for the totality of isolates belonging to a given genetic subgroup of the concrete genospecies and having a similar nucleotide sequence of rrf(5S)-rrr(23S) spacer or other conservative genomic sequence. Genovariant is ths smallest intraspecies taxonomic unit in widespread Borrelia pathogenic for man. Several genovariants of B. garinii and B. afzelii may simultaneously occur in combined parasitic systems formed by these spirochetal agents of Ixodes tick-borne borreliosis. Such natural foci in southern taiga of the Perm region have a complicated etiological structure due to the presence of 14 genovariants of Borrelia belonging to the two above genetic subgroups. Specific genovariants occur annually but with different frequency. They are lacking in host-specificity."

In 57% of cases, LD testing occurred after a clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans was made. Patients with any symptom in addition to erythema migrans were more likely to have testing (odds ratio (OR) = 3.52, 1.75-7.08). A positive LD screening test was not confirmed 24% of the time. Lack of ordering confirmatory testing was not associated with any clinical factors or site of the evaluation.

At the same time, factors potentially affecting the activity of ticks in these locations were studied. Results of the monitoring carried out in the first three spring months of the year 2011 are compared with 2010 results. In 2010-2011, Ixodes ricinus ticks were periodically sampled in two locations in Brno by flagging. Ticks were investigated by dark field microscopy (DFM) for the presence of spirochetes. DFM-positive samples from 2010 were tested by PCR to identify Bbsl. In the first three spring months (March-May) of 2011, a total of 234 ticks were collected in Pisárky and 211 ticks in ZH. Positive samples detected by DFM accounted for 5.56 % in Pisárky and 25.12 % in ZH. PCR confirmed Bbsl in at least 75 %. Statistical analysis confirmed the dependence of tick activity on the air temperature in both locations. Within the same city, seroprevalence was found to be different in two locations. High seroprevalence in ZH (25.12 %) could be attributed to focal spread of the disease from several sources, both ticks and reservoirs such as rodents. This may results in unfavourable epidemiological situation in Brno. On the other hand, the seroprevalence rates in Pisárky are consistent with findings from an earlier long-term study."

In the first part of this review, important aspects of epidemiology are discussed. Fundamentals of epidemiologic research include the measurement of occurrence of an event (prevalence and incidence) and the identification of factors that are associated with this event. The main study designs in observational studies are cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies, all of which have intrinsic strengths and limitations. These limitations include a variety of biases, which can be regrouped into selection bias, information bias, and confounding. The STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist is an important tool to further improve the reporting and quality of epidemiologic studies, and it is introduced. In the second part of this review, practical examples are presented, illustrating how dermatoepidemiology has contributed to an improved understanding of skin diseases and patient care, specifically in the case of melanoma therapy, serious cutaneous adverse reactions, Lyme disease, long-term safety of psoralin plus UVA (PUVA), teratogenicity of isotretinoin, and comorbidities in psoriasis."

The Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, produces Erp surface proteins throughout mammalian infection and represses their synthesis during colonization of vector ticks. Known functions of Erp proteins include binding of host laminin, plasmin(ogen), and regulators of complement activation. A DNA region immediately 5' of erp operons, the erp operator, is required for transcriptional regulation. The B. burgdorferi BpaB and EbfC proteins exhibit high in vitro affinities for erp operator DNA. In the present studies, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) demonstrated that both proteins bind erp operator DNA in vivo. Additionally, a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods demonstrated that BpaB functions as a repressor of erp transcription, while EbfC functions as an antirepressor."

In the enteric bacteria, flgJ null mutants fail to produce the flagellar rods, hooks, and filaments but still assemble the integral membrane-supramembrane (MS) rings. These mutants are nonmotile. The FlgJ proteins consist of two functional domains. The N-terminal rod-capping domain acts as a scaffold for rod assembly, and the C-terminal domain acts as a peptidoglycan (PG) hydrolase (PGase), which allows the elongating flagellar rod to penetrate through the PG layer. However, the FlgJ homologs in several bacterial phyla (including spirochetes) often lack the PGase domain. The function of these single-domain FlgJ proteins remains elusive. Herein, a single-domain FlgJ homolog (FlgJ(Bb)) was studied in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Cryo-electron tomography analysis revealed that the flgJ(Bb) mutant still assembled intact flagellar basal bodies but had fewer and disoriented flagellar hooks and filaments. Consistently, Western blots showed that the levels of flagellar hook (FlgE) and filament (FlaB) proteins were substantially decreased in the flgJ(Bb) mutant. Further studies disclosed that the decreases of FlgE and FlaB in the mutant occurred at the posttranscriptional level. Microscopic observation and swarm plate assay showed that the motility of the flgJ(Bb) mutant was partially deficient. The altered phenotypes were completely restored when the mutant was complemented. Collectively, these results indicate that FlgJ(Bb) is involved in the assembly of the flagellar hook and filament but not the flagellar rod in B. burgdorferi. The observed phenotype is different from that of flgJ mutants in the enteric bacteria."

He was examined by several specialists and an amputation was recommended since the condition was unknown and aggravating. On suspicion of Borrelia infection the patient was prescribed penicillin treatment for 28 days with convincing effect. Serologic tests showed increased Borrelia titer. Biopsy showed chronic inflammation without any suspicion of malignity. Denmark is endemic for borreliosis and per year approximately 50 cases develop acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans."

		"abstract": "The etiological agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus and, if untreated, can cause significant morbidity in affected individuals. Recent reports have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids in the B. burgdorferi cell envelope are potential targets for oxidative damage, which can be lethal. How B. burgdorferi responds to this assault is not known. Herein we report evidence that bb0646 codes for a lipase that is located within the bosR operon and that has specificity for both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Specifically, strains harbouring mutated copies of the lipase, either in the form of an insertionally inactivated construct or site-directed mutations within the active site, demonstrated attenuated lipolytic and haemolytic phenotypes when compared with the isogenic parent and trans-complements. In vivo analysis showed that while the bb0646 mutant remains infectious, the spirochaetal load is significantly lower than both the isogenic parent and the complemented mutant strains. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BB0646 is a broad substrate specific lipase that contributes to lipolytic and haemolytic activity in vitro and is required for optimal B. burgdorferi infection."

Small mammals of 19 species were captured in 1992-2010 at a station in low-mountain southern taiga forests of Chusov area of Perm region. Borreliae were isolated by seeding urinary bladder or aural bioptates into BSK II medium, leptospirae--by seeding a suspension of kidney tissue into Vervoort-Wolf medium. 1350 animals were studied by seeding for borrelia infection and 1077--for leptospira. 287 of those, small animals of 6 species, were simultaneously studied for borrelia and leptospira infection. Borrelia isolates were identified by using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism methods, and leptospirae--by using standard diagnostic agglutinating sera kit. Blood of 2893 rodents of 12 species and insectivorous of 7 species was studied in microagglutination reaction for the detection of antibodies against leptospirae. Infection by Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii or Grippotyphosa serogroup leptospira was detected in 6 most numerous species of forest small mammals. 3 root voles and I bankvole were simultaneously infected by borreliae and leptospirae. B. garinii and Grippotyphosa serogroup leptospira were simultaneously isolated from 2 root voles, and B. garinii and Javanica serogroup Leptospira interrogans--from 1 root vole. A bank vole was infected by B. afzelii and Javanica serogroup leptospira. Mixed-infected animals composed 1.4% of all animals of background species studied in parallel. The data obtained indicate a presence of natural foci of leptospiroses in the southern taiga forest pre-Urals. The data confirm the conceptions regarding a predominant presence in European forest ecosystems of foci with Grippotyphosa serogroup L. interrogans pathogen, and the main carrier ofthese leptospirae being bank vole. Combined natural foci of spirochetoses of two groups (ixodes tick borrelioses and leptospiroses) were detected."

The doxycycline-laden bait was formulated at a concentration of 500 mg/kg and delivered during the immature tick feeding season in rodent-targeted bait boxes. The percentage of infected small mammals recovered from treated areas after 2 years of treatment was reduced by 86.9% for B. burgdorferi and 74% for A. phagocytophilum. Infection rates in questing nymphal ticks for both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum were reduced by 94.3% and 92%, respectively.

These studies address whether current research methods using either ELISA to detect seroconversion to B. burgdorferi antigens or PCR quantification of bacterial DNA within tissues can accurately distinguish between a productive infection versus a B. burgdorferi exposure that is rapidly cleared by the innate responses. Mice receiving even minimal doses of live B. burgdorferi produced significantly more B. burgdorferi-specific IgM and IgG than groups receiving large inocula of heat-killed bacteria. Additionally, sera from mice injected with varied doses of killed B. burgdorferi recognized unique borrelial antigens compared to mice infected with live B. burgdorferi. Intradermal injection of killed B. burgdorferi resulted in rapid DNA clearance from skin, whereas DNA was consistently detected in skin inoculated with viable B. burgdorferi. These data indicate that both ELISA-based serological analyses and PCR-based methods of assessing B. burgdorferi infection clearly distinguish between an established infection with live bacteria and exposure to large numbers of bacteria that are promptly cleared by the innate responses."

Wooden picnic tables, tree trunks, logs, leaf litter, surrounding vegetation, and rock walls were checked for ticks using standard 1-m(2) flannel tick flags at biweekly intervals from March to August 2008. Results indicate that nymphal I. pacificus were commonly found on wooden picnic tables and other wooden materials, such as tree trunks and logs, at an equal proportion to those found in leaf litter. Nymphal I. pacificus in picnic areas peaked in April, with a secondary peak in early June. Five of 170 (2.9%) nymphal I. pacificus collected at picnic sites were positive for Borrelia spirochetes, of which 3 (1.8%) were identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto using molecular techniques. In addition, a nymphal I. auritulus collected from a rock wall in a picnic area tested positive for a mixture of B. burgdorferi and B. bissettii; this tick species feeds exclusively on birds. This study indicates a moderate risk of acquiring a nymphal tick at Tilden Park picnic areas, but due to the low B. burgdorferi infection prevalence, the risk of acquiring Lyme disease appears to be low."

Seasonal host-seeking activity of immature I. scapularis was similar to patterns reported previously in Canada and the USA: nymphal activity peaked in spring while larval activity peaked in late summer. Synchronous activity of nymphs with some larvae was observed in late spring, which could favour establishment of B. burgdorferi strains that cause short-lived infections in their hosts. White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), deer mice (P. maniculatus), chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) carried 92.0% of the larvae and 94.2% of the nymphs collected. Adult male white-footed mice carried significantly larger numbers of both larval and nymphal I. scapularis than other species and classes of small mammals (different demographic groups or physiological status: age, sex, sexual activity). We conclude that seasonality and host association were comparable to previous studies in North America, even in the context of a newly endemic pattern of low infection prevalence and low densities of host-seeking and feeding I. scapularis in southwestern Quebec. Our studies suggest that B. burgdorferi transmission cycles are focused on adult male mice (which carried 35% of all feeding ticks collected in the study), so control methods targeting this class of hosts may be particularly effective. However, our study also suggested that habitats containing a diverse host structure may dilute transmission cycles by partitioning of nymphal and larval ticks on different host species."

By applying a genomic approach relying on human antibodies we have identified 122 antigenic Borrelia proteins associated with Lyme borreliosis, including already known and published protective antigens. The heterogeneity of the Borrelia species causing Lyme borreliosis makes the search for conserved antigens providing broad protection challenging. Using several in vitro assays we narrowed down the selection to 15 vaccine candidates. These antigens were further analyzed for antigenicity and cross-reactivity using sera from mice infected with the three pathogenic Borrelia species. All antigens analyzed showed a high degree of cross-reactivity between the three Borrelia species, essential for providing cross-protection. We also investigated whether mice infected with B. afzelii through tick exposure are primed to mount cytokine responses. For a selection of these antigens, we observed preferentially a pro-inflammatory response in C3H/HeN mice, while in contrast also a type 2 T cell response was seen in the Borrelia-resistant mouse strain BALB/c. Thus, antigens mounting a type 2 or mixed type 2/type 1 T cell response might be preferred vaccine candidates for evaluation in animal models of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The analysis of different multi-host systems suggests that even hosts that are not capable of transmitting Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) to the tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, or that are secondary reservoirs for these agents contribute to the intensity of transmission and to the overall risk of Lyme borreliosis, through the process of vector augmentation and pathogen amplification. On the other hand, above certain threshold densities, or in the presence of competition with primary reservoir hosts or low attachment rate of ticks to reservoir hosts, incompetent or less competent hosts may reduce transmission through dilution. The transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l. is affected by molecular processes at the tick-host interface including mechanisms for the protection of spirochaetes against the host's immune response. Molecular biology also increasingly provides important identification tools for the study of tick-borne disease agents. Ixodes ricinus and B. burgdorferi s.l. are expanding their geographical range to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes through the effects of climate change on host populations and on tick development, survival and seasonal activity. The integration of quantitative ecology with molecular methodology is central to a better understanding of the factors that determine the main components of Lyme borreliosis eco-epidemiology and should result in more accurate predictions of the effects of climate change on the circulation of pathogens in nature."

B. burgdorferi is a highly invasive bacterium, yet lacks extracellular protease activity. In order to aid in its dissemination, B. burgdorferi binds plasminogen, a component of the hosts' fibrinolytic system. Plasminogen bound to the surface of B. burgdorferi can then be activated to the protease plasmin, facilitating the bacterium's penetration of endothelial cell layers and degradation of extracellular matrix components. Enolases are highly conserved proteins with no sorting sequences or lipoprotein anchor sites, yet many bacteria have enolases bound to their outer surfaces. B. burgdorferi enolase is both a cytoplasmic and membrane associated protein. Enolases from other pathogenic bacteria are known to bind plasminogen. We confirmed the surface localization of B. burgdorferi enolase by in situ protease degradation assay and immunoelectron microscopy. We then demonstrated that B. burgdorferi enolase binds plasminogen in a dose-dependent manner. Lysine residues were critical for binding of plasminogen to enolase, as the lysine analog εaminocaproic acid significantly inhibited binding. Ionic interactions did not play a significant role in plasminogen binding by enolase, as excess NaCl had no effects on the interaction. Plasminogen bound to recombinant enolase could be converted to active plasmin. We conclude that B. burgdorferi enolase is a moonlighting cytoplasmic protein which also associates with the bacterial outer surface and facilitates binding to host plasminogen."

		"abstract": "The agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, has a number of outer membrane proteins that are differentially regulated during its life cycle. In addition to their physiological functions in the organism, these proteins also likely serve different functions in invasiveness and immune evasion. In borreliae, as well as in other bacteria, a number of membrane proteins have been implicated in binding plasminogen. The activation and transformation of plasminogen into its proteolytically active form, plasmin, enhances the ability of the bacteria to disseminate in the host. Outer membrane vesicles of B. burgdorferi contain enolase, a glycolytic-cycle enzyme that catalyzes 2-phosphoglycerate to form phosphoenolpyruvate, which is also a known plasminogen receptor in Gram-positive bacteria. The enolase was cloned, expressed, purified, and used to generate rabbit antienolase serum. The enolase binds plasminogen in a lysine-dependent manner but not through ionic interactions. Although it is present in the outer membrane, microscopy and proteinase K treatment showed that enolase does not appear to be exposed on the surface. However, enolase in the outer membrane vesicles is accessible to proteolytic degradation by proteinase K. Samples from experimentally and tick-infected mice and rabbits as well as from Lyme disease patients exhibit recognition of enolase in serologic assays. Thus, this immunogenic plasminogen receptor released in outer membrane vesicles could be responsible for external proteolysis in the pericellular environment and have roles in nutrition and in enhancing dissemination."

More than 95% of naturally infected dogs are asymptomatic or subclinical; however, in experimental studies, histologic synovial lesions are consistently observed in asymptomatic dogs inoculated with B. burdgorferi. This study investigates the ability of a synovial histopathologic scoring system, clinicopathologic data, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to differentiate between B. burgdorferi-infected and uninfected dogs. Eighteen 18-week-old beagles were subject to challenge with B. burgdorferi-infected wild-caught ticks (Ixodes scapularis), and 4 uninfected dogs served as controls. Infection was confirmed by serology (ELISA) and PCR amplification of B. burgdorferi-specific DNA of skin biopsies taken at the tick attachment site. A synovial scoring system from human medicine was adapted and implemented on postmortem synovial samples to discriminate infected and noninfected animals. Application of this system to elbows and stifles with a cumulative joint score cutoff  > 4 showed a sensitivity of 88.2% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive likelihood ratio of infinity and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.12. Complete blood count, serum biochemistry, urinalysis, urine protein:creatinine, urine PCR, synovial and lymph node cytology, and synovial PCR were evaluated but were not reliable indicators of clinical disease."

		"abstract": "We present the draft genome for the Rickettsia endosymbiont of Ixodes scapularis (REIS), a symbiont of the deer tick vector of Lyme disease in North America. Among Rickettsia species (Alphaproteobacteria: Rickettsiales), REIS has the largest genome sequenced to date (>2 Mb) and contains 2,309 genes across the chromosome and four plasmids (pREIS1 to pREIS4). The most remarkable finding within the REIS genome is the extraordinary proliferation of mobile genetic elements (MGEs), which contributes to a limited synteny with other Rickettsia genomes. In particular, an integrative conjugative element named RAGE (for Rickettsiales amplified genetic element), previously identified in scrub typhus rickettsiae (Orientia tsutsugamushi) genomes, is present on both the REIS chromosome and plasmids. Unlike the pseudogene-laden RAGEs of O. tsutsugamushi, REIS encodes nine conserved RAGEs that include F-like type IV secretion systems similar to that of the tra genes encoded in the Rickettsia bellii and R. massiliae genomes. An unparalleled abundance of encoded transposases (>650) relative to genome size, together with the RAGEs and other MGEs, comprise ~35% of the total genome, making REIS one of the most plastic and repetitive bacterial genomes sequenced to date. We present evidence that conserved rickettsial genes associated with an intracellular lifestyle were acquired via MGEs, especially the RAGE, through a continuum of genomic invasions. Robust phylogeny estimation suggests REIS is ancestral to the virulent spotted fever group of rickettsiae. As REIS is not known to invade vertebrate cells and has no known pathogenic effects on I. scapularis, its genome sequence provides insight on the origin of mechanisms of rickettsial pathogenicity."

In other cases the rash may be unseen or unrecognized by a physician. In these situations, Lyme disease is difficult to diagnose because it masquerades as a non-specific viral-like illness. The seasonal peak of Lyme disease ranging from May through September overlaps with that of viral illnesses such as enteroviral infections, West Nile virus, and in rare years such as 2009, early influenza season. We present a case of a patient with Lyme disease who was initially misdiagnosed with influenza A during the summer of 2009. Because of the diagnostic importance of recognizing the erythema migrans rash, physicians in endemic regions should always ask about new rashes or skin lesions and perform a thorough physical examination when patients present over the summer with viral-like symptoms. Even when no rash is evident, Lyme disease should be considered if these symptoms persist or worsen without a specific diagnosis."

When the direct detection of a pathogen is not possible, detection of specific IgM antibodies or antigens may also help to diagnose an acute infection. This article describes the usefulness of serological testing for the diagnosis or the follow-up of some infectious pathologies: Lyme disease, sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Serological diagnosis of Lyme disease is difficult. Results must always be interpreted in correlation with clinical symptoms: on the one hand, the presence of antibodies could be correlated either with a recent or a past infection; and on the other hand, sensitivity of Lyme serology is low in the early stages. Concerning STD, the direct detection of the pathogen must be preferred for Herpes simplex, Chlamydia, mycoplasma and gonorrhoea infections. For detection of HIV, HCV, HBV and syphilis, serological testing is the method of choice. The diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis is based on the detection of specific EBV IgM antibodies and should be preferred to the detection of heterophilic antibodies such as Paul and Bunnel test. EBV reactivation are very rare in immunocompetent patients, but can occur in immunocompromised, particularly transplanted patients and can lead to a lymphoproliferative disorder. Surveillance of these patients can be followed with the monitoring of EBV viral load. Serological testing in this case is generally not useful."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, a tick-borne bacterial pathogen, causes a disseminated infection involving multiple organs known as Lyme disease. Surface proteins can directly participate in microbial virulence by facilitating pathogen dissemination via interaction with host factors. We show here that a fraction of the B. burgdorferi chromosomal gene product BB0337, annotated as enolase or phosphopyruvate dehydratase, is associated with spirochete outer membrane and is surface exposed. B. burgdorferi enolase, either in a recombinant form or as a membrane-bound native antigen, displays enzymatic activities intrinsic to the glycolytic pathway. However, the protein also interacts with host plasminogen, potentially leading to its activation and resulting in B. burgdorferi-induced fibrinolysis. As expected, enolase displayed consistent expression in vivo, however, with a variable temporal and spatial expression during spirochete infection in mice and ticks. Despite an extracellular exposure of the antigen and a potential role in host-pathogen interaction, active immunization of mice with recombinant enolase failed to evoke protective immunity against subsequent B. burgdorferi infection. In contrast, enolase immunization of murine hosts significantly reduced the acquisition of spirochetes by feeding ticks, suggesting that the protein could have a stage-specific role in B. burgdorferi survival in the feeding vector. Strategies to interfere with the function of surface enolase could contribute to the development of novel preventive measures to interrupt the spirochete infection cycle and reduce the incidences of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is one of the most common tick-borne diseases in the northern hemisphere. It is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi. In its early stages, pathological skin lesions, namely erythema chronicum migrans, appear. The lesions, usually localised at the site of the bite, may become visible from a few weeks up to 3 months after the infection. Predominant clinical symptoms of the disease also involve joint malfunctions and neurological or cardiac disorders. Lyme disease, in all its stages, may be successfully treated with antibiotics. The best results, however, are obtained in its early stages. In order to diagnose the disease, numerous medical or laboratory techniques have been developed. They are applied to confirm the presence of intact spirochaetes or spirochaete components such as DNA or proteins in tick vectors, reservoir hosts or patients. The methods used for the determination of LB biomarkers have also been reviewed. These biomarkers are formed during the lipid peroxidation process. The formation of peroxidation products generated by human organisms is directly associated with oxidative stress. Apart from aldehydes (malondialdehyde and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal), many other unsaturated components such as isoprostenes and neuroprostane are obtained. The fast determination of these compounds in encephalic fluid, urine or plasma, especially in early stages of the disease, enables its treatment. Various analytical techniques which allow the determination of the aforementioned biomarkers have been reported. These include spectrophotometry as well as liquid and gas chromatography. The analytical procedure also requires the application of a derivatization step by the use of selected reagents."

Instead, it relies on a post-transcriptional mechanism to control its flagellar synthesis. The underlying mechanism of this control remains elusive. A recent study reported that the increased level of BB0184 (CsrA(Bb); a homologue of carbon storage regulator A) substantially inhibited the accumulation of FlaB, the major flagellin protein of B. burgdorferi. In this report, we deciphered the regulatory role of CsrA(Bb) on FlaB synthesis and the mechanism involved by analysing two mutants, csrA(Bb)(-) (a deletion mutant of csrA(Bb)) and csrA(Bb)(+) (a mutant conditionally overexpressing csrA(Bb)). We found that FlaB accumulation was significantly inhibited in csrA(Bb)(+) but was substantially increased in csrA(Bb)(-) . In contrast, the levels of other flagellar proteins remained unchanged. Cryo-electron tomography and immuno-fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that the altered synthesis of CsrA(Bb) in these two mutants specifically affected flagellar filament length. The leader sequence of flaB transcript contains two conserved CsrA-binding sites, with one of these sites overlapping the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. We found that CsrA(Bb) bound to the flaB transcripts via these two binding sites, and this binding inhibited the synthesis of FlaB at the translational level. Taken together, our results indicate that CsrA(Bb) specifically regulates the periplasmic flagellar synthesis by inhibiting translation initiation of the flaB transcript."

		"abstract": "After infection with Borrelia species, the risk for developing Lyme disease varies significantly between individuals. Recognition of Borrelia by the immune system is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as TLRs. While TLR2 is the main recognition receptor for Borrelia spp., little is known about the role of TLR1 and TLR6, which both can form functionally active heterodimers with TLR2. Here we investigated the recognition of Borrelia by both murine and human TLR1 and TLR6. Peritoneal macrophages from TLR1- and TLR6- gene deficient mice were isolated and exposed to Borrelia. Human PBMCs were stimulated with Borrelia with or without specific TLR1 and TLR6 blocking using specific antibodies. Finally, the functional consequences of TLR polymorphisms on Borrelia-induced cytokine production were assessed. Splenocytes isolated from both TLR1-/- and TLR6-/- mice displayed a distorted Th1/Th2 cytokine balance after stimulation with B.burgdorferi, while no differences in pro-inflammatory cytokine production were observed. In contrast, blockade of TLR1 with specific neutralizing antibodies led to decreased cytokine production by human PBMCs after exposure to B.burgdorferi. Blockade of human TLR6 did not lead to suppression of cytokine production. When PBMCs from healthy individuals bearing polymorphisms in TLR1 were exposed to B.burgdorferi, a remarkably decreased in vitro cytokine production was observed in comparison to wild-type controls. TLR6 polymorphisms lead to a minor modified cytokine production. This study indicates a dominant role for TLR1/TLR2 heterodimers in the induction of the early inflammatory response by Borrelia spirochetes in humans."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is a European tick that transmits numerous pathogenic agents, including the bacteria that cause Lyme disease (some genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex). This tick has been considered as a classic example of an extreme generalist vector. However, host-associations in such vector species are difficult to determine from field observations alone and recent work suggests that host specificity may be more frequent in ticks than previously thought. The presence of host-associated vector groups can significantly alter the circulation and evolutionary pathway of associated pathogens. In this paper, we explicitly test for host-associated genetic structure in I. ricinus. We analyzed genetic variability at 11 microsatellite markers in a large sample of ticks collected directly from trapped wild animals (birds, rodents, lizards, wild boar and roe deer) at five sites in Western and Central Europe. We found significant levels of genetic structure both among host individuals and among host types within local populations, suggesting that host use is not random in I. ricinus. These results help explain previous patterns of structure found in off-host tick samples, along with epidemiological observations of Lyme disease."

Their numbers often increase during infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus, and at sites of chronic inflammation. However, the turnover dynamics of human γδ T cells are poorly understood. Here we observed that despite more rapid proliferation in vitro by human Lyme arthritis synovial γδ T cells of the Vδ1 subset, they have reduced surviving cell numbers compared with αβ T cells because of increased cell death by the γδ T cells. Because caspases are involved in cell proliferation and death, and because signaling is more efficient through T cell receptor (TCR)-γδ than through TCR-αβ, we examined the levels of active caspases during cell cycling and following TCR restimulation. We observed higher overall caspase activity in Borrelia-reactive γδ T cells than in comparable αβ T cells. This was paralleled by greater spontaneous cell death and TCR restimulation-induced cell death of the γδ T cells, which was caspase dependent. Our current findings thus are consistent with a model in which human γδ T cells evolved to function quickly and transiently in an innate fashion."

To further define the conformational secretion requirements and to identify potential lipoprotein translocation intermediates associated with the bacterial outer membrane (OM), we generated constructs in which Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface lipoprotein A (OspA) was fused to calmodulin (CaM), a conserved eukaryotic protein undergoing calcium-dependent folding. Protein localization assays showed that constructs in which CaM was fused to full-length wild-type (wt) OspA or to an intact OspA N-terminal \"tether\" peptide retained their competence for OM translocation even in the presence of calcium. In contrast, constructs in which CaM was fused to truncated or mutant OspA N-terminal tether peptides were targeted to the periplasmic leaflet of the OM in the presence of calcium but could be flipped to the bacterial surface upon calcium chelation. This indicated that in the absence of an intact tether peptide, unfolding of the CaM moiety was required in order to facilitate OM traversal. Together, these data further support a periplasmic tether peptide-mediated mechanism to prevent premature folding of B. burgdorferi surface lipoproteins. The specific shift in the OM topology of sequence-identical lipopeptides due to a single-variable change in environmental conditions also indicates that surface-bound Borrelia lipoproteins can localize transiently to the periplasmic leaflet of the OM."

		"abstract": "Interleukin-10 (IL-10) modulates inflammatory responses elicited in vitro and in vivo by Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete. How IL-10 modulates these inflammatory responses still remains elusive. We hypothesize that IL-10 inhibits effector functions of multiple genes induced by B. burgdorferi in macrophages to control concomitantly elicited inflammation. Because macrophages are essential in the initiation of inflammation, we used mouse J774 macrophages and live B. burgdorferi spirochetes as the model target cell and stimulant, respectively. First, we employed transcriptome profiling to identify genes that were induced by stimulation of cells with live spirochetes and that were perturbed by addition of IL-10 to spirochete cultures. Spirochetes significantly induced upregulation of 347 genes at both the 4-h and 24-h time points. IL-10 inhibited the expression levels, respectively, of 53 and 65 of the 4-h and 24-h genes, and potentiated, respectively, at 4 h and 24 h, 65 and 50 genes. Prominent among the novel identified IL-10-inhibited genes also validated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1), TLR2, IRAK3, TRAF1, IRG1, PTGS2, MMP9, IFI44, IFIT1, and CD40. Proteome analysis using a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) revealed the IL-10 modulation/and or potentiation of RANTES/CCL5, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2)/CXCL2, IP-10/CXCL10, MIP-1α/CCL3, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)/CSF3, CXCL1, CXCL5, CCL2, CCL4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), IL-1α, IL-1β, gamma interferon (IFN-γ), and IL-9. Similar results were obtained using sonicated spirochetes or lipoprotein as stimulants. Our data show that IL-10 alters effectors induced by B. burgdorferi in macrophages to control concomitantly elicited inflammatory responses. Moreover, for the first time, this study provides global insight into potential mechanisms used by IL-10 to control Lyme disease inflammation."

Chronic neuroborreliosis can mimic multiple sclerosis and cause considerable difficulties in differential diagnosis. A comparative clinical-instrumental analysis of patients with definite multiple sclerosis (n=65) and chronic borrelial encephalomyelitis (n=11) was carried out. The key differential-diagnostic features of multiple sclerosis and borrelial encephalomyelitis were specified. Migrating erythema and tick's bite in the anamnesis, combined with lesions of the central and peripheral nervous systems, the absence of retrobulbar neuritis in the anamnesis, artralgia and myalgia, the high blood sedimentation rate were not characteristic of multiple sclerosis. A patient with abovementioned findings should be tested for the presence of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi in the blood serum and, if necessary, in the cerebrospinal fluid to exclude the diagnosis of Lime disease."

		"abstract": "The surface-exposed antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi represent important targets for induction of protective host immune responses. BBA52 is preferentially expressed by B. burgdorferi in the feeding tick, and a targeted deletion of bba52 interferes with vector-host transitions in vivo. In this study, we demonstrate that BBA52 is an outer membrane surface-exposed protein and that disulfide bridges take part in the homo-oligomeric assembly of native protein. BBA52 antibodies lack detectable borreliacidal activities in vitro. However, active immunization studies demonstrated that BBA52 vaccinated mice were significantly less susceptible to subsequent tick-borne challenge infection. Similarly, passive transfer of BBA52 antibodies in ticks completely blocked B. burgdorferi transmission from feeding ticks to naïve mice. Taken together, these studies highlight the role of BBA52 in spirochete dissemination from ticks to mice and demonstrate the potential of BBA52 antibody-mediated strategy to complement the ongoing efforts to develop vaccines for blocking the transmission of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "We have shown previously that extended intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with low morbidity and no mortality in patients referred for treatment of neurologic Lyme disease. In this study, we evaluated the benefit of extended intravenous antibiotic therapy in patients with symptoms of neurologic Lyme disease. Patients with significant neurologic symptoms and positive testing for Borrelia burgdorferi were treated with intravenous antibiotics, and biweekly evaluation of symptom severity was performed using a six-level ordinal scale. Four symptoms were selected a priori as primary outcome measures in the study, ie, fatigue, cognition, myalgias, and arthralgias. Patients were placed into five groups according to time on treatment (1-4, 5-8, 9-12, 13-24, and 25-52 weeks), and changes in the primary symptoms as a function of time on treatment were analyzed using a mixed-effects proportional odds model. Among 158 patients with more than one follow-up visit who were monitored for up to 1 year, there were on average 6.7 visits per person (median 5, range 2-24). The last follow-up day was on average 96 days after enrollment (median 69, range 7-354 days), corresponding to the length of antibiotic therapy. Each primary symptom was significantly improved at one or more time points during the study. For cognition, fatigue, and myalgias, the greatest improvement occurred in patients on the longest courses of treatment (25-52 weeks) with odds ratios (OR) for improvement of 1.97 (P = 0.02), 2.22 (P < 0.01), and 2.08 (P = 0.01), respectively. In contrast, arthralgias were only significantly improved during the initial 1-4 weeks of therapy (OR: 1.57, P = 0.04), and the beneficial effect of longer treatment did not reach statistical significance for this symptom. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with improved cognition, fatigue, and myalgias in patients referred for treatment of neurologic Lyme disease. Treatment for 25-52 weeks may be necessary to obtain symptomatic improvement in these patients."

Although the Lone Star tick is found in the Lyme disease-endemic areas of New England and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, STARI has been reported only once from the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. We report a child from Connecticut who visited Long Island, New York, and developed a rash that was thought to be EM. Because the patient failed to respond to antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease, an investigation ensued, and the diagnosis of STARI was established."

The number of ticks per lizard and the number of ticks PCR positive for both microorganisms per lizard were strongly correlated. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between numbers of ticks infected with Anaplasmataceae and with B. burgdorferi s.l. living on the same lizard. However, there was no significant correlation between detection of both bacteria in the same tick. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Anaplasmataceae DNA and additionally the second report of B. burgdorferi s.l DNA detection in the sand lizard."

There are only a few case reports describing Lyme disease presenting with isolated hip involvement. The purpose of this study is to review our experience with primary Lyme arthritis of the hip. Clinical records at a tertiary children's referral center in a Lyme endemic region were scanned for key words \"Lyme\" and \"hip.\" Patients with isolated Lyme disease of the hip were included. Diagnosis was made based on Centers for Disease Control guidelines. Clinical presentation, laboratory evaluation, and treatment information were recorded for eligible patients. Eight patients met eligibility criteria with an average age of 9.5 years (3 to 20y). All patients presented with hip pain (8), limp (3), or refusal to bear weight (5). One of 8 patients had a fever >38.5°C. Two of 8 patients had a peripheral white blood cell count >12,500/mm and 3 of 8 patients had an erythrocyte sedimentation rate>40 mm/h. Aspiration was performed on 5 patients, with a median synovial fluid white blood cell of 41,500/mm (21,500 to 73,500/mm). Three of 8 patients were treated surgically; all patients were treated with antibiotics and were asymptomatic at last follow-up. With the exception of 1 case, there was a delay before appropriate antibiotics were started. Primary monoarticular Lyme arthritis of the hip is uncommon. Clinical presentation and laboratory findings are variable, and differentiating it from septic arthritis or toxic synovitis of the hip may be difficult. In areas where Lyme disease is endemic, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of monoarticular hip pain associated with an effusion. Level IV, Case Series."

Borrelia miyamotoi was the sole spirochete detected in larval ticks sampled while questing on vegetation. Questing nymphal and adult ticks were infected mainly by Borrelia afzelii, whereas larval ticks resulting from engorged females of the same population were solely infected by B. miyamotoi. Since larvae acquire Lyme disease spirochetes within a few hours of attachment to an infected rodent, questing larvae in nature may have acquired Lyme disease spirochetes from an interrupted host contact. Even if transovarial transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes may occasionally occur, it seems to be an exceedingly rare event. No undisputable proof exists for vertical transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes, whereas B. miyamotoi appears to be readily passed between generations of vector ticks."

This study was carried out in order to evaluate the potential of topically applied azithromycin to eliminate the spirochaetal organisms in the skin of the freshly bitten host and thereby prevent Lyme borreliosis. Laboratory mice were challenged with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto by needle inoculation or via infected ticks as vectors. Then, an azithromycin-containing formulation was applied once daily to the sites of exposure for three consecutive days. In the case of needle inoculation, a 5% azithromycin formulation was applied starting 1 h, 3 days and 5 days after infection. In the case of tick exposure, 4%, 10% and 20% azithromycin formulations were applied, starting directly after the detachment of the engorged ticks. Subsequently, the infection status of the mice was determined. Concentrations of azithromycin in murine skin were >3800-fold higher than the published minimal inhibitory concentration for B. burgdorferi as soon as 3 h after the first application. After needle inoculation, spirochaetes were not detectable in all infected mice after treatment, if the first application started 1 h or even after 3 days post-infection. Furthermore, no borrelial organisms were detected after topical treatment when ticks were used for spirochaete inoculation. Our data indicate that topical treatment with a formulation containing azithromycin is a promising approach to prevent Lyme borreliosis shortly after a tick bite."

We examined the prevalence of anti-Bbsl antibodies in 805 individuals of nine seabird species breeding across the North Pacific. Seroprevalence varied strongly among species and locations. Murres (Uria spp.) showed the highest antibody prevalence and may play a major role in facilitating Bbsl circulation at a worldwide scale. Other species showed little or no signs of exposure, despite being present in multispecific colonies with seropositive birds. Complex dynamics may be operating in this wide scale, natural host-parasite system, possibly mediated by the host immune system and host specialization of the tick vector."

The enzootic cycle of this pathogen requires that Ixodes spp. acquire B. burgdorferi from infected wildlife reservoirs and transmit it to other uninfected wildlife. At present, there are no effective measures to control B. burgdorferi; there is no human vaccine available, and existing vector control measures are generally not acceptable to the public. However, if B. burgdorferi could be eliminated from its reservoir hosts or from the ticks that feed on them, the enzootic cycle would be broken, and the incidence of Lyme disease would decrease. We developed OspA-RTV, a reservoir targeted bait vaccine (RTV) based on the immunogenic outer surface protein A (OspA) of B. burgdorferi aimed at breaking the natural cycle of this spirochete. White-footed mice, the major reservoir species for this spirochete in nature developed a systemic OspA-specific IgG response as a result of ingestion of the bait formulation. This immune response protected white-footed mice against B. burgdorferi infection upon tick challenge and cleared B. burgdorferi from the tick vector. In performing extensive studies to optimize the OspA-RTV for field deployment, we determined that mice that consumed the vaccine over periods of 1 or 4 months developed a yearlong, neutralizing anti-OspA systemic IgG response. Furthermore, we defined the minimum number of OspA-RTV units needed to induce a protective immune response."

In this study, we evaluated DNA extracted from 201 ticks captured locally by a real-time PCR that targeted a unique region within msp2, and 24 samples (12%) yielded positive results. The PCR also detected A. phagocytophilum DNA in blood samples obtained from 53 patients with clinical abnormalities consistent with HGA, and sequencing confirmed that the DNA was recovered from the Ap-ha variant of A. phagocytophilum, associated exclusively with human infection. The findings therefore confirmed that the upper Midwestern focus for HGA endemicity now includes the regions immediately surrounding La Crosse, WI. The results also validated the utility of the real-time msp2 PCR test for confirming acute HGA in the clinical setting."

The current study systematically evaluates canine brains for evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Twelve Beagles were experimentally challenged with B. burgdorferi-infected ticks at 18 weeks of age, and 2 unexposed dogs served as controls. One of the uninfected dogs and 6 infected dogs were each given 5 daily immunosuppressive doses of dexamethasone starting at 153 days post-infection. Eleven dogs were confirmed as infected by skin punch biopsy polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology. Neurological signs were not seen in any dogs through the end of the 190-day study. Whole blood, serum, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brains from all dogs were collected. DNA was extracted from blood, CSF, and brain and evaluated by PCR for B. burgdorferi. Formalin-fixed brain tissue was examined by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and PCR. Immunohistochemical staining for B. burgdorferi antigen was negative in all cases. The CSF analysis was normal, and PCR was uniformly negative for B. burgdorferi in all dogs. Six of the 11 (45%) infected dogs had mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic choroid plexitis, which was more pronounced in the immunosuppressed dogs. The lack of B. burgdorferi DNA and immunohistochemical evidence of organisms, including within the choroid plexus lesions, suggests that B. burgdorferi does not have a direct role in the etiopathogenesis of canine central nervous system pathology."

The most common clinical manifestation is erythema migrans, which eventually resolves, even without antibiotic treatment. However, the infecting pathogen can spread to other tissues and organs, causing more severe manifestations that can involve a patient's skin, nervous system, joints, or heart. The incidence of this disease is increasing in many countries. Laboratory evidence of infection, mainly serology, is essential for diagnosis, except in the case of typical erythema migrans. Diagnosed cases are usually treated with antibiotics for 2-4 weeks and most patients make an uneventful recovery. No convincing evidence exists to support the use of antibiotics for longer than 4 weeks, or for the persistence of spirochaetes in adequately treated patients. Prevention is mainly accomplished by protecting against tick bites. There is no vaccine available for human beings."

Since there is no evidence to indicate that chronic Lyme disease is due to a persistent infection and that extended antibiotic therapy is beneficial and safe, this condition should not be viewed solely as an infectious disease problem. Rather, it should be considered within the context of a broad-based, multidisciplinary approach to determining the cause of chronic pain per se and developing more effective strategies for its treatment as outlined in a recent report on pain issued by the Institute of Medicine."

Few data are available on the CSF lactate concentration in European adults with the diagnosis of acute LNB. The objective of the study was to investigate the CSF changes during acute LNB. Routine CSF parameters [leukocyte count, protein, lactate and albumin concentrations, CSF/serum quotients of albumin (Q(Alb)), IgG, IgA and IgM, and oligoclonal IgG bands] and the Borrelia burgdorferi (BB)-specific antibody index were retrospectively studied in relation to the clinical presentation in patients diagnosed with acute LNB. A total of 118 patients with LNB were categorized into the following groups according to their symptoms at presentation; group 1: polyradiculoneuritis (Bannwarth's syndrome), group 2: isolated facial palsy and group 3: predominantly meningitic course of the disease. In addition to the CSF of patients with acute LNB, CSF of 19 patients with viral meningitis (VM) and 3 with neurolues (NL) were analyzed. There were 97 patients classified with definite LNB, and 21 as probable LNB. Neck stiffness and fever were reported by 15.3% of patients. Most of these patients were younger than 50 years. Polyradiculoneuritis was frequently found in patients older than 50 years. Lymphopleocytosis was found in all patients. Only 5 patients had a CSF lactate ≥3.5 mmol/l, and the mean CSF lactate level was not elevated (2.1 ± 0.6 mmol/l). The patients with definite LNB had significantly higher lactate levels than patients with probable LNB. Elevated lactate levels were accompanied by fever and headache. In the Reiber nomograms, intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis was found for IgM in 70.2% followed by IgG in 19.5%. Isoelectric focussing detected an intrathecal IgG synthesis in 83 patients (70.3%). Elevated BB AIs in the CSF were found in 97 patients (82.2%). Patients with VM showed lower CSF protein concentration and CSF/serum quotients of albumin than LNB patients. In acute LNB, all patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leukocyte counts. In contrast to infections by other bacteria, CSF lactate was lower than 3.5 mmol/l in all but 5 patients. The CSF findings did not differ between polyradiculoneuritis, facial palsy, and meningitis. The CSF in LNB patients strongly differed from CSF in VM patients with respect to protein concentration and the CSF/serum albumin quotient."

		"abstract": "Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is known to play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of T helper 17 cells. It has been previously demonstrated that IL-17 is involved in experimental Lyme arthritis, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria. However, the precise role of the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) for the B. burgdorferi-induced IL-17 responses or human Lyme disease has not yet been elucidated. IL-23R single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11209026 was genotyped using the TaqMan assay. Functional studies were performed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Dose-dependent production of IL-23 and IL-17 by B. burgdorferi could be observed. Interestingly, when IL-23 bioactivity was inhibited by a specific antibody against IL-23p19, IL-17 production was significantly downregulated. In contrast, production of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) was not affected after the blockade of IL-23 activity. Moreover, individuals bearing a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IL-23R gene (Arg381Gln) produced significantly less IL-17 after B. burgdorferi stimulation compared with that of the individuals bearing the wild type. Despite lower IL-17 production, the IL-23R gene polymorphism did not influence the development of chronic Lyme disease in a cohort of patients with Lyme disease. This study demonstrates that IL-23R signaling is needed for B. burgdorferi-induced IL-17 production in vitro and that an IL-23R gene SNP leads to impaired IL-17 production. However, the IL-23R gene polymorphism is not crucial for the pathogenesis of chronic Lyme."

		"abstract": "How genomic diversity within bacterial populations originates and is maintained in the presence of frequent recombination is a central problem in understanding bacterial evolution. Natural populations of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterial agent of Lyme disease, consist of diverse genomic groups co-infecting single individual vertebrate hosts and tick vectors. To understand mechanisms of sympatric genome differentiation in B. burgdorferi, we sequenced and compared 23 genomes representing major genomic groups in North America and Europe. Linkage analysis of >13,500 single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed pervasive horizontal DNA exchanges. Although three times more frequent than point mutation, recombination is localized and weakly affects genome-wide linkage disequilibrium. We show by computer simulations that, while enhancing population fitness, recombination constrains neutral and adaptive divergence among sympatric genomes through periodic selective sweeps. In contrast, simulations of frequency-dependent selection with recombination produced the observed pattern of a large number of sympatric genomic groups associated with major sequence variations at the selected locus. We conclude that negative frequency-dependent selection targeting a small number of surface-antigen loci (ospC in particular) sufficiently explains the maintenance of sympatric genome diversity in B. burgdorferi without adaptive divergence. We suggest that pervasive recombination makes it less likely for local B. burgdorferi genomic groups to achieve host specialization. B. burgdorferi genomic groups in the northeastern United States are thus best viewed as constituting a single bacterial species, whose generalist nature is a key to its rapid spread and human virulence."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease and occurs in mammals including horses. The disease is induced by infection with spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group. Infection of mammalian hosts requires transmission of spirochetes by infected ticks during tick bites. Lyme disease diagnosis is based on clinical signs, possible exposure to infected ticks, and antibody testing which is traditionally performed by ELISA and Western blotting (WB). This report describes the development and validation of a new fluorescent bead-based multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA), OspC and OspF antigens in horse serum. Testing of 562 equine sera was performed blindly and in parallel by using WB and the new multiplex assay. Because a true gold standard is missing for Lyme antibody testing, we performed and compared different statistical approaches to validate the new Lyme multiplex assay. One approach was to use WB results as a 'relative gold standard' in ROC-curve and likelihood-ratio analyses of the new test. Cut-off values and interpretation ranges of the multiplex assay were established by the analysis. The second statistical approach used a Bayesian model for the calculation of diagnostic sensitivities and specificities of the multiplex assay. The Bayesian analysis takes into consideration that no true gold standard exists for detecting antibodies to B. burgdorferi and estimated sensitivities and specificities of both tests that were compared. Therefore, the Bayesian analysis also resulted in an evaluation of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of WB. Overall, the new assay was characterized by low background values and a wide dynamic quantification range for the detection of antibodies to OspA, OspC and OspF antigens of B. burgdorferi. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for the OspA bead-based assay were calculated as 49% and 85%, respectively, and by a standard ROC curve analysis only because the Bayesian model could not be run on this parameter. The Bayesian-derived diagnostic sensitivities of the OspC and OspF assays were 80% and 86%, respectively. For comparison, the Bayesian-derived estimates for WB resulted in sensitivities of 72% for OspC and 80% for OspF. The Bayesian diagnostic specificities of the multiplex assay were 79% and 69% for OspC and OspF, respectively. WB analysis had specificities of 92% for OspC and 77% for OspF. Although the analysis of a new assay in the absence of a true gold standard remains challenging, the approach used here can help to address this problem when new technologies and traditionally used test standards differ significantly in their analytical sensitivities, which consequently causes problems in the calculation of diagnostic sensitivity and sensitivity values for the new assay. In summary, the new multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi OspA, OspC and OspF antigens in horse serum has improved analytical and diagnostic sensitivities compared to WB analysis. Multiplex analysis is a valuable quantitative tool that simultaneously detects antibodies indicative for natural infection with and/or vaccination against the Lyme pathogen."

Vaccinating mouse reservoirs may reduce the prevalence of spirochetal infection due to the powerful vector and reservoir competence-modulating effects of anti-outer surface protein A (OspA) antibody. A delivery system for an oral immunogen would be required for field trials of any candidate vaccine. Accordingly, we tested candidate bait preparations that were designed to be environmentally stable, attractive to mice, and non-nutritive. In addition, we determined whether delivery of such baits within nest boxes could effectively target white-footed mice. A peanut butter-scented bait was preferred by mice over a blueberry-scented one. At a deployment rate of 12.5 nest boxes per hectare, more than half of resident mice ingested a rhodamine-containing bait, as demonstrated by fluorescent staining of their vibrissae. We conclude that a peanut butter-scented hardened bait placed within simple wood nest boxes would effectively deliver vaccine to white-footed mice, thereby providing baseline information critical for designing field trials of a candidate oral vaccine."

In the present study, 153 I. scapularis adults collected from southern Canada were compared genetically using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses in combination with DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. Nineteen haplotypes were detected, 8 of which have not been reported in the U.S.A. One 'new' haplotype was only detected at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, and comprised 38% of the ticks examined for that population. The population in the southeast corner of Manitoba contained 3 'new' haplotypes. Although the most common haplotype (Is-1) was present in all 6 populations of I. scapularis in Canada, there were significant differences in the genetic structure among population. This suggests different geographical origins for the tick populations in Canada, which may be related to the transportation of larval and nymphal ticks by migratory passerines using different flyways.

		"abstract": "In Europe, the Lyme borreliosis (LB) agents like Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), B. afzelii, and B. garinii are maintained in nature by enzoonotic transmission cycles between vertebrate hosts and Ixodes ricinus ticks. The outer surface protein C is a highly antigenic protein expressed by spirochaetes during transmission from ticks to mammals as well as during dissemination in the vertebrate hosts. Previous studies based on analysis of ospC gene sequences have led to the classification of ospC genotypes into ospC groups. The aim of this study was to analyse and compare ospC group distribution among isolates of the rodent-associated genospecies, B. afzelii, at 3 levels (questing ticks, ticks feeding on rodents, and xenodiagnostic ticks). Isolates were obtained during a study carried out in 2 LB endemic areas located on the Swiss Plateau [Portes-Rouges (PR) and Staatswald (SW)], where rodents were differently infested by co-feeding ticks (Pérez et al., unpublished data). Overall, we identified 10 different ospC groups with different distributions among isolates from questing ticks, ticks that detached from rodents, and xenodiagnostic ticks at the 2 sites. We observed a higher ospC diversity among isolates from ticks that fed on rodents at SW, and mixed infections with 2 ospC groups were also more frequent among isolates from ticks that fed on rodents at SW (n=18) than at PR (n=1). At both sites, B. afzelii isolates obtained from larvae that were feeding on the rodents simultaneously with nymphs displayed a higher diversity of ospC groups (mean number of ospC groups: 2.25 for PR and 1.75 for SW) than isolates from larvae feeding without nymphs (mean number of ospC groups: 1.17 for PR and 1 for SW). We suggest that co-feeding transmission of Borrelia, previously described in laboratory models, contributes in nature in promoting and maintaining ospC diversity within local tick populations."

		"abstract": "The periurban forest of Neuchâtel (Switzerland) is a high-risk area for Lyme Borreliosis, due to a high density of infected Ixodes ricinus ticks. In this study, we evaluated the risk of subclinical (seroconversion) and clinical infection after a tick bite in Neuchâtel inhabitants from 2003 to 2005. Inhabitants have been invited, through media, to visit a physician after a tick bite. A questionnaire was filled out and two blood samples were taken at 8-week interval. EIA screening tests for IgM and IgG (IMX system, Abbott) were applied for paired sera. In case of a change in antibody titres between both samples, a homemade Western-blot using Borrelia afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii as antigens was performed. Participants were included into two groups. Group one included asymptomatic participants (n=255). Among them, nine (3.5%) seroconverted with seroconversion rates varying between 6.8% in 2003, 2.1% in 2004 and 2.3% in 2005. Participants who developed clinical symptoms of LB were included into group two (n=14). Erythema migrans (EM) was reported in 5.2% of participants (5.2%), varying between 7.5% in 2003, 5% in 2004 and 3.4% in 2005. Ticks obtained from 186 participants were examined for B. burgdorferi infection by PCR/Reverse Line Blotting, and by Real Time PCR and tick attachment duration was estimated. Among I. ricinus ticks collected from participants, 32.8% were infected by B. burgdorferi sensu lato. B. afzelii predominated among these ticks. Globally, 65.9% of nymphs remained attached for more than 24h whereas only 38.3% of female ticks remained attached for more than 24h. We observed that 6.6% and 2.4% of participants bitten by infected and uninfected ticks, respectively, developed EM."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex is a diverse group of worldwide distributed bacteria that includes 18 named spirochete species and a still not named group proposed as genomospecies 2. Descriptions of new species and variants continue to be recognized, so the current number of described species is probably not final. Most of known spirochete species are considered to have a limited distribution. Eleven species from the B. burgdorferi s.l. complex were identified in and strictly associated with Eurasia (B. afzelii, B. bavariensis, B. garinii, B. japonica, B. lusitaniae, B. sinica, B. spielmanii, B. tanukii, B. turdi, B. valaisiana, and B. yangtze), while another 5 (B. americana, B. andersonii, B. californiensis, B. carolinensis, and B. kurtenbachii) were previously believed to be restricted to the USA only. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), B. bissettii, and B. carolinensis share the distinction of being present in both the Old and the New World. Out of the 18 genospecies, 3 commonly and 4 occasionally infect humans, causing Lyme borreliosis (LB) - a multisystem disease that is often referred to as the 'great imitator' due to diversity of its clinical manifestations. Among the genospecies that commonly infect people, i.e. B. burgdorferi s.s., B. afzelii, and B. garinii, only B. burgdorferi s.s. causes LB both in the USA and in Europe, with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions ranging from minor cutaneous erythema migrans (EM) to severe arthritis or neurological manifestations. The epidemiological data from many European countries and the USA show a dramatic increase of the diagnosed cases of LB due to the development of new progressive diagnostic methods during the last decades (Hubálek, 2009). Recently, the definition of the disease has also changed. What was not considered Lyme borreliosis before might be now."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most disseminated tick-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere, and infestation with ticks is one of the essential factors influencing transmission of the disease to humans. This work intends to compare the occurrence of borrelia circulating in indigenous ticks and in patients suffering from neurological diseases. The total of 660 nymphs and 567 adult ticks from the Bratislava and Košice areas was examined over the years 2001-2004, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 82 neurological patients suffering from suspected Lyme borreliosis infection was investigated in the 2007-2009 period, using the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR). PCR investigation proved presence of borrelia in 23.3% of the total 1227 ticks; of these, co-infection was found in 2.7% of all ticks. Borrelia garinii (9.9%) and B. valaisaina (9.2%) were the prevalent types. PCR investigation of the CSF samples of 32 patients with clinically diagnosed Lyme borreliosis showed the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in 17 cases. Positive results were found also in patients with unclear or different diagnoses. In cases where the genospecies could be identified, B. garinii was most frequently found (8x), followed with B. burgdorferi s.s. (4×) and B. afzelii (3×). The high infestation level of ticks with borrelia, mainly with B. garinii which is the most-often documented borrelia species identified in neurological patients, is indicative of a high risk of this contamination in Slovakia. B. garinii were found also in our neuroborreliosis patients, whereas their proof in the CSF of patients with suspected neuroborreliosis or with a different clinical diagnosis pointed upon their persistence after an infectious experience. However, knowledge of not only the genospecies but also of the genotypes capable of eliciting an invasive disorder would be necessary for better clarification of the relationship between borrelia and their peccant capacity. Identification of the invasive borrelia types circulating in nature, and clarification of the vector vs. human infection incidence relationship is of importance from the aspect of detailed knowledge of the epidemiology of this disease."

Similar to other antiscience groups, these advocates have created a pseudoscientific and alternative selection of practitioners, research, and publications and have coordinated public protests, accused opponents of both corruption and conspiracy, and spurred legislative efforts to subvert evidence-based medicine and peer-reviewed science.

In acute LNB and the rare chronic state of infection, patients can experience cognitive deficits such as attention and memory disturbances. During LNB, single compounds of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato are released into the subarachnoid space.To investigate the pathogenesis of neurologic dysfunction in LNB, we determined that the outer surface protein C (OspC), a major virulence factor of B. burgdorferi, stimulated mouse microglial cells in a dose-dependent manner to release nitric oxide (EC50 = 0.24 mg/L) in vitro. To mimic pathophysiologic conditions of long-term release of this bacterial component in vivo, we treated C57BL/6 mice with recombinant OspC from Borrelia garinii or buffer by intraventricular infusion and tested them for behavioral deficits. After 4weeks, brains were examined by routine histology and immunohistochemistry. Assessment of spatial learning and memory of treated mice during OspC exposure did not reveal significant differences from controls. Continuous exposure to intrathecal B. burgdorferi OspC led to activation of microglia and axonal damage without demonstrable cognitive impairment in experimental mice. These results suggest that long-term intrathecal exposure to OspC resulted in axonal damage that may underlie the neurologic manifestations in chronic LNB."

A single EIA using the C6 peptide of the Borrelia burgdorferi variable-major protein-like sequence expressed lipoprotein provides similar or better sensitivity but less specificity, compared with standard 2-tiered testing. Here, we investigated an alternative 2-tiered strategy, in which the first step remained a WCS EIA, but immunoblotting was replaced by a C6 EIA. We determined the sensitivity of the 3 testing strategies with use of 91 serum samples from research study patients with LD and 78 serum samples from patients with LD whose samples were submitted to our hospital's clinical laboratory. Specificity was measured using 54 patients with other illnesses and 1246 healthy subjects from areas where the infection is endemic and nonendemic. The 2-EIA algorithm in early LD had similar sensitivity as C6 testing alone, and both strategies had better sensitivity than did standard 2-tiered testing (61% and 64%, respectively, vs 48%; P = .03 and P = .008). For late disease, all 3 strategies had 100% sensitivity. The specificity of the 2-EIA algorithm was equal to that of standard 2-tiered testing, and both 2-tiered strategies were more specific than C6 testing alone (for both, 99.5% vs 98.4%; P = .01). The positive predictive value of the 2-EIA algorithm was 70%, compared with 66% for standard 2-tiered testing and 43% for the C6 EIA alone. The 2-EIA strategy matched the individual strengths of the C6 EIA and Western blotting, without the drawbacks. The 2 EIAs provided sensitivity comparable to that of the C6 EIA but maintained the specificity of standard 2-tiered testing."

		"abstract": "We have observed a number of patients who fail to develop coccidioidal complement fixing (CF) antibody (immunoglobulin [IgG]) after the initiation of early antifungal therapy. Although this is the first description of this phenomenon in mycology, a precedent for the abrogation of the immune response has been observed in other conditions, including primary syphilis and primary Lyme disease. We conducted a retrospective case-control study to determine any patient-specific risk factors associated with this observation. Additionally, in vitro analysis of the coccidioidal CF (IgG) antigen (Cts1) was performed after Coccidioides was grown under escalating fluconazole concentrations. Seventeen patients persistently positive for coccidioidal IgM antibodies without developing an IgG response (cases) were compared with 64 consecutive patients who did develop coccidioidal CF (IgG) antibodies (controls). Early treatment with antifungals (within 2 weeks of symptom onset) was associated with an abrogation of IgG antibody production (P < .001). With immunodiffusion testing, control serum demonstrated a lack of IgG seroreactivity when Coccidioides posadasii grown in the presence of escalating fluconazole doses (0.5-128 μg/mL) was used as the antigen; however, control serum remained seroreactive for the presence of IgM. The coccidioidal IgG antigen (Cts1) was shown to be diminished when cultures were grown in the presence of fluconazole, lending further in vitro plausibility to our findings. The abrogation of an IgG response in patients treated early in the course of coccidioidal infection may complicate serodiagnosis and epidemiologic studies, and further study to determine the potential clinical implications should be performed."

		"abstract": "Millions of Lyme disease vector ticks are dispersed annually by songbirds across Canada, but often overlooked as the source of infection. For clarity on vector distribution, we sampled 481 ticks (12 species and 3 undetermined ticks) from 211 songbirds (42 species/subspecies) nationwide. Using PCR, 52 (29.5%) of 176 Ixodes ticks tested were positive for the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Immature blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis , collected from infested songbirds had a B. burgdorferi infection prevalence of 36% (larvae, 48%; nymphs, 31%). Notably, Ixodes affinis is reported in Canada for the first time and, similarly, Ixodes auritulus for the initial time in the Yukon. Firsts for bird-parasitizing ticks include I. scapularis in Quebec and Saskatchewan. We provide the first records of 3 tick species cofeeding on passerines (song sparrow, Swainson's thrush). New host records reveal I. scapularis on the blackpoll warbler and Nashville warbler. We furnish the following first Canadian reports of B. burgdorferi-positive ticks: I. scapularis on chipping sparrow, house wren, indigo bunting; I. auritulus on Bewick's wren; and I. spinipalpis on a Bewick's wren and song sparrow. First records of B. burgdorferi-infected ticks on songbirds include the following: the rabbit-associated tick, Ixodes dentatus, in western Canada; I. scapularis in Quebec, Saskatchewan, northern New Brunswick, northern Ontario; and Ixodes spinipalpis (collected in British Columbia). The presence of B. burgdorferi in Ixodes larvae suggests reservoir competency in 9 passerines (Bewick's wren, common yellowthroat, dark-eyed junco, Oregon junco, red-winged blackbird, song sparrow, Swainson's thrush, swamp sparrow, and white-throated sparrow). We report transstadial transmission (larva to nymph) of B. burgdorferi in I. auritulus. Data suggest a possible 4-tick, i.e., I. angustus, I. auritulus, I. pacificus, and I. spinipalpis, enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. Our results suggest that songbirds infested with B. burgdorferi-infected ticks have the potential to start new tick populations endemic for Lyme disease. Because songbirds disperse B. burgdorferi-infected ticks outside their anticipated range, health-care providers are advised that people can contract Lyme disease locally without any history of travel."

Infection, if untreated, results in dissemination to multiple tissues and significant morbidity. Recent developments in bioluminescence technology allow in vivo imaging and quantification of pathogenic organisms during infection. Herein, luciferase-expressing B. burgdorferi and strains lacking the decorin adhesins DbpA and DbpB, as well as the fibronectin adhesin BBK32, were quantified by bioluminescent imaging to further evaluate their pathogenic potential in infected mice. Quantification of bacterial load was verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and cultivation. B. burgdorferi lacking DbpA and DbpB were only seen at the 1 h time point post infection, consistent with its low infectivity phenotype. The bbk32 mutant exhibited a significant decrease in its infectious load at day 7 relative to its parent. This effect was most pronounced at lower inocula and imaging correlated well with qPCR data. These data suggest that BBK32-mediated binding plays an important role in B. burgdorferi colonization. As such, in vivo imaging of bioluminescent Borrelia provides a sensitive means to detect, quantify and temporally characterize borrelial dissemination in a non-invasive, physiologically relevant environment and, more importantly, demonstrated a quantifiable infectivity defect for the bbk32 mutant."

When in regions with overlapping TBE virus and Borrelia endemicity, a tick bite causes the victim to become ill, it is important that appropriate serological and other laboratory investigations form part of the differential diagnosis. Account must always be taken of the fact that a tick bite may be followed by a double infection with the TBE virus and Borrelia. For this reason, a comprehensive diagnostic work-up aimed at detecting co-infection by both pathogens, even when the tick bite occurs in an endemic region for both pathogens but the initial clinical symptoms suggest an infection with only one of the two pathogens. The present article discusses a number of published cases of a co-infection with TBE virus and Borrelia and other potential multiple infections."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) is an important vector of emerging human pathogens. It has three blood-feeding stages, as follows: larva, nymph, and adult. Owing to inefficient transovarial transmission, at least for the Lyme disease agent (Borrelia burgdorferi), larval ticks rarely hatch infected, but they can acquire infection during their larval blood meal. Nymphal ticks are primarily responsible for transmitting pathogens to hosts, including humans. The transition from uninfected host-seeking larva to infectious host-seeking nymph is therefore a key aspect of human risk of infection. It can be divided into a series of steps, as follows: finding a host, taking a blood meal, becoming infected, molting, and overwintering. The chance of succeeding in each of these steps may depend on the species identity of the blood meal host. We used a Bayesian method to estimate the molting success of larval I. scapularis collected from four commonly parasitized species of birds and eight commonly parasitized small and mid-sized mammals found in the forests of Dutchess County, New York. We show that molting success varies substantially among host species; white-footed mice, veeries, and gray catbirds support particularly high molting success, whereas ticks feeding on short-tailed shrews, robins, and wood thrushes were less successful. We also show that larval molting success varies substantially between individual blood meal hosts, and that this intraspecific variability is much higher in some species than in others. The causes of both inter- and intraspecific variation in molting success remain to be determined."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi is primarily transmitted to vertebrates by Ixodes ticks. The classical and alternative complement pathways are important in Borrelia eradication by the vertebrate host. We recently identified a tick salivary protein, designated P8, which reduced complement-mediated killing of Borrelia. We now discover that P8 interferes with the human lectin complement cascade, resulting in impaired neutrophil phagocytosis and chemotaxis and diminished Borrelia lysis. Therefore, P8 was renamed the tick salivary lectin pathway inhibitor (TSLPI). TSLPI-silenced ticks, or ticks exposed to TSLPI-immune mice, were hampered in Borrelia transmission. Moreover, Borrelia acquisition and persistence in tick midguts was impaired in ticks feeding on TSLPI-immunized, B. burgdorferi-infected mice. Together, our findings suggest an essential role for the lectin complement cascade in Borrelia eradication and demonstrate how a vector-borne pathogen co-opts a vector protein to facilitate early mammalian infection and vector colonization."

The number of spirochetes in the blood of infected patients, however, has not been determined, and, therefore, it is unknown whether the number of spirochetes can be correlated with particular clinical or laboratory features. This study was designed to measure the level of Borrelia burgdorferi in the plasma of Lyme disease patients and correlate these levels with selected clinical and laboratory findings. Nested and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was employed to detect cell-associated flaB gene DNA in the plasma of untreated early Lyme disease patients with erythema migrans (EM). Twenty-nine (45.3%) of 64 patients had evidence of B. burgdorferi in their plasma by at least one of the PCR methods. For the 22 qPCR-positive patients, the mean number of flaB gene copies per mL of plasma was 4,660, with a range of 414 to 56,000. The number of flaB gene copies did not significantly correlate with any of the clinical, demographic, or laboratory variables assessed. For reasons discussed, we suggest caution in extrapolating an estimate of the number of viable Borrelia in plasma from the observed number of flaB copies."

The goal of this study was to determine if Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), a microorganism responsible for Lyme disease, is involved in the etiology of AAAs. The presence of serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi sl was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and confirmed by Western blotting in 96 AAA and 108 peripheral artery disease (PAD) patients. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of Borrelia-specific DNA in the aneurysm wall. Among AAA patients 34% and among PAD patients 16% were seropositive for B. burgdorferi sl antibodies (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.003; odds ratio [OR] 2.79; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37-5.85). In the German general population, 3-17% are seropositive for Borrelia antibodies. No Borrelia DNA was detected in the aneurysm wall. Our findings suggest a relationship between AAAs and B. burgdorferi sl. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism for B. burgdorferi sl in AAA formation is similar to that by the spirochete Treponema pallidum; alternatively, AAAs could develop due to induced autoimmunity via molecular mimicry due to similarities between some of the B. burgdorferi sl proteins and aortic proteins."

		"abstract": "Ecologists worldwide are challenged to contribute solutions to urgent and pressing environmental problems by forecasting how populations, communities, and ecosystems will respond to global change. Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool."

Although the importance of biodiversity to ecology and conservation biology is obvious, such measures have not been applied to strains of an invasive bacterium found in human tissues during infection. In this study, we compared the strain biodiversity of Borrelia burgdorferi found in tick populations with that found in skin, blood, synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid of Lyme disease patients. The biodiversity of B. burgdorferi strains is significantly greater in tick populations than in the skin of patients with erythema migrans. In turn, strains from skin are significantly more diverse than strains at any of the disseminated sites. The cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurologic Lyme disease harbored the least pathogen biodiversity. These results suggest that human tissues act as niches that can allow entry to or maintain only a subset of the total pathogen population. These data help to explain prior clinical observations on the natural history of B. burgdorferi infection and raise several questions that may help to direct future research to better understand the pathogenesis of this infection."

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the spatial distribution of seroprevalence for 4 vector-borne pathogens, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Dirofilaria immitis, across the 3 western coastal states of the contiguous United States that extend from the northern Mexican to the southern Canadian border. A convenience sample, targeting blood from 20 pet dogs per county across CA, OR, and WA, was evaluated using a canine point-of-care ELISA kit. Geographic coordinates of home zip code were displayed using a geographic information system. A total of 2431 dogs from CA, OR, and WA were tested. The overall seroprevalence was highest for A. phagocytophilum (2.4%), followed by B. burgdorferi (1.2%), and E. canis (0.7%). The prevalence of infection with D. immitis was 0.7%. At the individual dog level, there was a significant association between seropositivity to B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum (odds ratio=18.7, 95% confidence interval=6.8-47.1). For most positive results, prevalence tended to decrease with increasing latitude; thus, the highest rates of seropositivity occurred in CA, followed by OR, and then WA; one exception was seropositivity for B. burgdorferi, which was higher in WA (0.38%) than in OR (0.15%), but considerably lower than in CA (2.00%). In WA, dogs that tested positive for A. phagocytophilum, E. canis, and B. burgdorferi were in the southern Puget Sound area. For D. immitis, none of the dogs in WA was positive. Seropositivity for vector-borne pathogens is broadly but patchily distributed in dogs in CA, OR, and WA."

To investigate the role of IFNγ in the development of Lyme carditis, wild-type and IFNγ-deficient C57BL/6 mice were infected with the causative bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi. Histological analysis revealed no change in the severity of carditis between wild-type and IFNγ-deficient mice at 14, 21, 25, and 28 days after infection. However, a distinct shift in the types of leukocytes within the hearts of IFNγ-deficient mice was observed at 25 days. In the absence of IFNγ, the number of neutrophils in the heart was increased, whereas the number of T lymphocytes was decreased. Bacterial loads within hearts were the same as in wild-type mice. Macrophages secrete chemokines that recruit immune cells, which could contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes in murine Lyme carditis. The ability of IFNγ and B. burgdorferi to activate murine macrophages was examined, and the two stimuli synergistically induced chemoattractants for mononuclear cells (ie, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL16, and CCL12) and decreased those for neutrophils (ie, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3). IFNγ and B. burgdorferi also synergistically enhanced secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10 by murine cardiac endothelial cells. These results indicate that IFNγ influences the composition of inflammatory infiltrates in Lyme carditis by promoting the accumulation of leukocytes associated with chronic inflammation and suppressing that of cells that typify acute inflammation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a major human health problem which continues to increase in incidence and geographic distribution. As a vector-borne zoonotic disease, Lyme disease may be amenable to reservoir targeted strategies for control. We have previously reported that a vaccinia virus (VV) based vaccine expressing outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, protects inbred strains of laboratory mice against infection by feeding ticks and clears the ticks of infection when administered by gavage. Here we extend these studies to develop an effective bait formulation for delivery of the VV based vaccine and test its characteristics under simulated environmental conditions. We show that this vaccine is efficacious in decreasing acquisition of B. burgdorferi by uninfected larval ticks as well as in decreasing transmission from infected ticks to its natural reservoir, Peromyscus leucopus, when fed to mice in oral baits. Using live, in vivo imaging techniques, we describe the distribution of vaccinia virus infection after ingestion of the baited vaccines and establish the use of in vivo imaging technology for optimization of bait delivery. In summary, a VV based OspA vaccine is stable in an oral bait preparation and provides protection against infection for both the natural reservoir and the tick vector of Lyme disease."

The ability to survive in these two disparate environments requires up and downregulation of specific genes by regulatory circuits that remain largely obscure. In this work on the Lyme spirochete, B. burgdorferi, we show that a disruption of the hrpA gene, which encodes a putative RNA helicase, results in a complete loss in the ability of the spirochetes to infect mice by needle inoculation. Studies of protein expression in culture by 2D gels revealed a change in the expression of 33 proteins in hrpA clones relative to the wild-type parent. Quantitative characterization of protein expression by iTRAQ analysis revealed a total of 187 differentially regulated proteins in an hrpA background: 90 downregulated and 97 upregulated. Forty-two of the 90 downregulated and 65 of the 97 upregulated proteins are not regulated under any conditions by the previously reported regulators in B. burgdorferi (bosR, rrp2, rpoN, rpoS or rrp1). Downregulated and upregulated proteins also fell into distinct functional categories. We conclude that HrpA is part of a new and distinct global regulatory pathway in B. burgdorferi gene expression. Because an HrpA orthologue is present in many bacteria, its participation in global regulation in B. burgdorferi may have relevance in other bacterial species where its function remains obscure. We believe this to be the first report of a role for an RNA helicase in a global regulatory pathway in bacteria. This finding is particularly timely with the recent growth of the field of RNA regulation of gene expression and the ability of RNA helicases to modulate RNA structure and function."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by a spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi ZS7. This spirochete is most often spread by ticks. Single antibiotic therapy is sufficient for containment of the early stage progression of the disease but combinational therapy is more preferred in later stages. Research is in progress for the development of drugs against the pathogen, but till date no vaccines have been developed to effect the late stage infections. There is a rapid rise in the cases of antibiotic-resistant population which is more than 10% of the total infected individuals. In such condition vaccine becomes the sole alternative for prevention. Therefore effective treatment includes antibiotic combination and combination of antigenic surfaces (for vaccine preparation). Thus, a comprehensive list of drug targets unique to the microorganisms is often necessary. Availability of Borrelia burgdorferi ZS7 proteome has enabled insilico analysis of protein sequences for the identification of drug targets and vaccine targets. In this study, 272 essential proteins were identified out of which 42 proteins were unique to the microorganism. The study identified 15 membrane localized drug targets. Amongst these 15, molecular modeling and structure validation of the five membrane localized drug target proteins could only be achieved because of the low sequence identity of the remaining proteins with RCSB structures. These 3D structures can be further characterized by invitro and invivo studies for the development of novel vaccine epitopes and novel antibiotic therapy against Borrelia burgdorferi."

This is exacerbated by the lack of a clinical or microbiologic definition, and the commonality of chronic symptoms in the general population. An accumulating body of evidence suggests that Lyme disease is the appropriate diagnosis for only a minority of patients in whom it is suspected. In prospective studies of Lyme disease, very few patients go on to have a chronic syndrome dominated by subjective complaints. There is no systematic evidence that Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiology of Lyme disease, can be identified in patients with chronic symptoms following treated Lyme disease. Multiple prospective trials have revealed that prolonged courses of antibiotics neither prevent nor alleviate such post-Lyme syndromes. Extended courses of intravenous antibiotics have resulted in severe adverse events, which in light of their lack of efficacy, make them contraindicated."

The molecular mechanisms utilized to effect these lifestyle changes have begun to be elucidated and feature an alternative sigma factor cascade in which RpoN (σ(54)) and RpoS (σ(S)) globally control the genes required for the different phases of the enzootic cycle. The RpoN-RpoS pathway is surprisingly complex, entailing Rrp2, an unusual enhancer-binding protein and two-component regulatory system response regulator activated by acetyl phosphate; BosR, an unorthodox DNA-binding protein; DsrA(Bb), a small noncoding RNA; and Hfq and CsrA, two RNA-binding proteins.

Although OspC is an essential virulence factor needed by the spirochete to establish infection in the mammal, it represents a potent target for the host acquired immune response, and constitutive expression of OspC results in spirochete clearance. In this study, we demonstrate that a factor encoded on a linear plasmid of B. burgdorferi, lp17, can negatively regulate ospC transcription from the endogenous gene on the circular plasmid cp26 and from an ospC promoter-lacZ fusion on a shuttle vector. Furthermore, we have identified bbd18 as the gene on lp17 that is responsible for this effect. These data identify a novel component of ospC regulation and provide the basis for determining the molecular mechanisms of ospC repression in vivo."

In the case of active infection the dosage, duration, drug, and method of administration of antibiotics should be determined by the state of the infection and history of prior therapy, according to the established and validated recommendations of the Infectious Disease Society of America. Many patients have musculoskeletal complaints not attributable to active infection; some patients have residual complaints following a documented infection that has been adequately treated with antibiotics previously, and others never had true B. burgdorferi infection in the first place. For such patients, antibiotics are not warranted and in fact may be physically and emotionally harmful. Complaints following an episode of Lyme disease are not necessarily due to ongoing infection, especially adequately treated. Consideration of other diagnoses may suggest use of other effective modalities, including physical therapy and emotional support. Appropriate ordering and interpretation of the various validated seroconfirmatory tests available to study B. burgdorferi infection are critical, as these tests are often misapplied and misconstrued in pursuit of strategies aimed at eliminating patients' suffering. Although seronegative Lyme disease has been reported, seronegativity in a reputable laboratory makes the likelihood of Lyme arthritis very low. On the other hand, a positive result from certain unvalidated laboratories or novel assays proves nothing and should not be viewed as substantiating the diagnosis."

		"abstract": "The conversion of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid by nicotinamidase enzymes is a critical step in maintaining NAD(+) homeostasis and contributes to numerous important biological processes in diverse organisms. In Borrelia burgdorferi, the nicotinamidase enzyme, PncA, is required for spirochaete survival throughout the infectious cycle. Mammals lack nicotinamidases and therefore PncA may serve as a therapeutic target for Lyme disease. Contrary to the in vivo importance of PncA, the current annotation for the pncA ORF suggests that the encoded protein may be inactive due to the absence of an N-terminal aspartic acid residue that is a conserved member of the catalytic triad of characterized PncA proteins. Herein, we have used genetic and biochemical strategies to determine the N-terminal sequence of B. burgdorferi PncA. Our data demonstrate that the PncA protein is 24 aa longer than the currently annotated sequence and that pncA translation is initiated from the rare, non-canonical initiation codon AUU. These findings are an important first step in understanding the catalytic function of this in vivo-essential protein."

Epitope mapping was carried out using microarrays that contained synthesized overlapping peptides covering the full sequence of VlsE from B. burgdorferi B31. In addition to the previously characterized IR6 region in the variable domain, specific sequences in the N- and C-terminal invariable domains of VlsE were found to be major B cell epitopes in affected patients. The crystal structure of VlsE indicated that the newly described epitopes form a contiguous region in the surface-exposed membrane-proximal part of the monomeric form of the protein."

Serial serological tests demonstrated that the ticks successfully infected 8/8 control dogs with B. burgdorferi and co-infected 6/8 with A. phagocytophilum. B. burgdorferi infection also was confirmed in most control dogs by culture (6/8) and PCR (7/8) of skin biopsies. In contrast, CERTIFECT protected all 24 treated dogs against infection by both B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, as demonstrated by their negative serological tests throughout the study and the absence of any positive skin biopsy culture or PCR in these dogs."

		"abstract": "Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi is common in horses and ponies from the New England and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Here, we evaluated luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) for profiling antibody responses against three different antigenic targets for the diagnosis of equine B. burgdorferi infection. LIPS testing of horse serum samples suspected of Lyme infection revealed that approximately 75% of the horse samples (114/159) were seropositive against the synthetic VOVO antigen, comprising repeated immunodominant C6 epitopes as well as OspC immunodominant epitopes. A comparison of VOVO and immunofluorescence assays (IFA) showed that 51% of the samples were positive in both assays (VOVO(+)/IFA(+)), 13% were VOVO(-)/IFA(+), 21% were VOVO(+)/IFA(-), and 15% were negative in both. To further understand humoral responses to B. burgdorferi and reconcile the diagnostic differences between IFA and VOVO, two additional B. burgdorferi LIPS tests were performed with DbpA and DbpB. Robust seropositive antibody responses against DbpA and/or DbpB were detected in 98% (79/81) of the VOVO(+)/IFA(+) and 93% (50/54) of the discrepant samples. Additionally, some of the samples negative by both VOVO and IFA showed immunoreactivity against DbpA and/or DbpB. Overall, 94% of the suspected horse samples were seropositive by LIPS, and heat map analysis revealed that seropositive samples often were immunoreactive with at least two of the three antigens. These results suggest that LIPS tests employing multiple recombinant antigens offer a promising approach for the evaluation of antibody responses in Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "In Sweden, the geographical distribution of Lyme borreliosis corresponds to that of its vector Ixodes ricinus. Both tick activity and the length of the vegetation period are determined by daily mean temperatures ≥5°C. We analysed the correspondence between the distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden, the start date, end date, and length of the vegetation period, and the distributions of tick habitat-associated plant species. The geographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden corresponds to a vegetation period averaging approximately 170 days, an early start (before May 1st) of spring, and to the distribution of black alder (Alnus glutinosa). Based on scenario models for these parameters, changes in the range and abundance of I. ricinus were projected for the periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. We conclude that climate change during this century will probably increase the geographic range of I. ricinus as vegetation communities and mammals associated with high tick densities will increase their geographic ranges due to a markedly prolonged vegetation period. By the end of this century, the ranges of I. ricinus and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato may, in suitable habitats, encompass most of Sweden, Norway, and Finland as far as 70°N, except the mountainous regions. This will lead to an increased Lyme borreliosis risk in northern Scandinavia."

Approximately 25% of questing nymphs in endemic regions are infected with spirochetes. High throughput-sensitive and specific methods for testing nymphal I. scapularis for infection with B. burgdorferi are clearly needed. In the current study, we evaluated whether low-density microarrays could be adapted for the rapid and accurate detection and characterization of spirochetes in nymphal I. scapularis. Three different microarray platforms were developed and tested for the detection of spirochetes in ticks. They could both detect and differentiate different Borrelia genospecies, in one case detecting as few as a single copy of Borrelia DNA."

C3 knockout mice (C3-/-) and syngeneic C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) mice were challenged with 5 different Borrelia species. After 2 weeks, quantitative PCR (qPCR), culture, histopathology, and immunofluorescence were performed on heart, joint, brain, bladder, and skin.

In joints of C3-/-, but not WT mice challenged with B. burgdorferi, spirochaetes were detected by qPCR. No other significant differences between C3-/- and WT mice were seen. Histopathology demonstrated concordance between borrelia load and inflammation score. Only after B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii infection, spirochaetes were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. B. burgdorferi was cultured from heart, joint, bladder, and skin from all mice within 2 weeks. B. afzelii and B. bavariensis grew only from heart tissue from both C3-/- and WT mice after 2-6 weeks. The infectivity and pathogenicity of complement-resistant Borrelia strains is unchanged in complement-deficient mice. Complement-susceptible strains do not become infectious in the absence of C3."

We previously observed that γδ T cells in vitro are activated by Borrelia burgdorferi in a TLR2-dependent manner. We now observe that the activated γδ T cells can in turn stimulate dendritic cells in vitro to produce cytokines and chemokines that are important for the adaptive immune response. This suggested that in vivo γδ T cells may assist in activating the adaptive immune response. We examined this possibility in vivo and observed that γδ T cells are activated and expand in number during Borrelia infection, and this was reduced in the absence of TLR2. Furthermore, in the absence of γδ T cells, there was a significantly blunted response of adaptive immunity, as reflected in reduced expansion of T and B cells and reduced serum levels of anti-Borrelia antibodies, cytokines, and chemokines. This paralleled a greater Borrelia burden in γδ-deficient mice as well as more cardiac inflammation. These findings are consistent with a model of γδ T cells functioning to promote the adaptive immune response during infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Although antibiotic therapy is usually effective early in the disease, relapse may occur when administration of antibiotics is discontinued. Studies have suggested that resistance and recurrence of Lyme disease might be due to formation of different morphological forms of B. burgdorferi, namely round bodies (cysts) and biofilm-like colonies. Better understanding of the effect of antibiotics on all morphological forms of B. burgdorferi is therefore crucial to provide effective therapy for Lyme disease. Three morphological forms of B. burgdorferi (spirochetes, round bodies, and biofilm-like colonies) were generated using novel culture methods. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of five antimicrobial agents (doxycycline, amoxicillin, tigecycline, metronidazole, and tinidazole) against spirochetal forms of B. burgdorferi were evaluated using the standard published microdilution technique. The susceptibility of spirochetal and round body forms to the antibiotics was then tested using fluorescent microscopy (BacLight™ viability staining) and dark field microscopy (direct cell counting), and these results were compared with the microdilution technique. Qualitative and quantitative effects of the antibiotics against biofilm-like colonies were assessed using fluorescent microscopy and dark field microscopy, respectively. Doxycycline reduced spirochetal structures ∼90% but increased the number of round body forms about twofold. Amoxicillin reduced spirochetal forms by ∼85%-90% and round body forms by ∼68%, while treatment with metronidazole led to reduction of spirochetal structures by ∼90% and round body forms by ∼80%. Tigecycline and tinidazole treatment reduced both spirochetal and round body forms by ∼80%-90%. When quantitative effects on biofilm-like colonies were evaluated, the five antibiotics reduced formation of these colonies by only 30%-55%. In terms of qualitative effects, only tinidazole reduced viable organisms by ∼90%. Following treatment with the other antibiotics, viable organisms were detected in 70%-85% of the biofilm-like colonies. Antibiotics have varying effects on the different morphological forms of B. burgdorferi. Persistence of viable organisms in round body forms and biofilm-like colonies may explain treatment failure and persistent symptoms following antibiotic therapy of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, is a vector-borne pathogen that cycles between a mammalian host and tick vector. This complex life cycle requires that the spirochete modulate its gene expression program to facilitate growth and maintenance in these diverse milieus. B. burgdorferi contains an operon that is predicted to encode proteins that would mediate the uptake and conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Previous studies indicated that expression of the operon is elevated at 23°C and is repressed in the presence of the alternative sigma factor RpoS, suggesting that glycerol utilization may play an important role during the tick phase. This possibility was further explored in the current study by expression analysis and mutagenesis of glpD, a gene predicted to encode glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Transcript levels for glpD were significantly lower in mouse joints relative to their levels in ticks. Expression of GlpD protein was repressed in an RpoS-dependent manner during growth of spirochetes within dialysis membrane chambers implanted in rat peritoneal cavities. In medium supplemented with glycerol as the principal carbohydrate, wild-type B. burgdorferi grew to a significantly higher cell density than glpD mutant spirochetes during growth in vitro at 25°C. glpD mutant spirochetes were fully infectious in mice by either needle or tick inoculation. In contrast, glpD mutants grew to significantly lower densities than wild-type B. burgdorferi in nymphal ticks and displayed a replication defect in feeding nymphs. The findings suggest that B. burgdorferi undergoes a switch in carbohydrate utilization during the mammal to tick transition. Further, the results demonstrate that the ability to utilize glycerol as a carbohydrate source for glycolysis during the tick phase of the infectious cycle is critical for maximal B. burgdorferi fitness."

In a second case, a 40-year-old male, with a previously known microscopic hematuria, presented with rash, arthralgias, new proteinuria and gross hematuria following a tick bite. Biopsy revealed focal proliferative IgA nephropathy. Treatment with steroids and antibiotics resulted in rapid resolution of findings. Acute Lyme disease may contribute to the development of de novo, or activation of previously quiescent, immune-mediated glomerular disease."

Similar symptoms of many infections, including parasitic diseases, can limit the range of applied diagnostic and certification procedures only to diseases induced by pathogenic agents or exposures occurring in the occupational environment. In some cases this makes difficult or even impossible to explain a real cause of patients' complaints. We present a case report on the patient with suspected occupational borreliosis. Due to many diagnostic doubts during hospitalization, including long term presence of some clinical manifestations reported by the patient, which could occur in the course of borreliosis and also suggest earlier infection by trichinae, a wider span of specialist examinations was applied. Finally, the invasion of trichinae was diagnosed and later confirmed by serologic tests."

		"abstract": "Cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) is a bacterial second messenger that modulates many biological processes. Although its role in bacterial pathogenesis during mammalian infection has been documented, the role of c-di-GMP in a pathogen's life cycle within a vector host is less understood. The enzootic cycle of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi involves both a mammalian host and an Ixodes tick vector. The B. burgdorferi genome encodes a single copy of the diguanylate cyclase gene (rrp1), which is responsible for c-di-GMP synthesis. To determine the role of c-di-GMP in the life cycle of B. burgdorferi, an Rrp1-deficient B. burgdorferi strain was generated. The rrp1 mutant remains infectious in the mammalian host but cannot survive in the tick vector. Microarray analyses revealed that expression of a four-gene operon involved in glycerol transport and metabolism, bb0240-bb0243, was significantly downregulated by abrogation of Rrp1. In vitro, the rrp1 mutant is impaired in growth in the media containing glycerol as the carbon source (BSK-glycerol). To determine the contribution of the glycerol metabolic pathway to the rrp1 mutant phenotype, a glp mutant, in which the entire bb0240-bb0243 operon is not expressed, was generated. Similar to the rrp1 mutant, the glp mutant has a growth defect in BSK-glycerol medium. In vivo, the glp mutant is also infectious in mice but has reduced survival in ticks. Constitutive expression of the bb0240-bb0243 operon in the rrp1 mutant fully rescues the growth defect in BSK-glycerol medium and partially restores survival of the rrp1 mutant in ticks. Thus, c-di-GMP appears to govern a catabolic switch in B. burgdorferi and plays a vital role in the tick part of the spirochetal enzootic cycle. This work provides the first evidence that c-di-GMP is essential for a pathogen's survival in its vector host."

The purposes of this retrospective case report are: (1) to present an example of a therapeutic intervention for a pediatric patient in the late stages of Lyme disease with related musculoskeletal dysfunction and severely impaired quality of life, (2) to report the patient's functional outcomes from treatment, and (3) to discuss implications for treatment of patients with musculoskeletal dysfunction in the late stages of Lyme disease. The patient was a 14-year old girl who had contracted Lyme disease 1 year prior to initiation of physical therapy. She was unable to participate with her peers in school, church, and sporting events due to significant impairments in strength (force-generating capacity), endurance, and gait; fatigue; pain; and total body tremor. Therapeutic exercise and gait training were used for treatment. The patient actively participated in managing her care by providing feedback during interventions and setting goals. After 18 weeks of treatment, the patient achieved 96.7% of her predicted distance on the Six-Minute Walk Test with normal gait mechanics and returned to playing high school sports. She had a manual muscle test grade of 4/5 or greater in major extremity muscle groups. She returned to school and church participation with minimal total body tremor when fatigued and daily pain rated 0 to 3/10. Therapeutic exercise and gait training may facilitate return to function in an adolescent patient with late effects of Lyme disease. Further investigation is advised to establish treatment effects in a broader population."

Two hundred seventy-seven small mammals were trapped in South-Eastern Hungary during 2009. Tissue samples and a total of 831 ectoparasites (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes acuminatus, Haemaphysalis concinna, Ctenophtalmus assimilis, and Nosopsyllus fasciatus) were collected from small mammals. One thousand one hundred and six I. ricinus and 476 H. concinna were collected from the vegetation during the investigation. Neither A. phagocytophilum nor B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in any of the mammal tissue samples. A. phagocytophilum was not found in ticks collected from small mammals. Very low minimum prevalence was found for all pathogens (0.62% for Borrelia afzelii in ticks collected from small mammals, and 0.57%, 0.06%, and 0.19% for A. phagoctyophilum, B. afzelii, and Borrelia garinii, respectively, in questing ticks). The present study is the first report of borreliae from I. acuminatus and H. concinna from Hungary."

On the basis of patient registry, the incidence, prevalence in various months of the year, the mean number of cases in various seasons and the seasonality factors (SF) of LB were calculated. Between 2000-2007, an increased borreliosis incidence was observed in the study area. During the entire study period, the highest incidence (25.93 and 30.66) was observed in the regions with the highest density of Ixodes ricinus ticks - vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes, and where the inhabitants are offered the best available LB diagnosis and treatment due to a sufficient number of doctors (r = 0.74) and all medical personnel (doctors, nurses and diagnosticians) (r = 0.89). The highest LB incidence was present in the summer and autumn seasons (SF = 113.25 and 155.18%) in the areas with the highest density of nymphs and adult I. ricinus ticks (> =19/1 h of sampling). Improved standards of public medical care as well as environmental monitoring of tick threat may contribute to a decrease in prevalence of LB and to its better detection."

After identifying significant aPL in sera of several index patients with 'CLD', we performed aPL tests on all patients referred in whom 'CLD' was suspected, diagnosed or treated. All patients with suspected, diagnosed or treated 'CLD' and reportedly 'positive' Lyme assays were studied. aPL testing included anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), anti-beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies (anti-β2GP1) and lupus anticoagulant (LAC). Patients were classified into four newly described categories of CLD and data was analyzed. One hundred and six patients were evaluated, of whom 82% had neurologic symptoms and 51% rheumatologic symptoms. Eighty-eight of 106 (83%) patients had positive Lyme serologies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] 62/106, 58.4%; western blot [WB] 64/106, 60%), while 18/106 (16.9%) were negative or equivocal. aPL was found in all 'CLD' categories. aCL and/or anti-β2GP1 were positive in 85/106 (80%), with aCL present in 69/106 (65%) and anti-β2GP1 present in 69/106 (65%). For all assays, IgM isotypes predominated: WB 55/64 (85%), aCL 63/69 (91%), anti-β2GP1 52/69 (75%), aCL and/or anti-β2GP1 74/85 (87%). Anti-β2GP1 assays occurred in higher titer than aCL: 36/69 (52%) versus 63/69 (91%), p<0.001. Seventeen patients had aPL-related events. Only 12/106 (11.3%) had true post-Lyme syndromes (PLS), category IV, or late Lyme disease (LLD). Most patients had been treated for Lyme: 82/106 (79%). aPL occurs frequently in patients with 'CLD'. IgM anti-β2GP1, IgM aCL and IgM WB were frequently found. Documented PLS or LLD was uncommon. The role of aPL in patients with 'CLD' needs further investigation."

A lot of tick-borne human diseases include Lyme disease and virus encephalitis, can be transmitted by a tick bite. Also secondary bacterial skin infection, reactive manifestations against tick allergens, and granuloma's formation can be occurred. Tick paralysis is a relatively rare complication but it can be fatal. Except the general rules for tick bite prevention, any tick found should be immediately and completely removed alive. Furthermore, the tick removal technique should not allow or provoke the escape of infective body fluids through the tick into the wound site, and disclose any local complication. Many methods of tick removal (a lot of them are unsatisfactory and/or dangerous) have been reported in the literature, but there is very limited experimental evidence to support these methods. No technique will remove completely every tick. So, there is not an appropriate and absolutely effective and/or safe tick removal technique. Regardless of the used tick removal technique, clinicians should be aware of the clinical signs of tick-transmitted diseases, the public should be informed about the risks and the prevention of tick borne diseases, and persons who have undergone tick removal should be monitored up to 30 days for signs and symptoms."

The three major species of Lyme disease spirochete--B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, and B. afzelii--are associated with different chronic disease manifestations. Colonization is likely promoted by the ability to bind to target tissues, and Lyme disease spirochetes utilize multiple adhesive molecules to interact with diverse mammalian components. The allelic variable surface lipoprotein decorin binding protein A (DbpA) promotes bacterial binding to the proteoglycan decorin and to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) dermatan sulfate. To assess allelic variation of DbpA in GAG-, decorin-, and cell-binding activities, we expressed dbpA alleles derived from diverse Lyme disease spirochetes in B. burgdorferi strain B314, a noninfectious and nonadherent strain that lacks dbpA. Each DbpA allele conferred upon B. burgdorferi strain B314 the ability to bind to cultured kidney epithelial (but not glial or endothelial) cells, as well as to purified decorin and dermatan sulfate. Nevertheless, allelic variation of DbpA was associated with dramatic differences in substrate binding activity. In most cases, decorin and dermatan sulfate binding correlated well, but DbpA of B. afzelii strain VS461 promoted differential binding to decorin and dermatan sulfate, indicating that the two activities are separable. DbpA from a clone of B. burgdorferi strain N40 that can cause disseminated infection in mice displayed relatively low adhesive activity, indicating that robust DbpA-mediated adhesive activity is not required for spread in the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, exists in a complex enzootic cycle, transiting between its vector, Ixodes ticks, and a diverse range of vertebrate hosts. B. burgdorferi linear plasmid 38 (lp38) contains several genes that are differentially regulated in response to conditions mimicking the tick or mouse environments, suggesting that these plasmid-borne genes may encode proteins important for the B. burgdorferi infectious cycle. Some of these genes encode potential virulence factors, including hypothetical lipoproteins as well as a putative membrane transport system. To characterize the role of lp38 in the B. burgdorferi infectious cycle, we constructed a shuttle vector to selectively displace lp38 from the B. burgdorferi genome and analyzed the resulting clones to confirm the loss of lp38. We found that, in vitro, clones lacking lp38 were similar to isogenic wild-type bacteria, both in growth rate and in antigenic protein production. We analyzed these strains in an experimental mouse-tick infectious cycle, and our results demonstrate that clones lacking lp38 are fully infectious in a mouse, can efficiently colonize the tick vector, and are readily transmitted to a naive host."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis, commonly known as the blacklegged or deer tick, is the main vector of Lyme disease in the United States. Recent progress in transcriptome research has uncovered hundreds of different proteins expressed in the salivary glands of hard ticks, the majority of which have no known function, and include many novel protein families. We recently identified transcripts coding for two putative cytosolic sulfotransferases in these ticks which recognized phenolic monoamines as their substrates. In this current study, we characterize the genetic expression of these two cytosolic sulfotransferases throughout the tick life cycle as well as the enzymatic properties of the corresponding recombinant proteins. Interestingly, the resultant recombinant proteins showed sulfotransferase activity against both neurotransmitters dopamine and octopamine. The two sulfotransferase genes were coded as Ixosc SULT 1 & 2 and corresponding proteins were referred as Ixosc Sult 1 and 2. Using gene-specific primers, the sulfotransferase transcripts were detected throughout the blacklegged tick life cycle, including eggs, larvae, nymphs, adult salivary glands and adult midgut. Notably, the mRNA and protein levels were altered upon feeding during both the larval and nymphal life stages. Quantitative PCR results confirm that Ixosc SULT1 was statistically increased upon blood feeding while Ixosc SULT 2 was decreased. This altered expression led us to further characterize the function of these proteins in the Ixodid tick. The sulfotransferase genes were cloned and expressed in a bacterial expression system, and purified recombinant proteins Ixosc Sult 1(R) and 2(R) showed sulfotransferase activity against neurotransmitters dopamine and octopamine as well as the common sulfotransferase substrate p-nitrophenol. Thus, dopamine- or octopamine-sulfonation may be involved in altering the biological signal for salivary secretion in I. scapularis. Collectively, these results suggest that a function of Ixosc Sult 1 and Sult 2 in Ixodid tick salivary glands may include inactivation of the salivation signal via sulfonation of dopamine or octopamine."

		"abstract": "Little attention has been given in scientific literature to how introduced species may act as a new host for native infectious agents and modify the epidemiology of a disease. In this study, we investigated whether an introduced species, the Siberian chipmunk (Tamias sibiricus barberi), was a potentially new reservoir host for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme disease. First, we ascertained whether chipmunks were infected by all of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies associated with rodents and available in their source of infection, questing nymphs. Second, we determined whether the prevalence and diversity of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in chipmunks were similar to those of a native reservoir rodent, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Our research took place between 2006 and 2008 in a suburban French forest, where we trapped 335 chipmunks and 671 voles and collected 743 nymphs of ticks that were questing for hosts by dragging on the vegetation. We assayed for B. burgdorferi sensu lato with ear biopsy specimens taken from the rodents and in nymphs using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Chipmunks were infected by the three Borrelia genospecies that were present in questing nymphs and that infect rodents (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii). In contrast, voles hosted only B. afzelii. Furthermore, chipmunks were more infected (35%) than voles (16%). These results may be explained by the higher exposure of chipmunks, because they harbor more ticks, or by their higher tolerance of other B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies than of B. afzelii. If chipmunks are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, they may spill back B. burgdorferi sensu lato to native communities and eventually may increase the risk of Lyme disease transmission to humans."

		"abstract": "This work consists in a study of the links between alcohol, a psychoactive substance and different related epileptic manifestations in order to clarify predominant factors both on conceptual, clinical and therapeutic levels. If alcohol is a frequent risk factor for seizures, its scientific evidence is less clear and ad hoc literature is rich in controversies and not firmly supported by systematic surveys. Alcohol has variable roles in the physiopathological determinism of seizures, the nosographical status of which needs to be clarified: alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcoholic epilepsy, and sometimes symptomatic epilepsy caused by coincidental disorders. A synthesis of relevant literature describing the links between alcohol and epilepsy is illustrated by a clinical case: a patient admitted in our psychiatric ward for chronic alcoholism had had two seizures questioning their nosographical status. An infectious process with protean neurological manifestations, neuroborreliosis, was diagnosed. Three distinct clinical pictures illustrate the links between alcohol and epilepsy: the first, convulsive inebriation corresponds to a seizure during severe acute alcohol intoxication. The second deals with alcohol withdrawal seizures following a partial or complete sudden withdrawal of alcohol; these are the clinical features the most documented in the literature representing, with delirium tremens, the main complication of alcohol withdrawal. The third clinical picture, alcoholic epilepsy, is characterized by repetitive seizures in patients presenting alcohol abuse without former history of epilepsy or other potentially epileptic disorder, and without relationship to alcohol withdrawal or acute alcohol intoxication. Acute and chronic effects of alcohol on central nervous system have been depicted, while a unified classification of alcohol related seizures has been recently established by Bartolomei. This classification based on the Ballenger hypothesis of kindling (1978) could explain withdrawal and hazardous seizures as clinical expressions of the same epileptogenic process over different stages. Although theoretically criticized, such a model offers a conceptual interest while able to unify the varied understanding of convulsive crises related to alcohol, and a practical one, whilst being a basis for a therapeutic approach. Our clinical case illustrates the delay in the diagnosis established after two iterative generalized seizures, 72 hours after the beginning of a programmed weaning of a patient presenting alcohol dependency. If the withdrawal seizure hypothesis was underlined, some data led to symptomatic epilepsy. Firstly atypia, the well-supervised preventive treatment of convulsion did not avoid seizures. Secondly, the EEG showed focal anomalies strongly linked in the literature with a cerebral disorder, which was confirmed by MRI; thirdly, cognitive alterations, which are not usual in alcohol dependency, were observed clinically and confirmed by neuropsychological tests. Finally a neuroborreliosis was diagnosed, while the main neuropsychiatric complications of Lyme disease were described. In accordance with the recommendations made by some authors, it appeared legitimate to consider neuroborreliosis as a potential differential diagnosis of every atypical psychiatric disorder, the interest of such an identification laying in the existence of a specific treatment."

		"abstract": "Since 1977, >2000 research papers described attempts to detect, identify and/or quantify parasites, or disease organisms carried by ecto-parasites, using DNA-based tests and 148 reviews of the topic were published. Despite this, only a few DNA-based tests for parasitic diseases are routinely available, and most of these are optional tests used occasionally in disease diagnosis. Malaria, trypanosomiasis, toxoplasmosis, leishmaniasis and cryptosporidiosis diagnosis may be assisted by DNA-based testing in some countries, but there are very few cases where the detection of veterinary parasites is assisted by DNA-based tests. The diagnoses of some bacterial (e.g. lyme disease) and viral diseases (e.g. tick borne encephalitis) which are transmitted by ecto-parasites more commonly use DNA-based tests, and research developing tests for these species makes up almost 20% of the literature. Other important uses of DNA-based tests are for epidemiological and risk assessment, quality control for food and water, forensic diagnosis and in parasite biology research. Some DNA-based tests for water-borne parasites, including Cryptosporidium and Giardia, are used in routine checks of water treatment, but forensic and food-testing applications have not been adopted in routine practice. Biological research, including epidemiological research, makes the widest use of DNA-based diagnostics, delivering enhanced understanding of parasites and guidelines for managing parasitic diseases. Despite the limited uptake of DNA-based tests to date, there is little doubt that they offer great potential to not only detect, identify and quantify parasites, but also to provide further information important for the implementation of parasite control strategies. For example, variant sequences within species of parasites and other organisms can be differentiated by tests in a manner similar to genetic testing in medicine or livestock breeding. If an association between DNA sequence and phenotype has been demonstrated, then qualities such as drug resistance, strain divergence, virulence, and origin of isolates could be inferred by DNA-based tests. No such tests are in clinical or commercial use in parasitology and few tests are available for other organisms. Why have DNA-based tests not had a bigger impact in veterinary and human medicine? To explore this question, technological, biological, economic and sociological factors must be considered. Additionally, a realistic expectation of research progress is needed. DNA-based tests could enhance parasite management in many ways, but patience, persistence and dedication will be needed to achieve this goal."

		"abstract": "Yale scientists played a pivotal role in the discovery of Lyme disease and are credited as the first to recognize, name, characterize, and treat the affliction. Today, Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States, affecting approximately 20,000 people each year, with the incidence having doubled in the past 10 years [1]. Lyme disease is the result of a bacterial infection transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected deer tick, which typically results in a skin rash at the site of attack. While most cases, when caught early, are easily treated by antibiotic therapy, delayed treatment can lead to serious systemic side effects involving the joints, heart, and central nervous system. Here we review Yale's role in the discovery and initial characterization of Lyme disease and how those early discoveries are crucial to our current understanding of the disease."

The various ophthalmologic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (LB) during childhood are discussed in this paper. Six children with LB-associated ocular manifestations were treated between 2000 and 2010 in the ophthalmology department of Strasbourg University Hospital (an endemic area). Medical history, ocular and systemic clinical findings, determinations of antibodies related to Borrelia, as well as exclusion of other causes were the diagnosis criteria. Two cases of uveitis, two cases of abducens palsies, one case of optical neuropathy, and one case of orbital myositis associated with LB were diagnosed. Systemic findings, such as arthritis, rash, or erythema migrans were mentioned in all cases. Two children also complained of severe knee arthritis. Determination of antibodies was positive in all patients. They were all treated with antibiotics adjusted to individual circumstances and some of them (two cases of uveitis and one of optic neuropathy) also had anti-inflammatory treatment. Resolution of ocular signs, with no relapse, was observed in all patients within two to 12 weeks. For any unexplained ocular symptom, even in children, LB should be taken into account, especially in endemic areas. Such patients should undergo serological testing. If the clinical presentation is suggestive of LB, a course of oral antibiotics should be used. All in all, permanent defects are extremely rare during the childhood period, even following long-term manifestation at an early age."

The mechanisms by which the bacterium is transmitted from vector to host are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the F(ab)(2) fragments of BBE31, a B.burgdorferi outer-surface lipoprotein, interfere with the migration of the spirochete from tick gut into the hemolymph during tick feeding. The decreased hemolymph infection results in lower salivary glands infection, and consequently attenuates mouse infection by tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi. Using a yeast surface display approach, a tick gut protein named TRE31 was identified to interact with BBE31. Silencing tre31 also decreased the B. burgdorferi burden in the tick hemolymph. Delineating the specific spirochete and arthropod ligands required for B. burgdorferi movement in the tick may lead to new strategies to interrupt the life cycle of the Lyme disease agent."

		"abstract": "Although Lyme disease remains a controversial illness, recent events have created an unprecedented opportunity to make progress against this serious tick-borne infection. Evidence presented during the legally mandated review of the restrictive Lyme guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) has confirmed the potential for persistent infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, as well as the complicating role of tick-borne coinfections such as Babesia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Bartonella species associated with failure of short-course antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, renewed interest in the role of cell wall-deficient (CWD) forms in chronic bacterial infection and progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms of biofilms has focused attention on these processes in chronic Lyme disease. Recognition of the importance of CWD forms and biofilms in persistent B. burgdorferi infection should stimulate pharmaceutical research into new antimicrobial agents that target these mechanisms of chronic infection with the Lyme spirochete. Concurrent clinical implementation of proteomic screening offers a chance to correct significant deficiencies in Lyme testing. Advances in these areas have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in the coming decade."

Systematic ancillary investigations aimed at detecting an infectious disease (syphilis, HIV infection, Lyme neuroborreliosis or, more rarely, Whipple disease), an endocrine aetiology or a vitamin deficiency are rarely contributory, but remain relevant since these dementias could be reversible.

The role of multiple habitats in the establishment and maintenance of I. scapularis and Bb at local scales is not well understood, and the use of integrated approaches to evaluate local scale dynamics is rare. We evaluated habitat diversity and temporal changes of I. scapularis occurrence and Bb infection within a natural area in Piatt County, Illinois, where I. scapularis were first detected in 2002. Small mammals were trapped and attached ticks were collected in young forest, prairie, mature forest, and flood plain sites from 2005 to 2009. Small mammal abundance, and the prevalence (% mammals infested), mean intensity (I. scapularis per infested mammal), and relative density (I. scapularis per mammal trapped) of I. scapularis were computed for each habitat type and compared. Immature I. scapularis were tested for Bb infection using polymerase chain reaction techniques. Out of 2446 trapped small mammals, 388 were infested with I. scapularis. The prairie had the highest diversity of small mammal hosts. Prevalence, mean intensity, and relative density of I. scapularis and prevalence of Bb infection were highest for the prairie and young forest sites; in the former, all infection was associated with the prairie vole, Microtus ochrogaster. The minimum Bb infection prevalence of on-host I. scapularis collected in the natural area was 14% (n=56). Unlike previous studies solely focused on forested areas and Peromyscus leucopus, our study is the first to provide evidence of I. scapularis collected from prairie habitat and other reservoir hosts, particularly M. ochrogaster."

Infections involve bones (osteomyelitis) and joints (septic arthritis) separately as well as together and result in necrosis with inflammatory features determined by the duration of the infection. In many cases, the infecting organism, whether bacterial, fungal or mycobacterial, is present within the infected site, but occasionally is no longer identifiable locally despite the persistence of infection-related phenomena. Granulomatous infections in bones and joints require distinction from Sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of the immunologically mediated inflammatory diseases, such as RA, depends as much on the clinical features as on the histologic ones, with a few findings that might point to one or the other in ambiguous cases. Any discussion of inflammatory arthropathies should at least mention Osteoarthritis, if for no other reason than to compare it with the traditionally regarded inflammatory diseases. However, there has been increasing interest on the potential role that synovial inflammation may play in the pathogenesis of this vary common arthritis. Ultimately, the diagnosis of the inflammatory diseases of the bones and joints requires the synthesis of information from many sources: clinical, serological, microbiological, radiographic, and pathological."

		"abstract": "HD-GYP domain cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) phosphodiesterases are implicated in motility and virulence in bacteria. Borrelia burgdorferi possesses a single set of c-di-GMP-metabolizing enzymes, including a putative HD-GYP domain protein, BB0374. Recently, we characterized the EAL domain phosphodiesterase PdeA. A mutation in pdeA resulted in cells that were defective in motility and virulence. Here we demonstrate that BB0374/PdeB specifically hydrolyzed c-di-GMP with a K(m) of 2.9 nM, confirming that it is a functional phosphodiesterase. Furthermore, by measuring phosphodiesterase enzyme activity in extracts from cells containing the pdeA pdeB double mutant, we demonstrate that no additional phosphodiesterases are present in B. burgdorferi. pdeB single mutant cells exhibit significantly increased flexing, indicating a role for c-di-GMP in motility. Constructing and analyzing a pilZ pdeB double mutant suggests that PilZ likely interacts with chemotaxis signaling. While virulence in needle-inoculated C3H/HeN mice did not appear to be altered significantly in pdeB mutant cells, these cells exhibited a reduced ability to survive in Ixodes scapularis ticks. Consequently, those ticks were unable to transmit the infection to naïve mice. All of these phenotypes were restored when the mutant was complemented. Identification of this role of pdeB increases our understanding of the c-di-GMP signaling network in motility regulation and the life cycle of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Well balanced ecosystems have an essential role in disease regulation, and consequently their correct functioning is increasingly recognised as imperative for maintaining human health. Disruptions to ecosystems have been found to increase the risk of several diseases, including Hantavirus, Lyme disease, Ross River virus, malaria and Ciguatera fish poisoning. Leptospirosis is a globally important emerging zoonosis, caused by spirochaete bacteria, borne by many mammalian hosts, and also transmitted environmentally. We propose that leptospirosis incidence in humans is also linked to ecosystem disruption, and that reduced biodiversity (the diversity of species within an ecological community) may be associated with increased leptospirosis incidence. To investigate this hypothesis, the relationship between biodiversity levels of island nations and their annual leptospirosis incidence rates (adjusted for GDP per capita) was examined by linear correlation and regression. Supportive, statistically significant negative associations were obtained between leptospirosis incidence and (a) total number of species (r2=0.69, p<0.001) and (b) number of mammal species (r2=0.80, p<0.001) in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis only the number of mammal species remained significantly associated (r2=0.81, p=0.007). An association between biodiversity and reduced leptospirosis risk, if supported by further research, would emphasise the importance of managing the emergence of leptospirosis (and other infectious diseases) at a broader, ecosystem level."

		"abstract": "Despite the importance of population structure for the epidemiology of pathogenic bacteria, the spatial and ecological heterogeneity of these populations is often poorly characterized. Here, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of the Lyme borreliosis (LB) spirochaete Borrelia garinii in its marine cycle involving colonial seabirds and different host races of the seabird tick Ixodes uriae. Multilocus sequence analyses (MLSA) on eight chromosomal and two plasmid loci (ospA and ospC) indicate that B. garinii circulating in the marine system is highly diverse. Microevolution in marine B. garinii seems to be mainly clonal, but recombination and selection do occur. Sequence types were not evenly distributed among geographic regions, with substantial population subdivision between Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins. However, no geographic structuring was evident within regions. Results of selection analyses and phylogenetic discordance between chromosomal and plasmid loci indicate adaptive evolution is likely occurring in this system, but no pattern of host or vector-associated divergence was found. Recombination analyses showed evidence for population admixture between terrestrial and marine strains, suggesting that LB spirochaetes are exchanged between these enzootic cycles. Importantly, our results highlight the need to explicitly consider the marine system for a complete understanding of the evolutionary ecology and global epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disorder caused by Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Neurological symptoms such as lymphocytic meningoradiculoneuritis (Bannwart's syndrome), cranial neuritis (II,III,IV,V,VI), encephalitis, transverse myelitis are found in about 10% of cases during the second phase of the disease. In the chronic stage, many months or years after the initial infection, other neurologic complications may occur, such as encephalomyelitis, epileptic crises, cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy and psychiatric disturbances such as depression, anxiety, panicc attacks, catatonia, psychosis etc. Some patient continue to experience symptoms of fatigue, insomnia or psychiatric disorder in the post borrelia syndrome. We describe here a patient with a triad of unusual symptoms in chronic LNB including tremor, seizures and psychosis. Standardized medical interview, neurologic examination, neuroimaging, serum and CSF serology as well as EEG and EMNG evaluation were performed. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and doxycycline and responded with rapid clinical and functional improvement.Newertheless, he suffered from multiple systemic and neurologic sequelas that influenced his daily activities in post treatment period. Emphasis is placed on the atypical onset and evolution, the difficulties encountered in formulating diagnosis, early treatment and the uncertainties concerning the sequelae after treatment. In patients with non-specific long lasting symptoms in the absence of overt clinical signs suggesting CNS involvement, routine treatment with i.v. ceftriaxone is not to be encouraged."

		"abstract": "We previously modeled Lyme disease (LD) risk at the landscape scale; here we evaluate the model's overall goodness-of-fit using holdout validation. Landscapes were characterized within road-bounded analysis units (AU). Observed LD cases (obsLD) were ascertained per AU. Data were randomly subset 2,000 times. Of 514 AU, 411 (80%) were selected as a training dataset to develop parameter estimates used to predict observations in the remaining 103 (20%) AU, the validation subset. Predicted values were subtracted from obsLD to quantify accuracy across iterations. We calculated the percentage difference of over- and under-estimation to assess bias. Predictive ability was strong and similar across iterations and datasets; the exact number of obsLD cases per AU were predicted almost 60% of the time. However, the three highest obsLD AU were under-predicted. Our model appears to be accurate and relatively unbiased, however is conservative at high disease incidence."
