At the completion of therapy, all three patients major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25-30 months. In conclusion, Double dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS, especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

Analyzing the medical governance of Lyme disease through actors’ everyday decision-making practices, the author shows how, in failing to accurately diagnose and treat his sick body and depriving him of treatment, credentialed health care providers reproduced culturally dominant, institutionalized, yet inadequate formations of medical power-knowledge. The author’s experience of this disease illustrates how the manufacture of disease categories and their ascription regulates bodies that do not fit into established categories. Analyzing data from his own life in light of medical science research, the author advances an analytical autoethnography and dissenting embodied knowledge, legitimizing the diagnostic category of chronic Lyme disease, and introducing two concepts—<italic>contested disease</italic> and <italic>contested care</italic>—to theorize the complex phenomenon of Lyme disease.</p>"

		"abstract": "Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is classified as primary, secondary, tertiary, and latent infection. If left untreated, syphilis can cause devastating injury to the fetus. The drug of choice for treatment of syphilis in pregnancy is penicillin. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick. The principal clinical manifestation of Lyme disease is erythema migrans, but patients may also develop arthritis and cardiac and neurologic abnormalities. Congenital Lyme disease has not been reported. The drug of choice for treatment of Lyme disease in pregnancy is amoxicillin. Leptospirosis is usually acquired from direct contact with urine of infected animals or through contaminated water, soil, or vegetation. Pregnant women with mild disease should be treated with oral amoxicillin. Patients with severe disease should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin. This review contains 5 figures, 5 tables, and 19 references. Key Words: clinical infection, congenital syphilis, latent infection, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, syphilis"

		"abstract": "Syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It is classified as primary, secondary, tertiary, and latent infection. If left untreated, syphilis can cause devastating injury to the fetus. The drug of choice for treatment of syphilis in pregnancy is penicillin. Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by the Ixodes scapularis tick. The principal clinical manifestation of Lyme disease is erythema migrans, but patients may also develop arthritis and cardiac and neurologic abnormalities. Congenital Lyme disease has not been reported. The drug of choice for treatment of Lyme disease in pregnancy is amoxicillin. Leptospirosis is usually acquired from direct contact with urine of infected animals or through contaminated water, soil, or vegetation. Pregnant women with mild disease should be treated with oral amoxicillin. Patients with severe disease should be hospitalized and treated with intravenous penicillin or ampicillin. This review contains 5 figures, 5 tables, and 19 references. Key Words: clinical infection, congenital syphilis, latent infection, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, syphilis"

		"abstract": "Abstract: The most commonly reported vector-borne and tick-borne disease (TBD) in the United States is Lyme disease. Individuals with Lyme disease may present with a wide array of symptoms with resultant musculoskeletal, neurological, and cardiac manifestations that may cause them to seek physical therapist services. The symptoms may develop insidiously and with a variable presentation among individuals. Many persons with Lyme disease do not recall a tick bite or present with an erythema migrans rash, which is considered pathognomonic for the disease. Even if they do, they may fail to associate either with their symptoms, making the diagnosis elusive. It is important to diagnose patients early in the disease process when antibiotic treatment is most likely to be successful. Physical therapists are in a unique position to recognize the possibility that patients may have Lyme disease and refer them to another practitioner when appropriate. The purpose of this article is to (1) present an overview of the etiology, incidence, and clinical manifestations of Lyme disease, (2) review evaluation findings that should raise the index of suspicion for Lyme disease, (3) discuss the use of an empirically validated tool for differentiating those with Lyme disease from healthy individuals, (4) discuss the current state of diagnostic testing, and (5) review options for diagnosis and treatment available to patients for whom referral is recommended."

In this study, we compared paired results of clinical 2-tier Lyme disease tests to those of the C6 peptide EIA followed by supplemental immunoblotting (C6 2-tier test). Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of children aged ≥1 to ≤21 years who were undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease in the emergency department at 1 of 6 centers located in regions in which Lyme disease is endemic. The clinical first-tier test and a C6 EIA were performed on the same serum sample with supplemental immunoblotting if the first-tier test result was either positive or equivocal. We compared the results of the paired clinical and C6 2-tier Lyme disease test results using the McNemar test. Results: Of the 1714 children enrolled, we collected a research serum sample from 1584 (92.4%). The clinical 2-tier EIA result was positive in 316 (19.9%) children, and the C6 2-tier test result was positive or equivocal in 295 (18.6%) children. The clinical and C6 2-tier test results disagreed more often than they would have by chance alone (P = .002). Of the 39 children with either a positive clinical or C6 2-tier test result alone, 2 children had an erythema migrans (EM) lesion, and 29 had symptoms compatible with early disseminated Lyme disease. Conclusions: Two-tier Lyme disease test results differed for a substantial number of children on the basis of the specific first-tier test used. In children for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for Lyme disease and who have an initially negative test result, clinicians should consider retesting for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. To assess whether a tick bite puts someone at risk for LD, adequate tick identification skills are needed. We surveyed residents of a high LD-incidence state, Wisconsin, on their ability to distinguish ticks from insects and to identify the specimens that could transmit the LD causative agent. Surveys were conducted using resin blocks with four insects and four tick specimens embedded. About half of the participants (64 of 130) recognized all of the ticks, and 60% of those individuals chose only ticks and no insects. Younger participants (18- to 44-yr old) were more likely to identify ticks correctly compared with those 45 yr and older. Participants who agreed strongly with the statement ‘I know a lot about ticks` were also likelier to correctly identify ticks. When asked to identify which specimens could transmit LD, less than 25% of participants chose both the Ixodes scapularis Say adult female and nymph and about half of those (15% of participants) picked only those two and no other specimens. Although the relatively small convenience sample was biased toward younger participants who consider themselves ‘outdoorsy’, results showed that further assessments of tick recognition skills are needed to understand what determines whether people can recognize medically important ticks and to evaluate the potential benefits of enhanced education. In addition to the value of the resin blocks as research tools, the blocks may be useful as training tools to improve tick check efficacy."

PTLDS represents a small subset of patients treated for an erythema migrans (EM) rash with persistent or recurrent symptoms and functional decline. The larger population with chronic Lyme disease is less understood and well defined. Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) is a multifactorial model for treating chronic disease(s), which identifies up to 16 overlapping sources of inflammation and their downstream effects. A patient symptom survey and a retrospective chart review of 200 patients was therefore performed on those patients with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS to identify those variables on the MSIDS model with the greatest potential effect on regaining health. Results indicate that dapsone combination therapy decreased the severity of eight major Lyme symptoms, and multiple sources of inflammation (other infections, immune dysfunction, autoimmunity, food allergies/sensitivities, leaky gut, mineral deficiencies, environmental toxins with detoxification problems, and sleep disorders) along with downstream effects of inflammation may all affect chronic symptomatology. In part two of our observational study and review paper, we postulate that the use of this model can represent an important and needed paradigm shift in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic disease."

At the completion of therapy, all three patients’ major Lyme symptoms remained in remission for a period of 25–30 months. A retrospective chart review of 37 additional patients undergoing DDD CT therapy (40 patients in total) was also performed, which demonstrated tick-borne symptom improvements in 98% of patients, with 45% remaining in remission for 1 year or longer. In conclusion, double-dose dapsone therapy could represent a novel and effective anti-infective strategy in chronic Lyme disease/post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), especially in those individuals who have failed regular dose dapsone combination therapy (DDS CT) or standard antibiotic protocols. A randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial is warranted to evaluate the efficacy of DDD CT in those individuals with chronic Lyme disease/PTLDS."

		"abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is at the forefront of global health issues and contributes to myocardial infarction, stroke, and even death. Lyme disease (LD), spread by ticks of the genus Ixodes, is a contributing factor to the potential development of abnormalities in the heart. The bacterial agents Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi are known to cause a variety of infections and we speculate that infection with Borrelia is a contributing factor to cardiac abnormalities, especially Lyme carditis (LC). Patients who demonstrate undiagnosed cardiac abnormalities should be monitored for potential infection with Lyme disease and, consequently LC. Lyme carditis affects up to 10% of patients that have been diagnosed with LD and additionally, it indiscriminately manifests across a range of ages, from the pediatric populace to the elderly. Given the grave cardiac abnormalities that can arise from LC and the propensity for misdiagnosis, it is critical that medical professionals be aware of the cardiovascular signs and symptoms of Atrioventricular Heart Block (AHB). AHB can lead to third degree heart block in patients and potentially lead to death if left not properly diagnosed and treated. Essential treatments are readily available for Lyme carditis, which include a range of antibiotics and surgical procedures. In this review, we highlight not only the true nature of Lyme disease, but more importantly, the positive correlation between LD and a variety of undiagnosed heart complications."

In short order it was discovered that multiple microbes have the potential of triggering mental health issues in children and adolescents, and the nomenclature was updated to Pediatric Acute-Onset Neuropsychiatric Syndrome (PANS) [3]. The microbes that thus far have been associated with PANS include herpes simplex virus, influenza A virus, varicella virus, HIV, recurrent sinusitis, Epstein-Barr virus, the common cold, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Bartonella henselae [4-6]."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease, caused by spirochetes of the genus Borrelia, transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes genus. Infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi can occur throughout Poland and therefore, according to ECDC description, the whole country should be considered as an endemic area. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2017 in comparison to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on data from the annual bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017”. (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2018, NIZP-PZH, GIS). RESULTS. In 2017 were registered 21,514 Lyme disease cases i.e. 1.48% more than in the previous year and 2,324 people were hospitalized. Epidemiological situation in Western European countries and Poland are similar. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. A slightly increase in 2017 and lack of a clear trend in individual voivodeships may indicate, that a very high level of sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance has been achieved."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThe objective of this research is to develop the model for calculating the forecast of the Lyme disease dynamics what will help to take effective preventive and control measures using the intelligent multi-agent approach.IntroductionClimate warming, globalization, social and economic crises lead to the activation of natural foci of vector-borne infections, among which a special place belongs to Lyme disease (Ixodic tick borreliosis – ITB), the vectors of which are the Ixodes ticks. More than 5,000 cases are registered in the United States every year [1]. In European countries, the number of cases may reach up to 8,000-10,000 per year. Incidence rate for ITB in France is 39.4 per 100,000 population, in Bulgaria – 36.6 [2]. In Ukraine, among all ticks, 10-70% are infected with Borrelia; from 10% to 42.2% of Ukrainian population had contact with the causative agent of ITB.Mathematical modeling as an element of monitoring of natural focal infections makes it possible to assess the epidemiological potential of foci in the region and in individual territories, to forecast the trends of the epidemic process and to determine the main priorities and directions in the prevention of ITB. The most modern and effective method of simulation is multi-agent simulation, which is associated with the concept of an intelligent agent, as some robot, purposefully interacting with other similar elements and the external environment under given conditions. An intelligent agent is an imitation model of an active element, the state and behavior of which in various situations of achieving the goal vary depending on the state and behavior of other agents and the environment, in analogy with the intellectual behavior of a live organism (including a human) under similar conditions.As the epidemic process of Lyme disease is characterized by vector transmission, heterogeneous tick population, variable pathogen infectivity, heterogeneous environment, and seasonal changes in tick activity, the use of classical statistical methods for predicting the dynamics of morbidity cannot show high accuracy. The multiagent approach to simulation of the epidemic process of Lyme disease allows considering all of the above features, and since the dynamics of the modeled system is formed from the behavior of local objects (humans and ticks), we expect that a model constructed using a multiagent approach will yield a higher accuracy of prognosis morbidity. The multiagent model will allow not only to calculate the forecast, but also to reveal the factors influencing increase of the incidence of Lyme disease the most.MethodsThe research is based on official reports of new Lyme disease cases registered during 2006-2017. The data were collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine from the healthcare facilities of Kharkiv Oblast of Ukraine as a part of passive routine disease surveillance. In total, 1016 cases of Lyme disease registered during the study period were included in this research.The multi-agent approach to simulation of epidemic process has been used for the model development.The epidemiological model of Lyme disease is based on the Gromashevsky’s concept of the epidemic process, according to which the epidemic process exists with the continuous interaction of the three main components - source of infection, mechanism of transmission and susceptible organism.The most profitable type of agent in the study of epidemic process is an emotionally-motivated intellectual agent for the most complete and accurate model of human behavior. Let’s consider the agent as a set of properties:a=<s,st,c,ta,l>, a∈A, s∈S, c∈C, ta∈Ta, (1)where st is time in state s,A is set of all agents,S is set of different agent’s states,C is set of working area’s cells,Ta is set of possible agent’s types,l is length of life.The set of agent states is predefined and is constant. Depending on the process being studied, the set can be supplemented by different states, the initial set is:S={Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Dead}. (2)The composition of the workspace leads to the appearance of a set of cells, as conditional abstract objects. It is assumed that one cell can simultaneously include a number of agents as well as one object-vector of infection (tick). It is assumed that depending on the type of working area where the agent is located the specific nature of the epidemic process is changed.The vector transmission of the disease from tick to agent is realized as follows. To begin with, the possibility of contact with tick is checked. It is believed that this is possible if other agents are also processed in the same cell along with the tick processed as well. Each pair agent-tick is compared. If tick is infected, it is believed that with a certain probability healthy agent can become infected.To automate the prediction of the incidence of Lyme disease, a software package has been developed using C# programing language that allows to calculate prognosis morbidity based on existing statistical data in real time. In the developed model, the configuration of the software package includes data for the period 2006-2017. This data include incidence rate of ITB per 100,000 population, the population's seeking healthcare providers for tick bites, the results of studies of ticks removed from humans for the presence of Borrelia, the number and proportion of ticks infected by Borrelia collected by the flagging method.ResultsThe calculated prognosis shows the expected increase in the number of cases with a certain three-year cycle: an increase in the number of cases of Ixodic tick borreliosis within 2 years with a slight decrease for the next year.A comparative analysis of the accuracy of forecasting by moving average method to 3 years [3] and multiagent simulation showed that the latter describes the existing data better, therefore, the forecast will be more accurate. The accuracy rates using the moving average method is 85.4%, with the use of multiagent simulation 96.6%.ConclusionsA comparative assessment of the accuracy of predicting the dynamics of the epidemic process using the moving average method [3] and the multiagent approach was carried out. A higher accuracy is noted with the use of multi-agent simulation (96.6% against 85.4% using moving average method), based on which a software package has been developed, which makes it possible to calculate the expected morbidity rate of Lyme disease. That means that the hypothesis made of the research was confirmed. The adequacy of the tested prognosis was verified on the real statistical data collected by the State Institution Kharkiv Laboratory Center of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine on the incidence of Lyme disease in Kharkiv Oblast (Ukraine) from 2006 to 2017. The obtained forecast revealed the expected persistence of the unstable epidemic situation with respect to Lyme disease, which dictates the need to develop a set of preventive measures aimed at reducing the morbidity of people by ITB. Virtual verification of the effectiveness of such events will be the next step in our study.ReferencesGulia-Nuss M. Genomic insights into the Ixodes scapularis tick vector of Lyme disease [Text] / M.

For example, CRISPR-based genome editing may be used to create white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) that are resistant to the Lyme disease spirochete vectored by blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis). Toward this goal, academic researchers are developing Lyme-resistant and tick-resistant white-footed mice, which are a primary pathogen reservoir for Lyme disease in the United States. If field trials on small, experimental islands are successful, the project would scale up to the larger islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, and possibly to the mainland, most likely with a local gene drive to speed the traits’ proliferation, pending approvals from relevant constituents. Despite considerable publicity, this project has yet to be evaluated by independent professional ecologists. In the present article, I discuss key ecological and evolutionary questions that should be considered before such genetically engineered mice are released into natural habitats."

		"abstract": "The Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Neurology, and American Academy of Rheumatology jointly proposed Lyme disease guidelines. Four areas most relevant to psychiatry were reviewed—the disclaimer, laboratory testing, and adult and pediatric psychiatric sections. The disclaimer and the manner in which these guidelines are implemented are insufficient to remove the authors and sponsoring organizations from liability for harm caused by these guidelines. The guidelines and supporting citations place improper credibility upon surveillance case definition rather than clinical diagnosis criteria. The guidelines fail to address the clear causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, developmental disabilities and substance abuse despite significant supporting evidence. If these guidelines are published without very major revisions, and if the sponsoring medical societies attempt to enforce these guidelines as a standard of care, it will directly contribute to increasing a national and global epidemic of psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, substance abuse and developmental disabilities and the associated economic and non-economic societal burdens. The guideline flaws could be improved with a more appropriate disclaimer, an evidence-based rather than an evidence-biased approach, more accurate diagnostic criteria, and recognition of the direct and serious causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses."

In the present study, we provided a qualitative analysis of written correspondence produced by 23 parents of children and adolescents with Lyme disease. The goal of this study was to investigate how medical and psychological issues were highlighted by parents describing their family’s Lyme disease experiences. The results suggest a series of four stages in these families where satisfactory treatment had not been obtained over months or years. The experiences of parents evolved from feelings of worry for the child to frustration with the lack of a helpful treatment, to mistrust of physicians’ actions, and, in some case, to a rejection of the conventional health care system as a whole. Improved diagnostic testing and treatment guidelines, as well as family-centered practices of medical care were proposed as important features for improving the experiences of families living with Lyme disease."

Lyme optic neuritis  is a rare ocular manifestation of Lyme Disease. We report a case of a 13-year-old male patient, previously healthy, with decreased central visual acuity on his both eyes . On examination, best-corrected visual acuity on both eyes was 0,3 LogMar. Anterior segment biomicroscopy showed no inflammatory signs and the intraocular pressure was normal. A fundus examination performed under mydriasis revealed a swollen optic disk on both eyes confirmed by fluorescein angiography. The cerebrospinal fluid examination and Lyme Disease blood findings were positive. The diagnosis of Lyme disease-related optic neuritis was made. Treated with Ceftriaxone and Doxicycline, there was a vision recovery. We can state that isolated bilateral optic neuritis is uncommon and exceptional especially in children during Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a rapidly growing illness that remains poorly understood within the medical community. Critical questions about when and why patients respond to treatment or stay ill, what kinds of treatments are effective, and even how to properly diagnose the disease remain largely unanswered. We investigate these questions by applying machine learning techniques to a large scale Lyme disease patient registry, MyLymeData, developed by the nonprofit LymeDisease.org. We apply various machine learning methods in order to measure the effect of individual features in predicting participants’ answers to the Global Rating of Change (GROC) survey questions that assess the self-reported degree to which their condition improved, worsened, or remained unchanged following antibiotic treatment. We use basic linear regression, support vector machines, neural networks, entropy-based decision tree models, and k-nearest neighbors approaches. We first analyze the general performance of the model and then identify the most important features for predicting participant answers to GROC. After we identify the “key” features, we separate them from the dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of these features at identifying GROC. In doing so, we highlight possible directions for future study both mathematically and clinically."

		"abstract": "Over the past four decades, Lyme disease has remained a virulent and pervasive illness, persisting throughout North America and many other regions of the world. Recent increases in illness in many countries has sparked a renewed interest in improved Lyme diagnostics. While current standards of diagnosis are acceptable for the late stages of the disease, it remains difficult to accurately diagnose early forms of the illness. In addition, current diagnostic methods tend to be relatively expensive and require a large degree of laboratory-based analysis. Biosensors represent the fusion of biological materials with chemical techniques to provide simple, inexpensive alternatives to traditional diagnostic methods. Lyme disease biosensors have the potential to better diagnose early stages of the illness and provide possible patients with an inexpensive, commercially available test. This review examines the current state of Lyme disease biosensing, with a focus on previous biosensor development and essential future considerations."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a vector-borne illness caused by Borrelia spp. bacterium spread by ticks to humans and other mammals. Despite being prevalent in many regions of the world, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the disease, and consensus on the most appropriate and effective means of treating the illness remains to be achieved. Recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), the primary guidelines followed by health care professionals treating Lyme disease, diverge in many of their key recommendations, including treatment duration. Given this lack of consensus, surprisingly little research has been conducted on patient outcomes following different treatment approaches. In this study, patient outcomes were evaluated from a cohort of 210 Canadian Lyme disease patients seeking treatment at one US Lyme disease clinic following a treatment regimen conforming to the ILADS treatment guidelines. It was found that the majority of Lyme disease patients at the clinic responded positively to treatment and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in symptoms was observed over time. This study, along with related studies, may help to guide physicians to provide their patients with the most effective care."

Since the severity of symptoms and probability of recurrence significantly increases as time progresses, there is a need to find a new alternative diagnostic system for Early Lyme disease. Many solutions to this problem are considered within this document, most notably: polymerase chain reaction detection, metabolic biosignature testing, and OspC targeting serological testing. After further analysis, metabolic biosignature testing is considered the best alternative since it yields the highest diagnosis sensitivity with around 89% accuracy. Additionally, metabolic biosignature testing is both cost effective and widely applicable since it does not require the Erythema migran rash to be used. Once in place, Lyme disease will be able to be diagnosed quicker, thus reducing the number of cases of Chronic Lyme disease which significantly reduces personal quality of life and is often costly.

		"abstract": "In recent years, an increase in the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease (LD)) has been noted in the world, which causes the need for constant epidemic and clinical alertness. The causative agent of LD is Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, transmitting agents are Ixodes ricinus mites. Migratory erythema appears at the site of mite suction, which is a marker of cutaneous manifestation of LD — an early localized (І) stage of the disease. In the presence of migratory erythema, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is not difficult, but in the absence of the information about tick inoculation, the diagnosis is difficult. Timely detection and treatment of LD is important to prevent chronic disease, its progression with multiorgan lesions and complications, one of which is Borrelious lymphocytoma which refers to pathognomonic cutaneous manifestations of LD as a sign of dissemination (II or III) stage.Borreliosis lymphocytoma is diagnosed by positive serological tests — detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. The localization of borreliosis lymphocytoma — ear lobes, areolas of the nipples of the mammary glands, axillary cavities, occiput, scrotum, rear feet — is of decisive importance for the diagnosis. Treatment of both migratory erythema and borreliosis lymphocytoma consists of antibiotics. A rare case of borreliosis lymphocytoma is described in a patient with the disease duration of more than 15 years with the localization of the pathological process on the skin of the left ear in the area of the lobe and around it. The treatment plan was drawn up in two directions: the first included antibiotics and a synthetic drug that inhibited the activity of T lymphocytes without affecting B lymphocytes; the second one included pathogenetic drugs that increase the production of antibodies, reduce the manifestations of secondary immunodeficiency and have an anti-inflammatory effect. The pictures of the patient in dynamics are presented as she recovers. After the therapy, the patient achieved clinical recovery."

		"abstract": "ObjectiveThis study aims to describe incidence over time, geographic and seasonal distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of Lyme disease cases in Canada.IntroductionLyme disease (LD), a multisystem infection that is manifested by progressive stages (1), is emerging in central and eastern provinces of Canada due to northward expansion of the geographic range of Ixodes scapularis, the main vector in these regions (2). In 2004, approximately 40 human cases of LD were reported in Canada. In 2009, LD disease became nationally notifiable, with provincial and territorial health departments reporting clinician-diagnosed cases to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). This study summarizes seven years (2009-2015) of national surveillance data for LD in Canada.MethodsNational Lyme disease surveillance data is collected through two surveillance systems, the Canadian National Disease Surveillance System (CNDSS) and the Lyme disease enhanced surveillance system (LDES). The CNDSS collects only demographic data (age and sex), and information on episode date and case classification. The LDES system captures additional data, including: possible geographic location of infection (for both locally acquired and travel-related cases); clinical manifestations; and results of laboratory testing. Nine provinces out of ten participate to LDES that means they provide a part of or all the data elements of this surveillance system. The 2009 national Lyme disease case definition (3) that distinguishes confirmed and probable cases (Table 1) is used to classify and report cases diagnosed by clinicians.This study describes the incidence over time, seasonal and geographic distribution, demographic and clinical characteristics of reported LD cases. Logistic regression was used to explore variations among age groups, sex and year of reporting clinical manifestations to better understand potential demographic risk factors for the occurrence of LD. Different models were used with as outcomes absence or presence of: erythema migrans (early Lyme disease), neurologic and cardiac symptoms and multiple erythema, migrans (early disseminated Lyme disease); and arthritis (late disseminated Lyme disease). The most parsimonious multivariate models were sought by backward elimination of nonsignificant variables until all factors in the model were significant (P<0.05).ResultsThe number of reported LD cases increased more than six-fold, from 144 in 2009 to 917 in 2015, mainly due to an increase in infections acquired in Canada. For the provinces participating into the LDES system, the month of illness onset for Lyme disease cases acquired in Canada was available for 2010 cases. Most cases were reported during the summer months of June (20.7%), July (35.4%) and August (17.3%) (Figure 1). An increase in incidence of LD was observed in provinces from Manitoba eastwards (Figure 2). This is consistent with our knowledge of range expansion of the tick vectors in this region. In the western provinces the incidence has remained low and stable. All cases reported by Alberta, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland and Labrador were acquired outside of the province, either elsewhere in Canada or abroad. There was a bimodal distribution for LD by age with peaks at 5–9 and 45–74 years of age (Figure 3). The most common presenting symptoms were a single erythema migrans rash (74.2%) and arthritis (35.7%) (Figure 4). In the multivariate analysis for clinical manifestations, children aged 0–9 years had a greater number of cases reported as early LD (erythema migrans only) than patients aged 10–19 and 30–39 years (P<0.05). For early disseminated manifestations, young adults 20–29 years of age reported more neurologic manifestations, cardiac manifestations or multiple erythema migrans than the reference age group of 0–9 years (P<0.05). For late disseminated manifestations, children under 15 years of age were more frequently reported as having arthritis than other age groups.ConclusionsLyme disease incidence continues to increase in Canada as does the geographic range of ticks that carry the LD bacteria. This increasing of LD incidence might also be due to changing in knowledge, attitudes, and practices of clinicians who diagnose the disease and or of the public health workers who collect and report the data. Ongoing surveillance, preventive strategies as well as early disease recognition and treatment will continue to minimize the impact of LD in Canada.References1.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a complex multisystem illness with varying clinical manifestations. This tick-borne zoonosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and, worldwide, presents with at least 20 different types of rashes. Certain cutaneous rashes are inherently interconnected to various stages of Lyme disease. In this study, five Canadian Lyme disease patients from a multi-age range presented various phases of the acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) rash. In each case of ACA, the underlying etiological pathogen was the Lyme disease spirochete. Although ACA rashes are normally found on the lower extremities, this study illustrates that ACA rashes are not directly correlated with a tick bite, geographic area, age, Bbsl genospecies, exercise, or any given surface area of the body. Case 4 provides confirmation for an ACA rash and gestational Lyme disease. One patient (Case 5) puts forth a Bbsl and Bartonella sp. co-infection with a complex ACA rash. This study documents ACA rashes on Lyme disease patients for the first time in Canada."

		"abstract": "Despite the constant development of biotechnology, laboratory diagnostics of Lyme disease in children still poses a significant challenge. The aim of this article is to present the current methods of Lyme disease diagnosis and its future perspectives. A serological test is often the first step in supporting clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Recently, a new generation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays has been created. These assays use recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides in their antigenic spectrum. It is postulated that these tests may replace the classic immunoblot as the second step in the Lyme disease diagnostic protocol. Direct detection methods based on bacterial culture techniques or using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have inadequate sensitivity, which prevents their widespread use in clinical practice. Recently, a number of other tools have been developed that are of supportive importance. Among them, measuring of the CXCL13 chemokine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has the potential to become a routine procedure in the diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Future diagnostic strategies of Lyme disease might include: innovative immunological tests using new antigens, combining serology with direct methods in order to increase sensitivity, standardization of selected unconventional tests, identification of host response biochemical metabolic markers or linking clinical symptoms reported by patients with appropriate test panels. In the absence a vaccine which protects against the disease, the preventive recommendations given to parents to prevent tick bites in children remain valid."

The risk of developing Lyme disease after a single tick bite does not exceed 1%. Clinically overt disease develops usually after 0.3-1.4% bites. Lyme disease may affect many organs and is chronic. Symptoms may include skin, eyes, nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive and urogenital system. Cardiovascular system involvement occurs, according to va­rious reports, in 0.5 to 10% of cases. Men are sick more often than women, young patients predominate, < 50 years old. The clinical onset is acute and atrioventricular conduction disturbances are most commonly diagnosed (80-90% of cases). Atrioventricular blocks: first (>70%), second (30%) and third (70%) degree may occur. There are also descriptions of cardiac arrhythmias – both supraventricular and ventricular – as well as cases of prolonged QT interval, especially in children. Identification of patients who are more likely to have a third degree atrioventricular block in Lyme disease is critical to ensure timely and appropriate treatment. In most patients, antibiotic treatment helps to avoid the use of permanent cardiac pacing, but 20-50% of patients may need temporary pacing. In patients quickly, correctly diagnosed and treated – the prognosis is good."

The aim of this review was to summarize published data on clinical and economic outcomes associated with LD. Methods: A literature review was conducted to identify all studies of LD that incorporate both clinical outcomes and costs. Included studies were described and categorized based on costs consistent with best practices used in economic evaluation. Results: The most frequent costs identified focused on formal health costs and productivity losses were the most common costs identified outside of the health system. Travel and informal care costs were less frequently reported. Clinical and economic outcomes of LD are primarily studied through economic models or observational analyses and focus on formal health care. Conclusions: This review provides and overview of existing evidence and recommendations for future economic analyses in LD."

		"abstract": "Nowadays Lyme disease (systemic tick-borne borreliosis, Lyme borreliosis) remains one of the most widespread zoonotic diseases with inoculable transmission mechanism, with ixodid ticks as carriers and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato as the causative agent. The disease is characterized by a staged course and severe damage to various organs and systems. In Ukraine, the natural foci of this disease are almost throughout the country. Sumy region occupies a leading place in terms of morbidity. In Ukraine, the most affected regions are Kyiv (29.00 cases per 100 thousand population), Cherkasy (25.4), Vinnytsia (23.9), Sumy (25.89) regions, and Kyiv city (22.54). Lyme disease is mainly registered in the spring-autumn period, this may be due to increased visits to recreation areas and seasonal activity of ticks (May–June, September–October). Scientific data about etiology, epidemiology, clinical course, diagnostics, therapy, and disease preventive measures were analyzed. It was found that B. burgdorferi s. l. is one of the most widespread agents with inoculable transmission mechanism on the European continent, including Ukraine. There is no single worldwide conception concerning preventive measures, diagnostics, and treatment, which necessitates the further study of this problem. Detection of antibodies to B. Burgdorferi s. l. in the human blood serum is not evidence of infection but testifies the previous contact with these pathogens and the presence of high risk of Lyme disease development. To improve the epidemiologic situation concerning Lyme disease it is required to study sites of the disease in Ukraine more thoroughly, to improve epidemiological surveillance system by creating disease spread map for diseases which are transferred by ticks in Sumy region, to plan a series of anti-epidemic and preventive measures, which are of practical use for population, to prevent asymptomatic disease course and chronization."

According to ECDC, Poland should be considered as an endemic area. The risk of Lyme disease incidence in-creases with tick habitats increase, which is a response to environmental factors and climate change. AIM OF THE STUDY. The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2018 compared to the situation in previous years. MATERIAL AND METHODS. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on the basis of the data sent to NIPH-NIH by voivodeship sanitary-epidemiological stations and published in the bulletin ‘Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2018’ . RESULTS. In 2018; 20,150 Lyme disease cases was registered, 2,124 people were hospitalized. You can also see an increase in cases in the second and third quarter in favor of the fourth quarter. The epidemiological situation in Western European countries is similar to the situation in Poland. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION. The inability to determine the clear trend of the epidemiological situation in Poland indicates the sensitivity of the surveillance system, but also the difficulty in new cases diagnosis. You can also see a decrease in the number of cases, which may be a sign of having the right tools or experience in the Lyme disease diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States. The disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, a skin rash, and joint pain. If left untreated, infection can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system, resulting in inflammation and long-term symptoms that include arthritis and/or intermittent pain in joints and muscles, facial palsy, cardiovascular abnormalities and cognitive disturbances. Recent research suggests that late-stage Lyme disease may be a result of malfunctioning immune function. AHCCÒ is a natural immune modulating compound derived from a unique fraction of special cultured medicinal mushroom mycelia. Previous studies have also suggested that AHCCÒ exhibits preventive effect against a wide range of infections caused by MRSA, influenza and West Nile virus. The effect of AHCCÒ supplementation on Lyme disease patients was evaluated in the current study.Methods: In a pilot open-label study, 12 Lyme disease patients were administered 3 grams of AHCCÒ daily for 8 weeks. Before commencement of the administration and after 4 and 8 weeks, the effects of AHCCÒ were evaluated clinically based on symptoms, serum antibodies to pathogens, inflammatory activity and serum immunological parameters. Patients completed questionnaires pertaining to Qualify of Life parameters.Results: After 8 weeks of AHCCÒ administration, AHCCÒ ameliorated flu-like symptoms and manifestations in the eye, joint, muscle, nervous system and cardiovascular system. In addition, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an index as inflammation and serum interleukin-8 was significantly decreased.Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that AHCCÒ may be effective in treating patients with Lyme disease."

Methodology: three questionnaires were designed and applied to 290 individuals (40 small animal veterinarians, 50 in other professional practice and 200 veterinary students). Results and discussion: in general, the three groups were unaware about the disease, although there is a high interest in learning about this problem. Graduates from seven universities included in this study stated that Lyme disease was not part of the veterinary curriculum in their schools. Five clinical cases suggestive of Lyme disease occurring in dogs in the area were detected at the time of this research. Conclusion: although the presence of the agent causing Lyme disease has not been demonstrated in the studied area due to the lack of laboratory support and the apparent absence of the vector, it cannot be ruled out; furthermore, it is important that veterinary practitioners and student alike be aware of the potential presence of Lyme disease, paying particular attention to differential diagnosis when resembling clinical signs are observed."

Lyme arthritis is now less frequently seen than at the time of its discovery. However, it still occurs, and it is important to recognize this, the differential diagnoses, and how laboratory tests can be useful and their limitations. The most frequently used diagnostic tests are antibody based. However, antibody testing still suffers from many drawbacks and is only an indirect measure of exposure. In contrast, evolving direct diagnostic methods can indicate active infection."

Antibody detection is the most frequently used laboratory test, favoring a two-step serodiagnostic algorithm; immunoenzymatic detection of antibodies to C6 has been shown to perform similarly to a standard two-step workflow. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of the C6 Lyme ELISA kit compared to a standard two-step algorithm in three laboratories located in the northeastern region of Italy which cater to areas with different LD epidemiology. A total of 804 samples were tested, of which 695 gave concordant results between C6 testing and routine workflow (564 negative, 131 positive). Wherever available, clinical presentation and additional laboratory tests were analyzed to solve discrepancies. The C6 based method showed a good concordance with the standard two-step algorithm (Cohen’s κ = 0.619), however, the distribution of discrepancies seems to point towards a slightly lower specificity of C6 testing, which is supported by literature and could impact on patient management. The C6 ELISA, therefore, is not an ideal stand-alone test; however, if integrated into a two-step algorithm, it might play a part in achieving a sensitive, specific laboratory diagnosis of LD."

		"abstract": "Whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can persist for long periods in the human body has been a controversial question. The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation."

		"abstract": "Background. Lyme disease, the most common anthropozoonosis, is a transmissible natural focal infection affecting various organs and systems. Also known as Lyme borreliosis, it is caused by Borrelia spirochetes, which are distributed by ticks of the genus Ixodes. Early diagnosis is difficult due to frequent occurrence of atypical symptoms, unnoticed tick bites, the absence of migratory erythematous lesions, and symptoms occurring during the nontick season. If not diagnosed and treated in time, dissemination of the infection occurs and various complications develop since borrelias damage not only the skin but also the nervous system, joints, and, in rare cases, the heart and eyes. Materials and methods. This article presents a clinical case of Lyme borreliosis-induced myocarditis, which led to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and, consequently, urgent cardiac transplantation. According to our data, this is one of the first described cases of this complication in the world. Results and conclusions. When diagnosed in time and treated properly, the prognosis of Lyme myocarditis is usually good. In most cases, the atrioventricular block disappears within 1–2 weeks of antibiotic treatment and the implantation of a temporary pacemaker is rarely needed. In those rare cases of a chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection, dilated cardiomyopathy may develop; thus if a sudden atrioventricular block occurs, the physician should be vigilant and perform the necessary tests to exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Background: The sensitivity of current antibody detection assays against Borrelia burgdorferi in the early stage of Lyme disease is very low. In children especially, who commonly have febrile viral illnesses, manifestations of early Lyme disease can be misdiagnosed. We previously demonstrated that IFNγ secretion could be detected in whole blood collected from Lyme disease patients at first clinical presentation following overnight incubation of the blood with peptides derived from B. burgdorferi. In the present study, we further evaluated the utility of IFNγ release for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease in children with varying stages of the illness. Methods: Children ages 2–18 years with no prior history of Lyme disease and with manifestations of Lyme disease at any stage were enrolled in the study. Sick and healthy controls were enrolled for comparison. We collected history and physical examination data and blood samples at the time of enrollment, at 1 month, and at 6 months. Standard 2-tier testing with ELISA (whole cell sonicate [WCS] and C6) and western blot were run in parallel to the IFNγ release assay for all blood samples. Sensitivity and specificity of the study assay were determined for presentation at all stages of Lyme disease. Clinical data were summarized. Results: Blood samples from 22 patients with Lyme disease and 7 controls (4 sick, 3 healthy) were obtained at the first visit. The IFNγ release assay detected early and early disseminated Lyme disease with 78% sensitivity compared with 59% sensitivity of 2-tier testing in our study. For patients presenting with a single erythema migrans (EM) lesion, the IFNγ release assay detected Lyme disease with 63% sensitivity compared with 14% sensitivity with 2-tier testing. The IFNγ release assay had only 25% sensitivity for detecting late disease. A single control patient was positive for both the IFNγ release assay and 2-tier serology. Conclusion: A novel IFNγ release assay demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity when compared with 2-tier testing in the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients presenting with a single EM lesion. Future study is needed to determine its utility in detecting early Lyme disease in patients with nonspecific febrile illness in the absence of erythema migrans. Disclosures: R.

Concepts like the true burden of the illness, from incidence rates to longstanding consequences of infection, and optimal case management, also remain shrouded in controversy. At the heart of this multidisciplinary issue are the causative spirochetal pathogens belonging to the Borrelia Lyme complex. Their unusual physiology and versatile lifestyle have challenged microbiologists, and may also hold the key to unlocking mysteries of the disease. The goal of this review is therefore to integrate established and emerging concepts of Borrelia biology and pathogenesis, and position them in the broader context of biomedical research and clinical practice. We begin by considering the conventions around diagnosing and characterizing Lyme disease that have served as a conceptual framework for the discipline. We then explore virulence from the perspective of both host (genetic and environmental predispositions) and pathogen (serotypes, dissemination, and immune modulation), as well as considering antimicrobial strategies (lab methodology, resistance, persistence, and clinical application), and borrelial adaptations of hypothesized medical significance (phenotypic plasticity or pleomorphy)."

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect that coinfection with Babesiosis and Lyme Disease has on standard and novel biomarkers markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and procalcitonin (Pc), which may assist in elucidating how these pathogens interact within human hosts. Methods: Babesia cases were collected from Stony Brook University Hospital from 2012 to 2019. Cases of Babesia were included if parasites were detected by peripheral blood smear and confirmed by PCR. Lyme disease diagnosis criteria involved 2-tier testing per CDC guidelines. Cases were divided into three cohorts based on if they had CRP, ESR or Pc tested. Cohorts were divided into two groups: Babesiosis alone vs coinfection with Lyme Disease. Median values were analyzed for the following biomarkers across both groups: parasitemia, hemoglobin (Hgb), white blood cells (WBC), platelets, indirect bilirubin (IB), lactate dehydrogenase, ESR, CRP and Pc. Fisher Exact and Wilcoxon Rank sum tests were used and P values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: ESR values trended higher in monoinfection compared to coinfection (50 vs 36 mm/hr, p=0.63). Within this cohort, the coinfection group had significantly lower platelet values compared to monoinfection (52 vs. 75.5 K/uL, p=0.04, Table 1). Within the CRP and Pc cohorts, monoinfection had higher trends of parasitemia compared to coinfection (CRP group: 1.6 vs 0.7%, p=0.14, Pc group: 1.4 vs 0.7% p=1.0, Table 2&3). Pc levels were similar in both groups (1.1 vs 1.2 ng/mL, p=1.0, Table 3). Conclusion: Coinfection had significantly lower platelets within the ESR cohort but not in other cohorts. While not statistically significant, monoinfection showed greater trends of ESR and parasitemia, which is consistent with previous studies that suggest that Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

It was after the second spontaneous tear that the patient's recent diagnosis of Lyme disease became the likely culprit. Often, patients with chronic Lyme disease present with an elaborate clinical picture that can mimic many more common diagnoses such as septic arthritis, transient synovitis, ligamentous sprain, and various other traumatic injuries. With the pathognomonic erythema migrans rash reported to be present less than 50% of the time in late-stage infections, the diagnosis of Lyme disease can often be difficult, with a high rate of underdiagnosis. It is important that Lyme disease be included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous tendon pathology, especially for physicians practicing in highly endemic areas. The treatment is relatively simple and successful—especially for an acute infection—and it is important to initiate treatment promptly to prevent disability."

Method: A narrative review was conducted and designed to present a broad perspective on Lyme disease, and describe its history and development in terms of clinical care and public health implications. A structured literature search was conducted based on the question; what is currently known about Lyme disease? Results: The narrative review is presented in chronological order in terms of a summary of the history of Lyme disease, the complexities of clinical diagnosis, the problematic interpretation of serologic testing, the conflicting guidelines for diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic Lyme, and benefits of antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: Despite growing global incidence of the Lyme disease, treatment has not attracted pharmaceutical investment, and the evidence base and international guidelines for treatment and management of chronic Lyme continue to be conflicting and controversial. The challenges of this immune mediated tick borne disease for public health policy and clinical practice are summarised, alongside directions for future research."

It has a worldwide distribution and it is transmitted by the ticks of ixodes species. The reservoir of the causative agent in nature are small rodents, wild mammals and birds. In man, the clinical picture is quite clear: the pathognomonic sign is the chronicum erythema migrans in the acute phase, while in the dog, the clinical picture is not as clear: it looks like that of lupus erythematosus. The most constant symptom is lameness caused by the affection of joints. Diagnosis is based on the detection of antibodies against borrelia by the IFA method. Concerning public health, it is mentioned that in the U.S and in northern European countries, it is the most frequent tickbone disease while in Greece only some sporadic cases have been reported."

This has created a need to understand the environmental and human components of LD risk in open habitats. This study quantified both elements of LD risk and compared these between treeless islands with high and low LD incidence. We found high LD incidence was linked to higher prevalence in ticks (6.4% vs 0.4%) and increased human tick bite exposure. Most reported tick bites (72.7%) were within 1km of the home address and commonly in gardens. Residents on islands with high LD incidence reported increasing problems with ticks and suggested changing deer distribution as a potential driver. This study highlights the benefits to public health of an integrated approach to understand the factors contributing to LD emergence and a need to evaluate LD ecology in treeless habitats more broadly."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. This species undergoes a life cycle consisting of eggs and three active stages: larva, nymph, and adult. Each active life stage takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of blood digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within endosomes of acidic digestive cells. However, in other hematophagous arthropods, the serine protease trypsin plays an important role in early protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of I. scapularis cathepsins and serine proteases, some with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. Gut pH was also determined and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels during blood digestion. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 days post host detachment, respectively. In addition, alkaline gut pH (8.0) conditions after I. scapularis blood feeding were similar to those required for trypsin activity in other arthropods suggesting these enzymes have an important and previously overlooked role in I. scapularis blood digestion."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease (LD) is caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Over the past ten years, robust local public health data indicates that the incidence of LD has increased significantly in the eastern region of Ontario due to the spread of its vector, the blacklegged tick. As a result, we have seen an increase in the number of cases of LD in children at our tertiary paediatric centre, at all stages of infection. Familiarity with Lyme disease is important as incidence increases. We sought to characterize the cases at our centre. Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of LD in children at our centre from 2009-2018, as well as the variety of clinical presentations of paediatric LD. Design/Methods: We completed a retrospective chart review from 2009-2018 of all cases admitted or seen in the Infectious Disease (ID) clinic or the Emergency Department (ED) with a diagnosis of LD. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected, including geographic location where infection occurred and resource utilization. We used descriptive statistics to describe cases and comparative statistics to determine changes in number of cases over time. Results: There were 171 LD cases managed at our centre during this period. Mean age was 7.4 (SD 4.5) years, 89 (52.0%) were male. The annual number of cases from 2009 - 2018 increased from 1 to 44 and peaked in 2017 (47 cases). The highest number of cases occurred among children &lt;6, the lowest in children ≥11. Most cases occurred in summer (60%), with the fewest in winter months (4%). Stage of LD was not documented in 1 case. Of the remainder, 98 (57.6%) cases were early localized, 41 (25.7%) early disseminated and 31 (19.7%) late disseminated LD. Conclusion: Cases of LD managed at our paediatric centre have increased in keeping with population trends, with all LD stages experienced. Severe cases of meningitis, carditis, and arthritis resulted in hospitalization, with increasing numbers over the study period."

Factors influencing the number of LD cases range from environmental to system-level variables, but little is known about the influence of vegetation (canopy, understory, and ground cover) and human behavioral risk on LD cases and exposure to infected ticks. We determined the influence of various risk factors on the risk of exposure to infected ticks on 22 different walkways using multinomial logistic regression. The model classifies the walkways into high-risk and low-risk categories with 90% accuracy, in which the understory, human risk, and number of rodents are significant indicators. These factors should be managed to control the risk of transmission of LD to humans."

		"abstract": "Introduction: Lyme disease is a tickborne illness that generates controversy among medical providers and researchers. One of the key topics of debate is the existence of persistent infection with the Lyme spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, in patients who have been treated with recommended doses of antibiotics yet remain symptomatic. Persistent spirochetal infection despite antibiotic therapy has recently been demonstrated in non-human primates. We present evidence of persistent Borrelia infection despite antibiotic therapy in patients with ongoing Lyme disease symptoms. Materials &amp; Methods: In this pilot study, culture of body fluids and tissues was performed in a randomly selected group of 12 patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms who had been treated or who were being treated with antibiotics. Cultures were also performed on a group of 10 control subjects without Lyme disease. The cultures were subjected to corroborative microscopic, histopathological and molecular testing for Borrelia organisms in four independent laboratories in a blinded manner. Results: Motile spirochetes identified histopathologically as Borrelia were detected in culture specimens, and these spirochetes were genetically identified as&nbsp;Borrelia burgdorferi&nbsp;by three distinct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Spirochetes identified as&nbsp;Borrelia burgdorferi&nbsp;were cultured from the blood of seven subjects, from the genital secretions of ten subjects, and from a skin lesion of one subject. Cultures from control subjects without Lyme disease were negative for Borrelia using these methods. Conclusions: Using multiple corroborative detection methods, we showed that patients with persistent Lyme disease symptoms may have ongoing spirochetal infection despite antibiotic treatment, similar to findings in non-human primates. The optimal treatment for persistent Borrelia infection remains to be determined."

Prior to the diagnosis of Lyme disease, the patient also met the clinical diagnostic criteria for PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Strep), with serological evidence of three distinct episodes of streptococcal pharyngitis. All three episodes of strep occurred during the 6-months interval between suspected Lyme disease exposure and the onset of multiple neuropsychiatric symptoms. Her sometimes incapacitating symptoms followed a relapsing and remitting course that impacted her personal, family, social, and academic domains. Over a span of 31 consecutive months of treatment with various antimicrobials and three courses of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) she experienced complete remission and remains symptom free at the time of this publication. Written permission was obtained from the minor patient's mother allowing the submission and publication of this case study."

The source of such a long-running debate stems from the difference in opinions over the cause of long-term, persistent symptoms after treatment in some patients. Toward its end, Medicine has finally begun to embrace the existence of Chronic Lyme Disease, but changes still need to be made in the future."

		"abstract": "Background: Chronic Lyme disease (LD) is a matter of debate worldwide and has emerged as a social problem. We aim to analyze the media content and describe the transformation process of a collective pain into a social problem in France. Methods: Using social science methodology, a corpus of articles from 20 newspapers and videos from seven major TV stations from 1987 to 2017 were analyzed for discourse content. The speaking times and the frequency of interventions between doctors supporting the official guidelines and those against them were compared using the Mann–Whitney test and the Chi-square test, respectively. Results: In France, the media discourse is carried through testimonials from patient organizations and a professor of infectiology who acted as a whistleblower (WB). We showed that the emergence of the LD alert in the media corresponds to the process described by social sciences as ‘naming, blaming, claiming’. Since his first article in 2014, the WB has featured in 24% (22/89) of newspaper articles compared with 20% (18/89) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.52). Since his first appearance on a TV newscast in 2014, the WB has appeared in 45% (22/49) of news reports on LD with 24% of the speaking time compared with 22% (11/49) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.018). Conclusions: Media coverage of LD has been unbalanced since 2014 and promotes associations as well as the WB, who seems to be better identified than any of the different doctors defending the official guidelines."

		"abstract": "Climate change is facilitating the geographic range expansion of populations of the tick vector of Lyme disease Ixodes scapularis in Canada. Here, we characterize and map the spatio-temporal variability of environments suitable for I. scapularis using Earth observation (EO) data. A simple algorithm for I. scapularis occurrence (cumulative degree-days and forest: CSDF) was developed by combining cumulative annual surface degree-days above 0 °C and forest cover. To map the environmental risk of I. scapularis (risk of I. scapularis: RIS) in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015, CSDF was adjusted using data from an I. scapularis population model. CSDF was validated using cumulative annual degree days >0 °C (CADD) from meteorological stations, and CSDF was strongly associated with CADD (n = 52, R2 > 0.86, p < 0.001). Data on field surveillance for I. scapularis ticks (2008 to 2018) were used to validate the risk maps. The presence of I. scapularis ticks was significantly associated with CSDF, and at a limit of 2800, sensitivity approached 100%. RIS increased over the study period, with the highest values in 2012 and the lowest in 2000. The RIS was on average higher in Ontario and Quebec compared to other provinces, and it was higher in the southern parts of the provinces. The proportion of the populated areas with a positive RIS increased on average in central and eastern Canada from 2000 to 2015. Predicted I. scapularis occurrence identifies areas with a more probable risk of tick bites, Lyme disease, and other I. scapularis-borne diseases, which can help guide targeted surveillance, prevention, and control interventions."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is a spirochetal disease. Lyme disease-related ocular findings may also provide important clues. Ocular involvement is most commonly seen as uveitis, chorioretinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, papillitis, panuveitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, and retinal vasculitis. Case:: A 27-year-old male patient was admitted with a history of fatigue, malaise, and sudden loss of vision in his left eye for 3 days. The best visual acuity was found 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed no pathological findings in the right eye; but hyperfluorescence that was compatible with choroiditis foci was seen in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening in the left eye compared to the right eye. Lyme IgM antibody was found to be positive, explaining choroiditis etiology, while IgG values were found to be negative. Western blot verification test was positive. The patient was treated with 2 × 100 mg doxycycline (21 days) with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, prednol 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) for choroiditis. Omeprazole tablets were given 1 × 1 during the period of cortisone intake. On the third day of treatment, visual acuity increased to 20/200 and continued to increase until reaching 20/20 in the second week. Conclusions:: Lyme disease is rare, but must be kept in mind when investigating the etiology of chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The patient reported here is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in literature that shows atypical clinic for Lyme disease with unilateral chorioretinitis without Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)."

There are only two case reports in literature attributing Lyme disease to hyperbilirubinemia. Here we report a case of severe hyperbilirubinemia as the presenting symptom of Lyme disease. Other plausible etiologies have been ruled out after extensive workups, including liver biopsy. His hyperbilirubinemia gradually resolved after being started on doxycycline. With high incidence of Lyme disease, it should be considered for patients who present with hyperbilirubinemia in endemic areas with possible tick exposure."

CLD is an example of a contested condition and shares problems of legitimacy with other medically unexplained conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome. We use a critical discourse analysis (CDA) approach to understand the arguments of the authors to establish the legitimacy, or not, of a CLD diagnosis. This enabled us to make sense of the nature of the stalemate between patient groups and advocates of the medical establishment, as performed by authors of academic articles. In this article, we bring together the arguments to explain the polemical debate and to support accounts that avoid the impasse to give us greater insight into the experience of chronic illness."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is defined as sensorineural hearing loss of 30 dB or more over at least three adjacent audiometric frequencies occurring within a 72-h period of time. One of the causes of SSNHL could be the progressive inflammatory state caused by an infection. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of SSNHL caused by various factors, most importantly those potentially related to Lyme disease. Material and Methods: The study includes a group of 86 patients between the ages of 20 and 70 who were hospitalized due to SSNHL between 2017 and 2018. All of these patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological examination, including audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Results: In this group of 86 patients, nine patients presented with positive antibodies toward Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. This group was treated with antibiotics and experienced partial or complete regression of their deafness. This may suggest a relationship between SSNHL and Lyme disease. Conclusion: Infections caused by Borrelia burgdorferi may contribute to the development of inflammatory and angiopathic lesions, which are a possible cause of SSNHL. The longer the duration of the infection, the greater the likelihood of permanent and irreversible changes in the vessels of the cochlea or auditory nerve. Therefore, serological tests for Borrelia burgdorferi should be performed during the diagnosis of SSNHL as a possible cause of this illness."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore blood digestion is very important for tick survival. Most studies on blood digestion in ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. However, most of these studies have focused on partially engorged ticks. In other hematophagous arthropods, the serine proteases play an important role in blood protein degradation. In this study, we determined transcript expression of four I. scapularis serine proteases with previously characterized roles in blood digestion. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. An in vitro hemoglobinolytic assay was performed with or without serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after blood feeding and peaked in larvae, nymphs, and adults at 3, 1, and 1 day post host detachment, respectively. The knockdown of three previously identified serine proteases by RNAi negatively impacted blood intake, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the gut and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation in vitro. A trypsin inhibitor, PMSF, blocked the action of trypsin in the gut extract resulting in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Our data also demonstrated that in addition to blood digestion, these serine proteases might have a role in blood feeding success in I. scapularis."

		"abstract": "Background and objectives: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in Europe, caused by the spirocheta bacteria of Borrelia burgdorferi. Several genospecies of B. burgdorferi are pathogenic to humans. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is prevalent in North America, causes reactive arthritis, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii, common in Europe, can affect the skin, heart, or nervous system; it has been shown that the clinical symptoms of the disease may be very different. The objective of this study was to identify the baseline characteristics of Lyme disease and to elucidate the frequency of different Lyme disease syndromes in Lithuania. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed with Lyme disease during an ambulatory visit to the Center of Infectious Diseases, Vilnius University Santaros clinics, from 2014 to 2016, were enrolled in this study. A retrospective material analysis was conducted. Results: In total, 1005 patients were enrolled with the following prevalence of clinical syndromes: erythema migrans (EM), 945 (94.02%); Lyme arthritis, 32 (3.18%); neuroborreliosis, 23 (2.28%); Lyme carditis, 4 (0.39%); and acrodermatitis, 1 (0.09%). Erythema migrans was dominant among middle-aged women, with a rash appearing mainly on the lower extremities. Lyme arthritis mainly manifested among middle-aged women as an oligoarthritis, mostly affecting the knee joint. Neuroborreliosis was seen more often in middle-aged women than men and the main symptom was nervus facialis neuropathy. Lyme carditis, manifested as an atrioventricular block, with a male/female ratio of 3:1, and the median age was 51. Acrodermatitis was diagnosed in a 61-year-old woman, as a painful, red rash on the hand. Conclusions: According to the prevalence of B. garinii and B. afzelii in Europe, previously it was thought that Lyme disease presented as erythema migrans, and less frequently as neuroborreliosis; however, this study revealed that other syndromes may also be seen. In addition, we revealed that the longer it takes for erythema migrans to appear, the greater the likelihood of Lyme arthritis developing."

LD can affect the vestibulocochlear nerve, leading to hearing loss and vertigo/dizziness. Material and Methods: The study included a group of 38 patients between the ages of 20 and 77, who were hospitalized due to vertigo/dizziness between 2018 and 2019. All of the patients underwent a detailed medical interview and an otolaryngological and neurological examination, including video electronystagmography (VENG), in addition to audiological and diagnostic tests. Additionally, ELISA and Western blot tests were performed to confirm the diagnosis of LD. Results: In 20 patients (53%), the Romberg trial was positive (p < 0.001). The degree of vestibular dysfunction as shown by the VENG test was associated with the rate of hearing loss as confirmed by the Auditory Brainstem Response (ABR) test (p = 0.011), and it mainly concerned high-frequency sounds (p = 0.014). Conclusion: Vertigo can be a symptom of LD. It is often associated with labyrinth and hearing-organ damage, which can imply that the inner ear or nerve VIII is dysfunctional in the course of this disease. Antibiotic therapy is effective in reducing otoneurological symptoms."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, which is primarily caused by infection with the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi in the United States or other Borrelia species internationally, presents an ongoing challenge for diagnostics. Serological testing is the primary means of diagnosis but testing approaches differ widely, with varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, there is currently no reliable test to determine disease resolution following treatment. A distinct challenge in Lyme disease diagnostics is the variable patterns of human immune response to a plurality of antigens presented by Borrelia spp. during the infection. Thus, multiplexed testing approaches that capture these patterns and detect serological response against multiple antigens may be the key to prompt, accurate Lyme disease diagnosis. In this review, current state-of-the-art multiplexed diagnostic approaches are presented and compared with respect to their diagnostic accuracy and their potential for monitoring response to treatment."

Methods: Participants were 82 individuals who had a confirmed diagnosis of Lyme disease and had been experiencing symptoms for 6 months or more. They were recruited through various online mechanisms (e.g., social media, online support groups), and they completed the consent form and questionnaires via Qualtrics. Participants completed questions about their demographics and health status as well as the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (Moss-Morris et al., 2002), the Brief COPE (Carver, 1997), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). Results: Illness perceptions and coping explained a significant amount of variance in HRQOL. Among the illness perceptions, the consequences and identity dimensions were most strongly associated with HRQOL. Behavioral disengagement and substance use were the coping strategies most strongly associated with the emotional health outcomes. Discussion: Illness perceptions and coping are related to HRQOL among individuals with CLD. Given the increase in Lyme disease incidence and the chronicity of symptoms in some cases, it is critical to continue to examine the psychosocial factors associated with HRQOL in this population."

Borrelia infections can cause an intrathecal inflammatory response with accompanying cerebral and spinal imaging findings. Cases. Two children with acute or subacute initial neurological presentation, subsequent relapsing  course, and MR imaging features suggestive of multiple sclerosis are presented. A history of tick bite or dramatic response to antibiotic treatment supported Lyme disease in the beginning, but requirement of disaese-modifying treatment later in the course supported multiple sclerosis. Results. These cases carrying features supportive of both multiple sclerosis and Lyme disease caused clinical dilemma and were treated for both disorders. Borrelia-specific IgG index testing before any treatment could have prevented the difficulty in differential diagnosis. Conclusions. Clinical, imaging and CSF findings of multiple sclerosis and acute or chronic progressive borrelia encephalomyelitis may overlap and testing for Borrelia-specific intrathecal antibody synthesis should not be omitted in endemic areas."

The current study compared the level of knowledge and the knowledge needs about Lyme disease among individuals that spend time outdoors for work and for recreational purposes. Between December 2018 and February 2019, a survey was distributed to outdoor organizations across New Brunswick, Canada. Within the current sample of 137 individuals, 36% spent time outdoors for their occupation and 64% for recreational activities. Results showed no significant difference between these groups with regard to their level of knowledge, perceived efficacy and performance of various methods of prevention, and educational needs. Overall, the entire sample reported a low level of knowledge about Lyme disease. Participants perceived each prevention behavior to be at least somewhat effective, and behaviors perceived to be more effective were more likely to be carried out, but the performance of the behaviors varied. The most frequently performed behaviors included wearing long pants and protective footwear. Participants identified several aspects of Lyme disease about which they would like to have more information. The findings call attention to the specific needs of at-risk groups that must be considered when developing educational interventions."

Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (sNPH) based on chronic infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi (Bb) is an even rarer entity, that with the right treatment is potentially curable. Case presentation: A 67-year-old male with a slow onset of progressive balance problems, also presented unspecified dizziness, urge feeling, neck soreness and discrete cognitive complaints. An MRI scan revealed an enlarged ventricular system compatible with NPH. After further liquor dynamic procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed with the surprising results of lymphocytic pleocytosis, and signs of increased antibody production. Microbiology revealed chronic neuroborreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics accordingly. At the one-year follow-up no symptoms remained and the ventricular system almost normalized. Conclusions: We describe the 7th published case of sNPH secondary to chronic Borreliosis in a previous healthy adult. Existing published literature has been reviewed and previous cases showed similarly nearly full clinical recovery. Primary/idiopathic NPH (iNPH) is treated with the surgical intervention of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and can be mistaken for a sNPH. The awareness of rare causes of sNPH like chronic Borreliosis is important as it is easily treated non surgically."

		"abstract": "Objective: Chronic Lyme disease has been a poorly defined term and often dismissed as a fictitious entity. In this paper, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) provides its evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease. Definition: ILADS defines chronic Lyme disease (CLD) as a multisystem illness with a wide range of symptoms and/or signs that are either continuously or intermittently present for a minimum of six months. The illness is the result of an active and ongoing infection by any of several pathogenic members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bbsl). The infection has variable latency periods and signs and symptoms may wax, wane and migrate. CLD has two subcategories, CLD, untreated (CLD-U) and CLD, previously treated (CLD-PT). The latter requires that CLD manifestations persist or recur following treatment and are present continuously or in a relapsing/remitting pattern for a duration of six months or more. Methods: Systematic review of over 250 peer reviewed papers in the international literature to characterize the clinical spectrum of CLD-U and CLD-PT. Conclusion: This evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease clarifies the term’s meaning and the literature review validates that chronic and ongoing Bbsl infections can result in chronic disease. Use of this CLD definition will promote a better understanding of the infection and facilitate future research of this infection."

For this reason, affection of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) caused by Lyme disease (LD) can be misdiagnosed as a common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). The purpose of this case report of a 25-year old woman presenting to the Departments of Orthodontics and Maxillofacial Surgery with extensive symptoms of Temporomandibular Disorder is to illustrate the delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease, which was only made after extensive therapy of the temporomandibular joint. The specialist literature only reports a few cases of patients suffering from Lyme disease with TMJ manifestations. This case report and the relevant literature review aim to emphasize the importance of accurate request of medical history and differential diagnosis of acute TMJ arthritis and arthralgia. Early interdisciplinary diagnosis of Lyme disease and early antibiotic therapy are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary, sometimes invasive, therapies."

However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory/attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% (n=16) performed in the impaired range. Among the 239 patients who displayed sufficient performance validity, 2.9% (n=7) were classified as cognitively impaired. No association between subjective cognitive symptoms and objective impairment was found. Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment."

Three international database (electronic PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus) and two national database (Ulakbim and Turkmedline) searches were performed using the following keywords ([‘Lyme’ or ‘Borrelia burgdorferi’ or ‘Borrelia’ or ‘Borreliosis’] and ‘Turkey [and/country]’). National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNNDS) of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria were used for classification. A PRISMA-based algorithm was used for systematic review. There were a total of 75 LD cases in 36 different reports. Studies related to LD are confined to case reports. We believe that LD is an important healthcare problem in Turkey and to our knowledge this is the first systematic review from this country."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. As the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the USA, LD affects 300,000 human cases each year. LD is caused by inoculation of the bacterial spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, from an infected tick. If not treated quickly and completely, the bacteria disseminate from the tick's biting site into multiple organs including the joints, heart, and brain. Thus, the best outcome from medical intervention can be expected with early detection and treatment with antibiotics, prior to multi-organ dissemination. In the absence of a characteristic rash, LD is diagnosed using serological testing involving enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by western blotting, which is collectively known as the two-tier algorithm. These assays detect host antibodies against the bacteria, but are hampered by low sensitivity, which can miss early LD cases. This review discusses the application of some current assays for diagnosing LD clinically, thus providing a foundation for exploring newer techniques being developed in the laboratory for more sensitive detection of early LD."

LD can present with a wide range of symptoms depending on time since infection; from localised skin reactions such as erythema migrans, to widespread multi-system involvement. There may be non-specific symptoms of malaise, aching joints and muscles, and cognitive effects. Treatment with antibiotics is effective, especially if started in the early stages of infection. There is rising awareness of LD by the general public through media coverage and high-profile celebrity cases. Greater awareness has benefits, such as increased diagnosis and treatment of LD. However, cases in the media tend to highlight delays in diagnosis and complications of LD, which can lead to high levels of patient anxiety about the risks of LD."

		"abstract": "Abstract: In an update of earlier surveys conducted in Connecticut and New Jersey in the mid-1990s, an online survey of private commercial pest control firms engaged in residential tick control showed that the application of synthetic acaricides continues to be the primary method of control used. The carbamate and organophospate acaricides, previously the most commonly used against ticks, have given way to synthetic pyrethroids and, to a lesser extent, the use of natural product/organic acaricides. Typical costs for a single acaricide application today ($100–$200 for a 1 acre [0.4 ha] property) remain similar to those reported from the earlier surveys, although the frequency of applications and, therefore, also the overall annual cost has increased. The application habitats within residential properties, life stages targeted, and application equipment used have not changed appreciably since the mid-1990s. While most survey respondents expressed knowledge of natural product acaricides and Damminix Tick Tubes, many reported that they either did not employ or knew very little about other alternative tick control methods (including entomopathogenic fungus and topical application of acaricides to tick hosts via 4-Poster deer treatment stations or Select TCS rodent bait boxes). This suggests either a failure to adequately inform the pest management industry and their potential client base of the availability of alternate methods, and/or industry concerns about cost and effectiveness of the alternatives."

Concomitant with the increased incidence of infection has been an enhancement in the recognition of LD complications. Here, we report a case of Lyme carditis complicated by heart block in a pediatric patient admitted to our children’s hospital. What is unique about this case is that the complaint of chest palpitations is an infrequent presentation of LD, and what it adds to the scientific literature is an improved understanding of LD in the pediatric population. Case presentation: The patient was a 16-year-old male who presented with the main concerns of acute onset of palpitations and chest pain. An important clinical finding was Conclusions: Lyme carditis occurs in < 5% of LD cases, but the “take-away” lesson of this case is that carditis can be the presenting manifestation of"

MRI showed white matter lesions consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), but no optic nerve enhancement. Eight months later, the left eye was affected in the same manner. Examination showed right optic atrophy and apparent left optic disc swelling. Workup revealed positive Lyme IgG. Differential diagnosis included optic neuritis and Lyme optic neuropathy, and he was treated with intravenous steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and intravenous ceftriaxone without improvement. Neuro-ophthalmology consultation led to identification of pseudo-optic disc oedema, and Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) was suspected and confirmed by genetic testing. LHON may occur in association with MS, and should be considered in patients with MS with vision loss atypical for optic neuritis. This is especially important as new treatments for LHON (including gene therapy) are currently undergoing clinical trials."

		"abstract": "Abstract: Tick-borne infections—including tick-borne encephalitis viruses, represented in the United States by rare infections with Powassan and deer tick viruses, and more often Lyme disease—are of increasing importance to neurologists. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) causes all or part of a triad including meningitis, radiculoneuritis, and cranial neuritis. Rarely, parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement occur, with focal findings on examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LNB diagnosis requires plausible exposure, objective evidence of nervous system involvement, and, generally, positive two-tier serology. Central nervous system (CNS) LNB is almost always accompanied by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cells, protein), often with intrathecal antibody production, which is determined by concentration-adjusted comparison of serum and CSF antibody. Measuring CSF antibody in isolation and nucleic acid-based testing of CSF are not useful in LNB and should be avoided. LNB treatment is highly effective with a 2- to 3-week course of antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that LNB not involving the CNS parenchyma can be treated successfully with oral doxycycline."

Projections estimate that by the year 2049 all health units in Ontario will have suitable environmental conditions for the establishment of this vector. A review of website content from health units in Ontario was performed to assess the quality of tick and Lyme disease information provided to the public and health care providers. Websites were evaluated based on criteria such as the provision of Lyme disease information (i.e., transmission, symptoms, treatment, etc.), the inclusion of misleading or incorrect information, and visuals provided. The quality of textual and visual information varied substantially across the 35 health units analyzed. Eleven health units were found to provide misleading or incorrect information. Disparities were found between areas with current Lyme disease risk and those without. The majority of health units did not include satisfactory visual content pertaining to ticks. Given the expected expansion and intensification of blacklegged tick populations across the province, all health units must ensure the information communicated to the public about ticks and Lyme disease is of high-quality and consistent. We conclude with specific recommendations to improve the textual and visual content of websites."

		"abstract": "Seasonal variation in spatial distribution and pathogen prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) influences human population risk of Lyme disease in peri-urban built environments. Parks, gardens, playgrounds, school campuses and neighborhoods represent a significant risk for Lyme disease transmission. From June 2012 through May 2014, ticks were collected using 1 m2 corduroy cloths dragged over low-lying vegetation parallel to walkways with high human foot traffic. DNA was extracted from ticks, purified and presence of B. burgdorferi assessed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. Summer is reported as the time of highest risk for Lyme disease transmission in the United States and our results indicate a higher tick density of 26.0/1000 m2 in summer vs. 0.2/1000 m2 to 10.5/1000 m2 in spring and fall. However, our findings suggest that tick infection rate is proportionally higher during the fall and spring than summer (30.0–54.7% in fall and 36.8–65.6% in spring vs. 20.0–28.2% in summer). Seasonal variation in infected tick density has significant implications for Lyme disease transmission as people are less likely to be aware of ticks in built environments, and unaware of increased infection in ticks in spring and fall. These factors may lead to more tick bites resulting in Lyme infection."

Material and methods: The study included 59 (age range 41.68 ± 16.37 years) patients with Lyme disease whose single-photon emission tomography imaging was performed before and after the human embryonic stem cell therapy. Technetium-hexa methyl propylene aminoxime single-photon emission tomography imaging was used to assess the hypoperfused lesions/regions in the brain prior to the therapy, as well as the improvement in perfusion after human embryonic stem cell treatment. Results: After receiving human embryonic stem cell therapy, single-photon emission tomography imaging reflects a significant (>60%) improvement in 43 patients along with moderate (30–60%) and mild (<30%) improvement in 12 and four patients, respectively. The cerebral perfusion flow improved and the degree of hypoperfusion in the other regions significantly decreased after the human embryonic stem cell therapy. Interpretation of single-photon emission tomography imaging of brain images (before and after therapy) clearly presented the changes in color at various brain regions which represent the improvements in patients. Conclusion: Single-photon emission tomography imaging could be used as a potential diagnostic tool to assess the response of Lyme disease patients to human embryonic stem cell therapy."

We report a case of acute neuroborreliosis that manifested as extended isolated cervical myelitis. Not only the manifestation as isolated myelitis in the early stages of borreliosis represents a rarity, but also the strong contrast between mild clinical symptoms and pronounced imaging findings in this case is remarkable."

		"abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding treatment of Lyme disease patients who do not respond fully to initial short-term antibiotic therapy. Choosing the best treatment approach and duration remains challenging because treatment response among these patients varies: some patients improve with treatment while others do not. A previous study examined treatment response variation in a sample of over 3500 patients enrolled in the MyLymeData patient registry developed by LymeDisease.org (San Ramon, CA, USA). That study used a validated Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale to identify three treatment response subgroups among Lyme disease patients who remained ill: nonresponders, low responders, and high responders. The present study first characterizes the health status, symptom severity, and percentage of treatment response across these three patient subgroups together with a fourth subgroup, patients who identify as well. We then employed machine learning techniques across these subgroups to determine features most closely associated with improved patient outcomes, and we used traditional statistical techniques to examine how these features relate to treatment response of the four groups. High treatment response was most closely associated with (1) the use of antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and alternative treatments, (2) longer duration of treatment, and (3) oversight by a clinician whose practice focused on the treatment of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "This study provides a novel method of documenting established populations of bird-feeding ticks. Single populations of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, were revealed in southwestern Québec, Canada. Blacklegged tick nymphs and, similarly, larval and nymphal rabbit ticks were tested for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), using PCR and the flagellin (flaB) gene, and 14 (42%) of 33 of blacklegged tick nymphs tested were positive. In contrast, larval and nymphal H. leporsipalustris ticks were negative for Bbsl. The occurrence of Bbsl in I. scapularis nymphs brings to light the presence of a Lyme disease endemic area at this songbird nesting locality. Because our findings denote that this area is a Lyme disease endemic area, and I. scapularis is a human-biting tick, local residents and outdoor workers must take preventive measures to avoid tick bites. Furthermore, local healthcare practitioners must include Lyme disease in their differential diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Accurate laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis), caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (BB), is difficult and yet important to prevent serious disease. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) presently recommends a screening test for serum antibodies followed by confirmation with a more specific Western blot (WB) test to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against antigens in whole cell lysates of BB. Borrelia species related to BB cause tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). TBRF is increasingly recognized as a health problem in the US and occurs in areas where Lyme disease is prevalent. The two groups of Borrelia share related antigens. We have developed a modified WB procedure termed the Lyme immunoblots (IBs) using recombinant antigens from common strains and species of the BB sensu lato complex for serological diagnosis of Lyme disease. A reference collection of 178 sera from 26 patients with and 152 patients without Lyme disease were assessed by WB and IB in a blinded manner using either criteria for positive antibody reactions recommended by the CDC or criteria developed in-house. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values obtained with the reference sera suggest that the Lyme IB is superior to the Lyme WB for detection of specific antibodies in Lyme disease. The Lyme IB showed no significant reaction with rabbit antisera produced against two Borrelia species causing TBRF in the US, suggesting that the Lyme IB may be also useful for excluding TBRF."

The causative agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, is capable of establishing a persistent infection within the host. This is despite the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune responses. B. burgdorferi utilizes several immune evasion tactics ranging from the regulation of surface proteins, tick saliva, antimicrobial peptide resistance, and the disabling of the germinal center. This review aims to cover the various methods by which B. burgdorferi evades detection and destruction by the host immune response, examining both the innate and adaptive responses. By understanding the methods employed by B. burgdorferi to evade the host immune response, we gain a deeper knowledge of B. burgdorferi pathogenesis and Lyme disease, and gain insight into how to create novel, effective treatments."

Four patients were lost to follow-up, leaving 67 evaluable patients. Our retrospective review found patients to fall into a “high-dose” group (≥4 mg/kg/day) and a “low-dose” group (<4 mg/kg/day). In total, 62 of 67 (92.5%) patients treated with disulfiram were able to endorse a net benefit of the treatment with regard to their symptoms. Moreover, 12 of 33 (36.4%) patients who completed one or two courses of “high-dose” therapy enjoyed an “enduring remission”, defined as remaining clinically well for ≥6 months without further anti-infective treatment. The most common adverse reactions from disulfiram treatment in the high-dose group were fatigue (66.7%), psychiatric symptoms (48.5%), peripheral neuropathy (27.3%), and mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes (15.2%). We observed that although patients on high dose experienced a higher risk for adverse reactions than those on a low dose, high-dose patients were significantly more likely to achieve enduring remission."

		"abstract": "Background and objective: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB), is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia. The risk of infection depends on the geographical area, ecological factors, and human behavior. Clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have a wide range, but the most frequent clinical symptom, which is also a diagnostic symptom, is a skin rash called erythema migrans (EM). The disease is very common worldwide. In Lithuania, the disease frequency is 99.9 cases per 100,000 population (Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Lithuania, 2017). The main aim of this study was to obtain the baseline characteristics of the disease regarding the infected Lithuanian population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS about all Lyme disease (A69.2) diagnosed patients over a three-year period (from 2014 to 2016) in Lithuania. Results: In 2014–2016, 7424 (crude incidence rate 85.4) cases with LB were diagnosed in Lithuania. Most of them (4633 (62.4%)) were identified in women. Older people were more likely to suffer from LB. Urban residents were 2.6 times more often affected that those living in villages. Tick bites were primarily observed in high season months, from May to September (90%), with the highest peak in July. There was a higher number of observed tick bites (p = 0.003) in the urban residents. Erythema migrans occurred in 75.6% LB cases, while other symptoms did not exceed a quarter of all LB cases. There were 7353 (99.6%) cases where LB was confirmed via clinical symptoms and/or laboratory tests. Also, 1720 (23.2%) patients were tested for LB immunoglobulins. Conclusions: This study found a high incidence of Lyme disease in Lithuania. We elucidated the baseline characteristics regarding the infected Lithuanian population which may ease medical clinicians’ work on new Lyme diagnoses."

Main outcome measures: Time from Lyme disease diagnosis to consultation for any fatigue-related symptoms or diagnosis and for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from Cox models. Results: Average incidence rate for Lyme disease across the UK was 5.18 per 100,000 py between 2000 and 2018, increasing from 2.55 in 2000 to 9.33 in 2018. In total 929 events of any types of fatigue were observed, i.e. an incidence rate of 307.90 per 10,000 py in the Lyme cohort (282 events) and 165.60 in the comparator cohort (647 events). Effect of Lyme disease on any subsequent fatigue varied by index season with highest adjusted HRs in autumn [3.14 (95%CI: 1.92 to 5.13)] and winter [2.23 (1.21 to 4.11)]. Incidence rates of ME/CFS were 11.16 per 10,000 py in Lyme patients (12 events) and 1.20 in comparators (5 events), corresponding to an adjusted HR of 16.95 (5.17 to 55.60). Effect on any types of fatigue and ME/CFS was attenuated 6 months after diagnosis but still clearly visible. Conclusions: UK primary care records provided strong evidence that Lyme disease was associated with acute and chronic fatigue. Albeit weaker, these effects persisted beyond 6 months, suggesting that patients and healthcare providers should remain alert to fatigue symptoms months to years following Lyme disease diagnosis.

Setting: Study data were extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a primary care database covering about 8% of the population in the UK in 658 primary care practices. Participants: Cohort of 8.4 million individuals registered with general practitioners with 52.4 million person-years of observation between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2012. Primary and secondary outcome measures: LD was identified from recorded medical codes, notes indicating LD, laboratory tests and use of specific antibiotics. Annual incidence rates and the estimated total number of LD cases were calculated separately for each UK region. Results: The number of cases of LD increased rapidly over the years 2001 to 2012, leading to an estimated incidence rate of 12.1 (95% CI 11.1 to 13.2) per 100 000 individuals per year and a UK total of 7738 LD cases in 2012. LD was detected in every UK region with highest incidence rates and largest number of cases in Scotland followed by South West and South England. If the number of cases has continued to rise since the end of the study period, then the number in the UK in 2019 could be over 8000. The incidence of LD is about threefold higher than previously estimated, and people are at risk throughout the UK. These results should lead to increased awareness of the need for preventive measures. Trial registration number: This study was approved by the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee for CPRD research (Protocol number 13_210R)."

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Clinical manifestations vary greatly, with localized skin findings functioning as early signs of the disease, followed by disseminated disease. The rarest dermatologic presentation of Lyme is a borrelial lymphocytoma, occurring distinctly in Europe and caused typically by Case presentation: We report a case of a Caucasian 5-year-old European-American boy with slowly progressing, painless edema and erythema of his right pinna. Travel history revealed significant exposure to ticks during a recent trip to Eastern Europe. Laboratory testing for Conclusions: Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease in North America, although not uncommon in Europe. Diagnosis is made by the presence of a painless erythematous swelling typically found on the ear lobe, nipples, or testes. Laboratory tests are available but with low sensitivity, therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a clinical diagnosis to be made. Treatment for isolated borrelial lymphocytoma is doxycycline 4 mg/kg up to 100 mg twice daily, whereas for children less than 8 years of age amoxicillin 50 mg/kg divided three times daily, for 3–4 weeks, is preferred."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease arises from infection with pathogenic Borrelia species. In Canada, current case definition for confirmed Lyme disease requires serological confirmation by both a positive first tier ELISA and confirmatory second tier immunoblot (western blot). For surveillance and research initiatives, this requirement is intentionally conservative to exclude false positive results. Consequently, this approach is prone to false negative results that lead to underestimation of the number of people with Lyme disease. The province of New Brunswick (NB), Canada, can be used to quantify under-detection of the disease as three independent data sets are available to generate an estimate of the true human disease prevalence and incidence. First, detailed human disease incidence is available for the US states and counties bordering Canada, which can be compared with Canadian disease incidence. Second, published national serology results and well-described sensitivity and specificity values for these tests are available and deductive reasoning can be used to query for discrepancies. Third, high-density tick and canine surveillance data are available for the province, which can be used to predict expected human Lyme prevalence. Comparison of cross-border disease incidence suggests a minimum of 10.2 to 28-fold under-detection of Lyme disease (3.6% to 9.8% cases detected). Analysis of serological testing predicts the surveillance criteria generate 10.4-fold under-diagnosis (9.6% cases detected) in New Brunswick for 2014 due to serology alone. Calculation of expected human Lyme disease cases based on tick and canine infections in New Brunswick indicates a minimum of 12.1 to 58.2-fold underestimation (1.7% to 8.3% cases detected). All of these considerations apply generally across the country and strongly suggest that public health information is significantly under-detecting and under-reporting human Lyme cases across Canada. Causes of the discrepancies between reported cases and predicted actual cases may include undetected genetic diversity of Borrelia in Canada leading to failed serological detection of infection, failure to consider and initiate serological testing of patients, and failure to report clinically diagnosed acute cases. As these surveillance criteria are used to inform clinical and public health decisions, this under-detection will impact diagnosis and treatment of Canadian Lyme disease patients."

		"abstract": "Transmission of the causative agents of numerous infectious diseases might be potentially conducted by various routes if this is supported by the genetics of the pathogen. Various transmission modes occur in related pathogens, reflecting a complex process that is specific for each particular host–pathogen system that relies on and is affected by pathogen and host genetics and ecology, ensuring the epidemiological spread of the pathogen. The recent dramatic rise in diagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis might be due to several factors: the shifting of the distributional range of tick vectors caused by climate change; dispersal of infected ticks due to host animal migration; recent urbanization; an increasing overlap of humans’ habitat with wildlife reservoirs and the environment of tick vectors of Borrelia; improvements in disease diagnosis; or establishment of adequate surveillance. The involvement of other bloodsucking arthropod vectors and/or other routes of transmission (human-to-human) of the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, the spirochetes from the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, has been speculated to be contributing to increased disease burden. It does not matter how controversial the idea of vector-free spirochete transmission might seem in the beginning. As long as evidence of sexual transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi both between vertebrate hosts and between tick vectors exists, this question must be addressed. In order to confirm or refute the existence of this phenomenon, which could have important implications for Lyme borreliosis epidemiology, the need of extensive research is obvious and required."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is characterized by a bimodal age distribution and male predominance. We examined trends in reported cases during a 25-year period to describe changes in the populations most affected by Lyme disease in the United States. We examined demographic characteristics of people with confirmed cases of Lyme disease reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during 1992-2016 through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System. We grouped cases into 5-year periods (1992-1996, 1997-2001, 2002-2006, 2007-2011, 2012-2016). We calculated the average annual incidence by age and sex and used incidence rate ratios (IRRs) to describe changes in Lyme disease incidence by age and sex over time. We converted patient age at time of illness into patient birth year to ascertain disease patterns according to birth cohorts. The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States doubled from 1992-1996 to 2012-2016 (IRR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.70-1.78) and increased disproportionately among males; IRRs were 39%-89% higher among males than among females for most age groups. During the study period, children aged 5-9 years were most frequently and consistently affected. In contrast, the average age of adults with Lyme disease increased over time; of all adults, people born during 1950-1964 were the most affected by Lyme disease. Our findings suggest that age-related behaviors and susceptibilities may drive infections among children, and the shifting peak among adults likely reflects a probability proportional to the relative size of the baby boom population. These findings can inform targeted and efficient public health education and intervention efforts."

We collected data from an experimental group of 252 Lyme disease patients and a control group of 267 healthy individuals. The quality of life and sleep, attention and memory performance were assessed in both groups. Additionally, we investigated depressive symptoms in patients with Lyme disease to examine whether the duration of the disease had an influence on the severity of symptoms shown. Furthermore, various data on the diagnostics and treatment carried out in the patient group were recorded. On average, patients visited almost eight physicians to obtain a diagnosis, and eight years passed between the tick bite and diagnosis (SD ± 7.8); less than half of the sample (46%) received their diagnosis within the first five years after the development of symptoms. It became clear that Lyme disease is often diagnosed very late. It appears that people suffering from Lyme disease have significantly lower quality of life and sleep and show cognitive impairments when it comes to attention and memory. This study shows that 3.1% of Lyme patients were satisfied with their lives and that 37% scored in the lower third of the quality-of-life scale. It was also shown that Lyme patients tend to have depressive symptoms."

The literature describes a small number of cases of Lyme carditis with arrhythmias or cardiac conduction disorders. Material and methods We reviewed the case of a 14-year-old girl. LC was diagnosed on the basis of history of disease, physical examination, laboratory examination data (positive anti-borrelia IgM in ELISA with confirmation in immunoblot. The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). The presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected by the method of immunoassay analysis using the Euroimmun AG test systems (Germany). 2 instrumental methods: (ECG,Echo-cor) were used. Results We described a case of Lyme borreliosis in a 14-year-old girl, accompanied by sinus bradyarrhythmia and pericardial fluid -(hydropericardium) (passed after a course of antibacterial therapy). Analysis of this case indicates early detection and adequate treatment of Lyme carditis in young people with minimal deviations of the cardiogram. A case of Lyme carditis , in a child was confirmed.Echocardiography of the heart (at the time of admission to the hospital andat the time of discharge from the hospital was made. Conclusions 1. Lyme carditis should be suspected in patients with a history of Lyme disease and minimal Electrocardiographic abnormalities , such as sinus bradycardia. 2. For differential diagnosis of Lyme carditis, it is necessary to make ( carry out two-stage serological investigation of blood, especially using antibody screening tests by ELISA with subsequent confirmation by the Western blot assay."

Three etiological agents of human Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia bavariensis, and Borrelia garinii) predominantly utilize two distinct tick species as vectors in Asia (Ixodes persulcatus) and Europe (Ixodes ricinus) but how and in which order they colonized each continent remains unknown. Here, by reconstructing the evolutionary history of 142 Eurasian isolates, we show that all three Borrelia genospecies evolved from an Asian origin, suggesting that successful expansion into Europe resulted through invading a novel vector. The pattern of gene flow between continents is different between genospecies and most likely conditioned by reservoir host association and their dispersal. Our results highlight that Eurasian Lyme borreliosis agents are all capable of geographic expansion through vector shifts, but potentially differ in their capacity as emergent pathogens."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria borrelia burgdorferi and is spread primarily through the bite of a tick. There is considerable uncertainty in the medical community regarding the best approach to treating patients with Lyme disease who do not respond fully to short-term antibiotic therapy. These patients have persistent Lyme disease symptoms resulting from lack of treatment, under-treatment, or lack of response to their antibiotic treatment protocol. In the past, treatment trials have used small restrictive samples and relied on average treatment effects as their measure of success and produced conflicting results. To provide individualized care, clinicians need information that reflects their patient population. Today, we have the ability to analyze large data bases, including patient registries, that reflect the broader range of patients more typically seen in clinical practice. This allows us to examine treatment variation within the sample and identify groups of patients that are most responsive to treatment. Using patient-reported outcome data from the MyLymeData online patient registry, we show that sub-group analysis techniques can unmask valuable information that is hidden if averages alone are used. In our analysis, this approach revealed treatment effectiveness for up to a third of patients with Lyme disease. This study is important because it can help open the door to more individualized patient care using patient-centered outcomes and real-world evidence."

		"abstract": "Abstract: There is considerable evidence that some Borrelial (Lyme spirochetal) proteins share significant antigenic properties with several thyroid-related proteins (e.g. TSH receptor, thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase) and can induce thyroid autoimmunity, sometimes associated with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and perhaps also a “destructive thyroiditis” such as “silent” thyroiditis or “Hashitoxicosis.” As an acute illness, Lyme disease may also constitute a “non-thyroidal illness” capable of perturbing thyroid function tests without causing thyroid dysfunction. We report a 22-year old woman admitted with an acute paranoid schizophrenia, thyroid function tests consistent with autoimmunity, transient thyrotoxicosis (tachycardia, lid-lag, brisk DTR’s) and a greatly reduced radioiodine uptake. The thyroid was not palpably enlarged, nodular or tender. On screening assay, reactivity was demonstrated to 4 of 13 Borrelial proteins. Anti-Lyme IgM but not IgG, antibodies, were positive. This was consistent with recent Lyme disease infection. Serum TSH (NL: 0.358-3.74 mcU/ml), Free T4 (NL: 0.76-1.46 ng/dl), and Free T3 (NL: 2.18-3.98 pg/ml) were, respectively: Day1: 0.087 mcU/ml (suppressed), 1.52 ng/dl (slightly elevated), 2.07 pg/ml (slightly reduced); Day2: 0.148 (suppressed), 1.18 (normal), no FT3; Day4: 0.827 (normal), no FT4 or FT3; Day5: 1.66 (normal), 0.89 (normal), 1.77 (low). Anti-Tg and Anti-Peroxidase antibodies were both moderately elevated. Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulins were not elevated. The radioactive iodine uptake on Day4 was 2.8% (NL: 15-30% at 24 hr). Thyroid ultrasonogram was normal. An attractive explanation is that Lyme disease triggered a “destructive thyroiditis,” perhaps but not necessarily mediated by thyroid autoimmunity. This would account for the brief interval of thyrotoxicosis accompanied by a very low radioiodine uptake. Alternatively, Lyme disease, as an acute process, would expectedly be capable of eliciting the thyroid function abnormalities of “non-thyroidal illnesses” in general, as would acute psychosis, well-known to often resemble Graves’ disease at admission."

However, this is the first case report of simultaneous involvement of CN 2 and CN 6 in a patient with LD. The diagnosis of LD can be challenging and initial laboratory tests can be a false negative. It is paramount important to repeat the diagnostic test if clinical suspicious is ongoing.

Its emergence over the last decade is caused by environmental and anthropological factors that favour the survival of Ixodes scapularis, the vector of Lyme disease transmission. The objective of this study was to estimate the speed and direction of Lyme disease emergence in Qu&eacute;bec and to identify spatiotemporal risk patterns. A surface trend analysis was conducted to estimate the speed and direction of its emergence based upon the first detected case of Lyme disease in each municipality in Qu&eacute;bec since 2004. A cluster analysis was also conducted to identify at-risk regions across space and time. These analyses were reproduced for the date of disease onset and date of notification for each case of Lyme disease. It was estimated that Lyme disease is spreading northward in Qu&eacute;bec at a speed varying between 18 and 32 km/year according to the date of notification and the date of disease onset, respectively. A high rate of disease risk was found in seven clusters identified in the south-west of Qu&eacute;bec in the sociosanitary regions of Mont&eacute;r&eacute;gie and Estrie. The results obtained in this study improve our understanding of the spatiotemporal patterns of Lyme disease in Qu&eacute;bec, which can be used for proactive, targeted interventions by public and clinical health authorities."

However, the requirement for holistic TBD tests in routine clinical laboratories is ambiguous. TICKPLEX® PLUS is a holistic TBD test utilized herein to assess the need for multiplex and multifunctional diagnostic tools in a routine clinical laboratory. The study involved 150 specimens categorized into Lyme disease (LD)-positive (n = 48), LD-negative (n = 30), and febrile patients from whom borrelia serology was requested (n = 72, later “febrile patients”) based on reference test results from United Medix, Finland. Reference tests from DiaSorin, Immunetics, and Mikrogen Diagnostik followed the two-tier LD testing system. A comparison between the reference tests and TICKPLEX® PLUS produced 86%, 88%, and 87% positive, negative, and overall agreement, respectively. Additionally, up to 15% of LD and 11% of febrile patients responded to TBD related coinfections and opportunistic microbes. The results demonstrated that one (TICKPLEX® PLUS) test can aid in a LD diagnosis instead of four tests. Moreover, TBD is not limited to just LD, as the specimens produced immune responses to several TBD microbes. Lastly, the study indicated that the screening of febrile patients for TBDs could be a missed opportunity at reducing unreported patient cases."

		"abstract": "Background:: Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The current therapeutic approach to this disease is limited to antibiotics. However, after their administration, about 20% of patients experience delayed onset of this illness manifesting as lingering persistent symptoms. Methods:: To determine a suitable approach that would help reduce this number, we examined the efficacy of a composition of polyphenolic compounds (baicalein, luteolin, and rosmarinic acid) with fatty acids (monolaurin and cis-2-decenoic acid), and iodine/kelp in a Lyme disease animal model and volunteers. Results:: The results showed that 4 weeks of dietary intake of this composition reduced the spirochete burden in animal tissues by about 75%. Basic and differential blood parameters did not show significant differences between control animals and the animals fed with this composition. Also, hepatic and renal toxicity markers were not changed and apoptosis was not observed. Relevant inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were elevated in infected animals but normalized in infected and treated animals. A small observational study revealed that after administration of this composition to 17 volunteers three times per day for 6 months, 67.4% of the volunteers with late or persistent LD, and not receptive to previous antibiotic application, responded positively, in terms of energy status as well as physical and psychological wellbeing to supplementation with this composition, while 17.7% had slight improvement, and 17.7% were none responsive. Conclusion:: We concluded that this specific composition revealed feasible benefits in late or persistent LD management, although double-blind controlled clinical trials are warranted."

The most common and earliest clinical manifestation is erythema migrans, a distinctive cutaneous lesion that occurs at the site of deposition of the spirochaete by the vector tick. Most people treated for Lyme borreliosis respond well to a 2-week course of antibiotic therapy. Symptomatic treatment is recommended for patients who have or develop subjective complaints of unclear aetiology despite successful resolution of the objective manifestation of Lyme borreliosis following antibiotic therapy.</p>"

		"abstract": "<p>The Marine Protected Area Governance (MPAG) framework can be used to analyse MPA governance by moving away from conceptual discussions to focus on particular governance approaches leading to effectiveness. The framework was applied to the Lyme Bay MPA, southwest England, the site of a controversial fisheries closure, which has subsequently been proposed as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well the location for an NGO-led project focusing on stakeholder engagement. This paper examines a broad range of perspectives on the governance of this MPA, via semi-structured interviews with representatives of different interest groups and document analyses. The MPAG framework found a governance structure with a diversity of incentives, providing for bottom-up stakeholder engagement and awareness-raising coupled with strong top-down legislative structures. Although the fisheries closure and subsequent SAC restrictions have provided the main mechanisms for protecting biodiversity, an NGO-led project has provided a complement to the legislative framework and helped to facilitate a mechanism for adaptive co-management. However, the site is predicted to be subject to external pressures from changes in legislation, state resource restrictions and reduced NGO involvement, which will test the resilience of the structure and whether such a diversity of incentives provides sufficient resilience to maintain MPA effectiveness in the face of these pressures.</p>"

Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central line. The line had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broad-spectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. The long duration of antibiotic use and presence of a central venous catheter predisposed the patient to this infection. Patients should be counseled regarding the serious risks of long courses of broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics via central venous catheters to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Limited data are available on the current status of Lyme disease in South Korea. The aim of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with Lyme disease infection among forestry workers in National Park Offices in South Korea. We enrolled National Park Office forestry workers (NPOFWs) who had worked for ≥1 year. Participants completed questionnaires that addressed various subjects including work types and work hygiene-related factors. Collected serum samples were tested using immunofluorescence assay to detect anti-Borrelia antibodies. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors of seroprevalence. Of 1,410 NPOFWs, 655 (46.5%) participated in this study, and an overall seroprevalence of Lyme disease antibodies was 8.1%. Analysis showed that always eating meals in woodland (odds ratio (OR), 5.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.08–12.52) and raising dogs outside homes (OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.57–6.75) were significantly associated with Lyme disease infection. This seroprevalence study indicates that Lyme disease is an important disease among NPOFWs in South Korea. These identified modifiable risk factors should be considered while designing preventive strategies for reducing Lyme disease infection among NPOFWs."

Celem pracy było przeprowadzenie wstępnej analizy występowania zaburzeń słuchu u chorych na LB. Materiał i metody: Testy audiometryczne objęły 66 chorych z rozpoznaną LB, w wieku od 18 do 45 lat. Wszyscy badani (kobiety i mężczyźni) zostali podzieleni na dwie główne grupy: 1 – wczesnej, rozsianej LB i 2 – późnej LB; wśród nich zostały wyodrębnione podgrupy pacjentów z rozpoznaniem neuroboreliozy (Lyme neuroborreliosis – LNB). Diagnostykę narządu słuchu przeprowadzono na podstawie badań audiometrii tonalnej, audiometrii tonalnej rozszerzonej (o wysokiej częstotliwości do 18 kHz), audiometrii impedancyjnej i audiometrii mowy. Wyniki: Nieprawidłowe wyniki testów audiometrycznych stwierdzono u 66,7% badanych, a analiza statystyczna wskazała na istotny związek z zakażeniem Borrelia burgdorferi (p = 0,017). Większość stanowiły osoby z późną LB, zarówno bez, jak i z LNB. Wnioski: Zaburzenia słuchu różnego stopnia występują u ponad połowy chorych na LB, zwłaszcza w późnych stadiach procesu chorobowego. Uzyskane wyniki wskazują na konieczność prowadzenia dalszych wszechstronnych badań uwzględniających uszkodzenie narządu słuchu i równowagi w przebiegu LB, obejmujących większe grupy chorych."

		"abstract": "Background: Post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms/syndrome (PTLDS) occurs in approximately 10% of patients with Lyme disease following antibiotic treatment. Biomarkers or specific clinical symptoms to identify patients with PTLDS do not currently exist and the PTLDS classification is based on the report of persistent, subjective symptoms for ≥6 months following antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Methods: Untargeted liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry metabolomics was used to determine longitudinal metabolic responses and biosignatures in PTLDS and clinically cured non-PTLDS Lyme patients. Evaluation of biosignatures included (1) defining altered classes of metabolites, (2) elastic net regularization to define metabolites that most strongly defined PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at different time points, (3) changes in the longitudinal abundance of metabolites, and (4) linear discriminant analysis to evaluate robustness in a second patient cohort. Results: This study determined that observable metabolic differences exist between PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at multiple time points. The metabolites with differential abundance included those from glycerophospholipid, bile acid, and acylcarnitine metabolism. Distinct longitudinal patterns of metabolite abundance indicated a greater metabolic variability in PTLDS versus non-PTLDS patients. Small numbers of metabolites (6 to 40) could be used to define PTLDS versus non-PTLDS patients at defined time points, and the findings were validated in a second cohort of PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients. Conclusions: These data provide evidence that an objective metabolite-based measurement can distinguish patients with PTLDS and help understand the underlying biochemistry of PTLDS."

Maine, USA, is a high Lyme disease incidence state, with rising incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses associated with increasing I. scapularis abundance and northward range expansion. Members of the public submitted ticks to a tick identification program (1990–2013). From these passive surveillance data, we characterized temporal trends in I. scapularis submission rate (an index of abundance), comparing Maine’s northern tier (seven counties) versus southern tier (nine counties). In the northern tier, the I. scapularis submission rate increased throughout the duration of the time series, suggesting I. scapularis was emergent but not established. By contrast, in the southern tier, submission rate increased initially but leveled off after 10–14 yr, suggesting I. scapularis was established by the mid-2000s. Active (field) surveillance data from a site in the southern tier—bird tick burdens and questing adult tick collections—corroborated this leveling pattern. Lyme disease incidence and I. scapularis submission rate were temporally correlated in the northern but not southern tier. This suggested a decoupling of reported disease incidence and entomological risk."

In the Midwest, an additional Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia mayonii, was recorded from naturally infected I. scapularis and P. leucopus. However, an experimental demonstration of reservoir competence was lacking for a natural tick host. We therefore experimentally infected P. leucopus with B. mayonii via I. scapularis nymphal bites and then fed uninfected larvae on the mice to demonstrate spirochete acquisition and passage to resulting nymphs. Of 23 mice fed on by B. mayonii-infected nymphs, 21 (91%) developed active infections. The infection prevalence for nymphs fed as larvae on these infected mice 4 wk post-infection ranged from 56 to 98%, and the overall infection prevalence for 842 nymphs across all 21 P. leucopus was 75% (95% confidence interval, 72–77%). To assess duration of infectivity, 10 of the P. leucopus were reinfested with uninfected larval ticks 12 wk after the mice were infected. The overall infection prevalence for 480 nymphs across all 10 P. leucopus at the 12-wk time point was 26% (95% confidence interval, 23–31%), when compared with 76% (95% confidence interval, 71–79%) for 474 nymphs from the same subset of 10 mice at the 4-wk time point. We conclude that P. leucopus is susceptible to infection with B. mayonii via bite by I. scapularis nymphs and an efficient reservoir for this Lyme disease spirochete."

Long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing has demonstrated high initial protection against bites from blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), in laboratory settings, and sustained protection against bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in field tests. However, long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has not been field tested among outdoor workers who are frequently exposed to blacklegged ticks. We conducted a 2-yr randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial among 82 outdoor workers in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Participants in the treatment arm wore factory-impregnated permethrin clothing, and the control group wore sham-treated clothing. Outdoor working hours, tick encounters, and bites were recorded weekly to assess protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin-impregnated garments. Factory-impregnated clothing significantly reduced tick bites by 65% in the first study year and by 50% in the second year for a 2-yr protective effect of 58%. No significant difference in other tick bite prevention method utilization occurred between treatment and control groups, and no treatment-related adverse outcomes were reported. Factory permethrin impregnation of clothing is safe and effective for the prevention of tick bites among outdoor workers whose primary exposure is to blacklegged ticks in the northeastern United States."

		"abstract": "Background: Research is currently lacking on the interplay between Babesiosis and Lyme disease (LD) and how this coinfection may translate into morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to compare the clinical features of patients with single-infection with Babesia microti to those co-infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and Babesia microti. Methods: A retrospective review of all adult patients diagnosed with babesiosis and tested for LD at Stony Brook University Hospital between 2014 and 2019 was performed (n=40). Patients with single babesia infection (Group 1, n=22) were compared to those with Babesia and LD (Group 2, n=18). Babesiosis diagnosis was determined by microscopic visualization of Babesia spp under peripheral blood smear, and confirmed by PCR for B. microti. LD inclusion criteria included a positive screened ELISA test for lyme followed by positive IgM antibody by western blot per CDC criteria (2-3 positive bands). Statistical analysis of the data involved Fisher exact test, Chi-square test, independent t-test, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Statistical significance was considered as a p-value less than 0.05. Results: There was no significant difference in gender, race, and age (p &gt;.75) between both groups as well as comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, heart conditions, and immunocompromised state (p=1.0). Maximum parasitemia (Group 1: 1.1%, Group 2: 1.7%, p= 0.26) and percentage admitted to the ICU (Group 1: 18.18%, Group 2: 22.22%, p=1.0) were similar among both groups. While lab values on admission including WBC, hemoglobin, platelets, LDH, ALT, and AST did not significantly differ (p &gt;.09), the length of hospital stay in group 2 was significantly longer than group 1 (Group 1: 3.0 days, Group 2: 5.5 days; p=0.03). There was a 0% mortality rate among both groups. Conclusion: It is remarkable that despite no differences in lab values on admission, comorbidities, and demographics, patients with a coinfection had a longer hospital stay than those with only babesiosis. This suggests that having a coinfection with babesiosis and LD may lead to a more severe illness than a single infection with babesiosis. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Background: Although the prevalence of tick-borne diseases (TBD) continues to increase, there remains significant confusion regarding treatment for Lyme and other TBDs. We conducted a chart review of all new patients that came to an academic center for Lyme and TBDs. We then initiated a quality improvement project for feedback from a small subset of patients with Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Methods: Charts of patients visiting the clinic between March and November 2018 were reviewed. Data abstracted from the electronic health record included demographics, laboratory and clinical data. A small subset of patients who reported a history of Lyme and at least 6 months of symptoms after antibiotic treatment were enrolled in a phone survey to evaluate their experience with treatment for PTLDS. Results: Symptoms most commonly seen in 218 new patients included fatigue (66.5%), joint pain (58.2%), cognitive difficulty (32.1%), headache (27.9%) and sleep disturbance (27.5%). 87% had already received tick-borne disease directed antibiotic treatment. Over half (60.5%) of patients report having symptoms for more than 6 months. More than half of patients (54.8%) who had more than 6 months of Lyme-related symptoms had positive serological testing. Common themes identified in the 16 phone surveys of patients with PTLDS conducted so far included significant frustration related to the dismissive attitudes from medical professionals (n=9/16), and many sought alternative or complementary therapies (n=11/16). Six patients reported receiving very long-term antibiotic regimens from other Lyme specialists. Many patients expressed satisfaction with the visit and medical advice even in the absence of curative therapy (n=9/16), although a significant number continued to seek care elsewhere (n=6/16). Conclusion: More than half of new patients reported symptoms lasting more than 6 months after targeted antibiotic therapy. Further research is needed to develop interventions for the common symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, cognitive difficulty and sleep disturbance. Treatments to improve sleep, diet, and physical activity and decrease inflammation among patients who suffer from PTLDS are needed. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Background: Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and is a significant public health problem. The use of non-standard antibiotic treatment regimens for LD has been associated with adverse effects; however, the overall landscape of treatment has not been described previously. We aimed to describe real-world antibiotic prescribing patterns for LD. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the MarketScan commercial claims database of outpatient encounters from 2016-2018 in the United States. We identified all individuals with a visit that included an LD diagnosis code and a prescription within 30 days of the visit for one or more of 12 antibiotics that may be prescribed for LD. We then categorized each individual as having received either standard or non-standard treatment during the two-year period. Standard treatment was defined as treatment with a first, second or third-line antibiotic for LD, for no longer than 30 days, and for no more than two episodes during the study period. Descriptive and multivariable analyses were performed to compare characteristics of people who received standard vs non-standard treatment for LD. Results: A total of 84,769 prescriptions met criteria for inclusion, written for 45,926 unique patients. The mean duration of prescriptions was 21.4 days (SD 10.8). Most individuals (84.5%) treated for LD received standard treatment during the study period. Female gender (OR 1.5, p&lt; 0.0001) and age 19-45 (p=0.0003) were significantly associated with being prescribed non-standard LD treatment. Treatment in low-incidence states (OR 2.2 compared to high-incidence states, p&lt; 0.0001) and during non-summer months (OR 2.2, p&lt; 0.0001) was more likely to be non-standard. Conclusion: In this population of employed, young, and insured patients, young and middle-aged women were at the highest risk of receiving non-standard LD treatment. Treatments prescribed in states with low incidence of LD or during non-summer months were also more likely to be non-standard, a trend which likely reflects misdiagnosis or overtreatment of LD. Future studies are needed to further define prescriber and patient factors associated with non-standard LD treatment and related adverse outcomes. Disclosures: All Authors: No reported disclosures"

		"abstract": "Objectives: To identify underlying subgroups with distinct symptom profiles, and to characterise and compare these subgroups across a range of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors, within a heterogeneous group of patients with well-defined post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD). Design: A clinical case series of patents. Setting: Participants were recruited from a single-site, Lyme disease referral clinic patient population and were evaluated by physical exam, clinical laboratory testing and standardised questionnaires. Participants: Two hundred and twelve participants met study criteria for PTLD, with medical record-confirmed prior Lyme disease as well as current symptoms and functional impact. Results: Exploratory factor analysis classified 30 self-reported symptoms into 6 factors: ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Ocular Disequilibrium’, ‘Infection-Type’, ‘Mood-Related’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Neurologic’. A final latent profile analysis was conducted using ‘Fatigue Cognitive’, ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ and ‘Mood-Related’ factor-based scores, which produced three emergent symptom profiles, and participants were classified into corresponding subgroups with 59.0%, 18.9% and 22.2% of the sample, respectively. Compared with the other two groups, subgroup 1 had similarly low levels across all factors relative to the sample as a whole, and reported lower rates of disability (1.6% vs 10.0%, 12.8%; q=0.126, 0.035) and higher self-efficacy (median: 7.5 vs 6.0, 5.3; q=0.068,<0.001). Subgroup 2 had the highest ‘Musculoskeletal Pain’ factor-based scores (q≤0.001). Subgroup 3 was characterised overall by higher symptom factor-based scores, and reported higher depression (q≤0.001). Conclusions: This analysis identified six symptom factors and three potentially clinically relevant subgroups among patients with well-characterised PTLD. We found that these subgroups were differentiated not only by symptom phenotype, but also by a range of other factors. This may serve as an initial step towards engaging with the symptom heterogeneity that has long been observed among patients with this condition."

		"abstract": "Aims: This article sought to estimate the burden of disease attributable to atherosclerosis in mainland Portugal in 2016. Methods and results: The burden of atherosclerosis was measured in disability-adjusted life years following the latest 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) methodology. Disability-adjusted life years were estimated as the sum of years of life lost (YLL) with years lived with disability (YLD). The following clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis were included: ischaemic heart disease (IHD) (including acute myocardial infarction, stable angina, and ischaemic heart failure), ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (ICVD), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Years of life lost were estimated based on all-cause mortality data for the Portuguese population and mortality due to IHD, ICVD, and PAD for the year 2016 sourced from national statistics. Standard life expectancy was sourced from the GBD study. Years lived with disability corresponded to the product of the number of prevalent cases by an average disability weight for all possible combinations of disease. Prevalence data for the different clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis were sourced from epidemiological studies. Disability weights were sourced from the published literature. In 2016, 15 123 deaths were attributable to atherosclerosis, which corresponded to 14.3% of overall mortality in mainland Portugal. Disability-adjusted life years totalled 260 943, 75% due to premature death (196 438 YLL) and 25% due to disability (64 505 YLD). Conclusion: Atherosclerosis entails a high disease burden to society. A large part of this burden would be avoidable if evidence-based effective and cost-effective interventions targeting known risk factors, from prevention to treatment, were implemented."

		"abstract": "Human neutrophils are highly sensitive to the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the agent of Lyme disease (LD), in tissues. Although Bb is also found in the blood of LD patients, far less is known about how neutrophils respond to Bb in the presence of blood. In this study, we employed microfluidic tools to probe the interaction between human neutrophils and Bb and measured the activation of human neutrophils in blood samples from patients. We found that neutrophils migrate vigorously toward Bb in the presence of serum, and this process was complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage or blocking complement receptors decreased neutrophil’s ability to interact with Bb. We also found that spiking Bb directly into the blood from healthy donors induced spontaneous neutrophil motility. This response to Bb was also complement-dependent. Preventing complement factor 5 cleavage decreased spontaneous neutrophil motility in Bb-spiked blood. Moreover, we found that neutrophils in blood samples from acute LD patients displayed spontaneous motility patterns similar to those observed in Bb-spiked samples. Neutrophil motility was more robust in blood samples from LD patients than that measured in healthy and ill controls, validating the utility of the microfluidic assay for the study of neutrophil-Bb interactions in the presence of blood."

		"abstract": "Issue: Virtually non-existent in Eastern Townships (ET) before 2010, Lyme disease incidence rate reached 52 confirmed cases per 100 000 in some districts in 2018, leading to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) recommendation by public health. To improve access to PEP, community pharmacists can now screen and initiate PEP under a collaborative practice agreement (CPA) with the regional Medical Officer of Health. Knowledge, attitudes and practices of pharmacists regarding Lyme disease PEP were surveyed after implementation of this measure. Description of the problem: 312 community pharmacists practicing in ET were invited, in October 2018, to complete an online survey, based on Godin’s integrative model (2012), with questions on professional characteristics, knowledge of CPA, attitudes about PEP, and facilitators and barriers to the use of CPA. Pharmacist’s practices were evaluated using 8 clinical vignettes. Vignette-specific and a global score were calculated. Bivariate analyses were done to test the association between global score and knowledge, attitudes, facilitators and barriers. Results: Response rate was 13.8%. Most pharmacists knew (97.4%) and were in favor (93.1%) of the CPA, and believed it was effective to prevent Lyme disease (96.4%). The main barriers reported to using the CPA were related to the assessment of PEP criteria. With regards to practice, pharmacists answered correctly for clients presenting all criteria for PEP (80.6%), aged &lt; 8 y.o. (51.6%), who had their tick removed for &gt;72 hrs (67.7%), already presenting with symptoms (32.3%) or who had exposure in a non-endemic area (38.7%). Finally, none of the variables studied were associated with the global score. Lessons: This measure has now been expanded in other endemic regions in Quebec and a provincial CPA is under development. These results will help guide the development of the provincial CPA, specifically to better consider and to provide guidance regarding PEP contraindications. Key messages: Pharmacist-initiated PEP is an innovative approach to increase timely population access to an essential preventive measure in the fight against Lyme disease in endemic districts. Additional guidance is required for pharmacists with regards to assessment of PEP criteria in future CPAs."

For each species, we measured the rate of attachment to a common rodent host, the engorgement weight, and the efficiency of pathogen acquisition (host to tick) and pathogen transmission (tick to host) from laboratory mice. In measuring pathogen acquisition and transmission, we used two different pathogen strains, one sympatric with Results: We found Conclusions: This study identified species-specific vector traits as a potential driver of broad scale variation in Lyme disease risk in the USA.

		"abstract": "Introduction/Background: Lyme disease, a tick-borne zoonosis caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, has emerged in Nova Scotia (NS) as a common illness. Since 2002 when Lyme disease was first diagnosed in NS, &gt;1000 cases have been reported. Seventh cranial nerve palsy (CNP-7) is said to be the most common presentation of early disseminated Lyme disease in children in endemic areas. Objectives: We aimed to determine the frequency of CNP-7 in NS and if physicians are considering Lyme disease as an etiology. Design/Methods: A retrospective review of health records of children seen at the IWK Health Centre from 2000-2018 who were ≤18 years of age with an ICD-9 or 10 diagnosis of Bell’s palsy (CNP-7) was conducted. CNP-7 due to local infection, trauma, malignancy, or systemic neurologic disease was excluded. Results: Of 237 ICD “Bell’s palsy” diagnoses, 66 cases were eligible, of which 60.6 % (n=40) were female. The median age was 10 years (range 0-16). Five cases of Lyme disease-associated CNP-7 were recognized (7.6%), all since 2013. No bilateral CNP-7 occurred; 59.1% of cases were on the left. Most children presented within 3 days of symptom onset (84.8%) to the emergency department (95.4%), and 56.1% subsequently saw a pediatric neurologist. The most common associated symptom with CNP-7 was headache (22.7%). Lyme disease was considered in the differential diagnosis in 34.8 % (n=23) of cases, and only since 2012. Systemic steroids were prescribed to 51.5 % (34/66) of children in the emergency department, for durations varying from 1 to 10 days. The most common steroid course length was 5 days. Antimicrobials were prescribed for 18 (27.3%) children including acyclovir, beta lactams and tetracyclines. Conclusion: There does not appear to be a standard approach to diagnosis and management of CNP-7 in this pediatric health centre. Lyme disease is not regularly considered in the differential diagnosis, which is surprising given the high incidence of Lyme disease in NS. These findings will be shared with health care providers most likely to see CNP-7 in order to develop a standard algorithm to the initial presentation of 7th cranial nerve palsy in children."

Here we present the case of a 24-year-old Second Lieutenant, a recent graduate from the United States Military Academy, with a history of Lyme disease who developed recurrent knee effusions following surgery to correct a hip impingement. Although gonococcal arthritis was initially suspected from preliminary laboratory results, a comprehensive evaluation contradicted this diagnosis. Despite antibiotic therapy, aspiration of the effusions, and steroid treatment to control inflammation, the condition of the patient deteriorated to the point where he was found to be unfit for duty and subsequently discharged from active military service. This case illustrates the profound effect that latent Lyme disease can have on the quality of life and the career of an active duty military member. It highlights the need for increased surveillance for Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) in military training areas and for the early and aggressive diagnosis and treatment of military personnel who present with the symptoms of acute Lyme disease."

Awareness of general practitioners with this problem is insufficient, it requires additional knowledge about diagnosis and treatment. In pediatric practice, the fact of a child being bitten by an Ixodes mite that carries the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, in addition to babesiosis, anaplasmosis, often goes unnoticed. Therefore, parents seek medical help only when various problems arise, often the thought of Lyme disease does not even arise. Lyme disease has a wide polymorphism of clinical symptoms, is characterized by multisystem lesions, cyclical course — all this complicates the diagnostic search. The difficulty also lies in the fact that there are no domestic clinical recommendations. This publication presents approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, prevention of Lyme disease based on the experience of experts from different countries. Modern approaches to two-stage laboratory diagnostics, tactics of patient management from the moment of bite, treatment at different stages of Lyme borreliosis are analyzed. Attention is paid to the need for epidemiological research in Ukraine and the beginning of educational programs to prevent the disease. The differentiated approach to the treatment of Lyme disease in children due to age aspects, concomitant pathology, safety of long_term antibacterial therapy should be studied more. No conflict of interest was declared by the authors. Key words: Lyme disease, children, diagnosis, treatment, prevention."

		"abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Many recent publications have spoken about the relations between Borreliosis and Bartonellosis, and pathologies such as Parkinson’s Multiple Sclerosis, LAS, cluster headache, depression, autism, epilepsy, cancer, etc….The aim is to see if subjects with these two infections, pathologies considered incurable, respond positively to a protocol that includes antibiotics, oxygen/ozone therapy and autologous stem cells. RESULTS: The results of this protocol on serious pathologies considered incurable in veterinary and overlapping human pathologies, are giving good outcomes. DISCUSSION: The difficult to diagnose Borrelliosis and Bartonellosis in the Lab and variability of the clinical symptoms cause difficulty to both human and veterinary doctors. Even when these pathologies are confirmed by analyses they are treated with a short antibiotic cycle. Because bacteria have systems to overcome antibiotics the pathologies become chronic leading to sub-clinical meningitis that also blocks the correct functioning of the autonomous nervous system that regulates every physiological process. Serious pathologies appear even years after bacterial contamination and mankind’s increasing longevity together with these bacterias’ tropism can cause or has already caused a pandemic. CONCLUSION: Alternating or combining therapies using various antibiotics, together with the antibacterial and catalytic effect of the oxygen/ozone therapy in the antibiotics and stem cells and the immunomodulation and neurotrophic effect of the Blood Stem Cells can indirectly resolve pathologies considered incurable up to now."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease remains a contested illness in Canada, thereby making the diagnostic and treatment journeys difficult for some people. One outcome of this is that increasing numbers of people are turning to medical crowdfunding to support access to alternative therapies, non-local health care providers and assist with managing the costs of everyday life. In this analysis, we qualitatively explore the narratives shared in Canadians’ crowdfunding campaigns to support Lyme disease treatment or diagnosis to identify whether or not any common elements shared in these narratives exist, and if so, what they are. We identified 238 campaigns for inclusion from three prominent crowdfunding platforms. Thematic analysis of the campaign narratives shows four consistent themes shared in these campaigns: what is lost (e.g. bodily ability), what is missing (e.g. local care options), what is sought (e.g. funds to cover treatment abroad) and what is hoped for (e.g. return to wellbeing). These themes demonstrate the highly personal and emotional nature of medical crowdfunding, particularly in the context of a contested illness that may lead some to question the legitimacy of one’s financial need. This analysis contributes valuable new insights to the nascent scholarship on medical crowdfunding, and particularly to our understanding of how people communicate about their health and bodily needs on this public platform. It also identifies important directions for future research, including the potential for crowdfunding narratives to be used for advocacy."

This delayed diagnosis of Lyme disease in the patient we describe resulted in disseminated infection and sixth nerve palsy. We present the use of telemedicine to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease and to provide prompt access to diagnosis and care during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in the future."

Transmitted through ticks and carried mainly by mammals and birds, the Lyme disease (LD) bacterium is a well-suited model to study such tropism. LD bacteria species vary in host ranges through mechanisms eluding characterization. By feeding ticks infected with different LD bacteria species, utilizing feeding chambers and live mice and quail, we found species-level differences of bacterial transmission. These differences localize on the tick blood meal, and complement, a defense in vertebrate blood, and a bacterial polymorphic protein, CspA, which inactivates complement by binding to a host complement inhibitor, FH. CspA selectively confers bacterial transmission to vertebrates that produce FH capable of allele-specific recognition. Phylogenetic analyses revealed convergent evolution as the driver of such findings, which likely emerged during the last glacial maximum. Our results identify LD bacterial determinants of host tropism, defining an evolutionary mechanism that shapes host-microparasite associations."

Previous research has examined the potential role of climate change on the disease’s expansion, but no studies have considered the role of future land cover upon its distribution. This research examines Lyme disease risk in the south-eastern U.S. based on projected land cover developed under four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Scenarios: A1B, A2, B1, and B2. Land cover types and edge indices significantly associated with Lyme disease in Virginia were incorporated into a spatial Poisson regression model to quantify potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease in the south-eastern U.S. under each scenario. Our results indicate an intensification of potential land cover suitability for Lyme disease under the A scenarios and a decrease of potential land cover suitability under the B scenarios. The decrease under the B scenarios is a critical result, indicating that Lyme disease risk can be decreased by making different land cover choices. Additionally, health officials can focus efforts in projected high incidence areas."

		"abstract": "Background: Recent evidence suggests that climate change and other factors are leading to the emergence of Lyme disease in the province of Quebec, where it previously did not exist. As risk areas expand further north, the population can adopt specific preventive behaviors to limit chances of infection. The objectives of this study were to (1) create an index of Lyme disease prevention behaviors (LDPB), and (2) use the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explain the decision-making process of people who choose to adopt LDPB. Methods: A sample of 1959 adults living in a Lyme disease risk area completed a questionnaire by phone ( Results: Our findings led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index consisting of 10 behaviors, down from the 19 behaviors initially considered for inclusion in the index. Rates of adoption of each behavior varied tremendously, from 4.30 to 83.80%. All variables of the TPB model (attitude, social norms, and perceived control) were significantly associated with intention to adopt preventive behaviors. Intention itself was significantly associated with adoption of LDPB. Likewise, risk perception was positively correlated with the adoption of LDPB. Conclusions: This study led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index that can be used by public health agencies, researchers, and professionals to monitor the evolution over time of individuals’ LDPB adoption rates. It also showed the usefulness of the TPB in understanding the adoption of LDPB and how intention to adopt such behaviors is formed."

Reviews of both the academic and grey literature are complemented by surveys targeting both medical professionals and decision makers in government. Combined, the literature reviews and surveys demonstrate that there is considerable debate surrounding the effectiveness of testing, treatment options, and the existence of chronic Lyme disease. As the focus on the Maritimes demonstrates, these debates often pit the medical community against patients and patient advocates and, thus far, governments have been unable to produce policy that entirely pleases either side. Moving forward, this study recommends the creation of a discussion forum via a federal Commission of inquiry to review best practise guidelines for Lyme disease. The key is to foster an unbiased probe of central issues surrounding treatment and diagnosis without alienating stakeholders. This course of action will not necessarily solve the issue of Lyme disease, but would foster a greater understanding through dialogue that includes and validates the experiences of stakeholders, which is something that is currently missing."

In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis. Currently, many studies have been conducted to identify factors influencing Lyme disease risk in the Northeast, however, relatively few studies focused on the Upper Midwest. In this study, we explored and compared the climatic and landscape factors that shape the spatial patterns of human Lyme cases in these two regions, using the generalized linear mixed models. Our results showed that climatic variables generally had opposite correlations with Lyme disease risk, while landscape factors usually had similar effects in these two regions. High precipitation and low temperature were correlated with high Lyme disease risk in the Upper Midwest, while with low Lyme disease risk in the Northeast. In both regions, size and fragmentation related factors of residential area showed positive correlations with Lyme disease risk. Deciduous forests and evergreen forests had opposite effects on Lyme disease risk, but the effects were consistent between two regions. In general, this study provides new insight into understanding the differences of risk factors of human Lyme disease risk in these two regions."

This study examined predictors of symptom improvement after antimicrobial therapy for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, hypothesizing particularly pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement to be predictive. Methods: A predictive study was performed on pre-treatment and post-treatment individual characteristics, including expectancies, and physical and mental health–related quality of life (HRQoL) from the PLEASE-trial comparing randomized 12-weeks of doxycycline, clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, or placebo following 2 weeks of intravenous ceftriaxone. At end-of-treatment (14 weeks after trial start) and follow-up (52 weeks), complete data of 231 and 170 (of initial 280) patients with persistent symptoms temporally related to a history of erythema migrans or otherwise confirmed symptomatic Lyme disease, or accompanied by Results: In addition to pre-treatment HRQoL, pre-treatment expectancies regarding symptom improvement were consistently associated with stronger physical and mental HRQoL improvements at both end-of-treatment and follow-up (95% CI range: .09;.54, Conclusions: The present study shows that, next to pre-treatment functioning, patients’ pre-treatment and post-treatment expectancies regarding improvement of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease relate to a more beneficial symptom course. Expectancies of patients may be relevant to explain and potentially improve patient outcomes (e.g., by optimized communication about treatment success).

		"abstract": "Background: Approximately 300,000 cases of Lyme disease occur annually in the UNITED STATES, with children aged 5–9 years disproportionately affected. A single dose of doxycycline administered within 72 hours of a high-risk tick bite is recommended for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent Lyme disease in areas of high incidence. However, it is not known how often or for which patients PEP is used. We aimed to describe recent patterns of single-dose doxycycline medication claims in states with high and low Lyme disease incidence, and the associated patient and prescription characteristics in a large national commercial insurance claims database. Methods: Outpatient medication claims in the IBM Watson Health MarketScan Database®, a large nation-wide database of de-identified insurance claims filed between January 1, 2014–December 31, 2017 were reviewed. Claims of single-dose doxycycline were identified and associated patient demographics and medication characteristics were analyzed. Results: During 2014–2017, 66,210 medication claims for single-dose doxycycline were filed by 63,112 enrollees; mean annual incidence of receiving at least one single-dose doxycycline prescription was 56 per 100,000 enrollees. Mean patient age was 43 years (IQR 33–56 years); only 8% were for children aged <18 years. About half (46%) were male patients. Most claims (71%) were made by patients residing in the 14 states with high Lyme disease incidence, defined as an average annual incidence of ≥ 10 confirmed Lyme disease cases per 100,000 population. The majority (80%) of medication claims were during the 6 months of peak tick activity (April–July for nymphal ticks and October–November for adult ticks). Conclusion: Single-dose doxycycline medication claims are common in states with high Lyme disease incidence and are highest during months of peak tick activity, consistent with the assumption that most single-dose doxycycline is used for Lyme disease PEP. Use of single-dose doxycycline to prevent Lyme disease is infrequent in children, despite being a group at high risk for Lyme disease. Efforts to educate pediatric healthcare providers and parents should be made to increase Lyme disease PEP access for children. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

		"abstract": "Background: Diagnosing Lyme disease often involves laboratory evaluation, yet available tests have limitations. Serology remains negative for weeks after infection occurs, and may then remain positive for years. Borrelia burgdorferi blood PCR testing has low sensitivity, rendering it unhelpful. We sought to determine whether an emerging technology, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of microbial cell-free DNA (mcfDNA), can detect B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with erythema migrans (EM). Methods: Patients aged 1–17 years with a clinically-identified single or multiple EM were enrolled. Two clinical investigators were required to agree on the EM finding, with no evidence of an alternative diagnosis. Subjects were excluded if they previously had Lyme disease, had received antibiotics within 30 days prior to enrollment, or if the rash had resolved before the first blood draw. Three blood samples were taken during the study period: one before antibiotics were administered, then 1–3 weeks and 2–3 months later. At enrollment, plasma was tested for Lyme disease using C6 antibody with reflex to Western Blot and mcfDNA sequencing (Karius, Inc., Redwood City, CA). Briefly, mcfDNA was extracted from plasma and NGS performed. Human reads were removed and remaining sequences were aligned to a curated microbial database. Only mcfDNA testing was performed at follow-up visits. Results: We enrolled 5 subjects (ages 4–15 years old, median age 4). Four subjects had a single EM and negative Lyme serology. One subject had approximately 20 EMs and positive serology (C6-antibody=7.52 (Positive >1.09), 3/3 IgM, 2/10 IgG). All 14 plasma samples, including five pre- and nine post-antibiotic samples, were negative for B. burgdorferi DNA by mcfDNA sequencing. No other infections, including other tick-borne infections, were detected. Conclusion: NGS of mcfDNA did not identify B. burgdorferi DNA in the plasma of pediatric patients with active EM rashes. This approach is unlikely to be helpful in diagnosing early localized Lyme disease. This may be because spirochetes are localized to the periphery of the rash in EM and spirochetemia likely occurs at later stages of infection. Follow-up studies are planned to investigate how NGS of mcfDNA performs during early and late disseminated Lyme disease. Disclosures: All authors: No reported disclosures."

		"abstract": "States that claim responsibility for citizens’ healthcare try to deal with knowledge uncertainties while preserving a duty of care. Production of clinical guidelines in disputed medical conditions or where uncertainty is high, is difficult. Patient groups may advocate non-credentialed evidence, contribute to debates and form alliances with established policy actors. In this context, Lyme disease, especially highly contested ‘chronic’ Lyme disease is a good case with which to examine how official governance institutions are managing diagnostic uncertainty and evidence for tests. The healthcare state has been provoked to develop extensive policy for Lyme disease. In the UK, national Health Technology Assessment agency, NICE, began a consultation process in 2016. NICE and other policy actors are moving towards more participatory modes of decision-making. The article analyses NICE’s recently published guidelines and consultation documents; patient groups’ contributions; observations of consultations and of evidence review processes; and recent Department of Health systematic reviews, including patient group participation. We draw on concepts of participatory governance, patient group activism and guideline involvement. We find an increased level of participation by patient groups in recent policy and evidence review processes, and hence legitimation of them as ‘stakeholders’, alongside a strengthened state position on pre-existing diagnostic and testing standards."

Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of patients referred to an academic center with a presumed diagnosis or concern for Lyme disease between 2000 and 2013 was performed to analyze diagnoses and treatments. Characteristics of those with Lyme disease and those misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease were compared. Results: Of 1261 patients, 911 (72.2%) did not have Lyme disease, 184 (14.6%) had active or recent Lyme disease, 150 (11.9%) had a remote history of Lyme disease, and 16 (1.3%) were identified as having possible Lyme disease. Patients without current Lyme disease were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08–2.45), to have had symptoms for &gt;3 months (OR, 8.78; 95% CI, 5.87–13.1), to have higher symptom counts (OR per additional symptom, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02–1.13), to have had more Lyme-related laboratory testing (OR per additional laboratory test, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03–1.32), and to have been diagnosed with what were regarded as coinfections (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14–8.57). Of the 911 patients without Lyme disease, 764 (83.9%) had received antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease or their coinfections. The percentage of patients established to have Lyme disease was lower than in earlier studies of referred populations. Conclusions: Among patients referred to an academic Infectious Diseases practice for Lyme disease, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment were common, both for Lyme disease and for coinfections."

		"abstract": "A novel straightforward analytical technique was developed to monitor the emission of hydrogen from anaerobic bacteria cultured in sealed headspace vials using a specific hydrogen sensor. The results were compared with headspace gas chromatography carried out in parallel. This technique was also applied to investigate the efficacy of chemical antibiotics and of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties. Antibiotics added to the sample cultures are apparently effective if the emission of hydrogen is suppressed, or if not, are either ineffective or the related bacteria are even resistant. The sensor approach was applied to prove bacterial contamination in food, animals, medical specimens and in ticks infected by Borrelia bacteria and their transfer to humans, thus causing Lyme disease. It is a unique advantage that the progress of an antibiotic therapy can be examined until the emission of hydrogen is finished. The described technique cannot identify the related bacteria but enables bacterial contamination by hydrogen emitting anaerobes to be recognized. The samples are incubated with the proper culture broth in closed septum vials which remain closed during the whole process. The personnel in the lab never come into contact with pathogens and thus safety regulations are guaranteed."

		"abstract": "Background: Primary care is likely to see the highest number of Lyme disease patients. Despite this, there is limited published data regarding Lyme disease patients accessing primary care in the UK. We aim to describe trends in the incidence of a new diagnosis, and demographics of patients identified in a primary care electronic health database. Methods: A descriptive epidemiological study of Lyme disease coded patients in UK primary care. 3725 patients coded for Lyme disease during 1998–2016 were identified within The Health Improvement Network (THIN). Incidence rates and the demographics of cases identified were described. Poisson regression was used to analyse socio-demographic characteristics of the cases. Results: There was an increase in annual crude incidence rates, peaking in 2015 at 5.47 (95% CI 4.85–6.14) cases per 100,000 population per year. Multivariable analysis showed there were significant differences in the ages of those affected, incidence of a new diagnosis rose as deprivation levels improved, and that there was a higher incidence of cases living in rural areas compared to urban areas. There was no significant difference between sexes for the UK. Cases were significantly more likely to identify with being white compared to the national population. Conclusions: An increasing incidence of patients newly coded with Lyme disease related Read codes was identified using data from a UK national primary care database. By comparing these incidence figures with national laboratory-confirmed surveillance data, a multiplication factor of 2.35 (95%CI 1.81–2.88) can be calculated in order to estimate the annual number of cases seen in primary care. The significant socio-demographic variables associated with a Lyme disease diagnosis likely reflect a complex interplay of socio-economic issues, which needs to be further explored. Future work is needed to examine the treatment and management of patients within this database."

However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. Methods: For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory / attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients’ profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Results: Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% ( Conclusions: Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment.

Many have argued that a health frame increases engagement, as do visual methodologies including online and interactive platforms, yet to date there has been limited research on audience responses to health messaging using visual interventions. This study explores public attitudes regarding communication tools focused on climate change and climate-affected Lyme disease through six focus groups (n = 61) in rural and urban southern Manitoba, Canada. The results add to the growing evidence of the efficacy of visual and storytelling methods in climate communications and argues for a continuum of mediums: moving from video, text, to maps. Findings underscore the importance of tailoring both communication messages and mediums to increase uptake of adaptive health and environmental behaviours, for some audiences bridging health and climate change while for others strategically decoupling them."

		"abstract": "Background: Despite scientific evidence that climate change has profound and far reaching implications for public health, translating this knowledge in a manner that supports citizen engagement, applied decision-making, and behavioural change can be challenging. This is especially true for complex vector-borne zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease, a tick-borne disease which is increasing in range and impact across Canada and internationally in large part due to climate change. This exploratory research aims to better understand public risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease in order to increase engagement and motivate behavioural change. Methods: A focus group study involving 61 participants was conducted in three communities in the Canadian Prairie province of Manitoba in 2019. Focus groups were segmented by urban, rural, and urban-rural geographies, and between participants with high and low levels of self-reported concern regarding climate change. Results: Findings indicate a broad range of knowledge and risk perceptions on both climate change and Lyme disease, which seem to reflect the controversy and complexity of both issues in the larger public discourse. Participants in high climate concern groups were found to have greater climate change knowledge, higher perception of risk, and less skepticism than those in low concern groups. Participants outside of the urban centre were found to have more familiarity with ticks, Lyme disease, and preventative behaviours, identifying differential sources of resilience and vulnerability. Risk perceptions of climate change and Lyme disease were found to vary independently rather than correlate, meaning that high climate change risk perception did not necessarily indicate high Lyme disease risk perception and vice versa. Conclusions: This research contributes to the growing literature framing climate change as a public health issue, and suggests that in certain cases climate and health messages might be framed in a way that strategically decouples the issue when addressing climate skeptical audiences. A model showing the potential relationship between Lyme disease and climate change perceptions is proposed, and implications for engagement on climate change health impacts are discussed."

		"abstract": "The aim was to determine the occurrence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in patients with Lyme disease (LD), and to estimate the contribution of factors that may identify TMD among LD patients. In seventy-six (N = 76) adult patients with LD (mean age 57.6 ± 14.6 years) and 54 healthy non-Lyme volunteers with a mean age of 56.4 ± 13.5 years, possible function (i.e., non-pain) diagnoses were established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria of Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD). Pain diagnoses were established by means of the function-dependent dynamic and static tests. The two groups did not significantly differ in the frequency of disc displacements diagnoses and function-dependent pain diagnoses. LD showed a significantly higher frequency (p < 0.001) of osteoarthrosis than the control group. For the prediction of pain diagnoses in LD patients, the single regression analyses pointed out an association with age, sleep bruxism (SB), and awake bruxism (AB). Two predictors (i.e., SB (p = 0.002) and AB (p = 0.017)) were statistically significant in the final multiple variable model. The frequency of TMD in patients with LD based on function-dependent tests was not significantly different from that in the control group. This investigation suggests that the contribution of bruxism to the differentiation between patients with Lyme and TMD is high."

This exploratory study relies on the theory of planned behavior and certain constructs from the health belief model to identify the factors leading municipal authorities to implement preventive interventions for Lyme disease (PILD). Data were obtained from an online survey sent, during the summer of 2018, to municipal officers in 820 municipalities in Quebec, in all health regions where the population is at risk of contracting Lyme disease (response rate = 36%). The questionnaire was used to measure the implementation of PILD, the intention to implement these interventions, attitudes, perceived social pressure, perceived control (levers and barriers) over interventions, perceived effectiveness of preventive measures, risk, and perceived vulnerability. Results of structural equation analyses showed that attitudes were significantly associated with municipal authorities’ intention to implement PILD, while the intention to implement PILD was a significant predictor of the implementation of PILD. Additional analyses showed that perceived barriers added a moderating effect in the intention-implementation relationship. The prediction of behaviors or practices that municipal authorities could implement to prevent Lyme disease will enable the evaluation over time of the evolution of Quebec municipalities’ adaptation to Lyme disease. Moreover, the examination of the associations of specific psychosocial factors revealed important implications for the design of effective behavior-change interventions, which would allow health officials doing awareness work to create personalized interventions better suited to municipal officers and their specific contexts."

The current study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of various algorithms of MTTT in European patients with erythema migrans (EM) as a model disease for early Lyme borreliosis, and in appropriate controls. Four different immunoassays were used in the first tier, followed by either an immunoblot or the C6-EIA, or were used as standalone single-tier test. These tests were performed on consecutively collected sera of 228 Dutch patients with physician-diagnosed EM in the setting of general practice, 231 controls from the general population, and 50 controls with potentially cross-reactive antibodies. All the variants of MTTT that were studied had significantly higher sensitivity compared with their equivalent STTT, while retaining comparable specificity. Within the MTTT algorithms, classifying equivocal results as positive yielded better diagnostic parameters than classifying equivocal results as negative. The best diagnostic parameters were found using the Enzygnost-2 assay in the first tier, followed by a C6-ELISA in the second tier (sensitivity 77.6%, 95% CI 71.7–82.9; specificity 96.1%, 95% CI 92.7–98.2). This algorithm performed significantly better than the equivalent STTT algorithm in terms of sensitivity ("

The disease manifestations are very different, with the skin, joints, heart, and nervous systems being most often affected. The aim of this study was to find out whether there are significant differences in the appearance of symptoms and signs of the disease between the subjects who did / did not receive prophylactic, early antibiotic therapy, after the tick bite in patients diagnosed with the early phase of Lyme borreliosis. Methods. The study was carried out on 2,070 patients, who were treated or examined at the Clinic for Infectious and Tropical Diseases in the 1989?2004 period. The patients were divided into group ? (n = 591), in which they were given early antibiotic therapy, and group B (n = 1,479), in which they were not. The antibiotic therapy was used within five days of a tick bite in patients with a probable infection, who, at the time, did not have any symptoms or signs. The applied antibiotics included cephalosporins, macrolides, tetracyclines, semisynthetic penicillins, repeatedly for seven or 14 days, or benzathine benzylpenicillin once only. Results. The disease developed in a statistically significantly larger number of patients who were not given early antibiotic therapy (537/1,479) than in those who received the therapy (10/951), i.e. the ratio was 36.3% vs. 1.7%. We concluded that only two antibiotics were sufficient for optimal prevention: doxycycline and ampicillin, administered for seven days. The applied antibiotics showed a high statistically significant efficacy, ranging from 93.7% (cephalosporins) to 99.4% (macrolides). Conclusion. The application of early antibiotic therapy after a tick bite was effective in preventing the early phase of Lyme borreliosis, while in the case of infection it prevented the development of extracutaneous manifestations."

We present the case of an atypical papillitis, probably caused by this bacterium. We suspected this because of the results on the indirect test bloods and the improvement of the symptoms after treatment.

Based on the unique morphology and high motility of spirochetes, we hypothesized that their surface adhesive molecules might be suitably adapted to aid in their dissemination strategies. Designing a system that mimics natural environmental signals, which many spirochetes face during their infectious cycle, we observed that a subset of their surface proteins, particularly Decorin binding protein (Dbp) A/B, can strongly enhance the motility of spirochetes in the extracellular matrix of the host. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy, we disentangled the mechanistic details of DbpA/B and decorin/laminin interactions. Our results show that spirochetes are able to leverage a wide variety of adhesion strategies through force-tuning transient molecular binding to extracellular matrix components, which concertedly enhance spirochetal dissemination through the host."

		"abstract": "Background: To monitor the adoption of climate change adaptive behaviors in the population, public health authorities have to conduct national surveys, which can help them target vulnerable subpopulations. To ensure reliable estimates of the adoption of these preventive behaviors, many data collection methods are offered by polling firms. The aim of this study was to compare a telephone survey with a web survey on Lyme disease with regard to their representativeness. Methods: The data comes from a cross-sectional study conducted in the Province of Québec (Canada). In total, 1003 people completed the questionnaire by telephone and 956 filled in a web questionnaire. We compared the data obtained from both survey modes with the census data in regard to various demographic characteristics. We then compared the data from both samples in terms of self-reported Lyme disease preventive behaviors and other theoretically associated constructs. We also assessed the measurement invariance (equivalence) of the index of Lyme disease preventive behaviors across the telephone and web samples. Results: Findings showed that neither the telephone nor the web panel modes of data collection can be considered more representative of the target population. The results showed that the proportion of item non-responses was significantly higher with the web questionnaire (5.6%) than with the telephone survey (1.3%), and that the magnitude of the differences between the two survey modes was nil for 19 out of the 30 items related to Lyme disease, and small for 11 of them. Results from invariance analyses confirmed the measurement invariance of an index of adaptation to Lyme disease, as well as the mean invariance across both samples. Conclusions: Our results suggested that both samples provided similar estimates of the level of adaptation to Lyme disease preventive behaviors. In sum, the results of our study showed that neither survey mode was superior to the other. Thus, in studies where adaptation to climate change is monitored over time, using a web survey instead of a telephone survey could be more cost-effective, and researchers should consider doing so in future surveys on adaptation to climate. However, we recommend conducting a pretest study before deciding whether to use both survey modes or only one of them."

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT Lyme disease, an infectious multisystemic disease is caused by \"Borrelia burgdorferi\". It is a spirochete transmitted by the Ixodes tick. Until today, only one case has been reported from Nepal. Here we report case of a 50-year female from Gulmi, who presented with a history of fever, multiple joint pain, tiredness, tingling sensation, and a painful brownish raised lesion over the neck and anterior chest. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by histological findings typical of erythema chronicum migrans and by serology. The patient was treated successfully with doxycycline. This is the second case report of Lyme disease from Nepal and the first documented case who presented with typical erythema chronicum migrans. We suspect that Lyme disease might not have been considered in the differential diagnosis of fever with rash and joint pain in Nepal and suggest that it is to be kept as a differential in the given scenario.  "

Objectives: (i) Describe the process of trialing different modalities of patient engagement as a means to integrate a diversity of patient perspectives and (ii) Describe the learning process of INESSS regarding the integration of the patient perspective. Methodology: All documents were analyzed, and a survey with all advisory committee members and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted. Each interview was transcribed verbatim and imported into QDA miner software for the purposes of analysis. Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data collection to allow for an iterative approach between data collection and analysis. Results: Five methods to integrate the perspectives of patients were used: (i) interviews with patients, (ii) inclusion of patient partners within the advisory committee, (iii) literature review, (iv) focus groups with one patient association, and (v) feedback from patient associations on recommendations intended for decision makers and other targeted stakeholders. The patient partners influenced decisions by sharing their experiential knowledge. The patient interviews and the literature review added an in-depth perspective on the disease and experience with the healthcare system. The patient association members shared their perspectives and helped disseminate the recommendation to sustain a practice change. Conclusion: The combination of methods to collect and integrate patients’ knowledge and patient associations’ perspectives helped develop a comprehensive understanding of a controversial object of evaluation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), is typically transmitted by hard-bodied ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). Whenever this tick-borne zoonosis is mentioned in medical clinics and emergency rooms, it sparks a firestorm of controversy. Denial often sets in, and healthcare practitioners dismiss the fact that this pathogenic spirochetosis is present in their area. For distribution of Bbsl across Canada, we conducted a 4-year, tick–host study (2013–2016), and collected ticks from avian and mammalian hosts from Atlantic Canada to the West Coast. Overall, 1265 ticks representing 27 tick species belonging to four genera were collected. Of the 18 tick species tested, 15 species (83%) were positive for Bbsl and, of these infected ticks, 6 species bite humans. Overall, 13 of 18 tick species tested are human-biting ticks. Our data suggest that a 6-tick, enzootic maintenance cycle of Bbsl is present in southwestern B.C., and five of these tick species bite humans. Biogeographically, the groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, has extended its home range from central and eastern Canada to southwestern British Columbia (B.C.). We posit that the Fox Sparrow, Passerella iliaca, is a reservoir-competent host for Bbsl. The Bay-breasted Warbler, Setophaga castanea, and the Tennessee Warbler, Vermivora peregrina, are new host records for the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. We provide the first report of a Bbsl-positive Amblyomma longirostre larva parasitizing a bird; this bird parasitism suggests that a Willow Flycatcher is a competent reservoir of Bbsl. Our findings show that Bbsl is present in all provinces, and that multiple tick species are implicated in the enzootic maintenance cycle of this pathogen. Ultimately, Bbsl poses a serious public health contagion Canada-wide."

		"abstract": "Objectives: We evaluated trends in non-Lyme disease tick-borne disease (NLTBI) testing at a national reference laboratory. Methods: Testing data performed at Quest Diagnostics during 2010 to 2016 were analyzed nationally and at the state level. Results: Testing and positivity for most NLTBIs increased dramatically from 2010 through 2016 based on testing from a large reference laboratory. The number of positive cases, though not as stringent as criteria for public health reporting, generally exceeds that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The frequency of NLTBI in the US is seasonal but testing activity and positive test results are observed throughout all months of the year. Positive results for NLTBI testing mostly originated from a limited number of states, indicating the geographic concentration and distribution of NLTBIs reported in this study. Conclusions: This report provides an important complementary source of data to best understand trends in and spread of NLTBI."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Although tick-borne diseases account for a large number of health care visits in the United States, clinical practices for tick bite and Lyme disease treatment and prevention are not well understood. The objective of this study was to better understand factors associated with clinical practices related to tick bites and Lyme disease. Methods: In 2013-2015, questions about tick-bite evaluation, Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment, appropriate use of Lyme disease testing, and tick-bite prevention were included in Porter Novelli’s DocStyles survey, a nationally representative annual web-based survey of health care providers. We performed analyses of responses by provider license type and state-level incidence (high or low) of Lyme disease in 2019. Results: A total of 4517 providers were surveyed across the 3 study years. Overall, 80.9% of providers reported that they had evaluated at least 1 patient for a tick bite, 47.6% had diagnosed at least 1 patient with Lyme disease, and 61.9% had treated at least 1 patient for Lyme disease in the previous year. Providers from states with a high incidence of Lyme disease saw more patients for tick bites and Lyme disease than providers from states with a low incidence of Lyme disease. Few providers correctly chose Lyme disease testing as clinically useful in the hypothetical case of a patient from a state with a high incidence of Lyme disease with an arthritic knee (36.0%) or with new-onset atrioventricular block (39.5%), and respondents across all provider types incorrectly chose testing when not clinically indicated. Most providers (69.7%) reported routinely recommending tick-bite prevention methods to patients. Conclusions: Many providers evaluate patients for tick bites and treat patients for Lyme disease, but knowledge about appropriate testing is low. Providers may benefit from tailored education about appropriate Lyme disease diagnosis, testing, and effective tick-bite prevention."

		"abstract": "In children, tick-borne encephalitis and neuroborreliosis are common infections affecting the central nervous system. As inflammatory pathways including cytokine expression are activated in these children and appear to be of importance for outcome, we hypothesized that induction of the kynurenine pathway may be part of the pathophysiological mechanism. Inflammatory biomarkers were analyzed in cerebrospinal fluid from 22 children with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), 34 children with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 6 children with no central nervous system infection. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid were increased in children with neuroborreliosis compared to the comparison group. A correlation was seen between expression of several cerebrospinal fluid cytokines and levels of kynurenine and kynurenic acid in children with neuroborreliosis but not in children with tick-borne encephalitis. These findings demonstrate a strong induction of the kynurenine pathway in children with neuroborreliosis which differs from that seen in children with tick-borne encephalitis. The importance of brain kynurenic acid (KYNA) in both immune modulation and neurotransmission raises the possibility that abnormal levels of the compound in neuroborreliosis might be of importance for the pathophysiology of the disease. Drugs targeting the enzymes of this pathway may open the venue for novel therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the Eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore efficient blood digestion is critical for survival. Studies in partially engorged ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. In this study, we investigated the potential role of serine proteases in blood digestion in replete ticks. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. Hemoglobinolytic activity was determined in vitro, with or without a serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after repletion. Knockdown of serine proteases negatively impacted blood feeding, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the midgut, and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation. Incubation of midgut extract with a trypsin inhibitor resulted in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Understanding the digestive profile of trypsin during blood meal digestion in I. scapularis improves our understanding of the basic biology of ticks and may lead to new methods for tick control."

		"abstract": "Background: With more than 300,000 new cases reported each year in the United States of America (USA), Lyme disease is a major public health concern. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) is considered the primary agent of Lyme disease in North America. However, multiple genetically diverse Borrelia species encompassing the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex and the Relapsing Fever Borrelia (RFB) group are capable of causing tickborne disease. We report preliminary results of a serological survey of previously undetected species of Bbsl and RFB in California and Mexico using a novel immunoblot technique. Methods: Serum samples were tested for seroreactivity to specific species of Bbsl and RFB using an immunoblot method based on recombinant Borrelia membrane proteins, as previously described. A sample was recorded as seropositive if it showed immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or IgG reactivity with at least two proteins from a specific Borrelia species. Results: The patient cohort consisted of 90 patients residing in California or Mexico who met the clinical case definition of chronic Lyme disease. Immunoblot testing revealed that 42 patients were seropositive for Bbsl (Group 1), while 56 patients were seropositive for RFB (Group 2). Eight patients were seropositive for both Bbsl and RFB species. Group 1 included patients who were seropositive for Bbss (14), B. californiensis (eight), B. spielmanii (10), B. afzelii/B. garinii (10), and mixed infections that included B. mayonii (three). Group 2 included patients who were seropositive for B. hermsii (nine), B. miyamotoi (seven), B. turicatae (nine), and B. turcica (two). In the remaining Group 1 and Group 2 patients, the exact Borrelia species could not be identified using the immunoblot technique. Conclusions: Lyme disease is associated with a diverse group of Borrelia species in California and Mexico. Current testing for Lyme disease focuses on detection of Bbss, possibly resulting in missed diagnoses and failure to administer appropriate antibiotic therapy in a timely manner. The genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes must be considered in future Lyme disease test development."

We conducted a systematic review of the long-term sequelae and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) associated with LD in North America and Europe. We performed searches in 6 electronic databases up to December 2018 following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including observational studies reporting long-term sequelae, HRQoL, and prognostic factors. We included 46 studies, published between 1994 and 2019. Based on 21 studies reporting attributable outcomes, higher proportions of sequelae reported from exposed patients were: neck pain, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, sleep disorder, poor appetite, and concentration difficulties. Patients with PTLDS reported impaired HRQoL compared to the general US population. Included studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study design, settings, patient characteristics, and quality. Patients with LD are more likely to report nonspecific long-term sequelae, especially those experiencing persistent symptoms posttreatment. Opportunities exist for prospective longitudinal studies to better understand LD outcomes."

However, ecological solutions to the spread of the disease are rarely pursued. Drawing on interviews with Lyme activists, politicians, and state and local administrators dealing with Lyme disease related issues as well as an analysis of Lyme disease legislation in the state of Virginia, we examine why solutions to Lyme disease most often focus on expanding individual choices for diagnosis and treatment over changing the environments that enhance the risk of Lyme disease. We argue that the emergence of Lyme disease in a neoliberal society pushed debates on how to best deal with the disease away from its underpinning environmental causes and into individual human bodies."

This exploratory study found that self-reported LD respondents have multisystem health problems that result in very poor quality of life. Lyme disease respondents experience multiple and severe symptoms, particularly flu-like illness, extreme fatigue, back and neck pain, and anxiety and depression. These symptoms were present at similar levels among all LD respondents, whether their diagnosis was clinical or serological. For all LD respondents, this study points to quality of life experiences that are powerfully negative. Practitioners and disease surveillance experts may consider LD when multisystem symptoms are severe, other etiologies are ruled out, and quality of life is threatened."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. Early confirmatory diagnosis remains a challenge, while the disease can be debilitating if left untreated. Further, the decision to test is complicated by under-reporting, low positive predictive values of testing in non-endemic areas and travel, which together exacerbate the difficulty in identification of newly endemic areas or areas of emerging concern. Spatio-temporal analyses at the national scale are critical to establishing a baseline human LD risk assessment tool that would allow for the detection of changes in these areas. A well-established surrogate for human LD incidence is canine LD seroprevalence, making it a strong candidate covariate for use in such analyses. In this paper, Bayesian statistical methods were used to fit a spatio-temporal spline regression model to estimate the relationship between human LD incidence and canine seroprevalence, treating the latter as an explanatory covariate. A strong non-linear monotonically increasing association was found. That is, this analysis suggests that mean incidence in humans increases with canine seroprevalence until the seroprevalence in dogs reaches approximately 30%. This finding reinforces the use of canines as sentinels for human LD risk, especially with respect to identifying geographic areas of concern for potential human exposure."

		"abstract": "Introduction: The incidence of tick-borne diseases in Poland and Europe is increasing which is considered to be due to climate warming which promotes the growth of tick populations. Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent leptospirosis in the US and Europe. Due to the potential for serious complications and the lack of specific prevention, diagnostic vigilance is essential so as to ensure early diagnosis and implementation of treatment. The main pathogen-transmitting vector is the tick species Ixodex ricinus. The suborder of ticks (Ixodida) belongs to the Acari subclass of arachnids. The natural reservoir of B. burgdorferi consists of small and medium-sized mammals and birds. Around ¾ of patients with Lyme disease report complaints and present disease symptoms within in the head and neck. The symptoms are diverse and may occur at all stages of the disease. These include headaches, neck pain and stiffness, sore throat, dizziness, cervical lymphadenopathy, otalgia, tinnitus, sudden hearing loss, and facial muscle paresis. Despite numerous papers being published on neurological manifestations of Lyme disease, the issues regarding the location of damage within the course of the auditory pathway and the balance system remain unanswered. In some cases hearing disorders may be due to central damage while others may be due to peripheral damage. Objective: The article provides an overview of reports on the clinical course and manifestation of Lyme borreliosis."
