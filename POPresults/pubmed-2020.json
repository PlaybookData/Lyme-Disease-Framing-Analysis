		"abstract": "Some fragmentary studies show that the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Poland is increasing. It has been generally accepted that the most affected are forestry workers and farmers. The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of borreliosis in urban and rural residents in 2008-2016. Databases on Lyme borreliosis from the National Health Fund and Central Statistical Office in Poland were analyzed. For each patient, ambulatory or discharged from every hospital, the diagnosis was compulsorily reported as encoded following the International Classification of Diseases. A steadily increasing number of patients with borreliosis in Poland was found, which doubled in 2008 - 2016. The incidence was similar in urban and rural residents. In all the provinces in Poland, an increase in incidence of borreliosis was observed, although there were big differences between them. The highest frequency of borreliosis was in Podlasie and Warmia-Masuria provinces. The lowest incidence of borreliosis was noticed in Wielkopolska province. In the most provinces the increase in the incidence of borreliosis was steady, except Warmia-Masuria, where it was very low in 2008, and soaring since 2011. The number of cases per year between 2008 - 2016 increased in both in males and females. The results suggest the need for higher awareness of the risk of Lyme borreliosis in urban residents, because the incidence of Lyme borreliosis is growing independently of the place of residence. Prompt measures to prevent tick bites and appropriate education are urgently needed."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an emerging tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is predominantly caused by Borrelia afzelii and transmitted by Ixodes ricinus. Although Borrelia behavior throughout tick development is quite well documented, specific molecular interactions between Borrelia and the tick have not been satisfactorily examined. Here, we present the first transcriptomic study focused on the expression of tick midgut genes regulated by Borrelia. By using massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE), we searched for tick transcripts expressed differentially in the midgut of unfed, 24h-fed, and fully fed I. ricinus nymphs infected with B. afzelii. In total, we identified 553 upregulated and 530 downregulated tick genes and demonstrated that B. afzelii interacts intensively with the tick. Technical and biological validations confirmed the accuracy of the transcriptome. The expression of five validated tick genes was silenced by RNA interference. Silencing of the uncharacterized protein (GXP_Contig_30818) delayed the infection progress and decreased infection prevalence in the target mice tissues. Silencing of other genes did not significantly affect tick feeding nor the transmission of B. afzelii, suggesting a possible role of these genes rather in Borrelia acquisition or persistence in ticks. Identification of genes and proteins exploited by Borrelia during transmission and establishment in a tick could help the development of novel preventive strategies for Lyme borreliosis."

The number of cases of tick-borne diseases, especially Lyme disease, is constantly growing. Over the last several years, coinfections, which could be explained as presence of two of more pathogens in one organism are being observed with growing interest. Their occurrence may lead to severe or unusual symptoms, prolonged disease duration, diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Research on this subject concerns mainly ticks of the species Ixodes ricinus, however, literature data suggest that also the species Dermacentor reticulatus plays an important role as a vector of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Recently, the blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis), which is the vector of Borrelia burgdorferi, has undergone a range expansion from the northeastern and mid-west United States to areas of southeastern Canada, including parts of Ontario. Understanding the seroprevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi in horses and risk factors for exposure is important for monitoring and preventing this emerging disease. Cross-sectional study of 551 horses in southern, central, and eastern Ontario, Canada. To assess the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi in horses in Ontario, Canada; to evaluate risk factors associated with seropositivity; and, to compare the performance of two diagnostic tests. Serum samples were obtained from clinically healthy horses in Ontario, Canada, along with completed questionnaires that were used for the risk factor analysis. Sera were tested with a Multiplex ELISA (Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University) and C6 ELISA (IDEXX SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test, IDEXX Laboratories). The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi on at least one test was 17% (91/551), though only 15 (16%) horses tested positive with both tests. A spatial cluster of cases was detected in Eastern Ontario. The odds of being seropositive for B. burgdorferi on the C6 ELISA were significantly increased when oak trees were present by pastures (OR = 7.3 (1.8-29.2), P = .005), while the odds were significantly decreased when regular tick checks were performed (OR = 0.1 (0.01-0.7), P = 0.02). Recruitment focused on known areas with blacklegged ticks as well as areas of higher horse density, which may have led to selection bias. The expansion of blacklegged tick populations poses an ongoing risk for horses. Assessment of diagnostic testing options and risk factors is important for diagnosis and prevention, and with further investigation this information may be used to propose changes in management."

Due to the lack of effective protection against this disease, it seems important to ensure a timely diagnosis for effective treatment and the prevention of serious health consequences. The aim of this study was to assess the costs of diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease in Poland. The costs incurred for the medical payer were analyzed. The cost of hospitalization due to LB for one patient in 2018 was estimated to be ~582.39 EUR, which constituted 53.10% of the average monthly salary of that year. In the analyzed period (2008-2018), the number of people treated by medical services due to Lyme disease increased, both in hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care. Although, the costs of hospitalization were the highest of the two, we noticed a change ratio between hospitalization and ambulatory specialist care in favor of the latter."

This exploratory study found that self-reported LD respondents have multisystem health problems that result in very poor quality of life. Lyme disease respondents experience multiple and severe symptoms, particularly flu-like illness, extreme fatigue, back and neck pain, and anxiety and depression. These symptoms were present at similar levels among all LD respondents, whether their diagnosis was clinical or serological. For all LD respondents, this study points to quality of life experiences that are powerfully negative. Practitioners and disease surveillance experts may consider LD when multisystem symptoms are severe, other etiologies are ruled out, and quality of life is threatened."

		"abstract": "Syphilis is a global, re-emerging sexually transmitted infection and congenital syphilis remains a major cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes due to bacterial infection in developing nations with a high rate of fetus loss. The molecular mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of the causative agent, Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum remain poorly understood due to the difficulties of working with this pathogen, including the inability to grow it in pure culture. To reduce the spread of syphilis, we must first increase our knowledge of the virulence factors of T. pallidum and their contribution to syphilis manifestations. Tp0954 was predicted to be a surface lipoprotein of T. pallidum. Therefore, we experimentally demonstrated that Tp0954 is indeed a surface protein and further investigated its role in mediating bacterial attachment to various mammalian host cells. We found that expression of Tp0954 in a poorly adherent, but physiologically related derivative strain of the Lyme disease causing spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi B314 strain promotes its binding to epithelial as well as non-epithelial cells including glioma and placental cell lines. We also found that Tp0954 expression facilitates binding of this strain to purified dermatan sulfate and heparin, and also that bacterial binding to mammalian cell lines is mediated by the presence of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in the extracellular matrix of the specific cell lines. These results suggest that Tp0954 may be involved not only in initiating T. pallidum infection by colonizing skin epithelium, but it may also contribute to disseminated infection and colonization of distal tissues. Significantly, we found that Tp0954 promotes binding to the human placental choriocarcinoma BeWo cell line, which is of trophoblastic endocrine cell type, as well as human placental tissue sections, suggesting its role in placental colonization and possible contribution to transplacental transmission of T. pallidum. Altogether, these novel findings offer an important step toward unraveling syphilis pathogenesis, including placental colonization and T. pallidum vertical transmission from mother to fetus during pregnancy."

Participants were 82 individuals who had a confirmed diagnosis of Lyme disease and had been experiencing symptoms for 6 months or more. They were recruited through various online mechanisms (e.g., social media, online support groups), and they completed the consent form and questionnaires via Qualtrics. Participants completed questions about their demographics and health status as well as the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (Moss-Morris et al., 2002), the Brief COPE (Carver, 1997), and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). Illness perceptions and coping explained a significant amount of variance in HRQOL. Among the illness perceptions, the consequences and identity dimensions were most strongly associated with HRQOL. Behavioral disengagement and substance use were the coping strategies most strongly associated with the emotional health outcomes. Illness perceptions and coping are related to HRQOL among individuals with CLD. Given the increase in Lyme disease incidence and the chronicity of symptoms in some cases, it is critical to continue to examine the psychosocial factors associated with HRQOL in this population."

One hundred and 29 cases of Lyme borreliosis were diagnosed in a single hospital representing 27 % of all cases reported in the Veneto region in the same period. The mean annual incidence of Lyme borreliosis was 0.992/100,000 inhabitants. A peak incidence of 2/100,000 inhabitants was observed in 2018. Early localized Lyme borreliosis was the most common presentation (74 %), followed by early disseminated Lyme borreliosis (21 %). One possible early Lyme neuroborreliosis and two cranial neuropathies were diagnosed. IgM and/or IgG borrelia antibodies were positive in 90 % of the cases. This significant increase of Lyme borreliosis incidence in the province of Verona highlights the need to increase knowledge on its epidemiology and clinical manifestation among both the general population and clinicians to allow early diagnosis and treatment."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, the leading tick-borne illness in the United States. However, due to, in part, to the significant number of proteins of unknown function encoded across the complex fragmented genome, the molecular mechanisms of B. burgdorferi infection remain largely undefined. Previous work identified the virulence determinant gene, bbk13, which is critical for B. burgdorferi's ability to establish a productive disseminated infection. BBK13 is an immunogenic, non-surface exposed protein of unknown function predicted to harbor an N-terminal transmembrane domain and annotated as a member of the SIMPL domain protein superfamily (PF04402). In eukaryotes, SIMPL domain proteins have been shown to contribute to NF-kappa-B signaling but have no known functions in prokaryotes. Herein we investigated the biochemical and biophysical properties of BBK13 toward elucidation of its function. Bioinformatics analysis revealed secondary and tertiary structural homology between BBK13 and two other prokaryotic SIMPL domain proteins for which the crystal structures have been solved, Brucella abortus BP26 and Campylobacter jejuni cjSLP. Furthermore, comparable to BP26, recombinant BBK13 self-assembled into multimeric complexes in vitro and endogenous BBK13 was found in large oligomeric complexes in the spirochete membrane. Together these data suggest that the oligomeric structure of BBK13 may be important for the molecular function of this critical infection protein."

		"abstract": "Over the past three decades, citizens of Maine in the northeastern United States have experienced increasing blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) abundance and rising incidence of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases. White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) overabundance has been considered one cause of the high incidence of tick-borne diseases on offshore islands of New England. Most of Maine's 15 offshore, unbridged island communities have a history of concern about ticks, Lyme disease, and white-tailed deer overabundance, but have been challenged to keep deer numbers down through hunting or culls. This history has led to perennial, often divisive community debates about whether and how to reduce the size of their deer herds. In 2016 we conducted a convenience sample survey of year-round and summer residents of Maine's offshore islands to quantify the level of concern about Lyme disease, and assess the motivations and level of support for deer herd reduction. Among respondents, 84 % agreed Lyme disease was a problem on their island and 61 % supported deer herd reduction. Agreement that Lyme disease was a problem was associated with having acquired tick-borne disease as well as with tick bites without disease. Respondents ranked deer overabundance as a top cause of tick abundance and tick-borne disease and supported deer herd reduction as an approach to reduce the risk of Lyme disease. Other problems associated with deer overabundance (vehicle collisions, damage to landscaping, and damage to forests) also motivated support for deer reduction. Approval of doe permits, an expanded archery season, and sharpshooting as reduction methods was greater than an expanded firearms season. Respondents felt responsibility for tick control fell to the town for the most part, and recognized that multiple factors have contributed to the tick problem in Maine, not just deer."

		"abstract": "The western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus, an important vector in the western United States of two zoonotic spirochetes: Borrelia burgdorferi (also called Borreliella burgdorferi), causing Lyme disease, and Borrelia miyamotoi, causing a relapsing fever-type illness. Human cases of Lyme disease are well-documented in California, with increased risk in the north coastal areas and western slopes of the Sierra Nevada range. Despite the established presence of B. miyamotoi in the human-biting I. pacificus tick in California, clinical cases with this spirochete have not been well studied. To assess exposure to B. burgdorferi and B. miyamotoi in California, and to address the hypothesis that B. miyamotoi exposure in humans is similar in geographic range to B. burgdorferi, 1,700 blood donor sera from California were tested for antibodies to both pathogens. Sampling was from high endemic and low endemic counties for Lyme disease in California. All sera were screened using the C6 ELISA. All C6 positive and equivocal samples and nine randomly chosen C6 negative samples were further analyzed for B. burgdorferi antibody using IgG western blot and a modified two ELISA test system and for B. miyamotoi antibody using the GlpQ ELISA and B. miyamotoi whole cell sonicate western blot. Of the 1,700 samples tested in series, eight tested positive for antibodies to B. burgdorferi (0.47%, Exact 95% CI: 0.20, 0.93) and two tested positive for antibodies to B. miyamotoi (0.12%, Exact 95% CI: 0.01, 0.42). There was no statistically significant difference in seroprevalence for either pathogen between high and low Lyme disease endemic counties. Our results confirm a low frequency of Lyme disease and an even lower frequency of B. miyamotoi exposure among adult blood donors in California; however, our findings reinforce public health messaging that there is risk of infection by these emerging diseases in the state."

		"abstract": "In 2018, 23,558 confirmed cases and 10,108 probable cases of Lyme disease were reported in the United States, with 96% of all cases coming from 14 states. Lyme carditis is well described, occurring in less than 1% of Lyme disease. High-grade heart block is uncommon in early disseminated Lyme disease. In Lyme carditis due to sinus node dysfunction and/or high grade atrioventricular block, the pulse rates are significantly lower which can lead to syncope. This can happen in the setting of an unstable ventricular escape rhythm with pulse rates ranging around 30 beats per minute or lower. In patients with low cardiovascular reserve, high-degree AV block can cause sudden death. Here we describe a rare case of profound bradycardia in disseminated Lyme disease. The patient's only two symptoms are bradycardia and jaw pain. He lacks erythema migrans, neurological symptoms or syncope - despite having high-degree AV block. Initially prescribed doxycycline 100mg BID, his PR interval begins to normalize, but once a Lyme titre was positive for IgM (p41, p39, p23) and IgG (p66, p45, p41, p39, p23, p18), the patient was switched to 2g ceftriaxone IV Q 24h, per Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines. After several days he feels better and was discharged home to complete antibiotics and wear a cardiac event monitor. Lyme disease has three distinct stages that include early localized infection, early disseminated disease, and late infection. At the time of Lyme carditis diagnosis, common symptoms include erythema migrans, malaise, polyarthritis, Bell's palsy and other neurological symptoms - all of which were lacking in our patient. The prognosis for Lyme carditis is generally good, despite disagreement over the incidence of persistent B. burgdorferi infection. This patient's unique presentation of Lyme carditis is further evidence of variability in cardiac symptoms depending on one's immunological and physiological ability to combat acute spirochete infection."

By testing 13,400 Ixodes ticks from 17 US states spanning five geographical regions for etiological agents of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto [s.s.] and Borrelia mayonii), Borrelia miyamotoi disease (Borrelia miyamotoi), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and babesiosis (Babesia microti) we show that B. burgdorferi s.s. was the most prevalent and widespread pathogen. Borrelia miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, and B. microti were widespread but less prevalent than B. burgdorferi s.s. Coinfections with B. burgdorferi s.s. and A. phagocytophilum or B. microti were most common in the Northeast and occurred at rates higher than expected based on rates of single infections in that region."

		"abstract": "Antigen presentation is a crucial innate immune cell function that instructs adaptive immune cells. Loss of this pathway severely impairs the development of adaptive immune responses. To investigate whether B. burgdorferi sensu lato. spirochetes modulate the induction of an effective immune response, primary human PBMCs were isolated from healthy volunteers and stimulated with B. burgdorferi s.l. Through cell entry, TNF receptor I, and RIP1 signaling cascades, B. burgdorferi s.l. strongly downregulated genes and proteins involved in antigen presentation, specifically HLA-DM, MHC class II and CD74. Antigen presentation proteins were distinctively inhibited in monocyte subsets, monocyte-derived macrophages, and dendritic cells. When compared to a range of other pathogens, B. burgdorferi s.l.-induced suppression of antigen presentation appears to be specific. Inhibition of antigen presentation interfered with T-cell recognition of B. burgdorferi s.l., and memory T-cell responses against Candidaalbicans. Re-stimulation of PBMCs with the commensal microbe C.albicans following B. burgdorferi s.l. exposure resulted in significantly reduced IFN-γ, IL-17 and IL-22 production. These findings may explain why patients with Lyme borreliosis develop delayed adaptive immune responses. Unravelling the mechanism of B. burgdorferi s.l.-induced inhibition of antigen presentation, via cell entry, TNF receptor I, and RIP1 signaling cascades, explains the difficulty to diagnose the disease based on serology and to obtain an effective vaccine against Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The host immune response to infection is a well-coordinated system of innate and adaptive immune cells working in concert to prevent the colonization and dissemination of a pathogen. While this typically leads to a beneficial outcome and the suppression of disease pathogenesis, the Lyme borreliosis bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, can elicit an immune profile that leads to a deleterious state. As B. burgdorferi s.l. produces no known toxins, it is suggested that the immune and inflammatory response of the host are responsible for the manifestation of symptoms, including flu-like symptoms, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive disorders. The past several years has seen a substantial increase in the use of microarray and sequencing technologies to investigate the transcriptome response induced by B. burgdorferi s.l., thus enabling researchers to identify key factors and pathways underlying the pathophysiology of Lyme borreliosis. In this review we present the major host transcriptional outcomes induced by the bacterium across several studies and discuss the overarching theme of the host inflammatory and immune response, and how it influences the pathology of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Many species have experienced dramatic changes in both geographic range and population sizes in recent history. Increases in the geographic range or population size of disease vectors have public health relevance as these increases often precipitate the emergence of infectious diseases in human populations. Accurately identifying environmental factors affecting the biogeographic patterns of vector species is a long-standing analytical challenge, stemming from a paucity of data capturing periods of rapid changes in vector demographics. We systematically investigated the occurrence and abundance of nymphal Ixodes scapularis ticks at 532 sampling locations throughout New York State (NY), USA, between 2008 and 2018, a time frame that encompasses the emergence of diseases vectored by these ticks. Analyses of these field-collected data demonstrated a range expansion into northern and western NY during the last decade. Nymphal abundances increased in newly colonised areas, while remaining stable in areas with long-standing populations over the last decade. These trends in the geographic range and abundance of nymphs correspond to both the geographic expansion of human Lyme disease cases and increases in incidence rates. Analytic models fitted to these data incorporating time, space, and environmental factors, accurately identified drivers of the observed changes in nymphal occurrence and abundance. These models accounted for the spatial and temporal variation in the occurrence and abundance of nymphs and can accurately predict nymphal population patterns in future years. Forecasting disease risk at fine spatial scales prior to the transmission season can influence both public health mitigation strategies and individual behaviours, potentially impacting tick-borne disease risk and subsequently human disease incidence."

Research questions: To what extent does acceptability vary by vaccine type? To what extent does acceptability of vaccines in development vary by race and other key demographics? To what extent are general vaccine hesitancy and key demographics associated with acceptability of vaccines in development? Cross-sectional online survey administered through GfK's KnowledgePanel in 2015. Analysis completed in 2020. Nationally representative sample of Black and White American adults (n = 1,643). Willingness to accept a novel vaccine was measured on a 4-point Likert scale. Independent variables included demographics (e.g. age, race, gender) and measures of vaccine hesitancy, trust, and the \"Three C's\" of vaccine confidence, complacency, and convenience. Exploratory analysis including descriptive statistics and regression modeling. Acceptability varied from 77% for a cancer vaccine to 55% for an obesity vaccine. White race, male gender, older age, having a chronic health condition, and higher socioeconomic status were associated with higher acceptability. Higher vaccine confidence and lower vaccine hesitancy were predictors for acceptability. The success of a vaccine depends on widespread public acceptance. Vaccine hesitancy may hinder acceptance of future vaccines, with significant differences by demographics. Future social science research is necessary to better understand and address vaccine hesitancy."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease Borrelia are obligately parasitic, tick- transmitted, invasive, persistent bacterial pathogens that cause disease in humans and non-reservoir vertebrates primarily through the induction of inflammation. During transmission from the infected tick, the bacteria undergo significant changes in gene expression, resulting in adaptation to the mammalian environment. The organisms multiply and spread locally and induce inflammatory responses that, in humans, result in clinical signs and symptoms. Borrelia virulence involves a multiplicity of mechanisms for dissemination and colonization of multiple tissues and evasion of host immune responses. Most of the tissue damage, which is seen in non-reservoir hosts, appears to result from host inflammatory reactions, despite the low numbers of bacteria in affected sites. This host response to the Lyme disease Borrelia can cause neurologic, cardiovascular, arthritic, and dermatologic manifestations during the disseminated and persistent stages of infection. The mechanisms by which a paucity of organisms (in comparison to many other infectious diseases) can cause varied and in some cases profound inflammation and symptoms remains mysterious but are the subjects of diverse ongoing investigations. In this review, we provide an overview of virulence mechanisms and determinants for which roles have been demonstrated in vivo, primarily in mouse models of infection."

All documents were analyzed, and a survey with all advisory committee members and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders were conducted. Each interview was transcribed verbatim and imported into QDA miner software for the purposes of analysis. Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data collection to allow for an iterative approach between data collection and analysis. Five methods to integrate the perspectives of patients were used: (i) interviews with patients, (ii) inclusion of patient partners within the advisory committee, (iii) literature review, (iv) focus groups with one patient association, and (v) feedback from patient associations on recommendations intended for decision makers and other targeted stakeholders. The patient partners influenced decisions by sharing their experiential knowledge. The patient interviews and the literature review added an in-depth perspective on the disease and experience with the healthcare system. The patient association members shared their perspectives and helped disseminate the recommendation to sustain a practice change. The combination of methods to collect and integrate patients' knowledge and patient associations' perspectives helped develop a comprehensive understanding of a controversial object of evaluation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America, is increasing in incidence and geographic distribution as the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis, spreads to new regions. We re-construct the spatial-temporal invasion of the tick and human disease in the Midwestern US, a major focus of Lyme disease transmission, from 1967 to 2018, to analyse the influence of spatial factors on the geographic spread. A regression model indicates that three spatial factors-proximity to a previously invaded county, forest cover and adjacency to a river-collectively predict tick occurrence. Validation of the predictive capability of this model correctly predicts counties invaded or uninvaded with 90.6% and 98.5% accuracy, respectively. Reported incidence increases in counties after the first report of the tick; based on this modelled relationship, we identify 31 counties where we suspect I. scapularis already occurs yet remains undetected. Finally, we apply the model to forecast tick establishment by 2021 and predict 42 additional counties where I. scapularis will probably be detected based upon historical drivers of geographic spread. Our findings leverage resources dedicated to tick and human disease reporting and provide the opportunity to take proactive steps (e.g. educational efforts) to prevent and limit transmission in areas of future geographic spread."

		"abstract": "Ticks are globally distributed arthropods and a public health concern due to the many human pathogens they carry and transmit, including the causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi. As tick species' ranges increase, so do the number of reported tick related illnesses. The microbiome is a critical part of understanding arthropod biology, and the microbiome of pathogen vectors may provide critical insight into disease transmission and management. Yet we lack a comprehensive understanding of the microbiome of wild ticks, including what effect the presence of multiple tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) has on the microbiome. In this study we chose samples based on life stage (adult or nymph) and which TBPs were present. We used DNA from previously extracted Ixodes scapularis ticks that tested positive for zero, one, two or three common TBPs (B. burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti). We produced 16S rRNA amplicon data for the whole tick microbiome and compared samples across TBPs status, single vs multiple coinfections, and life stages. Focusing on samples with a single TBP, we found no significant differences in microbiome diversity in ticks that were infected with B. burgdorferi and ticks with no TBPs. When comparing multiple TBPs, we found no significant difference in both alpha and beta diversity between ticks with a single TBP and ticks with multiple TBPs. Removal of TBPs from the microbiome did not alter alpha or beta diversity results. Life stage significantly correlated to variation in beta diversity and nymphs had higher alpha diversity than adult ticks. Rickettsia, a common tick endosymbiont, was the most abundant genus. This study confirms that the wild tick microbiome is highly influenced by life stage and much less by the presence of human pathogenic bacteria."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, a public health threat of significance to both veterinary and human medicine, is caused by the tick (Ixodes) transmitted spirochete, Borreliella burgdorferi. Here we report on the immunogenicity and efficacy of VANGUARD®crLyme (Zoetis), the most recent canine Lyme disease vaccine to be approved by the United States Department of Agriculture. VANGUARD®crLyme is a subunit vaccine consisting of outer surface protein A (OspA) and a recombinant outer surface protein C (OspC) based-chimeric epitope protein (chimeritope) that consists of at least 14 different linear epitopes derived from diverse OspC proteins. The combination of OspA and the OspC chimeritope (Ch14) in the vaccine formulation allows for the development of humoral immune responses that work synergistically to target spirochetes in both ticks and in mammals. Immunogenicity was assessed in purpose-bred dogs. A two-dose vaccination protocol resulted in high antibody titers to OspA and Ch14 and vaccinal antibody reacted with 25 different recombinant OspC variants. Efficacy was demonstrated using an Ixodes scapularis -purpose bred dog challenge model. Vaccination with VANGUARD®crLyme provided protection against infection and prevented the development of clinical manifestations and histopathological changes associated with Lyme disease."

In 2017 the National Lyme Disease Centre (NLe) has been established in the Netherlands. Two university medical centres, the RIVM and the Lyme Organization participate in the NLe where diagnostics and treatment are offered to patients and research into Lyme disease is carried out. Ideally, collaboration between doctors, researchers and patients leads to research that addresses relevant and urgent questions. Regarding chronic Lyme disease not as a hype but a hypothesis that needs to be verified or falsified, could help both doctors and patients, assuming that they can conclude together that some notions might have seemed rational, but nonetheless have to be discarded based on the results of sound scientific research. That might open new ways to explore treatment of persisting symptoms."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an infectious disease that is increasing in frequency and can cause various forms of carditis in its disseminated phase. In otherwise healthy patients presenting with new-onset atrio-ventricular dissociation, Lyme carditis must be on the differential; however, due to its rarity in non-endemic regions, the clinician must remain vigilant and keep it on the differential. The objective of this clinical case report is to call attention to the importance of rapid diagnosis of Lyme carditis in regions where the disease is not common. The patient presented in this report is a 27-year-old, previously healthy male complaining of fatigue and presyncope over the past 48 hours who presented to a community ED in western Washington State. He had been traveling the country rock climbing and recalled a febrile illness and rash in the preceding three months. He was found to be in third-degree atrio-ventricular block on admission to the ED and was promptly diagnosed with Lyme carditis. He was hospitalized on telemetry monitoring and was treated with transvenous cardiac pacing and IV ceftriaxone. His atrio-ventricular block gradually resolved and he was discharged without need for permanent pacemaker placement. He was able to return to his active lifestyle of hiking, climbing, and other outdoor recreational activities. This case demonstrates how Lyme carditis must be a foremost consideration in a patient with new-onset conductive heart disease, particularly in patients without risk factors for other causes of atrio-ventricular block. A thorough travel and exposure history must be taken when Lyme carditis is suspected in patients presenting outside of areas where the disease is endemic."

		"abstract": "All members of the Borrelia genus that have been examined harbour a linear chromosome that is about 900 kbp in length, as well as a plethora of both linear and circular plasmids in the 5-220 kbp size range. Genome sequences for 27 Lyme disease Borrelia isolates have been determined since the elucidation of the B. burgdorferi B31 genome sequence in 1997. The chromosomes, which carry the vast majority of the housekeeping genes, appear to be very constant in gene content and organization across all Lyme disease Borrelia species. The content of the plasmids, which carry most of the genes that encode the differentially expressed surface proteins that interact with the spirochete's arthropod and vertebrate hosts, is much more variable. Lyme disease Borrelia isolates carry between 7-21 different plasmids, ranging in size from 5-84 kbp. All strains analyzed to date harbor three plasmids, cp26, lp54 and lp17. The plasmids are unusual, as compared to most bacterial plasmids, in that they contain many paralogous sequences, a large number of pseudogenes, and, in some cases, essential genes. In addition, a number of the plasmids have features indicating that they are prophages. Numerous methods have been developed for Lyme disease Borrelia strain typing. These have proven valuable for clinical and epidemiological studies, as well as phylogenomic and population genetic analyses. Increasingly, these approaches have been displaced by whole genome sequencing techniques. Some correlations between genome content and pathogenicity have been deduced, and comparative whole genome analyses promise future progress in this arena."

		"abstract": "Background: Longer time between symptom onset and treatment of Lyme disease has been associated with poor outcomes. Reducing time-to-treatment requires knowledge of risks for treatment delays. We conducted a population-based study to evaluate factors associated with delayed treatment of Lyme disease and the relation between delayed treatment and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Methods: We mailed questionnaires to 5,314 individuals with a Lyme disease diagnosis or blood test followed by an antibiotic order in the medical record of a Pennsylvania health system from 2015 to 2017. Analyses were confined to 778 respondents who reported that they were treated for Lyme disease within the past 5 years and reported a rash and/or a positive blood test for Lyme disease. Time-to-treatment was calculated as the sum of two windows before and after seeking care for Lyme disease symptoms: time to first medical contact and time under care. We used logistic regression to evaluate factors associated with delayed time-to-treatment in each time window (>14 days vs. ≤14 days) and the association between total time-to-treatment (>30 days vs. ≤30 days) and PTLDS. We used inverse probability weighting to calculate estimates for the study's source population (5,314 individuals sent questionnaires). Results: In the source population, 25% had time to first contact >14 days, 21% had time under care >14 days, and 31% had a total time-to-treatment >30 days. Being uninsured and attributing initial symptoms to something other than Lyme disease were positively associated with delayed time to first medical contact, while seeking care at an urgent care or emergency setting (vs. primary care) was negatively associated. Diagnoses between November and April, and the absence of rash were positively associated with delays. Individuals whose treatment was delayed, defined as time-to treatment >30 days had 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.25, 4.05) times the odds of PTLDS as those who were treated within 30 days of symptom onset. Conclusions: In a population-based study in Pennsylvania, one-third of Lyme disease patients reported delayed treatment, which was associated with PTLDS. To improve Lyme disease outcomes, prevention efforts should aim to reduce the time before and after seeking care."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, can acquire and transmit tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) responsible for diseases such as human granulocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [ANPH]), babesiosis (Babesia microti [BABE]), Lyme borreliosis (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato [BBSL]), and the relatively novel relapsing fever-like illness, Borrelia miyamotoi (BMIY) disease in the northeastern United States. Coinfections with these pathogens are becoming increasingly more common in I. scapularis and their hosts, likely attributed to their shared enzootic cycles. Urban habitats are favorable to host species such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and these ungulates are known to be important to I. scapularis for reproduction and dispersal in North America. To understand the relationship between TBPs, white-tailed deer, and I. scapularis, we sampled eight sites across central Maryland collecting I. scapularis using standard tick dragging/flagging methods and retrieved others from deer carcasses. Pathogenic TBP species in each tick were determined using qPCR. In total, 903 adult ticks (deer: n = 573; questing: n = 330) revealed landscape-level prevalence of ANPH (27.8%), BABE (1.3%), BBSL (14.6%), and BMIY (0.8%) as singular infections overall. However, secondary coinfections of ANPH and BBSL were highest (9.9%) in ticks feeding from deer while associations of BBSL and BABE (4.2%) were highest in questing ticks. Results from this study provide evidence suggesting that adult I. scapularis acquire pathogenic species through phenologically associated host use, and thus, subsequent infections found in adults may provide insights into coinfection relationships."

As part of its mandate, the Canadian Lyme Disease Research Network (CLyDRN) launched a pan-Canadian sentinel surveillance initiative, the Canadian Lyme Sentinel Network (CaLSeN), in 2019. To create a standardized, national sentinel surveillance network providing a real-time portrait of the evolving environmental risk of Lyme disease in each province. A multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach was used in the selection of sentinel regions. Within each sentinel region, a systematic drag sampling protocol was performed in selected sampling sites. Ticks collected during these active surveillance visits were identified to species, and Ixodes spp. ticks were tested for infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti and Powassan virus. In 2019, a total of 567 Ixodes spp. ticks (I. scapularis [n=550]; I. pacificus [n=10]; and I. angustus [n=7]) were collected in seven provinces: British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Québec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. The highest mean tick densities (nymphs/100 m2) were found in sentinel regions of Lunenburg (0.45), Montréal (0.43) and Granby (0.38). Overall, the Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence in ticks was 25.2% (0%-45.0%). One I. angustus nymph from British Columbia was positive for Babesia microti, a first for the province. The deer tick lineage of Powassan virus was detected in one adult I. scapularis in Nova Scotia. CaLSeN provides the first coordinated national active surveillance initiative for tick-borne disease in Canada. Through multidisciplinary collaborations between experts in each province, the pilot year was successful in establishing a baseline for Lyme disease risk across the country, allowing future trends to be detected and studied."

		"abstract": "Ticks transmit a diverse array of microbes to vertebrate hosts, including human pathogens, which has led to a human-centric focus in this vector system. Far less is known about pathogens of ticks themselves. Here, we discover that a toxin in blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) horizontally acquired from bacteria-called domesticated amidase effector 2 (dae2)-has evolved to kill mammalian skin microbes with remarkable efficiency. Secreted into the saliva and gut of ticks, Dae2 limits skin-associated staphylococci in ticks while feeding. In contrast, Dae2 has no intrinsic ability to kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne Lyme disease bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest ticks resist their own pathogens while tolerating symbionts. Thus, just as tick symbionts can be pathogenic to humans, mammalian commensals can be harmful to ticks. Our study underscores how virulence is context-dependent and bolsters the idea that \"pathogen\" is a status and not an identity."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a tick-borne, zoonosis of adults and children caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The ailment, widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, continues to increase globally due to multiple environmental factors, coupled with increased incursion of humans into habitats that harbor the spirochete. B. burgdorferi sensu lato is transmitted by ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex. In North America, B. burgdorferi causes nearly all infections; in Europe, B. afzelii and B. garinii are most associated with human disease. The spirochete's unusual fragmented genome encodes a plethora of differentially expressed outer surface lipoproteins that play a seminal role in the bacterium's ability to sustain itself within its enzootic cycle and cause disease when transmitted to its incidental human host. Tissue damage and symptomatology (i.e., clinical manifestations) result from the inflammatory response elicited by the bacterium and its constituents. The deposition of spirochetes into human dermal tissue generates a local inflammatory response that manifests as erythema migrans (EM), the hallmark skin lesion. If treated appropriately and early, the prognosis is excellent. However, in untreated patients, the disease may present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, most commonly involving the central nervous system, joints, or heart. A small percentage (~10%) of patients may go on to develop a poorly defined fibromyalgia-like illness, post-treatment Lyme disease (PTLD) unresponsive to prolonged antimicrobial therapy. Below we integrate current knowledge regarding the ecologic, epidemiologic, microbiologic, and immunologic facets of Lyme disease into a conceptual framework that sheds light on the disorder that healthcare providers encounter."

		"abstract": "Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi, along with closely related species, is the etiologic agent of Lyme disease. The spirochete subsists in an enzootic cycle that encompasses acquisition from a vertebrate host to a tick vector and transmission from a tick vector to a vertebrate host. To adapt to its environment and persist in each phase of its enzootic cycle, B. burgdorferi wields three systems to regulate the expression of genes: the RpoN-RpoS alternative sigma factor cascade, the Hk1/Rrp1 two-component system and its product c-di-GMP, and the stringent response mediated by RelBbu and DksA. These regulatory systems respond to enzootic phase-specific signals and are controlled or fine- tuned by transcription factors, including BosR and BadR, as well as small RNAs, including DsrABb and Bb6S RNA. In addition, several other DNA-binding and RNA-binding proteins have been identified, although their functions have not all been defined. Global changes in gene expression revealed by high-throughput transcriptomic studies have elucidated various regulons, albeit technical obstacles have mostly limited this experimental approach to cultivated spirochetes. Regardless, we know that the spirochete, which carries a relatively small genome, regulates the expression of a considerable number of genes required for the transitions between the tick vector and the vertebrate host as well as the adaptation to each."

		"abstract": "With one exception (epidemic relapsing fever), borreliae are obligately maintained in nature by ticks. Although some Borrelia spp. may be vertically transmitted to subsequent generations of ticks, most require amplification by a vertebrate host because inheritance is not stable. Enzootic cycles of borreliae have been found globally; those receiving the most attention from researchers are those whose vectors have some degree of anthropophily and, thus, cause zoonoses such as Lyme disease or relapsing fever. To some extent, our views on the synecology of the borreliae has been dominated by an applied focus, viz., analyses that seek to understand the elements of human risk for borreliosis. But, the elements of borrelial perpetuation do not necessarily bear upon risk, nor do our concepts of risk provide the best structure for analyzing perpetuation. We identify the major global themes for the perpetuation of borreliae, and summarize local variations on those themes, focusing on key literature to outline the factors that serve as the basis for the distribution and abundance of borreliae."

To verify the presence of Borrelia spp., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) extracted from individual blood samples was analyzed by nested-PCR, with markers targeted for amplification of portions of the flagellin B gene (flaB) present in Borrelia spirochetes. Ticks were also collected through inspection of the animals. Sera from 93 of 176 (52.84%) dogs were reactive to the indirect ELISA. Geographic prevalence varied from 54.35% (25/46) in Boyeros, 44.44% (20/45) in Cotorro, 66.67% (22/33) in Habana del Este, and 50% (26/52) in San José de las Lajas.

In total, 62 of 67 (92.5%) patients treated with disulfiram were able to endorse a net benefit of the treatment with regard to their symptoms. Moreover, 12 of 33 (36.4%) patients who completed one or two courses of \"high-dose\" therapy enjoyed an \"enduring remission\", defined as remaining clinically well for ≥6 months without further anti-infective treatment. The most common adverse reactions from disulfiram treatment in the high-dose group were fatigue (66.7%), psychiatric symptoms (48.5%), peripheral neuropathy (27.3%), and mild to moderate elevation of liver enzymes (15.2%). We observed that although patients on high dose experienced a higher risk for adverse reactions than those on a low dose, high-dose patients were significantly more likely to achieve enduring remission."

		"abstract": "The mammalian host responds to infection with Borrelia spirochetes through a highly orchestrated immune defense involving innate and adaptive effector functions aimed toward limiting pathogen burdens, minimizing tissue injury, and preventing subsequent reinfection. The evolutionary adaptation of Borrelia spirochetes to their reservoir mammalian hosts may allow for its persistence despite this immune defense. This review summarizes our current understanding of the host immune response to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, the most widely studied Borrelia spp. and etiologic agent of Lyme borreliosis. Pertinent literature will be reviewed with emphasis on in vitro, ex vivo and animal studies that influenced our understanding of both the earliest responses to B. burgdorferi as it enters the mammalian host and those that evolve as spirochetes disseminate and establish infection in multiple tissues. Our focus is on the immune response of inbred mice, the most commonly studied animal model of B. burgdorferi infection and surrogate for one of this pathogen's principle natural reservoir hosts, the white-footed deer mouse. Comparison will be made to the immune responses of humans with Lyme borreliosis. Our goal is to provide an understanding of the dynamics of the mammalian immune response during infection with B. burgdorferi and its relation to the outcomes in reservoir (mouse) and non-reservoir (human) hosts."

These atypical bacterial pathogens are maintained in a complex enzootic life cycle that primarily involves a vertebrate host and Ixodes spp. ticks. In the Northeastern United States, I. scapularis is the main vector, while wild rodents serve as the mammalian reservoir host. As B. burgdorferi is transmitted only by I. scapularis and closely related ticks, the spirochete-tick interactions are thought to be highly specific. Various borrelial and arthropod proteins that directly or indirectly contribute to the natural cycle of B. burgdorferi infection have been identified. Discrete molecular interactions between spirochetes and tick components also have been discovered, which often play critical roles in pathogen persistence and transmission by the arthropod vector. This review will focus on the past discoveries and future challenges that are relevant to our understanding of the molecular interactions between B. burgdorferi and Ixodes ticks. This information will not only impact scientific advancements in the research of tick- transmitted infections but will also contribute to the development of novel preventive measures that interfere with the B. burgdorferi life cycle."

With the development of safe and efficacious vaccines, LD can potentially be prevented. Vaccination offers a cost-effective and safe approach for decreasing the risk of infection. While LD vaccines have been widely used in veterinary medicine, they are not available as a preventive tool for humans. Central to the development of effective vaccines is an understanding of the enzootic cycle of LD, differential gene expression of Borrelia burgdorferi in response to environmental variables, and the genetic and antigenic diversity of the unique bacteria that cause this debilitating disease. Here we review these areas as they pertain to past and present efforts to develop human, veterinary, and reservoir targeting LD vaccines. In addition, we offer a brief overview of additional preventative measures that should employed in conjunction with vaccination."

		"abstract": "Tick bites in Australia are linked to the transmission of a variety of infectious diseases in humans, livestock and wildlife. Despite this recognition, little is currently known about the variety of potential pathogens that are carried and transmitted by Australian ticks. In this study, we attempted to expand knowledge of Australian tick-borne bacterial pathogens by analyzing various tick species from the state of Queensland for potential human pathogens belonging to the Rickettsia, Coxiella and Borrelia genera. A total of 203 ticks, comprising of four genera and nine different tick species, were screened by specific qPCR assays. An overall Rickettsia qPCR positivity of 6.4% (13/203) was detected with rickettsial DNA found in four tick species (Ixodes holocyclus, I. tasmani, Amblyommatriguttatum, and Haemaphysalis longicornis). Amplification and analysis of several rickettsial genes from rickettsial qPCR positive samples identified sequences closely related to but genetically distinct from several previously described cultured and uncultured rickettsial species in the Rickettsia spotted fever subgroup. No ticks were positive for either Coxiella or Borrelia DNA. This work suggests that a further diversity of rickettsiae remain to be described in Australian ticks with the full importance of these bacteria to human and animal health yet to be elucidated."

		"abstract": "Birds can act as reservoirs of tick-borne pathogens and can also disperse pathogen-containing ticks to both nearby and remote localities. The aims of this study were to estimate tick infestation patterns on migratory birds and the prevalence of different Borrelia species and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in ticks removed from birds in south-eastern Sweden. Ticks were collected from resident and migratory birds captured at the Ottenby Bird Observatory, Öland, Sweden, from March to November 2009. Ticks were molecularly identified to species, and morphologically to developmental stage, and the presence of Borrelia bacteria and TBEV was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. A total of 1339 ticks in the genera Haemaphysalis, Hyalomma, and Ixodes was recorded of which I. ricinus was the most abundant species. Important tick hosts were the European robin (Erithacus rubecula), Blackbird (Turdus merula), Tree pipit (Anthus trivialis), Eurasian wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), Common redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus), Willow warbler (Phylloscopus trochilus), and Common whitethroat (Sylvia communis). Borrelia bacteria were detected in 25% (285/1,124) of the detached ticks available for analysis. Seven Borrelia species (B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi (s.s.), B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. turdi, B. valaisiana, and B. miyamotoi) were identified. B. turdi was recorded for the first time in ticks in Sweden. The number of Borrelia cells per tick ranged from 2.0 × 100 to 7.0 × 105. B. miyamotoi-containing ticks contained a significantly higher median number of Borrelia cells than B. burgdorferi (s.l.)-containing ticks. B. garinii and B. miyamotoi were the most prevalent Borrelia species in tick larvae. Larvae of I. ricinus with B. garinii were removed from seven bird species, particularly S. communis and A. trivialis, which may suggest that the larvae had contracted the Borrelia bacteria from or via these birds. Also, a high percentage of tick larvae containing B. miyamotoi was removed from E. rubecula. All ticks were negative for TBEV. The results corroborate the view that the contributions of birds to human disease are substantial, particularly as blood hosts for ticks and for their short-, medium-, and long-distance dispersal. Moreover, several ground-foraging bird species appear to be important for the maintenance and dispersal of Borrelia species. The absence of TBEV in the ticks conforms to other similar studies."

		"abstract": "The aim of research is to estimate the number of LB-infected ticks and to evaluate their LB pathogen's genotype in children with clinical suspicion of Lyme borreliosis in the Ternopil region, Ukraine. In our first part of the study we conducted survey of 795 patients with clinical suspicion of Lyme borreliosis. In our second study we did laboratory analysis of the 795 ticks and 109 blood samples from children that were bitten by a tick. Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using Vector-Best production test systems were used to detect infected ticks and evaluate pathogen's genotype. Only 267 (33.5%) children from the total number were bitten by infected ticks. The following forms of the lesion were noted:-skin - erythema form in 83 (76.1%) children, nervous system in 20 (18.3%), arthritis in 13 (11.9%) and heart in 1 (0.9%). The remaining (59.2.%) of children at the time of the study had no external manifestations and other clinical signs of the disease. LB was caused by one or a combination of the few pathogens: B.burgdorferi s.l., A.phagocytophilum, and B . miyamotoi. The DNA of several infectious pathogens B.burgdorferi s.l., A. phagocytophilum, B. Miyamotoi simultaneously were diagnosed in (12.3 %). We identify antibodies to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in 57.7.% of the examined children. The types of pathogens influence on Lyme borreliosis clinical symptoms and therefore on the timing of the diagnosing."

		"abstract": "In addition to hypoxia, oxidative stress and inflammation due to carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning cause adverse health effects. These mechanisms are related to the occurrence of autoimmune connective tissue disease, but studies on the association between CO poisoning and autoimmune connective tissue disease are limited. We conducted a study to evaluate the occurrence of autoimmune connective tissue disease following CO poisoning. We identified participants with CO poisoning diagnosed between 1999 and 2012 from the Nationwide Poisoning Database and selected participants without CO poisoning from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database with matching age and index dates at a 1:3 ratio. Sex, underlying comorbidities, and monthly income were also included in the analyses. We followed up the participants until 2013 and made comparison of the risk of autoimmune connective tissue disease between participants with and without CO poisoning. The 23,877 participants with CO poisoning had a higher risk for autoimmune connective tissue disease than the 71,631 participants without CO poisoning (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.1-3.9) after adjustment for sex, diabetes, Lyme disease, herpes zoster, infectious mononucleosis, hepatitis, HIV infection, liver disease, renal disease, non-CO poisoning or drug abuse, malignancy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and monthly income. An increased risk was observed even after 4 years of follow-up (AHR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3.0-4.4). The risk of autoimmune connective tissue disease increased following CO poisoning. Close follow-up of the patients with CO poisoning for the development of connective tissue disease is recommended, and further investigation of the detailed mechanisms is warranted."

		"abstract": "Although the prevalence of Lyme and tick-borne diseases (TBDs) continues to rise, there is conflicting information regarding the best approach to management. The Lifespan Lyme Disease Clinic (LDC) is an academic out- patient clinic for Lyme and other TBDs. A chart review of 218 new patients between March and November 2018 was conducted. Symptoms most commonly reported included fatigue (66.5%), joint pain (58.2%), cognitive difficulty (32.1%), and headaches (27.9%). Most (87.1%) patients had received TBD-directed antibiotic treatment prior to their first appointment. Of the 136 patients who had experienced more than 6 months of symptoms attributed to Lyme, 55.1% had positive two-tiered serologies. Many patients characterized themselves as having \"chronic Lyme\" or had a diagnosis of \"post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome,\" a condition for which there is no clear consensus on pathophysiology or treatment. Outlined here are some lessons learned and practical approaches used by LDC physicians in caring for this patient population."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, an increasingly prevalent infection. While previous studies have provided important insight into B. burgdorferi biology, many aspects, including basic cellular processes, remain underexplored. To help speed up the discovery process, we adapted a CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) platform for use in B. burgdorferi For efficiency and flexibility of use, we generated various CRISPRi template constructs that produce different basal and induced levels of dcas9 and carry different antibiotic resistance markers. We characterized the effectiveness of our CRISPRi platform by targeting the motility and cell morphogenesis genes flaB, mreB, rodA, and ftsI, whose native expression levels span two orders of magnitude. For all four genes, we obtained gene repression efficiencies of at least 95%. We showed by darkfield microscopy and cryo-electron tomography that flagellin (FlaB) depletion reduced the length and number of periplasmic flagella, which impaired cellular motility and resulted in cell straightening. Depletion of FtsI caused cell filamentation, implicating this protein in cell division in B. burgdorferi Finally, localized cell bulging in MreB- and RodA-depleted cells matched the locations of new peptidoglycan insertion specific to spirochetes of the Borrelia genus. These results therefore implicate MreB and RodA in the particular mode of cell wall elongation of these bacteria. Collectively, our results demonstrate the efficiency and ease of use of our B. burgdorferi CRISPRi platform, which should facilitate future genetic studies of this important pathogen.IMPORTANCE Gene function studies are facilitated by the availability of rapid and easy-to-use genetic tools. Homologous recombination-based methods traditionally used to genetically investigate gene function remain cumbersome to perform in B. burgdorferi, as they often are relatively inefficient. In comparison, our CRISPRi platform offers an easy and fast method to implement as it only requires a single plasmid transformation step and IPTG addition to obtain potent (>95%) downregulation of gene expression. To facilitate studies of various genes in wild-type and genetically modified strains, we provide over 30 CRISPRi plasmids that produce distinct levels of dcas9 expression and carry different antibiotic resistance markers. Our CRISPRi platform represents a useful and efficient complement to traditional genetic and chemical methods to study gene function in B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) caused by Borrelia burgdorferi spp. is the most common human tick-borne disease in Europe. Although seroprevalence studies are conducted in several countries, rates of seroconversion and seroreversion are lacking, and they are essential to determine the risk of infection. Seropositivity was determined using a two-step approach-first, a serological screening assay, and in the event of a positive or equivocal result, a confirmatory immunoblot assay. Seroconversion and seroreversion rates were assessed from blood samples taken from participants included in two nation-wide population-based surveys. Moreover, the impact of antigen reactivity on seroreversion rates was assessed. The seroprevalence of antibodies reacting against B. burgdorferi spp. in the German population was 8.5% (95% CI 7.5-9.6) in 1997-99 and 9.3% (95% CI 8.3-10.4) in 2008-2011. Seroprevalence increased with age, up to 20% among 70-79 year-olds. The age-standardized seroprevalence remained the same. The yearly seroconversion rate was 0.45% (95% CI: 0.37-0.54), and the yearly seroreversion rate was 1.47% (95% CI: 1.24-2.17). Lower levels of antibodies were associated with seroreversion. Participants with a strong response against antigen p83 had the lowest odds on seroreversion. Given the yearly seroreversion rate of 1.47% and a seroprevalence up to 20% in the oldest age groups, at least 20% of the German population becomes infected with B. burgdorferi in their lifetime. The slight increase in seroprevalence between the two serosurveys was caused by an aging population."

Diagnosis of infection is currently mainly based on serological methods detecting antibodies against B. miyamotoi glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase (GlpQ). Here, we scrutinized the reliability of GlpQ as a diagnostic marker and compared the seroprevalence in different study populations and by applying various immunoblotting methods. Antibodies were detected in the sera of 7/53 hunters and in 1/11 sera of Lyme neuroborreliosis patients. Furthermore, 17/74 sera of persons with high concentrations of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (α-Bbsl) antibodies reacted strongly with B. miyamotoi GlpQ in immunoblots. The B. miyamotoi GlpQ seroprevalence was 7/50 in α-Bbsl negative persons. In healthy blood donors from commercial suppliers and from the Austrian Red Cross, seroprevalences were 5/14 and 10/35, respectively. Strikingly, two B. miyamotoi PCR-positive cases from Austria had negative GlpQ serology, indicating poor sensitivity. Finally, when we analyzed sera of dogs, we found α-B. miyamotoi GlpQ antibody seroprevalence in tick-free dogs (n = 10) and in tick-exposed dogs (n = 19) with 2/10 and 8/19, respectively. Thus, our results indicate that GlpQ-based B. miyamotoi serology holds neither specificity nor sensitivity."

The interval between the antecedent infection and arthritis is ranging from several days to 4-6 weeks. ReA is classified as member of the group of spondyloarthritides. The triggering microorganisms are not culturable by routine methods from the affected joints. In the pathogenesis of ReA, bacterial and immunological as well as genetic factors (HLA-B27) play an important role. Post-streptococcal arthritis, Lyme arthritis (Borreliosis) and viral arthritis are not classified as ReA within the spondyloarthritis group. In the treatment of ReA, antibiotics are not used. Acute ReA is treated by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and refractory (chronic) arthritis by steroids, sulfasalazine and TNF inhibitors. Notably, only a few original papers on ReA have been published within the last years."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease patients would greatly benefit from a timely, sensitive, and specific molecular diagnostic test that can detect the causal agent Borrelia burgdorferi at the onset of symptoms. Currently available diagnostic methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for Lyme disease involve indirect serological tests that rely on the detection of a host-antibody response, which often takes more than three weeks to develop. With this process, many positive cases are not detected within a timely manner, preventing a complete cure. In this study, we have developed a digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay that detects Lyme disease on clinical presentation with a sensitivity two-fold higher than that of the currently available diagnostic methods, using a cohort of patient samples collected from the Lyme disease endemic state of Connecticut, USA, in 2016-2018. Digital PCR technology was chosen as it is more advanced and sensitive than other PCR techniques in detecting rare targets. The analytical detection sensitivity of this diagnostic assay is approximately three genome copies of B. burgdorferi. The paucity of spirochetes in the bloodstream of Lyme disease patients has hindered the clinical adoption of PCR-based diagnostic tests. However, this drawback was overcome by using a comparatively larger sample volume, applying pre-analytical processing to the blood samples, and implementing a pre-amplification step to enrich for B. burgdorferi-specific gene targets before the patient samples are analyzed via digital PCR technology. Pre-analytical processing of blood samples from acute patients revealed that the best sample type for Lyme disease detection is platelet-rich plasma rather than whole blood. If detected in a timely manner, Lyme disease can be completely cured, thus limiting antibiotic overuse and associated morbidities."

		"abstract": "In the territory of the Primorsky region, the nosoareas of causative agents of tick-borne infections often coincide and lead to mixed infection of ticks, which causes the mixed pathology in humans . We investigated ixodid ticks taken from people during the epidemic season of 2019 for the spectrum of pathogens of transmissible infections to determine the degree of their mono- and mixed infection. 651 specimens of ixodid ticks investigated. RNA/DNA pathogens was determined by the method of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TBEV antigen by ELISA. The presence in ticks of pathogens of the following diseases was detected: Lyme borreliosis (35.3%), tick-borne replasing fever (11.3%), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (2.6%), human monocytic ehrlichiosis (2.4%), tick-borne encephalitis (1.8%), tick-borne ricketsiosis (1.0%). As agents of mono-infections, the virus of TBE, ehrlichia, anaplasma and rickettsia in ticks occurred less frequently than in combination with other pathogens. A high frequency of occurrence B. burgdorferi s.l. in mono-infection detected (58.7%). B. miyamotoi has met evenly at ticks with mono- and mixed infections. Total mixed infection of ticks was 23.1%. Borrelia have been identified in all mixed cases. Variants of double combinations (95.5 % of cases from all mixed infections) were as follows: B. burgdorferi s. l. + A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi s.l. + E. chaffeensis / E. muris, B. burgdorferi s.l. + TBEV, B. burgdorferi s.l. + R. heilongjiangensis, B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi. The most frequent combination was B. burgdorferi s.l. + B. miyamotoi (37.8% of all mixed infections). In triple infection of B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + TBEV and B. burgdorferi s.l. + A. phagocytophilum + B. miyamotoi, the frequency of occurrence for each combination was 2.2%. Given the above, a complex laboratory diagnosis of tick-borne infections in individuals who have been bitten by a tick is necessary, including the detection of all pathogens common in focal areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis can cause a variety of neurological manifestations. European children usually present facial nerve palsy, other cranial nerve palsies and aseptic meningitis. We hereby report a case of Lyme neuroborreliosis in a 9-year-old boy with abdominal pain as first symptom and subsequent onset of attention deficit and ataxia. Diagnosis was made by detection of specific antibody in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid with neuro-radiological images suggestive for this infectious disease. A 12-months follow-up was performed during which no relevant neurological sequelae were revealed. This case report shows that abdominal radiculitis, although extremely rare, could be the first manifestation of early Lyme neuroborreliosis in pediatric patients. Pediatricians must consider Lyme disease in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain of unknown origin in children, especially in countries where the infection is endemic."

Case study presentation as a basis for discussion, literature search of PubMed database particularly in the subject of combination of the JHR and Lyme borreliosis using the combination of words \"Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction\" and \"Lyme borreliosis\", \"Lyme arthritis\", \"antibiotic treatment\", \"generalized inflammation\", \"cytokine production\", \"children\", \"increasing awareness\"; discussion of the problem based on a clinical case and cited articles. The authors present a case of Lyme arthritis in a 13-year-old boy, as well as a discussion of clinical features of this complication of Lyme disease treatment as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. On the 7th day of doxycycline treatment the patient's condition deteriorated: a low-grade fever occurred, and severe arthralgias with intense hip, ankle and cervical spine pain and myalgias developed. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were elevated. The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction was diagnosed. This complication was characterized by severity, long duration and marked signs of inflammation. In the reviewed literature the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction in patients with Lyme borreliosis is described more often in adults, with mild course and short duration of the disease. Based on the presented clinical picture this severe complication may also be associated with long duration and marked signs of inflammation. The authors suggest that informing health professionals about occurrence of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction should help physicians to distinguish it from allergic reactions or other conditions and improve treatment outcomes."

		"abstract": "Babesiosis is a blood-borne disease found mainly in the United States caused by a parasitic piroplasm. While most infections are mild to moderate in immunocompetent hosts, life-threatening complications can occur in those with significant comorbidities like congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There is sparse literature discussing the complications of Babesia microti infection or the pathophysiology and management thereof. A literature review was conducted to consolidate the current knowledge about the disease, pathophysiology, and proposed management of all potential complications based on risk factors and other clinical information. A MeSH cross-references strategy was employed in PubMed using the search terms \"babesia\" and \"babesiosis\" and the established associated conditions, and the search expanded to increase capture. Only papers written in the English language and discussing human subjects in the North American patient population were included. The initial search yielded 315 papers and, after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, a final number of 18 was reviewed. The various complications and pathophysiology thereof are then discussed according to organ system. Babesia is a subversive parasite associated with a variety of conditions. We hope a better appreciation of all potential presentations and complications will help clinicians manage this increasingly common zoonosis and reduce adverse effects. More research is recommended into the pathophysiology and prevention of complications following this and other tick-borne illnesses."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi has been reported in 10-19% of Ixodes ticks from Alberta, Canada, where the tick vector Ixodes scapularis is at the northwestern edge of its range. However, the presence of Borrelia has not been verified independently, and the bacterial microbiome of these ticks has not been described. We performed 16S rRNA bacterial surveys on female I. scapularis from Alberta that were previously qPCR-tested in a Lyme disease surveillance program. Both 16S and qPCR methods were concordant for the presence of Borrelia. The 16S studies also provided a profile of associated bacteria that showed the microbiome of I. scapularis in Alberta was similar to other areas of North America. Ticks that were qPCR-positive for Borrelia had significantly greater bacterial diversity than Borrelia-negative ticks, on the basis of generalized linear model testing. This study adds value to ongoing tick surveillance and is a foundation for deeper understanding of tick microbial ecology and disease transmission in a region where I. scapularis range expansion, induced by climate and land use changes, is likely to have increasing public health implications."

To improve our understanding of the general U.S. population's experiences with tick exposure and use of personal prevention methods, we used data from ConsumerStyles, a web-based, nationally representative questionnaire on health-related topics. Questions addressed tick bites and LD diagnosis in the last year, use of personal prevention methods to prevent tick bites, and willingness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine. Of 10,551 participants surveyed over three years, 12.3 % reported a tick bite for themselves or a household member in the last year, including 15.4 % of participants in high LD incidence (LDI) states, 16.3 % in states neighboring high LDI states, and 9.4 % in low LDI states. Participants in high LDI states and neighboring states were most likely to use personal prevention methods, though 46.6 % of participants in high LDI states and 53.9 % in neighboring states reported not using any method. Participants in low LDI states, adults ≥ 75 years of age, those with higher incomes, and those living in urban housing tended to be less likely to practice personal prevention methods. Likeliness to receive a theoretical LD vaccine was high in high LDI (64.5 %), neighboring (52.5 %), and low LDI (49.7 %) states. Targeted educational efforts are needed to ensure those in high LDI and neighboring states, particularly older adults, are aware of their risk of LD and recommended personal prevention methods."

A second model based on Borrelia infections in sentinel dogs was used to quantify the prevalence of Lyme disease Borrelia infections in humans; the reference baseline for this model was human and canine infections in Germany. A comparison of the two models is shown and differences discussed. The relationships between incidence, prevalence and total infection burden for LB were derived from published data and these were used in both models to calculate annual incidence, prevalence and total LB infections. The modelling was conservative and based on medical insurance records coded for erythema migrans. Linear model growth rates were used in place of the commonly adopted exponential growth. The mean of the two models was used to create estimates for various countries and continents. Examples from the analyses for LB estimated for 2018 include: incidence - USA 473,000/year, Germany 471,000/year, France 434,000/year and UK 132,000/year; prevalence - USA 2.4 million, Germany 2.4 million, France 2.2 million and UK 667,000; total infections - USA 10.1 million, Germany 10.0 million, France 9.3 million and UK 2.8 million. Estimates for the world for 2018 are: incidence 12.3 million/year; prevalence 62.1 million; and total infection burden 262.0 million. These figures are far higher than officially published data and reflect not only the underestimation of diagnosed cases, which is acknowledged by health agencies, but also undiagnosed and misdiagnosed cases."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the vector for Borrelia afzelii, the predominant cause of Lyme borreliosis in Europe, whereas Ixodes scapularis is the vector for Borrelia burgdorferi in the USA. Transcription of several I. scapularis genes changes in the presence of B. burgdorferi and contributes to successful infection. To what extend B. afzelii influences gene expression in I. ricinus salivary glands is largely unknown. Therefore, we measured expression of uninfected vs. infected tick salivary gland genes during tick feeding using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) and RNAseq, quantifying 26.179 unique transcripts. While tick feeding was the main differentiator, B. afzelii infection significantly affected expression of hundreds of transcripts, including 465 transcripts after 24 h of tick feeding. Validation of the top-20 B. afzelii-upregulated transcripts at 24 h of tick feeding in ten biological genetic distinct replicates showed that expression varied extensively. Three transcripts could be validated, a basic tail protein, a lipocalin and an ixodegrin, and might be involved in B. afzelii transmission. However, vaccination with recombinant forms of these proteins only marginally altered B. afzelii infection in I. ricinus-challenged mice for one of the proteins. Collectively, our data show that identification of tick salivary genes upregulated in the presence of pathogens could serve to identify potential pathogen-blocking vaccine candidates."

		"abstract": "The two-component response regulator Rrp2 is a key activator controlling the production of numerous virulence factors of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen. Previously it was shown that the cognate histidine kinase HK2 is not required for Rrp2 activation in vitro, nor for mammalian infection upon needle inoculation, raising the question whether HK2 has any role in the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. In this study, we demonstrated that HK2 is not required for spirochetal survival in the tick vector. When fed on naive mice, the hk2 mutant had reduced infectivity through the route of tick bite, suggesting that the spirochetes lacking HK2 had a disadvantage in the enzootic cycle. Furthermore, overexpression of hk2 reduced the level of Rrp2 phosphorylation, suggesting that HK2 can function as a phosphatase to dephosphorylate Rrp2. Strains overexpressing hk2 impaired the expression of RpoN regulon whose activation is dependent on Rrp2 phosphorylation and activation, and had reduced infectivity in mice. Taken together, these results demonstrate that although HK2 does not play an essential role in Rrp2 activation, it is important for the optimal fitness of B. burgdorferi in the enzootic cycle."

Nearly all of the patients (98%) had no prior B. miyamotoi testing, indicating that clinicians rarely test for this emerging tick-borne pathogen.

		"abstract": "In Europe, ticks are responsible for the transmission of several pathogens of medical importance, including bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi (s.l.) complex, the agents of Lyme borreliosis. In France, the Auvergne Rhône-Alpes region is considered a hot spot for human tick-borne pathogen infections, with an estimated annual rate of 156 cases of Lyme borreliosis per 100,000 inhabitants. Although several studies have assessed the abundance of ticks in rural areas, little consideration has been given thus far to urban green spaces in France. This study aimed to estimate tick abundance in three parks, two urban (U1, U2) and one peri-urban (PU), in and around the city of Lyon (France). A forest in a rural area was used as a control (C). Tick sampling campaigns were performed in each site in April, May, June, July, and October 2019 using the dragging method. One hundred transects of 10 m2 each were randomly chosen in each park in places frequented by humans. The sampling sessions were carried out under semi-controlled abiotic conditions. Ticks were stored in 70% ethanol and identified to species and developmental stage under a light microscope using morphological keys. A total of seven ticks (nymphs and adults) were collected in the two urban parks (six in U1 and one in U2), while 499 ticks were sampled in the peri-urban park. Of the 506 ticks collected, 504 were identified as Ixodes ricinus, one as Dermacentor marginatus, and one as Ixodes frontalis. In the peri-urban park, ticks were mainly collected under the forest cover and at forest edges. Tick density under forest cover was 7.1 times higher in the control site than in the peri-urban park throughout the survey period. This study confirmed the presence of ticks in all of the parks surveyed, although their occurrence in the urban parks was very rare compared to the peri-urban park and the control site. These results should serve as a basis for the implementation of preventive measures."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne illness in North America, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Infection begins in the skin following a tick bite and can spread to the hearts, joints, nervous system, and other organs. Diverse host responses influence the level of B. burgdorferi infection in mice and humans. Using a systems biology approach, we examined potential molecular interactions between human extracellular and secreted proteins and B. burgdorferi. A yeast display library expressing 1031 human extracellular proteins was probed against 36 isolates of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. We found that human Peptidoglycan Recognition Protein 1 (PGLYRP1) interacted with the vast majority of B. burgdorferi isolates. In subsequent experiments, we demonstrated that recombinant PGLYRP1 interacts with purified B. burgdorferi peptidoglycan and exhibits borreliacidal activity, suggesting that vertebrate hosts may use PGLYRP1 to identify B. burgdorferi. We examined B. burgdorferi infection in mice lacking PGLYRP1 and observed an increased spirochete burden in the heart and joints, along with splenomegaly. Mice lacking PGLYRP1 also showed signs of immune dysregulation, including lower serum IgG levels and higher levels of IFNγ, CXCL9, and CXCL10.Taken together, our findings suggest that PGLYRP1 plays a role in the host's response to B. burgdorferi and further demonstrate the utility of expansive yeast display screening in capturing biologically relevant interactions between spirochetes and their hosts."

		"abstract": "Mass spectrometry enhanced by nanotechnology can achieve previously unattainable sensitivity for characterizing urinary pathogen-derived peptides. We utilized mass spectrometry enhanced by affinity hydrogel particles (analytical sensitivity = 2.5 pg/mL) to study tick pathogen-specific proteins shed in the urine of patients with (1) erythema migrans rash and acute symptoms, (2) post treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), and (3) clinical suspicion of tick-borne illnesses (TBI). Targeted pathogens were Borrelia, Babesia, Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Ehrlichia, Bartonella, Francisella, Powassan virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Colorado tick fever virus. Specificity was defined by 100% amino acid sequence identity with tick-borne pathogen proteins, evolutionary taxonomic verification for related pathogens, and no identity with human or other organisms. Using a cut off of two pathogen peptides, 9/10 acute Lyme Borreliosis patients resulted positive, while we identified zero false positive in 250 controls. Two or more pathogen peptides were identified in 40% of samples from PTLDS and TBI patients (categories 2 and 3 above, n = 59/148). Collectively, 279 distinct unique tick-borne pathogen derived peptides were identified. The number of pathogen specific peptides was directly correlated with presence or absence of symptoms reported by patients (ordinal regression pseudo-R2 = 0.392, p = 0.010). Enhanced mass spectrometry is a new tool for studying tick-borne pathogen infections."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. Once inoculated into the host dermis, it disseminates to various organs including distant skin sites, the heart, the joint and the nervous system. Most humans will develop an early skin manifestation called erythema migrans at the tick bite site. This can be followed by symptoms such as carditis, neuritis, meningitis, or arthritis if not treated. A specific mouse strain, C3H/HeN develops arthritis with B. burgdorferi infection whereas another strain, C57BL/6, develops minimal to no arthritis. Neither strain of mice show any skin signs of rash or inflammation. Factors that determine the presence of skin inflammation and the joint arthritis susceptibility in the host are only partially characterized. We show in this study that murine fibroblast-like synoviocytes display trained immunity, a program in some cells that results in increased inflammatory responses if the cell has previously come in contact with a stimulus, and that trained immunity in fibroblast-like synoviocytes tested ex vivo correlates with Lyme arthritis susceptibility. Conversely, skin fibroblasts do not exhibit trained immunity, which correlates with the absence of skin symptoms in these mice. Moreover, we demonstrate that the trained phenotype in FLS is affected by the cell environment, which depends on the host genetic background. Future studies expanding this initial report of the role of trained immunity on symptoms of B. burgdorferi infection may provide insight into the pathogenesis of disease in murine models."

We analyzed retrospective surveillance data for Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus/rickettsial diseases, and tularemia diagnosed in Indiana from 2009 to 2016. We used chi-square cross tabulation to test gender, age group, and county classification (rural, rural-mixed, urban) differences in tickborne disease. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test with a post hoc Conover test to identify differences in summated tickborne disease by county classification. Finally, we used retrospective space-time permutation models in SaTScan to test the hypothesis of complete spatiotemporal randomness of tickborne disease. We found more Lyme disease diagnoses among Indiana residents 44 years of age or younger compared with those over 44 years. Conversely, more ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and tularemia were reported in Indiana residents aged over 44 years of age. An analysis of summated tickborne disease by county showed significantly higher diagnosis reported in urban counties, compared with rural and rural-mixed counties. Finally, 2 significant clusters of summated tickborne disease were observed in south-central Indiana in 2014 and in western Indiana from 2010 to 2011. The detection of tickborne disease clusters, coupled with the finding that significant differences exist in the diagnosis of tickborne diseases between urban, rural, and rural-mixed counties in Indiana, suggests a need for continued surveillance of the counties observed within these clusters."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multi-faceted illness caused by infection due to Borrelia burgdorferi. Acute kidney damage secondary to Lyme disease is well described but less so as a chronic event. The role of Anaplasma spp. and secondary kidney dysfunction is not known. A retrospective cohort study was performed to determine if dogs within a defined Lyme disease and anaplasmosis region with B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibodies had an increased risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient exposure was defined as having a B. burgdorferi or Anaplasma spp. antibody positive result recorded at any point in the available patient history. CKD was defined as concurrent increased symmetric dimethylarginine and creatinine (Cr) for a minimum of 25 days with inappropriate urine specific gravity (USG). Patients were matched using propensity scoring to control for age, region, and breed. Contingency tables were used to compare dogs seropositive and not seropositive to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. and CKD outcome. For each comparison that was performed, statistical significance was defined by a P-value of <.025. The risk ratio of CKD for patients exposed to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. were found to be 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI, 1.27, 1.61], P < .0001) and 1.04, (95% CI [0.87, 1.24], P = .6485), respectively. Results suggest in this cohort no increased risk for developing CKD when exposed to Anaplasma spp. but a significant increase in risk for developing CKD with exposure to B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in temperate zones and a growing public health threat in the United States (US). The life cycles of the tick vectors and spirochete pathogen are highly sensitive to climate, but determining the impact of climate change on Lyme disease burden has been challenging due to the complex ecology of the disease and the presence of multiple, interacting drivers of transmission. Here we incorporated 18 years of annual, county-level Lyme disease case data in a panel data statistical model to investigate prior effects of climate variation on disease incidence while controlling for other putative drivers. We then used these climate-disease relationships to project Lyme disease cases using CMIP5 global climate models and two potential climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). We find that interannual variation in Lyme disease incidence is associated with climate variation in all US regions encompassing the range of the primary vector species. In all regions, the climate predictors explained less of the variation in Lyme disease incidence than unobserved county-level heterogeneity, but the strongest climate-disease association detected was between warming annual temperatures and increasing incidence in the Northeast. Lyme disease projections indicate that cases in the Northeast will increase significantly by 2050 (23,619 ± 21,607 additional cases), but only under RCP8.5, and with large uncertainty around this projected increase. Significant case changes are not projected for any other region under either climate scenario. The results demonstrate a regionally variable and nuanced relationship between climate change and Lyme disease, indicating possible nonlinear responses of vector ticks and transmission dynamics to projected climate change. Moreover, our results highlight the need for improved preparedness and public health interventions in endemic regions to minimize the impact of further climate change-induced increases in Lyme disease burden."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a bacterial pathogen transmitted by Ixodes ticks and is responsible for Lyme disease in both humans and dogs. The aim of this work was to evaluate B. burgdorferi diffusion among stray dogs in Palermo (Sicily, Italy) by serological methods in order to study the risk factors associated with the infection. Serum and blood samples of 316 dogs were collected from a shelter in Palermo, and were analyzed for the presence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and of the ospA gene by real-time PCR, respectively. Seventeen sera (5.4%) were positive for the antibodies via IFA and one blood (0.3%) for ospA via real time PCR. On the basis of serological results, the evaluation of the potential risk factors (sex, age, breed and coat color) was carried out. The multivariate analysis indicated that male sex is a factor significantly associated with B. burgdorferi seropositivity. This study confirms that male dogs have a higher risk of developing the disease than females, and represents the first investigation on the spread of B. burgdorferi among stray dogs in Sicily."

		"abstract": "Fluorescence detection of nucleic acid isothermal amplification utilizing energy-transfer-tagged oligonucleotide probes provides a highly sensitive and specific method for pathogen detection. However, currently available probes suffer from relatively weak fluorescence signals and are not suitable for simple, affordable smartphone-based detection at the point of care. Here, we present a cleavable hairpin beacon (CHB)-enhanced fluorescence detection for isothermal amplification assay. The CHB probe is a single fluorophore-tagged hairpin oligonucleotide with five continuous ribonucleotides which can be cleaved by the ribonuclease to specifically initiate DNA amplification and generate strong fluorescence signals. By coupling with loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), the CHB probe could detect Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) recA gene with a sensitivity of 100 copies within 25 min and generated stronger specific fluorescence signals which were easily read and analysed by our programmed smartphone. Also, this CHB-enhanced LAMP (CHB-LAMP) assay was successfully demonstrated to detect B. burgdorferi DNA extracted from tick species, showing comparable results to real-time PCR assay. In addition, our CHB probe was compatible with other isothermal amplifications, such as isothermal multiple-self-matching-initiated amplification (IMSA). Therefore, CHB-enhanced fluorescence detection is anticipated to facilitate the development of simple, sensitive smartphone-based point-of-care pathogen diagnostics in resource-limited settings."

		"abstract": "Serological diagnosis of Lyme disease suffers from considerable limitations. Yet, the technique cannot currently be replaced by direct detection methods, such as bacterial culture or molecular analysis, due to their inadequate sensitivity. The low bacterial burden in vasculature and lack of consensus around blood-based isolation of the causative pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, are central to this challenge. We therefore addressed methodological optimization of Borrelia recovery from blood, first by analyzing existing protocols, and then by using experimentally infected human blood to identify the processing conditions and fractions that increase Borrelia yield. In this proof-of-concept study, we now report two opportunities to improve recovery and detection of Borrelia from clinical samples. To enhance pathogen viability and cultivability during whole blood collection, citrate anticoagulant is superior to more commonly used EDTA. Despite the widespread reliance on serum and plasma as analytes, we found that the platelet fraction of blood concentrates Borrelia, providing an enriched resource for direct pathogen detection by microscopy, laboratory culture, Western blot, and PCR. The potential for platelets to serve as a reservoir for Borrelia and its diagnostic targets may transform direct clinical detection of this pathogen."

		"abstract": "Arthropods pests are most frequently associated with both plants and vertebrate animals. Ticks, in particular the blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis Say and Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), are associated with wildlife hosts and are the primary vectors of Lyme disease, the most frequently reported vector-borne disease in the United States. Immature blacklegged ticks in the eastern United States frequently use small mammals from the genus Peromyscus as hosts. These mice are competent reservoirs for Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, as well as other tick-borne pathogens. To conduct surveillance on immature ticks and pathogen circulation in hosts, capture and handling of these small mammals is required. While protocols for rearing and pest surveillance on plants are common, there are very few protocols aimed at entomologists to conduct research on vertebrate-arthropod relationships. The goal of this manuscript is to provide a practical template for trapping Peromyscus spp. for vector and vector-borne pathogen surveillance and ecology for professionals that may not have a background in wildlife research. Important considerations are highlighted when targeting P. leucopus Rafinesque and P. maniculatus Wagner. Specifically, for tick and tick-borne disease-related projects, materials that may be required are suggested and references and other resources for researchers beginning a trapping study are provided."

Here, we designed a tick-sampling study to estimate the sampling efficiency of this standard method. We established 10 m dragging transects in a hemiboreal mixed forest patch in SW Finland for a 5-day monitoring period. Five of the transects were cloth-dragged 3× a day, whereas another five transects were dragged 6× a day in a manner that after each morning, midday and afternoon dragging, a second dragging was conducted on the same transect immediately. Captured Ixodes ricinus ticks were subsequently analysed for tick-borne pathogens. The initial population size of nymphal ticks on a transect was approximated by the accumulated nymph catch from the dragging sessions. The sampling efficiency of the cloth dragging was low, as a single dragging in a previously untouched vegetation strip always caught less than 12% (mean 6%) of the estimated population of active nymphs that were assumed to be questing during the study. Clear results were not found for daily activity rhythm, as ticks were caught in all daily dragging sessions. Approximately every third nymph and every second adult carried a pathogen, but nothing indicated that the occurrence of a pathogen affected the likelihood of the tick being caught by cloth dragging. Our results suggest that only a minority of active ticks can be caught by a single cloth dragging. The abundance estimates in many tick investigations might thus be downward biased."

		"abstract": "To provide better care for patients suspected of having a tick-transmitted infection, the Clinic for Tick-borne Diseases at Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark was established. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to evaluate diagnostic outcome and to characterize demographics and clinical presentations of patients referred between the 1st of September 2017 to 31st of August 2019. A diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, symptoms, serology and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. The patients were classified as definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis manifestations was initiated in accordance with the national guidelines. Patients not fulfilling the criteria of Lyme borreliosis were further investigated and discussed with an interdisciplinary team consisting of specialists from relevant specialties, according to individual clinical presentation and symptoms. Clinical information and demographics were registered and managed in a database. A total of 215 patients were included in the study period. Median age was 51 years (range 17-83 years), and 56 % were female. Definite Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed in 45 patients, of which 20 patients had erythema migrans, 14 patients had definite Lyme neuroborreliosis, six had acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, four had multiple erythema migrans and one had Lyme carditis. Furthermore, 12 patients were classified as possible Lyme borreliosis and 12 patients as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. A total of 146 patients (68 %) did not fulfil the diagnostic criteria of Lyme borreliosis. Half of these patients (73 patients, 34 %) were diagnosed with an alternative diagnosis including inflammatory diseases, cancer diseases and two patients with a tick-associated disease other than Lyme borreliosis. A total of 73 patients (34 %) were discharged without sign of somatic disease. Lyme borreliosis patients had a shorter duration of symptoms prior to the first hospital encounter compared to patients discharged without a specific diagnosis (p<0.001). When comparing symptoms at presentation, patients discharged without a specific diagnosis suffered more often from general fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. In conclusion, 66 % of all referred patients were given a specific diagnosis after ended outpatient course. A total of 32 % was diagnosed with either definite Lyme borreliosis, possible Lyme borreliosis or post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome; 34 % was diagnosed with a non-tick-associated diagnosis. Our findings underscore the complexity in diagnosing Lyme borreliosis and the importance of ruling out other diseases through careful examination."

		"abstract": "Ticks are blood-feeding ectoparasites that transmit a variety of pathogens to host animals and humans, causing severe infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. In a certain combination of animal and tick species, tick infestation elicits acquired immunity against ticks in the host, which can reduce the ability of ticks to feed on blood and to transmit pathogens in the following tick infestations. Therefore, our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of acquired tick resistance (ATR) can advance the development of anti-tick vaccines to prevent tick infestation and tick-borne diseases. Basophils are a minor population of white blood cells circulating in the bloodstream and are rarely observed in peripheral tissues under steady-state conditions. Basophils have been reported to accumulate at tick-feeding sites during re-infestation in cattle, rabbits, guinea pigs and mice. Selective ablation of basophils resulted in a loss of ATR in guinea pigs and mice, illuminating the essential role of basophils in the manifestation of ATR. In this review, we discuss the recent advance in the elucidation of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying basophil recruitment to the tick-feeding site and basophil-mediated ATR."

Transmission of vector-borne pathogens to mammals primarily occurs by hematophagous arthropods. It is speculated that blood may provide a unique environment that aids in the replication and pathogenesis of these microbes. Lipids and their derivatives are one component enriched in blood and are essential for microbial survival. For instance, the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, among others, have been shown to scavenge and manipulate host lipids for structural support, metabolism, replication, immune evasion, and disease severity. In this Review, we will explore the importance of lipid hijacking for the growth and persistence of these microbes in both mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors."

		"abstract": "Over 600,000 vector-borne disease cases were reported in the United States (U.S.) in the past 13 years, of which more than three-quarters were tick-borne diseases. Although Lyme disease accounts for the majority of tick-borne disease cases in the U.S., tularemia cases have been increasing over the past decade, with >220 cases reported yearly. However, when comparing Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) and Francisella tularensis (causative agent of tularemia), the low infectious dose (<10 bacteria), high morbidity and mortality rates, and potential transmission of tularemia by multiple tick vectors have raised national concerns about future tularemia outbreaks. Despite these concerns, little is known about how F. tularensis is acquired by, persists in, or is transmitted by ticks. Moreover, the role of one or more tick vectors in transmitting F. tularensis to humans remains a major question. Finally, virtually no studies have examined how F. tularensis adapts to life in the tick (vs. the mammalian host), how tick endosymbionts affect F. tularensis infections, or whether other factors (e.g., tick immunity) impact the ability of F. tularensis to infect ticks. This review will assess our current understanding of each of these issues and will offer a framework for future studies, which could help us better understand tularemia and other tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-transmitted pathogen that may cause severe encephalitis; experimentally, it can be transmitted within just 15 minutes following a tick bite. The deer tick virus subtype of POWV (DTV) is transmitted by the deer tick and is the likely cause of the increase in the number of POWV cases reported in the United States. However, DTV has only been definitively documented in 6 patients by molecular analysis of the virus. Two patients from Connecticut with encephalitis, who had a recent deer tick bite, were evaluated by the relevant serologic tests to determine if they had been infected with POWV. Evaluation also included molecular testing of an adult deer tick that had been removed from one of the patients. We documented neuroinvasive POWV infection in 2 children from Connecticut. Based on the results of testing the tick removed from case 2, this patient was infected by DTV, representing the 7th reported case and the first documented case of DTV infection in a child. Of note, the duration of the tick bites in both cases was very short. We provide the first clinical and epidemiologic evidence that POWV/DTV can be rapidly transmitted to a human host, that is, within hours of tick attachment, which is distinctive when compared to other deer tick-transmitted infections such as Lyme disease."

Between April and October 2017, a total of 504 questing Ixodid ticks (77% Ixodes ricinus and 23% Dermacentor reticulatus) were collected from six regions and city of Minsk, in Belarus. All ticks were analyzed by RT-PCR amplification for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Anaplasma phagocytophillum, Ehrlihia muris, and Borrelia miyamotoi. B. burgdorferi s.l. and Rickettsia spp. were the most commonly detected tick-borne pathogens, with prevalence rates of 31.08% and 33.7%, respectively. A. phagocytophillum was found in 104 (20.63%), and 107 (21.2%) ticks were positive for E. muris. TBEV was detected in 83 (16.47%). Circulation of Borrelia miyamotoi spirochete in I. ricinus ticks in Brest, Gomel, and Minsk region was detected for the first time. Our data provide a basis for further studies to determine the distribution and abundance of different tick species in Belarus and therefore a capacity to predict where cases of important tick-borne diseases may occur."

We evaluated the impact of having been started on antibiotic treatment before study enrollment on 12 particular symptoms for 38 subjects with erythema migrans versus 52 untreated subjects. There were no significant differences in the frequency of having at least one symptom or in the symptom severity score on study entry. However, the frequency of having at least one symptom was significantly greater for those who had received <7 days of antibiotic treatment than for those who had been treated for ≥7 days (23/24 [95.8%] versus 8/14 [57.1%], P = 0.006). In addition, the percentage of subjects who were males was significantly lower among the group on treatment than among the untreated study subjects (13/38 [34.2%] versus 34/52 [65.4%], P = 0.005). In conclusion, based on these findings, combining untreated and treated groups of patients with erythema migrans for research study analyses may have limitations and, depending on the study objectives, might not be preferred. Additional studies are warranted to better understand the day-to-day impact of antibiotic treatment on the presence, type, and severity of symptoms in patients with early Lyme disease."

The prevalence of Borrelia infection was 33.6%, and the most common genospecies were B. afzelii (62.5%), B. valaisiana (31.9%), B. yangtzensis (2.4%), B. garinii (1.6%), and B. tanukii (1.6%). Borrelia afzelii was found in all regions except Jeju Island; this predominant genospecies was found in the northern and central sampling regions. Borrelia valaisiana, B. yangtzensis, and B. tanukii were found only in the southern regions with B. valaisiana being the most common, whereas B. yangtzensis and B. tanukii were only found on Jeju Island. Our study is the first to describe the nationwide prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in ticks from wild rodents in the ROK.

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common arthropod-borne disease in Europe and North America and is caused by members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) species complex. These bacteria are transmitted by ixodid tick vectors and therefore human LB risk is influenced by the prevalence and distribution of Bbsl genospecies within tick vectors throughout the wild. These distributions can easily change over spatiotemporal scales and, to understand LB risk fully, up to date information on prevalence and distribution of Bbsl is required. The last survey of Bbsl in southern Germany, including parts of the Munich metropolitan area, was completed in 2006 and new data is needed. Ixodid ticks were collected in seven plots located in and around Munich, Germany, from March to July 2019 and were screened for Bbsl. Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. positive ticks (52 adults, 158 nymphs) were found in all plots and adults (0-61.5 % Bbsl positive/plot) and nymphs (17.4-59.5 % Bbsl positive/plot) did not differ significantly in their overall Bbsl prevalence. The number of Bbsl positive nymphs did vary significantly between plots but the number of positive adults did not. In total, six Bbsl genospecies were located with B. afzelii and B. garinii dominating. Additionally, the relapsing-fever species B. miyamotoi was found in two sampling plots. Our results highlight the variability in Bbsl prevalence and genospecies distribution over short geographic distances and aid in understanding LB risk in and around the Munich metropolitan area."

		"abstract": "Current serological immunoassays have inherent limitations for certain infectious diseases such as Lyme disease, a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi in North America. Here we report a novel method of manufacturing high-density multiplexed protein microarrays with the capacity to detect low levels of antibodies accurately from small blood volumes in a fully automated system. A panel of multiple serological markers for Lyme disease are measured using a protein microarray system, Lyme Immunochip, in a single step but interpreted adhering to the standard two-tiered testing algorithm (enzyme immunoassay followed by Western blot). Furthermore, an enhanced IgM assay was supplemented to improve the test's detection sensitivity for early Lyme disease. With a training cohort (n = 40) and a blinded validation cohort (n = 90) acquired from CDC, the Lyme Immunochip identified a higher proportion of Lyme disease patients than the two-tiered testing (82.4% vs 70.6% in the training set, 66.7% vs 60.0% in the validation set, respectively). Additionally, the Immunochip improved sensitivity to 100% while having a lower specificity of 95.2% using a set of investigational antigens which are being further evaluated with a large cohort of blinded samples from the CDC and Columbia University. This universal microarray platform provides an unprecedented opportunity to resolve a broad range of issues with diagnostic tests, including multiplexing, workflow simplicity, and reduced turnaround time and cost."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, spread by the Ixodes tick, is typically associated with a single \"bull's eye rash\" that emergency physicians are comfortable recognizing and treating during the summer months when this disease is most prevalent. However, Lyme disease can also present in disseminated forms that are more difficult to diagnose. We describe a phenomenon of disseminated Lyme with multiple rash complexes that is unrecognized by clinicians. A 65-year-old woman with no prior medical history presented with flu-like symptoms including headache, nausea, and arthralgias, as well as a nonpruritic rash on her lower limbs. On physical examination, multiple red, blanching patches with a diameter of up to 20 cm were seen. Although she was initially thought to have a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug reaction as her skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi was negative, an immunoglobulin M test for B. burgdorferi was found to be positive during her emergency department visit. Despite the diverging results, a diagnosis of early-disseminated Lyme was made. She was discharged home on a 3-week course of oral doxycycline, and a complete resolution of her symptoms was noted on a follow-up visit. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: With the incidence of Lyme disease and its atypical presentations on the rise, the emergency physician should be aware of the other rashes that are associated with this disease, particularly those associated with disseminated cutaneous Lyme. Early diagnosis of the disseminated forms of Lyme is critical to prevent the occurrence of life-threatening cardiovascular and neurological complications known to occur with this disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi Current diagnosis of early Lyme disease relies heavily on clinical criteria, including the presence of an erythema migrans rash. The sensitivity of current gold-standard diagnostic tests relies upon antibody formation, which is typically delayed and thus of limited utility in early infection. We conducted a study of blood and skin biopsy specimens from 57 patients with a clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans. Samples collected at the time of diagnosis were analyzed using an ultrasensitive, PCR-based assay employing an isothermal amplification step and multiple primers. In 75.4% of patients, we directly detected one or more B. burgdorferi genotypes in the skin. Two-tier testing showed that 20 (46.5%) of those found to be PCR positive remained serologically negative at both acute and convalescent time points. Multiple genotypes were found in three (8%) of those where a specific genotype could be identified. The 13 participants who lacked PCR and serologic evidence for exposure to B. burgdorferi could be differentiated as a group from PCR-positive participants by their levels of several immune markers as well as by clinical descriptors such as the number of acute symptoms and the pattern of their erythema migrans rash. These results suggest that within a Mid-Atlantic cohort, patient subgroups can be identified using PCR-based direct detection approaches. This may be particularly useful in future research such as vaccine trials and public health surveillance of tick-borne disease patterns."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis has not been studied in Jordan or in much of the Middle East. However, limited research indicates that the tick vector, Ixodes ricinus, exists in the region. This study examined the seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in Jordan and potential demographic and zoonotic risk factors for seropositivity. Serum samples of 824 apparently healthy participants from 11 governorates in Jordan were tested for B. burgdorferi s.l. using Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A validated questionnaire was used to collect demographic and animal exposure data. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with seropositivity. The results showed that 11.7 % (95 % CI, 9.3-14.0 %) of the participants were seropositive for B. burgdorferi s.l.. There was a bimodal age distribution of seroprevalence with higher seroprevalence among individuals <20 and>60 years old. After controlling for governorate of residence, females had 2.77 (95 % CI 1.53-5.00) times greater odds of seropositivity compared to males. Individuals living in the southeastern part of Jordan (Ma'an) had 2.32 (95 % CI, 1.02-5.31) greater odds of seropositivity compared to those living in Amman, the Capital of Jordan, while those living in the northeast had significantly lower odds of seropositivity. This study presents the first evidence of B. burgdorferi s.l. seropositivity in Jordan and suggests several risk factors which were reported in studies conducted elsewhere. This study suggests that Lyme borreliosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients presenting with skin lesions in Jordan."

		"abstract": "People with occupations that require them to spend time working outdoors in suitable tick habitats are predicted to be at an increased risk for tick-borne diseases (TBDs). However, few studies have assessed the risks of outdoor employees in the United States. We conducted a cross-sectional survey to collect data on exposure to ticks and TBD infections among U.S. Forest Service employees in a high TBD incidence region of northern Wisconsin, and to examine employee knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) regarding TBDs to help guide future education and prevention programs. Chi-square contingency tables, calculations of odds ratios, and logistic regression models were used to identify associations among self-reported employee factors, the proportion of correctly answered knowledge questions, their ranked concern for TBDs, adherence to practicing preventive behaviors, and willingness to pay for protective measures. Ninety-five employees completed the survey. Nearly all respondents (97%) reported recent tick exposure, with 27% reporting encountering 10 or more ticks per week during peak tick season. Employee knowledge of TBD was high (median score: 80% correct). Fifty-nine percent of respondents had high concern for TBDs, and there was high adherence to conducting body checks for ticks (83% reported always doing them), but only moderate use of tick repellents (24% reported always and 60% reported occasionally using). High concern for TBD (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 6.32 [95% confidence intervals, 1.97-20.28]), a history of TBD diagnosis (aOR = 5.88 [1.41-24.55]), and older age (≥ 46 years) (aOR = 3.29 [1.00-10.84]) were positively associated with high practice adherence. Respondents suggested they would be willing to pay for personal protective methods and get a hypothetical vaccine for Lyme disease, but not community-wide efforts to control ticks. Our study provides evidence that U.S. Forest Service employees in Wisconsin represent a high risk group for TBD, and despite relatively high TBD knowledge and engagement in tick protection activities, efforts are needed to reduce their risks for tick bites. More generally, our findings suggest that studies to better understand the factors related to the adoption and effectiveness of public health interventions are needed."

Despite the serological evidence of LD in Malaysia, there has been no report from Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo. Thus, this study aimed to detect and characterize Borrelia in rodents and Ixodes ticks from primary forests and an oil palm (OP) plantation in Sarawak. Borrelia yangtzensis (a member of the Bbsl complex) was detected in 43.8% (14/32) of Ixodes granulatus; most of the positive ticks were from the OP plantation (13/14). Out of 56 rodents, B. yangtzensis was detected in four Rattus spp. from the OP plantation and B. miyamotoi was detected in one rodent, Sundamys muelleri, from the primary forest. Further, the positive samples of B. yangtzensis were randomly selected for multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). The MLSA results of successfully amplified tick samples revealed a clustering with the sequences isolated from Japan and China. This study is the first evidence of B. miyamotoi, a known human pathogen in Malaysia, and B. yangtzensis, which is circulating in ticks and rodents in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo, and presenting a new geographical record of the Borrelia spp."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is a tick-borne spirochete of the relapsing fever borrelia group and an emerging pathogen of public health significance. The genomes of relapsing fever borreliae and Lyme disease borreliae consist of multiple linear and circular plasmids in addition to the chromosome. Previous work with B. burgdorferi sensu lato found diminished infectivity upon continuous in vitro culture passage that was attributable to plasmid loss. The effect of long-term culture passage on B. miyamotoi is not known. We generated a series of plasmid-specific primer sets and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect the 14 known plasmids of B. miyamotoi North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. We assessed the plasmid content of B. miyamotoi LB-2001 over 64 culture passages spanning 15 months and determined that strain LB-2001 retained all plasmids upon prolonged in vitro cultivation and remained infectious in mice. We also found that strain LB-2001 lacks plasmid lp20-1 which is present in strain CT13-2396. These results suggest that B. miyamotoi remains genetically stable when cultured and passaged in vitro."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus is the vector of various pathogens, including Chlamydiales bacteria, which potentially cause respiratory infections. In this study, we modeled the spatial distribution of I. ricinus and associated Chlamydiales over Switzerland from 2009 to 2019. We used a total of 2,293 ticks and 186 Chlamydiales occurrences provided by a Swiss Army field campaign, a collaborative smartphone application, and a prospective campaign. For each tick location, we retrieved from Swiss federal data sets the environmental factors reflecting the topography, climate, and land cover. We then used the Maxent modeling technique to estimate the suitability of particular areas for I. ricinus and to subsequently build the nested niche of Chlamydiales bacteria. Results indicate that I. ricinus habitat suitability is determined by higher temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values, lower temperature during the driest months, and a higher percentage of artificial and forest areas. The performance of the model was improved when extracting the environmental variables for a 100-m radius buffer around the sampling points and when considering the climatic conditions of the 2 years previous to the sampling date. Chlamydiales bacteria were favored by a lower percentage of artificial surfaces, drier conditions, high precipitation during the coldest months, and short distances to wetlands. From 2009 to 2018, we observed an extension of areas suitable to ticks and Chlamydiales, associated with a shift toward higher altitude. The importance of considering spatiotemporal variations in the environmental conditions for obtaining better prediction was also demonstrated.IMPORTANCEIxodes ricinus is the vector of pathogens including the agent of Lyme disease, the tick-borne encephalitis virus, and the less well-known Chlamydiales bacteria, which are responsible for certain respiratory infections. In this study, we identified the environmental factors influencing the presence of I. ricinus and Chlamydiales in Switzerland and generated maps of their distribution from 2009 to 2018. We found an important expansion of suitable areas for both the tick and the bacteria during the last decade. Results also provided the environmental factors that determine the presence of Chlamydiales within ticks. Distribution maps as generated here are expected to bring valuable information for decision makers in controlling tick-borne diseases in Switzerland and establishing prevention campaigns. The methodological framework presented could be used to predict the distribution and spread of other host-pathogen pairs to identify environmental factors driving their distribution and to develop control or prevention strategies accordingly."

		"abstract": "Borreliosis is the most frequently transmitted tick-borne disease in Europe. It is difficult to estimate the incidence of tick bites and associated diseases in the German population due to the lack of an obligation to register across all 16 federal states of Germany. The aim of this study is to show that Google data can be used to generate general trends of infectious diseases on the basis of borreliosis and tick bites. In addition, the possibility of using Google AdWord data to estimate incidences of infectious diseases, where there is inconsistency in the obligation to notify authorities, is investigated with the perspective to facilitate public health studies. Google AdWords Keyword Planner was used to identify search terms related to ticks and borreliosis in Germany from January 2015 to December 2018. The search volume data from the identified search terms was assessed using Excel version 15.23. In addition, SPSS version 24.0 was used to calculate the correlation between search volumes, registered cases, and temperature. A total of 1999 tick-related and 542 borreliosis-related search terms were identified, with a total of 209,679,640 Google searches in all 16 German federal states in the period under review. The analysis showed a high correlation between temperature and borreliosis (r=0.88), and temperature and tick bite (r=0.83), and a very high correlation between borreliosis and tick bite (r=0.94). Furthermore, a high to very high correlation between Google searches and registered cases in each federal state was observed (Brandenburg r=0.80, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania r= 0.77, Saxony r= 0.74, and Saxony-Anhalt r=0.90; all P<.001). Our study provides insight into annual trends concerning interest in ticks and borreliosis that are relevant to the German population exemplary in the data of a large internet search engine. Public health studies collecting incidence data may benefit from the results indicating a significant correlation between internet search data and incidences of infectious diseases."

		"abstract": "The distribution and prevalence of zoonotic pathogens infecting ixodid ticks in Western Europe have been extensively examined. However, data on ticks and tick-borne pathogens in Eastern Europe, particularly Ukraine are scarce. The objective of the current study was, therefore, to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasmataceae, Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in engorged and questing ixodid ticks collected from five administrative regions (oblasts) of Ukraine, namely Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Ternopil, and Vinnytsia. The ticks were collected from both wild and domestic animals and from vegetation. Of 524 ixodid ticks collected, 3, 99, and 422 ticks were identified as Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes ricinus, and Dermacentor reticulatus, respectively. DNA samples individually extracted from 168 questing and 354 engorged adult ticks were subjected to pathogen-specific PCR analyses. The mean prevalence in I. ricinus and D. reticulatus were, respectively: 10 % (10/97) and 3 % (12/422) for A. phagocytophilum; 69 % (67/97) and 52 % (220/422) for members of the Anaplasmataceae family; 25 % (24/97) and 28 % (117/422) for Rickettsia spp.; 3 % (3/97) and 1 % (6/422) for Babesia spp.; and 9 % (9/97) and 5 % (20/422) for Bartonella spp. Overall, between the five cities, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of any of the pathogens for the respective ticks (p > 0.05). The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s. l. in the questing and engorged I. ricinus varied from 0 to 27 % and 14-44%, respectively, with no statistical significance identified between the five cities (p > 0.05). In addition to reporting the updated data for Kyiv and Ternopil, this study is the first to provide the prevalences of the tick-borne pathogens for Chernivtsi, Khmelnytskyi, and Vinnytsia. This investigation is also the first to detect Neoehrlichia mikurensis in ixodid ticks from Ukraine. These new data will be useful for medical and veterinary practitioners as well as public health officials when diagnosing infections and when implementing measures to combat tick-borne diseases in Ukraine."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen causes persistent infection by evading the host immune response. Differential expression of the surface-exposed lipoprotein VlsE that undergoes antigenic variation is a key immune evasion strategy employed by B. burgdorferi. Most studies focused on the mechanism of VlsE antigen variation, but little is known about VlsE regulation and factor(s) that regulates differential vlsE expression. In this study, we investigated BB0025, a putative YebC family transcriptional regulator (and hence designated BB0025 as YebC of B. burgdorferi herein). We constructed yebC mutant and complemented strain in an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi. The yebC mutant could infect immunocompromised SCID mice but not immunocompetent mice, suggesting that YebC plays an important role in evading host adaptive immunity. RNA-seq analyses identified vlsE as one of the genes whose expression was most affected by YebC. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses confirmed that vlsE expression was dependent on YebC. In vitro, YebC and VlsE were co-regulated in response to growth temperature. In mice, both yebC and vlsE were inversely expressed with ospC in response to the host adaptive immune response. Furthermore, EMSA proved that YebC directly binds to the vlsE promoter, suggesting a direct transcriptional control. These data demonstrate that YebC is a new regulator that modulates expression of vlsE and other genes important for spirochetal infection and immune evasion in the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "To describe the role of the internet and cognitive biases in the controversy surrounding chronic Lyme disease. The attribution of chronic but aspecific symptoms to Lyme borreliosis is a source of worldwide controversy. Some patients attribute their aspecific symptoms to Lyme borreliosis even though, in fact, they have a functional somatic syndrome. These patients' diagnostic and therapeutic wandering contributes to the above attribution and to their suffering. The Internet has deregulated the information market. Cognitive confirmation bias contributes to confinement in belief. Negativity bias explains the tendency of the human brain to select the most alarming information available. The narrative force of alarmist videos or personal testimonies acts like a nocebo effect. The social exclusion generated by adherence to this belief is a factor of reinforcement and aggravation. Deconstructing chronic Lyme disease with empathy and conviction is in patients' best interests."

Diagnosis of Lyme disease in humans is often difficult and a detailed knowledge of the circulation of B. burgdorferi s.l. in tick hosts is therefore fundamental to support clinical procedures. Here we developed a molecular approach for the detection of B. burgdorferi s.l. in North Italian Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus). The method is based on the amplification of a fragment of the groEL gene, which encodes a heat-shock protein highly conserved among B. burgdorferi s.l. species. The tool was applied in both qualitative and Real-time PCR approaches testing ticks collected in a North Italian area. The obtained results suggest that this new molecular tool could represent a sensitive and specific method for epidemiological studies aimed at defining the distribution of B. burgdorferi s.l. in I. ricinus and, consequently, the exposure risk for humans."

		"abstract": "The MHC class II antigen processing and presentation pathway has evolved to derive short amino acid peptides from proteins that enter the endocytic pathway, load them onto MHC class II molecules and display them on the surface of antigen presenting cells for recognition by CD4+ T cells. Under normal circumstances, peptides bound to MHC class II molecules are derived from host (self) proteins and not recognized by T cells due to tolerance mechanisms. Pathogens induce significant changes in the biology of antigen presenting cells, including upregulation of MHC processing and presentation. We therefore hypothesized that exposure to pathogens may alter the repertoire of self-peptides bound to MHC class II molecules. To test this hypothesis, we isolated monocyte-derived dendritic cells from healthy subjects, exposed them to the TLR-2 agonist lipoteichoic acid or live Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and isolated and characterized HLA-DR associated peptides using mass spectrometry. Our results show that lipoteichoic acid-stimulated, B. burgdorferi-stimulated and unstimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells largely derive their self-peptides from similar overlapping sets of host proteins. However, lipoteichoic acid and B. burgdorferi stimulation promote the processing and presentation of new sets of HLA-DR associated self-peptides derived from unique protein sources. Examination of processes and compartments these proteins reside in, indicate that activation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells changes the range of host self-proteins available for processing and presentation on MHC class II molecules. These findings reveal that the HLA-DR-bound self-immunopeptidome presented by mo-DCs is dynamic in nature and changes with activation state reflective of cellular function. In addition, among the repertoire of self-peptides bound to HLA-DR are several epitopes known to be recognized by autoreactive T cells. These studies are relevant to our basic understanding of pathogen-induced changes in monocyte-derived dendritic cell function, and the mechanisms involved in infection-induced autoimmune illnesses such as Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne illness in Europe. Population-based studies in European children are few. This study aimed to assess the incidence, clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of serologically confirmed paediatric LD in the Republic of Ireland over a 5-year period. A retrospective review of records from accredited laboratories performing Borrelia burgdorferi serological testing was undertaken. Proformas were distributed to clinicians of children and adolescents with positive Lyme serology. Data were requested regarding clinical presentation, treatment and outcome. Updated NICE guidelines were used to classify clinical cases. Serology testing for B. burgdorferi was performed on 2908 samples. Sixty-three (2.2%) children were two-tier positive, generating a crude annual incidence rate of 1.15/100,000. Proformas were returned for 55 (87%) and 47 met clinical and laboratory criteria for LD. Twenty-seven (57%) presented with non-focal symptoms (erythema migrans and/or influenza-like symptoms), and 20 (43%) with focal symptoms (cranial nerve involvement, 11; CNS involvement, 8; arthritis, 1). Median age at presentation was 8.2 (2.5-17.9) years. Seventeen (36%) acquired LD overseas. Twenty-five (83%) of the remaining 30 children acquired infection in the West/Northwest of Ireland. Full resolution of symptoms was reported in 97% of those with available data. Serologically confirmed LD in children is relatively rare in the Republic of Ireland. Ninety-eight percent of children tested were seronegative. Of the seropositive cases, 40% could have been diagnosed based on clinical findings alone. Neurological presentations (40%) were common. Full resolution of symptoms occurred in almost all (97%) where data were available."

		"abstract": "Macrophages play a key role in the inflammatory response in Lyme arthritis (LA) and could be a target for diagnosing and monitoring active Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb) infection. Therefore, we evaluated the potential of macrophage imaging using 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT for detection of Bb activity in a murine model of LA. LA was established in C3H/HeNRj mice infected with Bb B31 strain ML23 pBBE22luc. Bioluminescence imaging was performed to detect migration of spirochetes and inflammatory phagocytes to the joints. Three weeks post-infection 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging was performed at an early (3 h) and late (48 h) time point. Plasma levels of a systemic macrophage marker in plasma CD163 were measured. 64Cu-DOTATATE uptake in infected joints was increased at the early (p < 0.0001) and late time points (p = 0.0005) compared with uptake in non-infected controls. No significant difference in plasma levels of CD163 was measured. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET allows for in vivo detection and quantification of LA locally in the joints through non-invasive visualization of macrophages. In contrast, measurement of a systemic macrophage marker in plasma, CD163, did not allow to detect disease. We suggest that 64Cu-DOTATATE PET could become a valuable diagnostic tool for in situ detection of Bb infection-related inflammation."

		"abstract": "Most vector-borne pathogens cause zoonotic diseases. These zoonoses often have wild animal reservoirs that play a significant role in disease epidemiology. However, pet animals have also been implicated in transmission of zoonotic agents to humans. To exemplify, dogs are competent reservoir hosts for several zoonotic vector-borne bacteria and protozoa. Despite that vector-borne diseases can be life-threatening for both pets and humans, studies on pathogen seroprevalence are very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the serological prevalence of six zoonotic vector-borne agents in dogs from the South Central region of Texas (US). Electronic medical records of dogs, presenting over 2014-2019 for elective ovariohysterectomy or castration at a high volume spay and neuter clinic, were reviewed for serological testing. Sera from 418 dogs were tested for the Dirofilaria immitis antigen, and antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia canis, and Ehrlichia ewingi, using a commonly available commercial test kit. Descriptive statistics were computed to characterize the respective seroprevalence rates of the dog population. The study involved 192 (46%) male and 226 (54%) female dogs. Overall, 85 (20%) dogs tested positive for at least one of the 6 pathogens investigated. The highest seroprevalence rate averaged over the 6-year period was 11.7% for D. immitis followed by 8.4% for E. canis and/or E. ewingii, 4.3% for A. phagocytophilum and/or A. platys, and 0.2% for B. burgdorferi. The co-exposure or co-infection was only detected in 3.8% of the dog population. Together, opportunistic testing of dogs presenting for elective surgical procedures may provide an effective way of assessing seroprevalence and/or risk factors for common vector-borne diseases within a geographic region of concern."

		"abstract": "Borrelia bavariensis is one of the agents of Lyme Borreliosis (or Lyme disease) in Eurasia. The genome of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, that includes B. bavariensis, is known to be very complex and fragmented making the assembly of whole genomes with next-generation sequencing data a challenge. We present a genome reconstruction for 33 B. bavariensis isolates from Eurasia based on long-read (Pacific Bioscience, for three isolates) and short-read (Illumina) data. We show that the combination of both sequencing techniques allows proper genome reconstruction of all plasmids in most cases but use of a very close reference is necessary when only short-read sequencing data is available. B. bavariensis genomes combine a high degree of genetic conservation with high plasticity: all isolates share the main chromosome and five plasmids, but the repertoire of other plasmids is highly variable. In addition to plasmid losses and gains through horizontal transfer, we also observe several fusions between plasmids. Although European isolates of B. bavariensis have little diversity in genome content, there is some geographic structure to this variation. In contrast, each Asian isolate has a unique plasmid repertoire and we observe no geographically based differences between Japanese and Russian isolates. Comparing the genomes of Asian and European populations of B. bavariensis suggests that some genes which are markedly different between the two populations may be good candidates for adaptation to the tick vector, (Ixodes ricinus in Europe and I. persulcatus in Asia). We present the characterization of genomes of a large sample of B. bavariensis isolates and show that their plasmid content is highly variable. This study opens the way for genomic studies seeking to understand host and vector adaptation as well as human pathogenicity in Eurasian Lyme Borreliosis agents."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme disease (LD) in North America has increased substantially in the past two decades. Concomitant with the increased incidence of infection has been an enhancement in the recognition of LD complications. Here, we report a case of Lyme carditis complicated by heart block in a pediatric patient admitted to our children's hospital. What is unique about this case is that the complaint of chest palpitations is an infrequent presentation of LD, and what it adds to the scientific literature is an improved understanding of LD in the pediatric population. The patient was a 16-year-old male who presented with the main concerns of acute onset of palpitations and chest pain. An important clinical finding was Erythema migrans (EM) on physical exam. The primary diagnoses were LD with associated Lyme carditis, based on the finding of 1st degree atrioventricular heart block (AVB) and positive IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi. Interventions included echocardiography, electrocardiography (EKG), and intravenous antibiotics. The hospital course was further remarkable for transition to 2nd degree heart block and transient episodes of complete heart block. A normal sinus rhythm and PR interval were restored after antibiotic therapy and the primary outcome was that of an uneventful recovery. Lyme carditis occurs in < 5% of LD cases, but the \"take-away\" lesson of this case is that carditis can be the presenting manifestation of B. burgdorferi infection in pediatric patients. Any patient with suspected Lyme carditis manifesting cardiac symptoms such as syncope, chest pain, or EKG changes should be admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy and cardiac monitoring. The most common manifestation of Lyme carditis is AVB. AVB may manifest as first-degree block, or may present as high-grade second or third-degree block. Other manifestations of Lyme carditis may include myopericarditis, left ventricular dysfunction, and cardiomegaly. Resolution of carditis is typically achieved through antibiotic administration, although pacemaker placement should be considered if the PR interval fails to normalize or if higher degrees of heart block, with accompanying symptoms, are encountered. With the rising incidence of LD, providers must maintain a high level of suspicion in order to promptly diagnose and treat Lyme carditis."

Its presence warrants a thorough evaluation to search for demyelinating, mass effect, inflammatory, or infectious etiologies. CASE REPORT A 15-year-old African American girl presented to the Emergency Department with acute horizontal binocular diplopia in left gaze. An ophthalmic examination revealed a right INO. She denied any fever, chills, or neck stiffness. Complete blood counts and a metabolic panel were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed scattered pontine, periventricular, and subcortical white matter signal abnormalities within the left frontal lobe suggestive of active demyelination. MRI of the spinal column also demonstrated multiple areas of increased signal intensity from the C3 to C7-T1 region. Inflammatory and autoimmune studies were negative. However, her serum IgM and IgG studies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi with negative CSF titers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated mildly elevated glucose (82 mg/dL) and oligoclonal bands, but was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and ceftriaxone. She was subsequently diagnosed with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis and started on disease-modifying therapy, with full resolution of diplopia and INO 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS We present a case of INO presenting as the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis in a pediatric patient with a concurrent infectious etiology. A thorough evaluation can lead to earlier identification and treatment of underlying diseases."

Cohort register-based study of 264 patients with non-idiopathic peripheral FP and uniform diagnostics and standardized treatment in a university hospital from 2007 to 2017 (47% female, median age: 57 years). Clinical data, facial grading, electrodiagnostics, motor function tests, non-motor function tests, and onset of prednisolone therapy were assessed for their impact on the probability of complete recovery using univariable and multivariable statistics. The most frequent reason for a non-idiopathic peripheral FP was a reactivation of Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV; 36.4%). Traumatic origin had a higher proportion of complete FP (52.9%). Furthermore, in traumatic FP, the mean interval between onset and start of prednisolone therapy was longer than in other cases (5.6 ± 6.2 days). Patients with reactivation of VZV, Lyme disease or otogenic FP had a significant higher recovery rate (p = 0.002, p < 0.0001, p = 0.018, respectively), whereas patients with post-surgery FP and other reasons had a significant lower recovery rate (p < 0.0001). After multivariate analyses voluntary activity in first EMG, Lyme disease and post-surgery cause were identified as independent diagnostic and prognostic factors on the probability of complete recovery (all p < 0.05). Infectious causes for non-idiopathic FP like VZV reactivation and Lyme disease had best probability for complete recovery. Post-surgery FP had a worse prognosis. 2."

		"abstract": "There is considerable uncertainty regarding treatment of Lyme disease patients who do not respond fully to initial short-term antibiotic therapy. Choosing the best treatment approach and duration remains challenging because treatment response among these patients varies: some patients improve with treatment while others do not. A previous study examined treatment response variation in a sample of over 3500 patients enrolled in the MyLymeData patient registry developed by LymeDisease.org (San Ramon, CA, USA). That study used a validated Global Rating of Change (GROC) scale to identify three treatment response subgroups among Lyme disease patients who remained ill: nonresponders, low responders, and high responders. The present study first characterizes the health status, symptom severity, and percentage of treatment response across these three patient subgroups together with a fourth subgroup, patients who identify as well. We then employed machine learning techniques across these subgroups to determine features most closely associated with improved patient outcomes, and we used traditional statistical techniques to examine how these features relate to treatment response of the four groups. High treatment response was most closely associated with (1) the use of antibiotics or a combination of antibiotics and alternative treatments, (2) longer duration of treatment, and (3) oversight by a clinician whose practice focused on the treatment of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The manifestations of borreliosis in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) remain poorly described. As the symptoms of neuroborreliosis can be reversed with timely introduction of antibiotics, early identification could avoid unnecessary axonal loss. Our aim was to describe the characteristics of confirmed neuroborreliosis cases involving the PNS diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 in our neuromuscular disease center in a nonendemic area (La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, France).Neuroborreliosis was defined as follows: compatible neurological symptoms without other cause of neuropathy; cerebrospinal fluid and serum analysis (positive serological tests with ELISA, confirmed by Western Blot); and improvement of symptoms with adapted antibiotherapy. All the patients consulting in our center between 2007 and 2017 underwent electrophysiological study.Sixteen confirmed cases of neuroborreliosis involving the PNS were included: 10 cases of meningoradiculoneuritis, 4 of axonal neuropathy, and 2 of demyelinating neuropathy (one acute and one chronic). Only 4 (25%) patients reported tick bites. Meningoradiculoneuritis was characterized by lymphocytic meningitis, intense pain, cranial nerve palsy, and contrast enhancement of nerve roots on imagery. The patients with axonal neuropathy presented sensory symptoms with intense pain but no motor deficit and meningitis was rare. Nerve biopsy of 1 patient revealed lymphocytic vasculitis. Electrophysiological testing showed sensory or sensorimotor axonal neuropathy (3 subacute and 1 chronic) of the lower limbs, with asymmetrical neuropathy in 1 patients, symmetrical neuropathy in one and monomelic sensory mononeuritis multiplex in another. We also found 1 case of acute demyelinating neuropathy, treated with antibiotherapy and immunoglobulins, and 1 chronic demyelinating neuropathy. Overall, diaphragmatic paralysis was frequent (18.6%). Antibiotherapy (mostly ceftriaxone 3-4 weeks) resulted in symptom resolution.This series gives an updated overview of the peripheral complications of neuroborreliosis to help identify this disease so that timely treatment could avoid axonal loss."

		"abstract": "The peritrophic matrix (PM) is an acellular membrane that covers the gut epithelium in arthropods and physically separates it from the lumen. The structure is thought to play an important role in tick biology. The PM is also known to impact the persistence of tick-borne pathogens like Borrelia burgdorferi, although limited information is available about its molecular constituents or their biological significance. Herein, we characterise a novel PM-associated gut protein in Ixodes scapularis ticks, annotated as Peritrophic Membrane Chitin Binding Protein (PM_CBP), for its role in the integrity and function of the matrix. The PM_CBP displays homology to the chitin deacetylase metalloenzyme, shows upregulation during tick feeding, and is localized at the luminal surface of the gut epithelium. The structural integrity of the PM was impaired both by the knock down of PM_CBP expression via RNA interference and by treatment with anti-PM_CBP antibodies, as revealed by its electron microscopic appearance. Additionally, the duration of tick engorgement on mice and the passage of experimentally-inoculated fluorescent dextran molecules across the PM are affected by the knock down of PM_CBP expression. The transfer of anti-PM_CBP antibodies into the tick gut impacted the overall composition of the resident microbiome, and also influenced B. burgdorferi acquisition in ticks and its transmission to mice. Taken together, these data highlight the biological significance of the Ixodes PM and suggest that the targeting of its molecular constituents may contribute to the development of novel interventions against tick-borne infections."

Ocular involvement is most commonly seen as uveitis, chorioretinitis, conjunctivitis, keratitis, episcleritis, papillitis, panuveitis, ischemic optic neuropathy, papilledema, and retinal vasculitis. A 27-year-old male patient was admitted with a history of fatigue, malaise, and sudden loss of vision in his left eye for 3 days. The best visual acuity was found 20/20 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. Fluorescein fundus angiography showed no pathological findings in the right eye; but hyperfluorescence that was compatible with choroiditis foci was seen in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed choroidal thickening in the left eye compared to the right eye. Lyme IgM antibody was found to be positive, explaining choroiditis etiology, while IgG values were found to be negative. Western blot verification test was positive. The patient was treated with 2 × 100 mg doxycycline (21 days) with a diagnosis of Lyme disease, prednol 1 mg/kg/day (10 days) for choroiditis. Omeprazole tablets were given 1 × 1 during the period of cortisone intake. On the third day of treatment, visual acuity increased to 20/200 and continued to increase until reaching 20/20 in the second week. Lyme disease is rare, but must be kept in mind when investigating the etiology of chorioretinitis and retinal vasculitis. The patient reported here is, to our knowledge, the second case reported in literature that shows atypical clinic for Lyme disease with unilateral chorioretinitis without Erythema chronicum migrans (ECM)."

		"abstract": "Over the past four decades, Lyme disease has remained a virulent and pervasive illness, persisting throughout North America and many other regions of the world. Recent increases in illness in many countries has sparked a renewed interest in improved Lyme diagnostics. While current standards of diagnosis are acceptable for the late stages of the disease, it remains difficult to accurately diagnose early forms of the illness. In addition, current diagnostic methods tend to be relatively expensive and require a large degree of laboratory-based analysis. Biosensors represent the fusion of biological materials with chemical techniques to provide simple, inexpensive alternatives to traditional diagnostic methods. Lyme disease biosensors have the potential to better diagnose early stages of the illness and provide possible patients with an inexpensive, commercially available test. This review examines the current state of Lyme disease biosensing, with a focus on previous biosensor development and essential future considerations."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States, with an estimated incidence of 300,000 infections annually. Antibiotic intervention cures Lyme disease in the majority of cases; however, 10 to 20% of patients develop posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), a debilitating condition characterized by chronic fatigue, pain, and cognitive difficulties. The underlying mechanism responsible for PTLDS symptoms, as well as a reliable diagnostic tool, has remained elusive. We reasoned that the gut microbiome may play an important role in PTLDS given that the symptoms overlap considerably with conditions in which a dysbiotic microbiome has been observed, including mood, cognition, and autoimmune disorders. Analysis of sequencing data from a rigorously curated cohort of patients with PTLDS revealed a gut microbiome signature distinct from that of healthy control subjects, as well as from that of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Notably, microbiome sequencing data alone were indicative of PTLDS, which presents a potential, novel diagnostic tool for PTLDS.IMPORTANCE Most patients with acute Lyme disease are cured with antibiotic intervention, but 10 to 20% endure debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, neurological complications, and myalgias after treatment, a condition known as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). The etiology of PTLDS is not understood, and objective diagnostic tools are lacking. PTLDS symptoms overlap several diseases in which patients exhibit alterations in their microbiome. We found that patients with PTLDS have a distinct microbiome signature, allowing for an accurate classification of over 80% of analyzed cases. The signature is characterized by an increase in Blautia, a decrease in Bacteroides, and other changes. Importantly, this signature supports the validity of PTLDS and is the first potential biological diagnostic tool for the disease."

Here, in this area, we examined I. ricinus and other hard ticks, along with common rodents and small mammals for LB and relapsing fever (RF) borreliae infection. Ticks were collected from various mammalian hosts, including sheep, goats, cattle, camels, horses, dogs, donkeys, rodents, and hedgehogs. Rodents and small mammals were live-captured from different habitats. A real-time PCR for 16S rRNA sequence revealed borrelial DNA in 71 out of 501 (≈14 %) specimens belonging to I. ricinus and Rhipicephalus ticks. None of the rodents and small mammals showed borrelial infection in the viscera. PCR amplification and sequencing of a 600-bp sequence of the flaB identified Borrelia bavariensis, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia valaisiana, and the RF Borrelia, B. miyamotoi in I. ricinus ticks. The RF-like Borrelia in Rhipicephalus ticks shared the highest identity (98.97 %) with an isolate infecting Haemaphysalis megaspinosa ticks in Japan. Our phylogeny and BLAST analysis suggest the range extension of the European I. ricinus-associated borreliae into the north of Iran."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) typically presents as a painful radiculitis or a cranial mononeuropathy with lymphocytic meningitis (Bannwarth's syndrome). Isolated peripheral mononeuropathy or multiple mononeuropathy is less frequently recognised. A 58-year-old female with a background of IgA nephropathy and chronic kidney disease presented with a painful left ulnar neuropathy followed within 3 months by superficial radial neuropathy. Initial serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis were unremarkable; nerve conduction study was in keeping with a mononeuritis multiplex. A superficial radial nerve biopsy demonstrated inflammation with axonal injury consistent with a pathologically possible vasculitis. Borrelia antibodies were identified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot in serum consistent with active recent Lyme borreliosis. A 6-week course of doxycycline was initiated with gradual resolution of pain and improved power. A repeat nerve conduction study demonstrated improvement in sensory and motor responses. This case report identifies a peripheral nerve syndrome of a mononeuritis multiplex secondary to LNB in the absence of CSF pleocytosis with excellent outcome following antibiotic treatment. Peripheral nervous system manifestations of Lyme borreliosis can mimic a vasculitic neuropathy and therefore should be considered in individuals presenting with a painful mononeuritis multiplex."

Acquired resistance to tick bites has been demonstrated to prevent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) transmission. However, the mechanism of resistance, as well as the protective antigens, have remained elusive. To address these unknowns, we utilized a guinea pig model of tick resistance and a mouse model of permissiveness. Guinea pigs developed immunity after multiple Ixodes scapularis tick infestations, characterized by rapid tick detachment and impaired feeding. In comparison, mice tolerated at least 6 infestations with no significant impact on feeding. We analyzed the bite sites by RNA-sequencing and histology, identifying several inflammatory pathways in tick immune animals, such as FcεRI signaling and complement activation, and activation of coagulation pathways that could impair local blood flow. Together, these results identify important pathways altered during tick rejection and potential tick proteins that could serve as vaccine candidates."

		"abstract": "It is often suggested that due to climate and environmental policy changes, the risk from tick-borne disease is increasing, particularly at the geographical limits of the vector distribution. Our project aimed to determine whether this was true for the risk of Lyme borreliosis in Ireland which is the western-most limit of Ixodes ricinus, the European vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The availability of a historical data set of tick infection rates compiled in the 1990s represented a unique opportunity as it provided a baseline against which current data could be compared. Following construction of a spatial predictive model for the presence and absence of I. ricinus based on data from 491 GPS locations visited between 2016 and 2019, 1404 questing nymphs from 27 sites were screened for the presence of Borrelia spp. using a TaqMan PCR aimed at the 23S rRNA gene sequence. All positive ticks were further analysed by nested PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the 5 S-23 S intergenic spacer. The model indicated that areas with the highest probability of tick presence were mostly located along the western seaboard and the Shannon and Erne river catchments, coinciding with historical high incidence areas of bovine babesiosis, while the infection rate of questing nymphs with B. burgdorferi s.l. and the prevalence of the various genospecies have remained surprisingly stable over the last 3 decades. Clear communication of the potential disease risk arising from a tick bite is essential in order to allay undue concerns over tick-borne diseases among the general public."

		"abstract": "The dynamics of zoonotic vector-borne diseases are determined by a complex set of parameters including human behavior that may vary with socio-ecological contexts. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. The Northeast and upper Midwest are the regions most affected - two areas with differing levels of urbanization and differing sociocultural settings. The probability of being infected with Lyme disease is related to the risk of encounters with Ixodes scapularis ticks infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which reflects both the environmental tick hazard and human behaviors. Herein, we compare behavioral and peridomestic risk factors perceived to influence the risk for human-tick encounters between two high-incidence states in the Northeast (New York and New Jersey) and one high-incidence state in the Midwest (Wisconsin). We used a smartphone application, The Tick App, as a novel survey tool, during spring and summer of 2018. Adaptive human behavior was identified in the relationship between outdoor activities and the use of methods to prevent tick bites. More frequent recreational outdoor activities and gardening (a peridomestic activity) were associated with a 1.4-2.3 times increased likelihood of using personal protective measures to prevent tick bites, when accounting for demographics and previous Lyme diagnosis. Most outdoor activities were more frequently reported by participants from the Midwest (n = 697), representing an older demographic, than the Northeast (n = 396). Participants from the Northeast were less likely to report use of personal protective measures to prevent tick bites, but a larger proportion of participants from the Northeast reported application of environmental pesticides targeting ticks or mosquitoes or other insects on their property (34 % of 279 versus 22 % of 616 participants) and interventions to reduce the presence of peridomestic deer compared to participants from the Midwest (e.g. 20 % of 278 versus 7% of 615 participants reported having a deer proof fence). Participants from the Midwest were more likely to kill rodents on their property (28 % versus 13 %). These differences illustrate the need for further assessment of personal behavior and tick exposure in these two Lyme disease-endemic regions to aid in targeted public health messaging to reduce tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the most common and widely distributed tick species in Europe, responsible for several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme borreliosis. Population genetics of disease vectors is a useful tool for understanding the spread of pathogens and infection risks. Despite the threat to the public health due to the climate-driven distribution changes of I. ricinus, the genetic structure of tick populations, though essential for understanding epidemiology, remains unclear. Previous studies have demonstrated weak to no apparent spatial pattern of genetic differentiation between European populations. Here, we analysed the population genetic structure of 497 individuals from 28 tick populations sampled from 20 countries across Europe, the Middle-East, and northern Africa. We analysed 125 SNPs loci after quality control. We ran Bayesian and multivariate hierarchical clustering analyses to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. Both clustering methods support the identification of three spatially-structured clusters. Individuals from the south and north-western parts of Eurasia form a separated cluster from northern European populations, while central European populations are a mix between the two groups. Our findings have important implications for understanding the dispersal processes that shape the spread of zoonotic diseases under anthropogenic global changes."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne, multisystemic disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. Standard treatments for early Lyme disease include short courses of oral antibiotics but relapses often occur after discontinuation of treatment. Several studies have suggested that ongoing symptoms may be due to a highly antibiotic resistant form of B. burgdorferi called biofilms. Our recent clinical study reported the successful use of an intracellular mycobacterium persister drug used in treating leprosy, diaminodiphenyl sulfone (dapsone), in combination therapy for the treatment of Lyme disease. In this in vitro study, we evaluated the effectiveness of dapsone individually and in combination with cefuroxime and/or other antibiotics with intracellular activity including doxycycline, rifampin, and azithromycin against Borrelia biofilm forms utilizing crystal violet biofilm mass, and dimethyl methylene blue glycosaminoglycan assays combined with Live/Dead fluorescent microscopy analyses. Dapsone, alone or in various combinations with doxycycline, rifampin and azithromycin produced a significant reduction in the mass and protective glycosaminoglycan layer and overall viability of B. burgdorferi biofilm forms. This in vitro study strongly suggests that dapsone combination therapy could represent a novel and effective treatment option against the biofilm form of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a novel highly contagious infectious disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV2. The virus affects the human respiratory and other systems, and presents mostly as acute respiratory syndrome with fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia and dyspnea. The clinical manifestations vary from no symptoms to multiple organ failure. Majority of patients fully recover. Several postinfectious presumably autoimmune complications of COVID-19 affecting the brain or peripheral large nerve fibers have been reported. This report describes a post COVID-19 patient who developed chronic fatigue, orthostatic dizziness and brain fog consistent with orthostatic hypoperfusion syndrome (OCHOS), a form of orthostatic intolerance, and painful small fiber neuropathy (SFN). Initially, the patient was diagnosed with. OCHOS (detected by the tilt test with transcranial Doppler monitoring) and SFN (confirmed by skin biopsy), and both OCHOS/SFN were attributed to Post Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome of presumed autoimmune etiology. Patient recovered on symptomatic therapy. COVID-19 triggered exacerbation of OCHOS/SFN responded to immunotherapy with intravenous immunoglobulins. This case suggests that post COVID-19 syndrome may present as an autoimmune OCHOS/SFN and that early immunotherapy may be effective. Further studies are necessary to confirm the link between OCHOS/SFN and COVID-19 disease as well as to confirm the benefit of immunotherapy."

In this retrospective, population-based study, we collected data from the medical records of all patients referred for infectious disease consultations in 2013 due to presumed LB from a population of 1.58 million. The patients were classified according to the certainty of LB on the basis of their symptoms, signs and laboratory results. Data on the outcomes and subsequent alternative diagnoses during the 4-year follow-up period were reviewed from all of the available patient records from public, private and occupational healthcare providers. A total of 256 patients (16/100 000) were referred as a result of suspicion of LB; 30 (12%) of 256 were classified with definite, 36 (14%) with probable and 65 (25%) with possible LB. LB was unlikely in 121 (47%) patients. A novel diagnosis was discovered in the background symptoms in 73 (29%) of patients. Previously diagnosed comorbidities caused at least some of the symptoms in 48 (19%) patients. Other explanations for symptoms were found in 81 (67%) of 121 of unlikely and 22 (34%) of 65 of possible LB patients. The spectrum of conditions behind the symptoms was quite broad and most often were musculoskeletal, neurological, psychological or functional disorders. LB was unlikely in half of the patients with presumed LB. In most cases the patients had other conditions that explained their symptoms."

In New Jersey, a Lyme-endemic area, the months with the most Lyme disease (80% of cases) are May through October (\"Lyme months\"). Our aim was to determine whether positive tests for Lyme disease and visits are greater in the Lyme months than the rest of the year for patients with Bell's palsy in New Jersey emergency departments (EDs). We conducted a retrospective chart review from two New Jersey suburban EDs with consecutive patients from February 1, 2013 to January 31, 2018.We identified patients having Bell's palsy using the emergency physician diagnosis. We tabulated positive Lyme tests and visits for Bell's palsy by month of year. We calculated the ratio of positive tests and visits between the Lyme months and the rest of the year along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). There were 442 visits for Bell's palsy, 359 (81%) of these patients were tested for Lyme disease and 57 (16%) of the tests were positive. The Lyme months had 7.1 (95% CI 3.5-14.4) times more positive tests and 1.3 (95% CI 1.1-1.4) times more Bell's palsy visits than the rest of the year. Both measures peaked in July. In a Lyme-endemic area, positive Lyme tests and ED visits for Bell's palsy are greatest in the Lyme months, peaking in July. This finding can help guide testing and treatment for patients in the ED with Bell's palsy during various months of the year."

We performed isoelectric focusing followed by immunoblotting in CSF of 10 NB patients and 11 controls (7 patients with multiple sclerosis, 2 patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disease, 1 patient with dementia and 1 patient with monoclonal gammopathy). Immunoblotting was performed using an uncoated as well as a borrelia antigen pre-coated nitrocellulose membrane (NCM). OCB were counted by visual inspection and photometric analysis. OCB were compared between uncoated und pre-coated NCM both in the NB and control group. For validation purposes inter-assay precision was determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV). Borrelia-specific OCB were found in the CSF of 9 NB patients and in none of the control subjects resulting in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. Number of NB specific OCB were 11±7 bands by photometric analyses compared to 9±5 bands by visual inspection. Validation experiments revealed an inconsistent inter-assay precision between visual and photometric analyses (NB uncoated: visual 28% versus photometric 14%, control subject uncoated: visual 16% versus photometric 24%). In CSF samples with positive OCB, Borrelia-specific bands were detected in almost all NB patients and in none of the control subjects. Inconsistent inter-assay precision may be explained by a poor comparability of visual and photometric approach."

		"abstract": "Post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms/syndrome (PTLDS) occurs in approximately 10% of Lyme disease patients following antibiotic treatment. Biomarkers or specific clinical symptoms to identify PTLDS patients do not currently exist and the PTLDS classification is based on the report of persistent, subjective symptoms for ≥ 6 months following antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics was used to determine longitudinal metabolic responses and biosignatures in PTLDS and clinically cured non-PTLDS Lyme patients. Evaluation of biosignatures included: 1) defining altered classes of metabolites; 2) elastic net regularization to define metabolites that most strongly defined PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at different timepoints; 3) changes in the longitudinal abundance of metabolites; 4) linear discriminant analysis to evaluate robustness in a second patient cohort. This study determined that observable metabolic differences exist between PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients at multiple timepoints. The metabolites with differential abundance included those from glycerophospholipid, bile acid and acylcarnitine metabolism. Distinct longitudinal patterns of metabolite abundance indicated a greater metabolic variability in PTLDS vs non-PTLDS patients. Small numbers of metabolites (6-40) could be used to define PTLDS vs. non-PTLDS patients at defined time points, and the findings were validated in a second cohort of PTLDS and non-PTLDS patients. These data provide evidence that an objective metabolite-based measurement can distinguish patients with PTLDS and help understand the underlying biochemistry of PTLDS."

As no data exist on the presence of canine vector-borne pathogens in Kosovo, we here present a first study on the seroprevalence of selected vector-borne pathogens, the dog heartworm Dirofilaria immitis and the bacteria Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The study was carried out from July to October 2019 in all regions of Kosovo and included 149 clinically healthy dogs (84 owned, 40 sheltered and 25 free-ranging). Blood samples collected from each individual were tested using a commercially available rapid multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In total, 37.6% of the examined dogs were seropositive for one or more of the target pathogens. Most frequently, antibodies were found against Anaplasma spp. (24.8% of the dogs tested), followed by antigen detection of D. immitis (14.8%) and antibodies of B. burgdorferi s.l. (1.3%). The lowest antibody prevalence (0.7%) showed E. canis where only one dog was found positive. This preliminary study demonstrates the circulation of several zoonotic vector-borne pathogens in natural cycles involving dogs in Kosovo. It should trigger studies on infection prevalences in humans and initiate vector surveillance programmes in order to manage and control transmission and the diseases associated with the pathogens."

However, the Czech Republic is an endemic region for several of tickborne diseases and, therefore, they should be a part of differential diagnosis of GI symptoms of unknown origin. This article describes GI and hepatic symptoms of several tickborne diseases - Lyme disease, ehrlichiosis, Rocky mountain spotted fever, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, tickborne relapsing fever, Q fever and babesiosis. GI and hepatic symptoms are quite common in Lyme disease patients. The prognosis is generally favourable with antibiotics treatment, however, serious courses have been described. Lyme disease should be a part of differential diagnosis of liver tests elevation and GI symptoms in patients from endemic regions regardless erythema migrans presence. Ehrlichiosis should be a part of differential diagnosis of acute febrile illness with GI symptoms especially in the presence of leukopenia/thrombocytopenia and/or liver tests elevation. Tularemia should be considered as a rare etiology of cholestatic hepatopathy and a history of a tick bite. In general, the importance of careful patient interviewing, including the history of a tick bite, can be highlighted also as a part of investigation of patients with seemingly unrelated GI and/or hepatic symptoms."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb or B. burgdorferi) is the most common vector-borne, multi-systemic disease in the USA. Although most Lyme disease patients can be cured with a course of the first line of antibiotic treatment, some patients are intolerant to currently available antibiotics, necessitating the development of more effective therapeutics. We previously found several drugs, including disulfiram, that exhibited effective activity against B. burgdorferi. In the current study, we evaluated the potential of repurposing the FDA-approved drug, disulfiram for its borreliacidal activity. Our results indicate disulfiram has excellent borreliacidal activity against both the log and stationary phase B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31 MI. Treatment of mice with disulfiram eliminated the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto B31 MI completely from the hearts and urinary bladder by day 28 post infection. Moreover, disulfiram-treated mice showed reduced expressions of inflammatory markers, and thus they were protected from histopathology and cardiac organ damage. Furthermore, disulfiram-treated mice showed significantly lower amounts of total antibody titers (IgM and IgG) at day 21 and total IgG2b at day 28 post infection. FACS analysis of lymph nodes revealed a decrease in the percentage of CD19+ B cells and an increase in total percentage of CD3+ T cells, CD3+ CD4+ T helpers, and naive and effector memory cells in disulfiram-treated mice. Together, our findings suggest that disulfiram has the potential to be repurposed as an effective antibiotic for treating Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Most tick-related studies in Europe have been conducted in nonurban areas, but ticks and tick-borne pathogens also occur in urban green spaces. From a public health perspective, risks regarding tick-borne infections should be studied in these urban areas, where contacts between infected ticks and humans may be more frequent than elsewhere, due to high human activity. We examined the risk of encountering an infected tick in urban green spaces in Helsinki, Finland. We collected ticks at nine sites throughout Helsinki, recorded the prevalence of several pathogens and identified areas with a high potential for contacts between infected ticks and humans. Moreover, we explored the relationship between the density of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato-infected ticks and locally diagnosed cases of borreliosis and compared the potential for human-tick encounters in Helsinki to those in nonurban areas in south-western Finland. During 34.8 km of cloth dragging, 2,417 Ixodes ricinus were caught (402 adults, 1,399 nymphs and 616 larvae). From analysed nymphs, we found 11 distinct tick-borne pathogens, with 31.5% of nymphs carrying at least one pathogen. Tick activity was highest in August and September, leading to the density of nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l., and concurrently infection risk, to also be highest during this time. Nymph densities varied between the sampling sites, with obvious implications to spatial variation in infection risk. While ticks and tick-borne pathogens were found in both Helsinki and nonurban areas in south-western Finland, the estimates of human activity were generally higher in urban green spaces, leading to a higher potential for human-tick contacts therein. The presence of ticks and tick-borne pathogens and high local human activity in urban green spaces suggest that they form potential foci regarding the acquisition of tick-borne infections. Risk areas within cities should be identified and knowledge regarding urban ticks increased."

		"abstract": "Studies of tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Europe focus on pathogens with principal medical importance (e.g. Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis), but we have limited epidemiological information on the neglected pathogens, such as the members of the genera Anaplasma, Rickettsia, Babesia and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis. Here, we integrated an extensive field sampling, laboratory analysis and GIS models to provide first publicly available information on pathogen diversity, prevalence and infection risk for four overlooked zoonotic TBDs in the Czech Republic. In addition, we assessed the effect of landscape variables on the abundance of questing ticks at different spatial scales and examined whether pathogen prevalence increased with tick density. Our data from 13,340 ticks collected in 142 municipalities showed that A. phagocytophilum (MIR = 3.5%) and Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis (MIR = 4.0%) pose geographically uneven risks with localized hotspots, while Rickettsia (MIR = 4.9%) and Babesia (MIR = 1.1%) had relatively homogeneous spatial distribution. Landscape variables had significant effect on tick abundance up to the scale of 1 km around the sampling sites. Questing ticks responded positively to landscape diversity and configuration, especially to forest patch density that strongly correlates with the amount of woodland-grassland ecotones. For all four pathogens, we found higher prevalence in places with higher densities of ticks, confirming the hypothesis that tick abundance amplifies the risk of TB infection. Our findings highlight the importance of landscape parameters for tick vectors, likely due to their effect on small vertebrates as reservoir hosts. Future studies should explicitly investigate the combined effect of landscape parameters and the composition and population dynamics of hosts on the host-vector-pathogen system."

		"abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that climate change and other factors are leading to the emergence of Lyme disease in the province of Quebec, where it previously did not exist. As risk areas expand further north, the population can adopt specific preventive behaviors to limit chances of infection. The objectives of this study were to (1) create an index of Lyme disease prevention behaviors (LDPB), and (2) use the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to explain the decision-making process of people who choose to adopt LDPB. A sample of 1959 adults living in a Lyme disease risk area completed a questionnaire by phone (n = 1003) or on the Web (n = 956). The questionnaire measured whether they did or did not adopt the LDPB proposed by public health officials. It also measured some TPB variables, including their attitude or perceived social norms regarding LDPB. Our findings led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index consisting of 10 behaviors, down from the 19 behaviors initially considered for inclusion in the index. Rates of adoption of each behavior varied tremendously, from 4.30 to 83.80%. All variables of the TPB model (attitude, social norms, and perceived control) were significantly associated with intention to adopt preventive behaviors. Intention itself was significantly associated with adoption of LDPB. Likewise, risk perception was positively correlated with the adoption of LDPB. This study led to the creation of a Lyme disease prevention index that can be used by public health agencies, researchers, and professionals to monitor the evolution over time of individuals' LDPB adoption rates. It also showed the usefulness of the TPB in understanding the adoption of LDPB and how intention to adopt such behaviors is formed."

Additional objectives were to discover possible differences in seroprevalence between groups of cats living in different living conditions, and to determine the spectrum of Leptospira serogroups in cats in the same places. A total of 360 blood sera from domestic cats of 3 different sets were collected during the period 2013-2015. All samples were examined using ELISA for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies against <i>Bb</i>sl, and the microscopic agglutination test (MAT) for the detection of antibodies against 8 serogroups of <i>Li</i>sl. The ELISA method determined 15.8%, 4.8% and 10.3% IgM anti-Borrelia antibodies in the patient group, shelter cats and street cats, respectively. IgG anti-Borrelia antibodies were found in 6.2%, 9.5%, 5.2%, respectively. Antibodies specific for 5 Leptospira serogroups were detected by the use of MAT in 8.8%, 9.5% and 10.3% of cats from the investigated groups. The total positivity of all examined cats for anti-Borrelia antibodies was 18.0% and for anti-Leptospira - 9.2%. Cats can be infected with both <i>Bb</i>sl and <i>Li</i>sl. The obtained results are exclusive to the city of Brno and its environs, and are comparable to the limited previous studies. There is a need for further studies of clinical signs of both infections and the possible transmission of Leptospira by ticks."

		"abstract": "In the absence of definitive diagnosis, healthcare providers are likely to prescribe empirical antibacterials to those who test negative for malaria. This problem is of critical importance in Southern Asia (SA) and South-eastern Asia (SEA) where high levels of antimicrobial consumption and high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have been reported. To improve management and guide further diagnostic test development, better understanding is needed of the true causative agents of fever and their geographical variability. We conducted a systematic review of published literature (1980-2015) to characterise the spectrum of pathogens causing non-malarial febrile illness in SA and SEA. We searched six databases in English and French languages: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health (CABI) database, WHO Global Health Library, PASCAL, and Bulletin de la Société Française de Parasitologie (BDSP). Selection criteria included reporting on an infection or infections with a confirmed diagnosis, defined as pathogens detected in or cultured from samples from normally sterile sites, or serological evidence of current or past infection. A total of 29,558 records from 19 countries in SA and SEA were screened, of which 2410 (8.1%) met the selection criteria. Bacterial aetiologies were reported in 1235 (51.2%) articles, viral in 846 (35.1%), parasitic in 132 (5.5%), and fungal in 54 (2.2%), and 143 (6.0%) articles reported more than one pathogen group. In descending order of frequency, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were the commonly reported bacteria, while dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were common viral pathogens reported. Reports of rarely reported or emerging pathogens included a case report of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) in India in 2010 and reports of Nipah virus in Singapore and India. This review summarises the reported non-malaria pathogens that may cause febrile illness in SA and SEA. The findings emphasise the need of standardising the reporting of aetiological studies to develop effective, evidence-based fever management and improved surveillance. Research and development of diagnostic tools would benefit from up-to-date epidemiological reporting of the regional diversities of non-malaria fever aetiologies.

		"abstract": "This study examines the use of AI methods and deep learning (DL) for prescreening skin lesions and detecting the characteristic erythema migrans rash of acute Lyme disease. Accurate identification of erythema migrans allows for early diagnosis and treatment, which avoids the potential for later neurologic, rheumatologic, and cardiac complications of Lyme disease. We develop and test several deep learning models for detecting erythema migrans versus several other clinically relevant skin conditions, including cellulitis, tinea corporis, herpes zoster, erythema multiforme, lesions due to tick bites and insect bites, as well as non-pathogenic normal skin. We consider a set of clinically-relevant binary and multiclass classification problems of increasing complexity. We train the DL models on a combination of publicly available images and test on public images as well as images obtained in the clinical setting. We report performance metrics that measure agreement with a gold standard, as well as a receiver operating characteristic curve and associated area under the curve. On public images, we find that the DL system has an accuracy ranging from 71.58% (and 95% error margin equal to 3.77%) for an 8-class problem of EM versus 7 other classes including other skin pathologies, insect bites and normal skin, to 94.23% (3.66%) for a binary problem of EM vs. non-pathological skin. On clinical images of affected individuals, the DL system has a sensitivity of 88.55% (2.39%). These results suggest that a DL system can help in prescreening and referring individuals to physicians for earlier diagnosis and treatment, in the presence of clinically relevant confusers, thereby reducing further complications and morbidity."

We report the solution NMR structure of the B. burgdorferi outer surface lipoprotein BBP28, a member of the multicopy lipoprotein (mlp) family. The structure comprises a tether peptide, five α-helices and an extended C-terminal loop. The fold is similar to that of Borrelia turicatae outer surface protein BTA121, which is known to bind lipids.

In this study, we assessed the impact of pre-existing statin use on the course and outcome of Lyme neuroborreliosis manifested as meningoradiculitis (Bannwarth's syndrome). One hundred and twenty three consecutive patients with Bannwarth's syndrome, of whom 18 (14.6%) were being treated with statins, were included in the study. To assess the influence of statin use on the course and outcome of the disease, univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. No statistically significant association was found between statin pre-treatment and the clinical manifestations, laboratory test results, and outcome of Bannwarth's syndrome. In conclusion, pre-existing use of statins did not significantly impact either the clinical presentation or the outcome of Bannwarth's syndrome."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever are considered emerging and re-emerging diseases that cause major public health problems in endemic countries. Epidemiology and geographical distribution of these diseases are documented in the US and in Europe, yet in Mexico, studies are scarce and scattered. The aims of this study were (1) to present the first confirmatory evidence of an endemic case of Lyme disease in Mexico and (2) to analyze the epidemiological trend of these both diseases by compiling all the information published on Borrelia in Mexico. Two databases were compiled, one of human cases and another of wild and domestic animals in the country. The analysis included the evaluation of risk factors for the human population, the diversity of Borrelia species and their geographic distribution. Six Borrelia species were reported in a total of 1,347 reports, of which 398 were of humans. Women and children from rural communities were shown to be more susceptible for both Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever. The remaining reports were made in diverse mammalian species and ticks. A total of 17 mammalian species and 14 tick species were recorded as hosts for this bacterial genus. It is noteworthy that records of Borrelia were only made in 18 of the 32 states, mainly in northern and central Mexico. These results highlight the importance of performing further studies in areas where animal cases have been reported, yet no human studies have been done, in order to complete the epidemiological panorama for Lyme borreliosis and Relapsing fever. Finally, the search for Borrelia infections in other vertebrates, such as reptiles and amphibians is recommended to gain a more accurate view of Borrelia species and their distribution. The geographical approach presented herein justifies an intense sampling effort to improve epidemiological knowledge of these diseases to aid vector control and prevention programs."

		"abstract": "Infection with tick borne Borrelia Burgdorferi (Lyme disease) can without treatment rarely develop into a chronic phase. Secondary Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (sNPH) based on chronic infection with Borrelia Burgdorferi (Bb) is an even rarer entity, that with the right treatment is potentially curable. A 67-year-old male with a slow onset of progressive balance problems, also presented unspecified dizziness, urge feeling, neck soreness and discrete cognitive complaints. An MRI scan revealed an enlarged ventricular system compatible with NPH. After further liquor dynamic procedures, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analysed with the surprising results of lymphocytic pleocytosis, and signs of increased antibody production. Microbiology revealed chronic neuroborreliosis and the patient was treated with antibiotics accordingly. At the one-year follow-up no symptoms remained and the ventricular system almost normalized. We describe the 7th published case of sNPH secondary to chronic Borreliosis in a previous healthy adult. Existing published literature has been reviewed and previous cases showed similarly nearly full clinical recovery. Primary/idiopathic NPH (iNPH) is treated with the surgical intervention of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and can be mistaken for a sNPH. The awareness of rare causes of sNPH like chronic Borreliosis is important as it is easily treated non surgically."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, a causative agent of Lyme disease, encodes a protein BBB07 on the genomic plasmid cp26. BBB07 was identified as a candidate integrin ligand based on the presence of an RGD tripeptide motif, which is present in a number of mammalian ligands for β1 and β3 integrins . Previous work demonstrated that BBB07 in recombinant form binds to β1 integrins and induces inflammatory responses in synovial cells in culture. Several transposon mutants in bbb07 were attenuated in an in vivo screen of the transposon library in mice. We therefore tested individual transposon mutant clones in single-strain infections in mice and found that they were attenuated in terms of ID50 but did not have significantly reduced tissue burdens in mice. Based on data presented here we conclude that BBB07 is not essential for, but does contribute to, B. burgdorferi infectivity in mice."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, the most common tick-transmitted illness in North America. When Ixodes scapularis feed on an infected vertebrate host, spirochetes enter the tick gut along with the bloodmeal and colonize the vector. Here, we show that a secreted tick protein, I. scapularisprotein disulfide isomerase A3 (IsPDIA3), enhances B. burgdorferi colonization of the tick gut. I. scapularis ticks in which ispdiA3 has been knocked down using RNA interference have decreased spirochete colonization of the tick gut after engorging on B. burgdorferi-infected mice. Moreover, administration of IsPDIA3 antiserum to B. burgdorferi-infected mice reduced the ability of spirochetes to colonize the tick when feeding on these animals. We show that IsPDIA3 modulates inflammatory responses at the tick bite site, potentially facilitating spirochete survival at the vector-host interface as it exits the vertebrate host to enter the tick gut. These data provide functional insights into the complex interactions between B. burgdorferi and its arthropod vector and suggest additional targets to interfere with the spirochete life cycle."

		"abstract": "During the natural enzootic life cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi (also known as Borreliella burgdorferi), the bacteria must sense conditions within the vertebrate and arthropod and appropriately regulate expression of genes necessary to persist within these distinct environments. bb0345 of B. burgdorferi encodes a hypothetical protein of unknown function that is predicted to contain an N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain. Because HTH domains can mediate protein-DNA interactions, we hypothesized that BB0345 might represent a previously unidentified borrelial transcriptional regulator with the ability to regulate events critical for the B. burgdorferi enzootic cycle. To study the role of BB0345 within mammals, we generated a bb0345 mutant and assessed its virulence potential in immunocompetent mice. The bb0345 mutant was able to initiate localized infection and disseminate to distal tissues but was cleared from all sites by 14 days postinfection. In vitro growth curve analyses revealed that the bb0345 mutant grew similar to wild-type bacteria in standard Barbour-Stoenner-Kelley II (BSK-II) medium; however, the mutant was not able to grow in dilute BSK-II medium or dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted in rats. Proteinase K accessibility assays and whole-cell partitioning indicated that BB0345 was intracellular and partially membrane associated. Comparison of protein production profiles between the wild-type parent and the bb0345 mutant revealed no major differences, suggesting BB0345 may not be a global transcriptional regulator. Taken together, these data show that BB0345 is essential for B. burgdorferi survival in the mammalian host, potentially by aiding the spirochete with a physiological function that is required by the bacterium during infection."

Extending the literature beyond basic searches for symptoms or disease terms, this study examines spatiotemporal dynamics among symptom, disease, and unconventional lab test searches on Google Trends, in compared with CDC confirmed cases of LD. The search terms used for the Google Trends analysis between 2011 and 2015 include: (1) \"lyme\" and \"lyme disease\" for disease, (2) \"tick bite,\" \"bone pain,\" \"stiff neck,\" \"circular rash,\" and \"brain fog\" for symptoms, and (3) \"IGENEX\" for the alternative lab test. Spatial and temporal analyses illustrate noticeable similar patterns between the search frequency and the actual LD incidence. Beyond basic searches for symptoms or disease terms, we demonstrate the improved utility of Google Trends analysis in discovering spatial and temporal patterns of perceived LD and comparing with the reported LD cases. The public health and medical communities benefit from this research through improved knowledge of undiagnosed patients who are searching for alternative labs to explain lingering symptoms. This study validates the need for further research into Google Trends data and surveillance protocols of diseases characterized by non-specific symptoms, prompting patients to \"self-diagnose.\""

Understanding tick population dynamics and predicting risk of tick-borne disease insurgence helps to design preventive actions against the disease spread. Using a compartmental model describing the pathogen transmission among ticks and hosts, we study the influence of host-targeted tick control strategies with chemical insecticides on tick population and disease transmission dynamics. Our analysis shows that in areas with rapid-growing population of ticks, host-targeted controls using chemical insecticides may enhance disease persistence and even turn a disease-free area to a disease endemic area. Therefore, the complex dynamics of pathogen spread among ticks and hosts should be carefully examined when designing tick control strategies."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, is established in several regions of Ontario, Canada, and continues to spread into new geographic areas across the province at a rapid rate. This poses a significant public health risk since I. scapularis transmits the Lyme disease-causing bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi, and other pathogens of potential public health concern. The objective of this study was to develop species distribution models for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi to predict and compare the potential distributions of the tick vector and the Lyme disease pathogen as well as the ecological factors most important for species establishment. Ticks were collected via tick dragging at 120 sites across southern, central, and eastern Ontario between 2015 and 2018 and tested for tick-borne pathogens. A maximum entropy (Maxent) approach was used to model the potential distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi. Two independent datasets derived from tick dragging at 25 new sites in 2019 and ticks submitted by the public to local health units between 2015 and 2017 were used to validate the predictive accuracy of the models. The model for I. scapularis showed high suitability for blacklegged ticks in eastern Ontario and some regions along the shorelines of the Great Lakes, and moderate suitability near Algonquin Provincial Park and the Georgian Bay with good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.898; ticks from public: AUC = 0.727). The model for B. burgdorferi showed a similar predicted distribution but was more constrained to eastern Ontario, particularly between Ottawa and Kingston, and along Lake Ontario, with similarly good predictive accuracy (tick dragging 2019: AUC = 0.958; ticks from public: AUC = 0.863. The ecological variables most important for predicting the distributions of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi included elevation, distance to deciduous and coniferous forest, proportions of agricultural land, water, and infrastructure, mean summer/spring temperature, and cumulative annual degree days above 0°C. Our study presents a novel application of species distribution modelling for I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Ontario, Canada, and provides an up to date projection of their potential distributions for public health knowledge users."

		"abstract": "Drug-induced antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) has been increasingly recognized in the literature with numerous medications listed as causative agents in disease pathology. Doxycycline is a commonly prescribed medication within the United States which is a synthetic, broad-spectrum antibiotic with antimicrobial properties and at low doses exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. In this report, we describe a case of doxycycline-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis with laboratory and biopsy findings supporting the diagnosis, which to the best of our knowledge is the first described case of doxycycline-induced AAV in the literature. The patient was started on doxycycline for treatment of potential Lyme disease. She began to develop progressively worsening myasthenia, erythematous macular rash, anorexia, anemia, and fatigue for several weeks following the course of doxycycline with initial concern of a paraneoplastic process. Ultimately, the patient was discovered to be positive for antinuclear antibody (ANA), perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA), and myeloperoxidase (MPO) antibody for which she was treated with a course of prednisone leading to complete remission of disease. A brief review of the pathogenesis of ANCA vasculitides will also be discussed within this article."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a vector-borne illness caused by Borrelia spp. bacterium spread by ticks to humans and other mammals. Despite being prevalent in many regions of the world, there remains considerable uncertainty surrounding many aspects of the disease, and consensus on the most appropriate and effective means of treating the illness remains to be achieved. Recommendations published by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS), the primary guidelines followed by health care professionals treating Lyme disease, diverge in many of their key recommendations, including treatment duration. Given this lack of consensus, surprisingly little research has been conducted on patient outcomes following different treatment approaches. In this study, patient outcomes were evaluated from a cohort of 210 Canadian Lyme disease patients seeking treatment at one US Lyme disease clinic following a treatment regimen conforming to the ILADS treatment guidelines. It was found that the majority of Lyme disease patients at the clinic responded positively to treatment and a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in symptoms was observed over time. This study, along with related studies, may help to guide physicians to provide their patients with the most effective care."

		"abstract": "Matching of symmetry at interfaces is a fundamental obstacle in molecular assembly. Virus-like particles (VLPs) are important vaccine platforms against pathogenic threats, including Covid-19. However, symmetry mismatch can prohibit vaccine nanoassembly. We established an approach for coupling VLPs to diverse antigen symmetries. SpyCatcher003 enabled efficient VLP conjugation and extreme thermal resilience. Many people had pre-existing antibodies to SpyTag:SpyCatcher but less to the 003 variants. We coupled the computer-designed VLP not only to monomers (SARS-CoV-2) but also to cyclic dimers (Newcastle disease, Lyme disease), trimers (influenza hemagglutinins), and tetramers (influenza neuraminidases). Even an antigen with dihedral symmetry could be displayed. For the global challenge of influenza, SpyTag-mediated display of trimer and tetramer antigens strongly induced neutralizing antibodies. SpyCatcher003 conjugation enables nanodisplay of diverse symmetries towards generation of potent vaccines."

A high-throughput 16S V1-V2 rRNA gene-based metagenomics assay was developed and evaluated using >13,000 residual samples from patients suspected of having tick-borne illness and >1,000 controls. Taxonomic predictions for tick-borne bacteria were exceptionally accurate, as independently validated by secondary testing. Overall, 881 specimens were positive for bacterial tick-borne agents. Twelve tick-borne bacterial species were detected, including two novel pathogens, representing a 100% increase in the number of tick-borne bacteria identified compared to what was possible by initial PCR testing. In three blood specimens, two tick-borne bacteria were simultaneously detected. Seven bacteria, not known to be tick transmitted, were also confirmed to be unique to samples from persons suspected of having tick-borne illness. These results indicate that 16S V1-V2 metagenomics can greatly simplify diagnosis and accelerate the discovery of bacterial tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Companion animals can become infected with tick-borne diseases (TBDs) becoming a reservoir for human transfer, thereby damaging human health. To evaluate whether companion animals are infested with ticks harboring human TBD pathogens, we detected TBD pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and cats brought to animal hospitals in the Yamagata prefecture of Japan. An investigation of 164 adult ticks collected from 88 dogs and 41 cats between March and July 2018 revealed that this region was dominated by three tick species, Ixodes ovatus (n = 95, 57.9%), Ixodes nipponensis (n = 37, 22.6%) and Haemaphysalis flava (n = 10, 6.1%). To evaluate their pathogenic potential, we went on to test each tick for spotted fever group rickettsiae, Lyme disease borreliae, relapsing fever borreliae, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Huaiyangshan banyangvirus (formerly SFTS virus). Our results identified two I. ovatus ticks infected with Borrelia miyamotoi, which causes emerging relapsing fever; several I. nipponensis ticks infected with Rickettsia monacensis, which cause rickettsiosis; and several Ixodes persulcatus ticks infected with Rickettsia helvetica, which can also cause rickettsiosis. These results suggest that dogs and cats, and veterinary professionals and pet owners, in the Yamagata prefecture have some risk of exposure to several TBDs. This means that there should be continuous monitoring and reporting of TBDs, even those known to be uncommon in Japan, in both companion animals and humans to ensure the health and safety of both humans and animals in Japan."

Five horses met the inclusion criteria of ocular disease with evidence of B burgdorferi present in ocular or CNS tissues. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and progression of ocular disease when associated with ocular or CNS B burgdorferi infection in horses. A retrospective review of medical records was performed on horses admitted for ocular disease with evidence of B burgdorferi infection between 1998 and 2015. The diagnosis of B burgdorferi-associated uveitis was based on histopathologic lesions of lymphohistiocytic and suppurative uveitis/endophthalmitis and intralesional argyrophilic spirochetes in either ocular or CNS tissue consistent with Borrelia. Leptospiral uveitis was ruled out by PCR. All five horses in the current study had intraocular inflammation at the time of presentation. Medical management with anti-inflammatories was successful in controlling uveitis in the two horses in which treatment of uveitis was attempted. Systemic treatment with oral tetracyclines was unsuccessful in a single case in which treatment of Borrelia was attempted. Four horses were euthanized due to progression of neurologic disease. The surviving horse had an enucleation performed and did not show systemic signs. Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi should be considered in endemic areas as a differential for horses with ocular disease, in particular, uveitis. The prognosis for uveitis and neurologic disease associated with Lyme disease was poor in the current study."

B. burgdorferi persisters, which are not killed by the current antibiotics for Lyme disease, are considered one possible cause. Disulfiram has shown to be active against B. burgdorferi, but its activity against persistent forms is not well characterized. We assessed disulfiram as single drug and in combinations against stationary-phase B. burgdorferi culture enriched with persisters. Disulfiram was not very effective in the drug exposure experiment (survival rate (SR) 46.3%) or in combinations. Clarithromycin (SR 41.1%) and nitroxoline (SR 37.5%) were equally effective when compared to the current Lyme antibiotic cefuroxime (SR 36.8%) and more active than disulfiram. Cefuroxime + clarithromycin (SR 25.9%) and cefuroxime + nitroxoline (SR 27.5%) were significantly more active than cefuroxime + disulfiram (SR 41.7%). When replacing disulfiram with clarithromycin or nitroxoline in three-drug combinations, bacterial viability decreased significantly and subculture studies showed that combinations with these two drugs (cefuroxime + clarithromycin/nitroxoline + furazolidone/nitazoxanide) inhibited the regrowth, while disulfiram combinations did not (cefuroxime + disulfiram + furazolidone/nitazoxanide). Thus, clarithromycin and nitroxoline should be further assessed to determine their role as potential treatment alternatives in the future."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases affecting humans and animals are on the rise worldwide. Vaccines constitute an effective control measure, but very few are available. We selected Lyme borreliosis, a bacterial infection transmitted by the hard tick Ixodes, to validate a new concept to identify vaccine candidates. This disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Although attempts to develop a vaccine exist, none have been successfully marketed. In tick-borne diseases, the skin constitutes a very specific environment encountered by the pathogen during its co-inoculation with tick saliva. In a mouse model, we developed a proteomic approach to identify vaccine candidates in skin biopsies. We identified 30 bacterial proteins after syringe inoculation or tick inoculation of bacteria. Discovery proteomics using mass spectrometry might be used in various tick-borne diseases to identify pathogen proteins with early skin expression. It should help to better develop sub-unit vaccines based on a cocktail of several antigens, associated with effective adjuvant and delivery systems of antigens. In all vector-borne diseases, the skin deserves further investigation to better define its role in the elaboration of protective immunity against pathogens."

		"abstract": "The first line therapy for Lyme disease is treatment with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime. In endemic regions, the persistence of symptoms in many patients after completion of antibiotic treatment remains a major healthcare concern. The causative agent of Lyme disease is a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, an extreme auxotroph that cannot exist under free-living conditions and depends upon the tick vector and mammalian hosts to fulfill its nutritional needs. Despite lacking all major biosynthetic pathways, B. burgdorferi uniquely possesses three homologous and functional methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidases (MTANs: Bgp, MtnN, and Pfs) involved in methionine and purine salvage, underscoring the critical role these enzymes play in the life cycle of the spirochete. At least one MTAN, Bgp, is exceptional in its presence on the surface of Lyme spirochetes and its dual functionality in nutrient salvage and glycosaminoglycan binding involved in host-cell adherence. Thus, MTANs offer highly promising targets for discovery of new antimicrobials. Here we report on our studies to evaluate five nucleoside analogs for MTAN inhibitory activity, and cytotoxic or cytostatic effects on a bioluminescently engineered strain of B. burgdorferi. All five compounds were either alternate substrates and/or inhibitors of MTAN activity, and reduced B. burgdorferi growth. Two inhibitors: 5'-deoxy-5'-iodoadenosine (IADO) and 5'-deoxy-5'-ethyl-immucillin A (dEt-ImmA) showed bactericidal activity. Thus, these inhibitors exhibit high promise and form the foundation for development of novel and effective antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has been recently shown to form biofilm structures in vitro and in vivo. Biofilms are tightly clustered microbes characterized as resistant aggregations that allow bacteria to withstand harsh environmental conditions, including the administration of antibiotics. Novel antibiotic combinations have recently been identified for B. burgdorferi in vitro, however, due to prohibiting costs, those agents have not been tested in an environment that can mimic the host tissue. Therefore, researchers cannot evaluate their true effectiveness against B. burgdorferi, especially its biofilm form. A skin ex vivo model system could be ideal for these types of experiments due to its cost effectiveness, reproducibility, and ability to investigate host-microbial interactions. Therefore, the main goal of this study was the establishment of a novel ex vivo murine skin biopsy model for B. burgdorferi biofilm research. Murine skin biopsies were inoculated with B. burgdorferi at various concentrations and cultured in different culture media. Two weeks post-infection, murine skin biopsies were analyzed utilizing immunohistochemical (IHC), reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), and various microscopy methods to determine B. burgdorferi presence and forms adopted as well as whether it remained live in the skin tissue explants. Our results showed that murine skin biopsies inoculated with 1 × 107 cells of B. burgdorferi and cultured in BSK-H + 6% rabbit serum media for two weeks yielded not just significant amounts of live B. burgdorferi spirochetes but biofilm forms as well. IHC combined with confocal and atomic force microscopy techniques identified specific biofilm markers and spatial distribution of B. burgdorferi aggregates in the infected skin tissues, confirming that they are indeed biofilms. In the future, this ex vivo skin model can be used to study development and antibiotic susceptibility of B. burgdorferi biofilms in efforts to treat Lyme disease effectively."

		"abstract": "Pathogens can manipulate the phenotypic traits of their hosts and vectors, maximizing their own fitness. Among the phenotypic traits that can be modified, manipulating vector behavior represents one of the most fascinating facets. How pathogens infection affects behavioral traits of key insect vectors has been extensively investigated. Major examples include Plasmodium, Leishmania and Trypanosoma spp. manipulating the behavior of mosquitoes, sand flies and kissing bugs, respectively. However, research on how pathogens can modify tick behavior is patchy. This review focuses on current knowledge about the behavioral changes triggered by Anaplasma, Borrelia, Babesia, Bartonella, Rickettsia and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in tick vectors, analyzing their potential adaptive significance. As a general trend, being infected by Borrelia and TBEV boosts tick mobility (both questing and walking activity). Borrelia and Anaplasma infection magnifies Ixodes desiccation resistance, triggering physiological changes (Borrelia: higher fat reserves; Anaplasma: synthesis of heat shock proteins). Anaplasma infection also improves cold resistance in infected ticks through synthesis of an antifreeze glycoprotein. Being infected by Anaplasma, Borrelia and Babesia leads to increased tick survival. Borrelia, Babesia and Bartonella infection facilitates blood engorgement. In the last section, current challenges for future studies are outlined."

		"abstract": "The cricetine rodent Peromyscus leucopus is an important reservoir for several human zoonoses, including Lyme disease, in North America. Akin to hamsters, the white-footed deermouse has been unevenly characterized in comparison to the murid Mus musculus. To further understanding of P. leucopus' total genomic content, we investigated gut microbiomes of an outbred colony of P. leucopus, inbred M. musculus, and a natural population of P. leucopus. Metagenome and whole genome sequencing were combined with microbiology and microscopy approaches. A focus was the genus Lactobacillus, four diverse species of which were isolated from forestomach and feces of colony P. leucopus. Three of the species-L. animalis, L. reuteri, and provisionally-named species \"L. peromysci\"-were identified in fecal metagenomes of wild P. leucopus but not discernibly in samples from M. musculus. L. johnsonii, the fourth species, was common in M. musculus but absent or sparse in wild P. leucopus. Also identified in both colony and natural populations were a Helicobacter sp. in feces but not stomach, and a Tritrichomonas sp. protozoan in cecum or feces. The gut metagenomes of colony P. leucopus were similar to those of colony M. musculus at the family or higher level and for major subsystems. But there were multiple differences between species and sexes within each species in their gut metagenomes at orthologous gene level. These findings provide a foundation for hypothesis-testing of functions of individual microbial species and for interventions, such as bait vaccines based on an autochthonous bacterium and targeting P. leucopus for transmission-blocking."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease and anaplasmosis are tick-borne bacterial diseases caused by Borreliella and Anaplasma species, respectively. A comprehensive analysis of the exposure of eastern coyotes (Canis latrans) in the northeastern United States to tick-borne pathogens has not been conducted. In this report, we assess the serological status of 128 eastern coyotes harvested in Pennsylvania in 2015 and 2017 for antibodies to Borreliella burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum Immunoblot and dot blot approaches were employed to test each plasma sample by using cell lysates and recombinant proteins as detection antigens. The results demonstrate high seropositivity incidences of 64.8% and 72.7% for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum, respectively. Antibodies to both pathogens were detected in 51.5% of the plasma samples, indicating high potential for coinfection. Antibodies to the B. burgdorferi proteins DbpB, VlsE, DbpA, BBA36, and OspF (BBO39) were detected in 67.2, 63.3, 56.2, 51.6, and 48.4% of the plasma samples, respectively. Antibodies to the A. phagocytophilum P44 and P130 proteins were detected in 72.7 and 60.9% of the plasma samples, respectively.IMPORTANCE The incidence of Lyme disease (Borreliella burgdorferi) and anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) are increasing in North America and Europe. The causative agents of these debilitating tick-transmitted infections are maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle involving Ixodes ticks and diverse mammals and birds. It has been postulated that predators directly or indirectly influence the dynamics of the enzootic cycle and disease incidence. Here, we demonstrate high seropositivity of eastern coyotes for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum As coyotes become established in urban and suburban environments, interactions with humans, companion animals, and urban/suburban wildlife will increase. Knowledge of the pathogens that these highly adaptable predators are exposed to or carry, and their potential to influence or participate in enzootic cycles, is central to efforts to reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases in humans and companion animals."

		"abstract": "Lyme arthritis was described in 1977, after an apparent outbreak of juvenile idiopathic arthritis in Lyme, Connecticut. The evolution of the disease has been meticulously described with presentation dependent on disease duration and previous therapy. Erythema migrans is typically the first manifestation. Untreated patients often develop early disseminated disease, characterized by migratory polyarthralgia, potentially with cardiac and/or neurologic sequelae. If untreated, most patients develop late Lyme arthritis, characterized as a monoarthritis or oligoarthritis, typically involving the knees. Serologies are strongly positive at this stage; if positive, Lyme PCR from synovial fluid confirms the diagnosis. Doxycycline is recommended for late Lyme arthritis, although amoxicillin or ceftriaxone may be considered.Initial antibiotic therapy for late Lyme arthritis is insufficient for a subset of patients. However, serologies and synovial fluid PCR are not useful at determining whether infection persists after oral therapy. As such, ceftriaxone is recommended in patients with inadequate response to doxycycline or amoxicillin.Approximately 10% of patients have persistent arthritis despite antimicrobial therapy, termed postinfectious Lyme arthritis, which is thought to be related to prolonged inflammation and unique microbial and host interaction. Therapy at this stage relies on immunosuppression and/or synovectomy. Lyme arthritis provides unique insights into the complex interplay between microbes and host immunity. The progression from localized erythema migrans to early disseminated disease and late Lyme arthritis allows insight into arthritis initiation, and the study of postinfectious Lyme arthritis allows further insight into mechanisms of arthritis persistence."

A female smoker in her fifties presented with dizziness due to a left cerebellar infarction, and after general stroke workup atherosclerosis was considered the probable cause. In the preceding months she had experienced nonspecific intermittent headache, neck pain and dizziness initially attributed to prior head trauma. Over the following months she presented with relapsing and additional symptoms from the posterior circulation and a new right cerebellar infarction was diagnosed. Contrast-enhanced MRI showed signs of myelitis and meningeal enhancement. CSF examination revealed leukocytes 230 · 106/L (0-4 · 106/L) with 98 % mononuclear cells, protein 3.12 g/L (0.00-0.45 g/L). Borrelia IgG and IgM antibodies were positive in serum and CSF, with ratio examinations consistent with intrathecal synthesis. She had a history of multiple tick bites, but not of erythema migrans. She had satisfactory clinical, biochemical and radiological response to antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone. Neuroborreliosis was considered the aetiology of her cerebellar infarctions although no definite signs of cerebral vasculitis were evident from CT angiography. Rare causes of stroke, including neuroborreliosis, should be considered in stroke patients without risk factors for cerebrovascular disease and negative primary workup, and in recurrent stroke despite secondary preventive treatment."

The heterogeneity in clinical manifestations of LB can be related to different causes, including the different strains of Borrelia, possible co-infection with other tick transmitted pathogens, and its interactions with the human host. This review aims at describing the heterogeneous symptoms of Lyme Borreliosis, as well as offering a practical approach for recognition of the disease, both in terms of clinical features and diagnostic/research tools."

Temporal studies of maternal antibody (Ab) profiles in Bb infected pregnant dogs and their pups have not been conducted. In this study, Ab profiles of a client-owned Bb C6 Ab positive Rottweiler and her nine pups were assessed. The dam presented with lameness 12 days prior to parturition and was C6 Ab positive with a Quant C6 Ab concentration of 237U/mL. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated and 11 days later nine pups were delivered. Screening of the sera from the dam and pups against Bb cell lysates and a panel of antigens revealed similar immunoreactivity profiles. While antigen-specific IgG and IgM reactivity persisted in the dam for at least 7 months, a rapid decline in IgG specific for BBA36, BBK53, BB0238, BBA73 and outer surface protein (Osp) E in the pups occurred between days 29 and 52 post-parturition. In contrast, Ab specific for DbpA and the diagnostic antigens VlsE (C6) and OspF, remained elevated in the pups. Sera from the dam displayed potent complement-dependent bactericidal activity against Bb. Sera from the pups was also bactericidal but primarily through a complement-independent mechanism. Lastly, single dose vaccination of the dam at day 51 post-parturition with a LD subunit vaccine consisting of OspA and an OspC chimeritope triggered a broad anti-OspC Ab response indicative of an anamnestic response. Although this study focused on a single case, these findings add to our knowledge of maternal Ab profiles and will aid the interpretation of serological assays in pups delivered by a Bb C6 Ab positive dog."

		"abstract": "An increased risk for glomerulonephritis and a higher prevalence of antibodies to Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato have been reported in Bernese mountain dogs (BMDs). The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of laboratory abnormalities suggestive of kidney disease in clinically healthy BMDs compared to a control population and to investigate if there is a correlation with the occurrence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, Ehrlichia canis, and Anaplasma (A.) spp. and with the occurrence of Dirofilaria (D.) immitis antigen. A total of 197 BMDs and 57 control dogs were included in the study. Laboratory evidence of kidney disease was defined as renal azotemia and/or proteinuria with a urine protein creatinine ration of more than 0.5 in an inactive urine sediment. A SNAP®4Dx® ELISA (IDEXX, Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME, USA) was used to detect antibodies to B. burgdorferi sensu lato, E. canis and Anaplasma spp. and antigen of D. immitis. Laboratory evidence of kidney disease was significantly more common in BMDs than in control dogs (17.8% versus 1.8%) (p = 0.005). The proportion of BMDs with anti-B. burgdorferi sensu latu antibodies and anti-A. phagocytophilum antibodies was significantly higher in BMDs (p <  0.001). However, an association between these findings could not be identified. BMDs are more often affected by kidney disease and have a higher prevalence of antibodies to bacterial pathogens transmitted by Ixodes ticks than control dogs. However, a causal relationship between these two variables could not be established due to a lack of association between these two findings."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in North America. The etiological agent is the spirochete Borreliella burgdorferi, transmitted to mammalian hosts by the Ixodes tick. In recent years there has been an increase in the number of cases of Lyme disease. Currently, there is no vaccine on the market for human use. We describe the development of a novel synthetically engineered DNA vaccine, pLD1 targeting the outer-surface protein A (OspA) of Borreliella burgdorferi. Immunization of C3 H/HeN mice with pLD1 elicits robust humoral and cellular immune responses that confer complete protection against a live Borreliella burgdorferi bacterial challenge. We also assessed intradermal (ID) delivery of pLD1 in Hartley guinea pigs, demonstrating the induction of robust and durable humoral immunity that lasts at least 1 year. We provide evidence of the potency of pLD1 by showing that antibodies targeting the OspA epitopes which have been associated with protection are prominently raised in the immunized guinea pigs. The described study provides the basis for the advancement of pDL1 as a potential vaccine for Lyme disease control."

		"abstract": "The symptoms of Lyme disease are caused by inflammation induced by species of the Borrelia burgdorferisensu lato complex. The various presentations of Lyme disease in the population suggest that differences exist in the intensity and regulation of the host response to the spirochete. Previous work has described correlations between the presence of regulatory T cells and recovery from Lyme arthritis. However, the effects of Foxp3-expressing CD4+ T cells existing prior to, and during, B. burgdorferi infection have not been well characterized. Here, we used C57BL/6 \"depletion of regulatory T cell\" mice to assess the effects these cells have on the arthritis-resistant phenotype characteristic of this mouse strain. We showed that depletion of regulatory T cells prior to infection with B. burgdorferi resulted in sustained swelling, as well as histopathological changes, of the tibiotarsal joints that were not observed in infected control mice. Additionally, in vitro stimulation of splenocytes from these regulatory T cell-depleted mice resulted in increases in gamma interferon and interleukin-17 production and decreases in interleukin-10 production that were not evident among splenocytes of infected mice in which Treg cells were not depleted. Depletion of regulatory T cells at various times after infection also induced rapid joint swelling. Collectively, these findings provide evidence that regulatory T cells existing at the time of, and possibly after, B. burgdorferi infection may play an important role in limiting the development of arthritis."

		"abstract": "To predict the risk of tick-borne disease, it is critical to understand the ecological factors that determine the abundance of ticks. In Europe, the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) transmits a number of important diseases including Lyme borreliosis. The aim of this long-term study was to determine the abiotic and biotic factors driving the annual abundance of I. ricinus at a location in Switzerland where Lyme borreliosis is endemic. Over a 15-year period (2004 to 2018), we monitored the abundance of I. ricinus ticks on a monthly basis at three different elevations on Chaumont Mountain in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. We collected climate variables in the field and from nearby weather stations. We obtained data on beech tree seed production from the literature, as the abundance of Ixodes nymphs can increase dramatically two years after a masting event. We used AIC-based model selection to determine which ecological variables drive annual variation in tick density. We found that elevation site, year, seed production by beech trees two years prior, and mean annual relative humidity together explained 73.2% of the variation in our annual estimates of nymph density. According to the parameter estimates of our models, (i) the annual density of nymphs almost doubled over the 15-year study period, (ii) changing the beech tree seed production index from very poor mast (1) to full mast (5) increased the abundance of nymphs by 86.2% two years later, and (iii) increasing the field-collected mean annual relative humidity from 50.0 to 75.0% decreased the abundance of nymphs by 46.4% in the same year. Climate variables collected in the field were better predictors of tick abundance than those from nearby weather stations indicating the importance of the microhabitat. From a public health perspective, the increase in nymph abundance is likely to have increased the risk of tick-borne disease in this region of Switzerland. Public health officials in Europe should be aware that seed production by deciduous trees is a critical driver of the abundance of I. ricinus, and hence the risk of tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "Ticks display a distinct type of host-seeking behaviour called questing. It has been proposed that the questing behaviour of Ixodes scapularis explains the geographic variation in Lyme disease (LD) risk in the eastern USA because the northern population has been shown to quest more often than the southern population. The height at which questing occurs is variable and this study aimed to characterize questing height for I. scapularis. Ticks were collected from a northern and southern state (i.e. Maryland and Texas) and bioassays were conducted. We report that nymphs from Texas quested at lower heights compared to nymphs from Maryland. In addition, only Texas nymphs exhibited a behaviour we call 'hiding behaviour'. These results may reflect the different composition of hosts between these two areas as the south has a higher abundance of lizards. In contrast, there was no significant difference in questing height between Maryland adults and Texas adults which was to be expected since adults are feeding on white-tailed deer in both locations. If all southern I. scapularis nymphs are questing at lower heights, this might make them less likely to come into contact with humans and this may be contributing to the geographical difference in LD prevalence."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi s.s. is a Gram-negative spirochaete, the aetiological agent of Lyme disease, the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere. Reports on the presence of B. burgdorferi in central Mexico have been strongly criticized, since these were based only on unspecific serological methods. Furthermore, the worldwide genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi s.s. has not been evaluated. For this reason, the aim of the present study was to confirm the presence of B. burgdorferi in the central area of Mexico and to evaluate its relationship with regard to the global genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi s.s. To achieve this, fragments of the flagellin and the outer surface protein A genes were amplified from ear biopsies of the arboreal wild endemic mice Habromys schmidlyi. With these sequences, a concatenated Bayesian analysis was performed to confirm the identity of B. burgdorferi s.s. Afterwards, the global genetic diversity of this bacterial species was evaluated using our sequences and those available in GenBank. A prevalence of 10.4% (5/48) of H. schmidlyi infected with Borrelia sp. was detected, and the phylogenetic analyses confirmed the identity of B. burgdorferi s.s. Using both genes, the genetic diversity was low. However, genetic structuring analyses revealed that populations of western United States and those from Mexico formed slightly different genetic groups, separated from the populations of the rest of the world. Our study not only confirms the presence of this bacterium in central Mexico, but also shows the most southern record of this bacterium so far. It also highlights the importance of H. schmidlyi as a new potential host of this bacterial species. Our study also provides first genetic data on an incipient process of divergence in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations of eastern United States and central Mexico."

		"abstract": "Borreliosis (Lyme disease) is a spirochetal disease caused by the species complex of Borrelia burgdorferi transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks. Recorded to be the most common tick-borne disease in the world, the last two decades have seen an increase in disease incidence and distribution, exceeding 360 000 cases in Europe alone. If untreated, infection may cause skin symptoms, arthritis, and neurological or cardiac complications. Borrelia spirochetes have developed strategies to evade the mammalian host immune system. These include the complement system, which is an important first-line defense mechanism against invading microbes. To evade the complement, spirochetes bind soluble complement regulators factor H (FH), factor H-like protein, and C4bp to their outer surfaces. B. burgdorferi spirochetes can inhibit the classical pathway of complement by the outer surface protein (Osp) BBK32, which blocks the activation of the C1 complex, composed of C1q, C1r, and C1s. The FH-binding proteins of borreliae include Osps OspE, CspA, and CspZ. Following repeated infections, antibodies against these proteins develop and may provide functional immunity against borreliosis. This review discusses critical immune evasion strategies, focusing on complement evasion by borreliae."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of vector-borne infections caused by Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma spp. and Leishmania infantum in a dog kennel in Argeș County, Romania. Dog kennels are shelters for stray dogs with no officially registered owners that are gathered to be neutered and/or boarded for national/international adoptions by various public or private organizations. The international dog adoptions might represent a risk in the transmission of pathogens into new regions. In this context, a total number of 149 blood samples and 149 conjunctival swabs from asymptomatic kennel dogs were assessed using serology and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. were detected in one dog (0.6%), anti-Anaplasma antibodies were found in five dogs (3.3%), while ten dogs (6.7%) tested positive for D. immitis antigen. Overall, 20.1% (30/149) of dogs were positive for L. infantum DNA. All samples were seronegative for anti-Leishmania antibodies. When adopting dogs from this region of Romania, owners should be aware of possible infection with especially L. infantum. The travel of infected dogs may introduce the infection to areas where leishmaniasis is not present."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the USA with cases continuing to increase. Current control measures have not been shown to be impactful, and therefore alternatives are needed. Treating pathogen reservoirs with low dose systemic acaricides in endemic areas may provide a useful tool for disrupting the cycle of the vector and pathogen. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of a 0.005% fipronil bait, presented orally to white-footed mice, in controlling blacklegged tick larvae (larvae). Sixty mice were assigned to 3 treatment groups and three untreated control groups. All individually housed mice in treatment groups were exposed to 0.005% fipronil bait for 48 hours. Larvae were manually applied to mice within feeding capsules at one of three timepoints: Day 1, Day 9 and Day 15 post-exposure. For 4-days post-tick attachment, replete larvae were collected from water moats underneath each cage and attached larvae were observed by microscopy. Plasma from 4 treated mice at Day-1, Day 13 and Day 19, and 4 control mice (n = 16) was collected to obtain fipronil plasma concentrations (CP). Fipronil bait did not appear to produce neophobia in mice, as the amount of bait eaten at 24- and 48-hours exposure did not differ significantly. The 48-hour fipronil bait exposure prevented 100% of larvae from feeding to repletion at Day 1, Day 9 and Day 15 post-treatment. Within the treatment groups, all larvae observable within the capsules expired and were prevented from detaching by Day 4. In contrast, within the control groups a total of 502 replete larvae were collected from moats and 348 larvae observable within the capsules successfully detached. CP averaged 948.9, 101.2 and 79.4 ng/ml for mice euthanized at Day 1, Day 9 and Day 15, respectively. No fipronil was detected in control mice. We provide early indication that low dose fipronil bait, orally presented to white-footed mice, can effectively control blacklegged tick larvae. Future research should modify the exposure duration and post-exposure tick attachment timepoints to simulate various field scenarios under which successful efficacy might be obtained. Low dose fipronil bait could provide a cost-effective, practical means of controlling blacklegged ticks and other arthropod vectors."

		"abstract": "Because ixodid ticks are vectors of zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia, information of their abundance, seasonal variation in questing behaviour and pathogen prevalence is important for human health. As ticks are invading new areas northwards, information from these new areas are needed. Taiga tick (Ixodes persulcatus) populations have been recently found at Bothnian Bay, Finland. We assessed seasonal variation in questing abundance of ticks and their pathogen prevalence in coastal deciduous forests near the city of Oulu (latitudes 64-65°) in 2019. We sampled ticks from May until September by cloth dragging 100 meters once a month at eight study sites. We calculated a density index (individuals/100 m2) to assess seasonal variation. Samples were screened for Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato) (including B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi (sensu stricto) and B. valaisana), Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp., Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Francisella tularensis and Bartonella spp., Babesia spp. and for the tick-borne encephalitis virus. All except one nymph were identified as I. persulcatus. The number of questing adults showed a strong peak in May (median: 6.5 adults/100 m2), which is among the highest values reported in northern Europe, and potentially indicates a large population size. After May, the number of questing adults declined steadily with few adults still sampled in August. Nymphs were present from May until September. We found a striking prevalence of Borrelia spp. in adults (62%) and nymphs (40%), with B. garinii (51%) and B. afzelii (63%) being the most common species. In addition, we found that 26% of infected adults were coinfected with at least two Borrelia genospecies, mainly B. garinii and B. afzelii, which are associated with different host species. The coastal forest environments at Bothnian Bay seem to provide favourable environments for I. persulcatus and the spread of Borrelia. High tick abundance, a low diversity of the host community and similar host use among larvae and nymphs likely explain the high Borrelia prevalence and coinfection rate. Research on the infestation of the hosts that quantifies the temporal dynamics of immature life stages would reveal important aspects of pathogen circulation in these tick populations."

		"abstract": "Due to the specific plateau climate, a variety of unique animals live in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Area (QTPA) including yaks (Bos grunniens), Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries) and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus). However, information on tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in the QTPA and on the molecular characteristics of tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) in the area is limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Rickettsia spp. infecting yaks, Tibetan sheep and camels in this area. A total of 276 animals were screened. Overall, 84.5% (164/194) of yaks, 58% (23/40) of Tibetan sheep, and 38% (16/42) of camels tested positive for at least one pathogen. Theileria spp., Anaplasma ovis and spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. were detected as TBPs in the current study with overall infection rates of 10.9% (30/276), 8.3% (23/276) and 62.9% (171/276), respectively. Further study revealed that 1.5% (3/194) of the yaks were infected with Theileria sp. OT3, 1.5% (3/194) with T. luwenshuni, 6.2% (12/194) with T. uilenbergi, 1.1% (2/194) with T. ovis and 82% (159/194) with SFG Rickettsia spp. It was also shown that 58% (23/40) of the Tibetan sheep were infected with A. ovis and 15% (6/40) with T. ovis. Among the camels, 10% (4/42) were infected with T. equi, while 29% (12/42) were positive for Rickettsia spp. Sequence analysis revealed that the Rickettsia spp. infecting yaks and camels were Rickettsia raoultii and Rickettsia slovaca. To the best of our knowledge, this study reports the first detection and characterization of these pathogens in yaks, Tibetan sheep and camels in the country, except for T. luwenshuni infections in yaks."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is a tick-borne pathogen that causes Borrelia miyamotoi disease (BMD), an emerging infectious disease of increasing public health significance. B. miyamotoi is transmitted by the same tick vector (Ixodes spp.) as B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), the causative agent of Lyme disease, therefore laboratory assays to differentiate BMD from Lyme disease are needed to avoid misdiagnoses and for disease confirmation. We previously performed a global immunoproteomic analysis of the murine host antibody response against B. miyamotoi infection to discover antigens that could serologically distinguish the two infections. An initial assessment identified a putative lipoprotein antigen, here termed BmaA, as a promising candidate to augment current research-based serological assays. In this study, we show that BmaA is an outer surface-associated protein by its susceptibility to protease digestion. Synthesis of BmaA in culture was independent of temperature at either 23 °C or 34 °C. The BmaA gene is present in two identical loci harbored on separate plasmids in North American strains LB-2001 and CT13-2396. bmaA-like sequences are present in other B. miyamotoi strains and relapsing fever borrelia as multicopy genes and as paralogous or orthologous gene families. IgM and IgG antibodies in pooled serum from BMD patients reacted with native BmaA fractionated by 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by mass spectrometry. IgG against recombinant BmaA was detected in 4 of 5 BMD patient serum samples as compared with 1 of 23 serum samples collected from patients with various stages of Lyme disease. Human anti-B. turicatae serum did not seroreact with recombinant BmaA suggesting a role as a species-specific diagnostic antigen. These results demonstrated that BmaA elicits a human host antibody response during B. miyamotoi infection but not in a tested group of B. burgdorferi-infected Lyme disease patients, thereby providing a potentially useful addition for developing BMD serodiagnostic tests."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is an inflammatory multistage infection, consisting of localized, disseminated, and persistent disease stages, impacting several organ systems through poorly defined gene regulation mechanisms. The purpose of this study is to further characterize the spatiotemporal transcriptional regulation of B. burgdorferi during mammalian infection of borrelial oxidative stress regulator (bosR) and decorin binding protein (dbpBA) by utilizing bioluminescent B. burgdorferi reporter strains and in vivo imaging. Fluctuating borrelial load was also monitored and used for normalization to evaluate expression levels. bosR transcription is driven by two promoters, Pbb0648 and PbosR, and we focused on the native promoter. bosR expression is low relative to the robustly expressed dbpBA throughout infection. In distal tissues, bosR was the highest in the heart during in the first week whereas dbpBA was readily detectable at all time points with each tissue displaying a distinct expression pattern. This data suggests bosR may have a role in heart colonization and the induction of dbpBA indicates a RpoS independent transcriptional regulation occurring in the mammalian cycle of pathogenesis. These finding demonstrate that B. burgdorferi engages unknown genetic mechanisms to uniquely respond to mammalian tissue environments and/or changing host response over time."

We used existing metagenomic data from I. scapularis to determine the phylogeny of this tick-associated nematode and employed quantitative PCR to determine if the presence of this agent had an effect on the burden of Borrelia burgdorferi. We also developed a Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System assay using the Av33 antigen as a target to investigate the presence of antibodies against this nematode in 128 serum specimens from patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis. To demonstrate assay utility, we used 15 sera from patients with onchocerciasis as controls. We show that this agent is a new species in the genus Monanema and its presence in vector ticks does not impact the burden of B. burgdorferi. We did not detect IgG antibodies to this agent in 127 of 128 sera from patients with Lyme disease or babesiosis. One sample had reactivity above the threshold, but at the low-level equivalent to the least reactive onchocerciasis sera. This low positive signal could be a result of cross-reacting antibodies, antibodies from a previous infection with a filarial nematode, or, less likely, a exposure to the Ixodes scapularis-associated nematode. We found no evidence that this nematode contributes to the spectrum of human tick-borne infections."

The results were compared with headspace gas chromatography carried out in parallel. This technique was also applied to investigate the efficacy of chemical antibiotics and of natural compounds with antimicrobial properties. Antibiotics added to the sample cultures are apparently effective if the emission of hydrogen is suppressed, or if not, are either ineffective or the related bacteria are even resistant. The sensor approach was applied to prove bacterial contamination in food, animals, medical specimens and in ticks infected by Borrelia bacteria and their transfer to humans, thus causing Lyme disease. It is a unique advantage that the progress of an antibiotic therapy can be examined until the emission of hydrogen is finished. The described technique cannot identify the related bacteria but enables bacterial contamination by hydrogen emitting anaerobes to be recognized. The samples are incubated with the proper culture broth in closed septum vials which remain closed during the whole process. The personnel in the lab never come into contact with pathogens and thus safety regulations are guaranteed."

		"abstract": "Dementia is a clinical syndrome commonly encountered in clinical practice. Early onset cognitive impairment is always of particular concern and warrants further workup for diagnostic clarity, potentially reversible causes, and prognosis. Unfortunately, although there is increasing knowledge of certain patterns of early onset neurodegenerative disorders, such as early onset Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia, more atypical cases exist that do not fit these molds. Here, the case is presented of a 67-year-old man who first developed cognitive impairment at age 47 years. He also had a history of hyperlipidemia, hypogonadism, Lyme disease, anxiety, and attention-deficit disorder. He developed executive function deficits, impaired concentration, apathy, and gait disturbance, which led to loss of job, reduction in household responsibilities, and social isolation. He underwent extensive neuropsychiatric workup and several treatment attempts (for Lyme disease and attention-deficit disorder) over the subsequent 20 years; however, he had progressive indolent neurocognitive decline. This workup ruled out known causes of neurodegeneration but was consistent with early onset atypical parkinsonism with dementia of unspecified etiology. This case demonstrates the course of an early onset dementia that, despite exhaustive medical workup, remains diagnostically unclear. This scenario is common across medical specialties, although not often written about. This article synthesizes the individual approaches of neurologists, psychiatrists, radiologists, infectious disease specialists, and psychologists when presented with the same case and the effective multidisciplinary integration of these efforts even when the exact diagnosis remains unknown."

		"abstract": "The causative agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, requires shifts in gene expression to undergo its natural enzootic cycle between tick and vertebrate hosts. mRNA decay mechanisms play significant roles in governing gene expression in other bacteria, but are not yet characterized in B. burgdorferi. RNase III is an important enzyme in processing ribosomal RNA, but it also plays a role in mRNA decay in many bacteria. We compared RNA decay profiles and steady-state abundances of transcripts in wild-type Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 and in an RNase III null (rnc-) mutant. Transcripts encoding RNA polymerase subunits (rpoA and rpoS), ribosomal proteins (rpsD, rpsK, rpsM, rplQ, and rpsO), a nuclease (pnp), a flagellar protein (flaB), and a translational regulator (bpuR) decayed more rapidly in the wild-type strain than in the slow growing rnc- mutant indicating that RNA turnover is mediated by RNase III in the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Additionally, in wild type bacteria, RNA decay rates of rpoS, rpoN, ospA, ospC, bpuR and dbpA transcripts are only modestly affected by changes in the osmolarity."

		"abstract": "Schoolyards and suburban parks are two environments where active tick surveillance may inform local management approaches. Even in a state such as New York with a robust active tick surveillance programme operated by the state Department of Health, these settings are not routinely covered. The goal of this study was to highlight the importance of active surveillance for tick-borne pathogens by describing their prevalence in ticks collected from schoolyards and suburban parks and to guide the use of integrated pest management in these settings. Tick dragging was performed in three regions of New York State: Long Island, the Lower Hudson Valley and the Capital Region. A total of 19 schoolyards and 32 parks were sampled. The location, habitat and weather at the time of tick collection were recorded. Ticks were speciated and tested for the presence of 17 pathogens with a novel application of nanoscale real-time PCR. The causative agents of Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, babesiosis and Powassan virus disease were all detected from Ixodes scapularis in various sites throughout the capital region and south-eastern counties of New York state. The most common agent detected was Borrelia burgdorferi, and coinfection rates were as high as 36%. This surveillance study also captured the first of the invasive Asian longhorned tick species, Haemaphysalis longicornis, in New York state (collected 2 June 2017). Results from this study highlight the importance of collaborative efforts and data sharing for improvement of surveillance for tick-borne disease agents."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a well-recognized public health problem in the USA, however, other tick-borne diseases also have major public health impacts. Yet, limited research has evaluated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases within endemic regions. Using laboratory data from a large healthcare system in north-central Wisconsin from 2000-2016, we applied a Kulldorf's scan statistic to analyze spatial, temporal and seasonal clusters of laboratory-positive cases of human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA), babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis at the county level. Older males were identified as the subpopulation at greatest risk for non-Lyme tick-borne diseases and we observed a statistically significant spatial and temporal clustering of cases (p < 0.05). HGA risk shifted from west to east over time (2000-2016) with a relative risk (RR) ranging from 3.30 to 11.85, whereas babesiosis risk shifted from south to north and west over time (2004-2016) with an RR ranging from 4.33 to 4.81. Our study highlights the occurrence of non-Lyme tick-borne diseases, and identifies at-risk subpopulations and shifting spatial and temporal heterogeneities in disease risk. Our findings can be used by healthcare providers and public health practitioners to increase public awareness and improve case detection."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are of substantial concern worldwide in both humans and animals. Several hard tick species are of medical and veterinary interest in Europe, and changes in the range of tick species can affect the spread of zoonotic pathogens. The aim of the present study was to map the current prevalence and distribution pattern of ticks and related tick-borne pathogens in Latvia, a Baltic state in northern Europe. Nearly 4600 Ixodes ricinus, I. persulcatus and Dermacentor reticulatus tick samples were collected in all regions of Latvia during 2017-2019 and were screened by molecular methods to reveal the prevalence and distribution pattern of a wide spectrum of tick-borne pathogens. New localities of D. reticulatus occurrence were found in western and central Latvia, including the Riga region, indicating that the northern border of D. reticulatus in Europe has moved farther to the north. Among the analyzed ticks, 33.42% carried at least one tick-borne pathogen, and 5.55% of tick samples were positive for two or three pathogens. A higher overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens was observed in I. ricinus (34.92%) and I. persulcatus (31.65%) than in D. reticulatus (24.2%). The molecular analysis revealed the presence of tick-borne encephalitis virus, Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Rickettsia spp. Overall, 15 and 7 tick-borne pathogen species were detected in Ixodes spp. and D. reticulatus ticks, respectively. This is the first report of Borrelia miyamotoi in Latvian field-collected ticks. This large-scale countrywide study provides a snapshot of the current distribution patterns of Ixodes and Dermacentor ticks in Latvia and gives us a reliable overview of tick-borne pathogens in Latvian field-collected ticks."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease and is transmitted to vertebrate hosts by Ixodes spp. ticks. The spirochaete relies heavily on its arthropod host for basic metabolic functions and has developed complex interactions with ticks to successfully colonize, persist and, at the optimal time, exit the tick. For example, proteins shield spirochaetes from immune factors in the bloodmeal and facilitate the transition between vertebrate and arthropod environments. On infection, B. burgdorferi induces selected tick proteins that modulate the vector gut microbiota towards an environment that favours colonization by the spirochaete. Additionally, the recent sequencing of the Ixodes scapularis genome and characterization of tick immune defence pathways, such as the JAK-STAT, immune deficiency and cross-species interferon-γ pathways, have advanced our understanding of factors that are important for B. burgdorferi persistence in the tick. In this Review, we summarize interactions between B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis during infection, as well as interactions with tick gut and salivary gland proteins important for establishing infection and transmission to the vertebrate host."

		"abstract": "Global environmental change is having profound effects on the ecology of infectious disease systems, which are widely anticipated to become more pronounced under future climate and land use change. Arthropod vectors of disease are particularly sensitive to changes in abiotic conditions such as temperature and moisture availability. Recent research has focused on shifting environmental suitability for, and geographic distribution of, vector species under projected climate change scenarios. However, shifts in seasonal activity patterns, or phenology, may also have dramatic consequences for human exposure risk, local vector abundance and pathogen transmission dynamics. Moreover, changes in land use are likely to alter human-vector contact rates in ways that models of changing climate suitability are unlikely to capture. Here we used climate and land use projections for California coupled with seasonal species distribution models to explore the response of the western blacklegged tick (Ixodes pacificus), the primary Lyme disease vector in western North America, to projected climate and land use change. Specifically, we investigated how environmental suitability for tick host-seeking changes seasonally, how the magnitude and direction of changing seasonal suitability differs regionally across California, and how land use change shifts human tick-encounter risk across the state. We found vector responses to changing climate and land use vary regionally within California under different future scenarios. Under a hotter, drier scenario and more extreme land use change, the duration and extent of seasonal host-seeking activity increases in northern California, but declines in the south. In contrast, under a hotter, wetter scenario seasonal host-seeking declines in northern California, but increases in the south. Notably, regardless of future scenario, projected increases in developed land adjacent to current human population centers substantially increase potential human-vector encounter risk across the state. These results highlight regional variability and potential nonlinearity in the response of disease vectors to environmental change."

Included studies were described and categorized based on costs consistent with best practices used in economic evaluation. The most frequent costs identified focused on formal health costs and productivity losses were the most common costs identified outside of the health system. Travel and informal care costs were less frequently reported.

We hypothesize that during infection Borrelia burgdorferi will induce an immune response conducive to the chemotaxis of immune cells and subsequently lead to a pro-inflammatory state with the CNS parenchyma. Primary human choroid plexus epithelial cells were grown in culture and infected with B. burgdorferi strain B31 MI-16 for 48 hours. RNA was isolated and used for RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR validation. Secreted proteins in the supernatant were analyzed via ELISA. Transcriptome analysis based on RNA sequencing determined a total of 160 upregulated genes and 98 downregulated genes. Pathway and biological process analysis determined a significant upregulation in immune and inflammatory genes specifically in chemokine and interferon related pathways. Further analysis revealed downregulation in genes related to cell to cell junctions including tight and adherens junctions. These results were validated via RT-qPCR. Protein analysis of secreted factors showed an increase in inflammatory chemokines, corresponding to our transcriptome analysis. These data further demonstrate the role of the CP in the modulation of the immune response in a disease state and give insight into the mechanisms by which Borrelia burgdorferi may disseminate into, and act upon, the CNS. Future experiments aim to detail the impact of B. burgdorferi on the blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB) integrity and inflammatory response within animal models."

		"abstract": "Clinical coding is an integral part of primary care. Disease incidence studies based on primary care electronic health records (EHRs) rely on the accuracy of these codes. Current code validation methods are not appropriate for non-specific conditions and provide limited information about GPs' decision-making behaviour around coding. Qualitative methods could offer insight into decision-making behaviour around coding of patients with non-specific conditions. To investigate the decision-making behaviour of GPs when applying Read codes to non-specific clinical presentations, using Lyme disease as a case example. A pilot study was undertaken, involving masked semi-structured interviews of eight GPs in the North West of England. Semi-structured interviews were carried out based on 11 clinical cases representative of Lyme disease presentations. Discrete answers were described descriptively. Interview transcripts were analysed using a thematic approach. Themes underpinning GPs' coding behaviour included: GP personal and professional experience; clinical evidence; diagnostic uncertainty; professional integrity and defensive practice; and patient-sourced health information and beliefs. GPs placed Lyme disease on their differential diagnosis list for five cases; in only two cases would GPs select a Lyme disease related Read code. GPs were reluctant to code with specific diagnostic Read codes when they were presented with patients with vague or unfamiliar symptomology. This masked questionnaire methodology offers a new approach to validate incidence figures, based on Read codes of non-specific conditions. The reluctance to code poses many problems for primary care EHRs research. Further research is needed to understand what drives GPs' coding behaviour."

The current study assesses the sensitivity and specificity of various algorithms of MTTT in European patients with erythema migrans (EM) as a model disease for early Lyme borreliosis, and in appropriate controls. Four different immunoassays were used in the first tier, followed by either an immunoblot or the C6-EIA, or were used as standalone single-tier test. These tests were performed on consecutively collected sera of 228 Dutch patients with physician-diagnosed EM in the setting of general practice, 231 controls from the general population, and 50 controls with potentially cross-reactive antibodies. All the variants of MTTT that were studied had significantly higher sensitivity compared with their equivalent STTT, while retaining comparable specificity. Within the MTTT algorithms, classifying equivocal results as positive yielded better diagnostic parameters than classifying equivocal results as negative. The best diagnostic parameters were found using the Enzygnost-2 assay in the first tier, followed by a C6-ELISA in the second tier (sensitivity 77.6%, 95% CI 71.7-82.9; specificity 96.1%, 95% CI 92.7-98.2). This algorithm performed significantly better than the equivalent STTT algorithm in terms of sensitivity (p < 0.001), while maintaining comparable specificity (population controls p = 0.617). Our results show that MTTT can be a useful tool for the serodiagnosis of European patients with early Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia genus contains two major clades, the Lyme borreliosis group, which includes the causative agents of Lyme disease/borreliosis (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and other related B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies), and the relapsing fever borreliosis group (B. hermsii, B. turicatae, and B. parkeri). Other unclassified reptile- and echidna-associated Borrelia spp. (i.e., B. turcica and 'Candidatus Borrelia tachyglossi', respectively) do not belong in either of these two groups. In North America, Borrelia spp. from both of the major clades are important pathogens of veterinary and public health concern. Lyme disease is of particular interest because the incidence in the northeastern United States continues to increase in both dogs and humans. Birds have a potentially important role in the ecology of Borrelia species because they are hosts for numerous tick vectors and competent hosts for various Borrelia spp. Our goal was to investigate the prevalence of Borrelia spp. in four free-living species of upland game birds in Pennsylvania, USA including wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), and American woodcock (Scolopax minor). We tested 205 tissue samples (bone marrow and/or spleen samples) from 169 individuals for Borrelia using a flagellin gene (flab) nested PCR, which amplifies all Borrelia species. We detected Borrelia DNA in 12% (24/205) of samples, the highest prevalence was in wild turkeys (16%; 5/31), followed by ruffed grouse (13%; 16/126) and American woodcock (3%; 1/35). All pheasants (n = 13) were negative. We sequenced amplicons from all positive game birds and all were B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Our results support previous work indicating that certain species of upland game birds are commonly infected with Borrelia species, but unlike previous studies, we did not find any relapsing fever borreliae."

Laboratory workup showed severe hyperbilirubinemia and elevated serum creatinine, and the rest of the serum chemistry was unremarkable. The ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was normal. The patient had a recent history of travel to an endemic area for Lyme disease. After an extensive workup, all other possible etiologies had been ruled out, and the patient was started on empirical doxycycline by considering the patient's recent history of travel. Serum serologic test confirmed Lyme disease. His bilirubin and creatinine improved gradually. His fever subsided in three days, and he was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Although hyperbilirubinemia is rare in Lyme disease, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with severe jaundice and a recent history of travel."

		"abstract": "Population-level surveys for Dirofilaria immitis in wild canids typically rely on identification of the parasite at necropsy. More recently, some studies have employed the use of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test. However, since the assay was designed for use with domestic dogs it needs to be validated for use with wild canids for accurate interpretation of results. We therefore evaluated the performance of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test for detection of D. immitis in wild canids in southern Ontario. Overall, 199 wild canid carcasses were collected from across the region and assessed for the presence of D. immitis parasites at necropsy; ten were infected. Lung tissue extract (LE) and thoracic fluid filter paper extract (TFE) prepared from each wild canid were tested via the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test, which simultaneously tests for the presence of D. immitis antigen and antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., and Ehrlichia spp. The prevalence adjusted bias adjusted kappa (PABAK) and Gwet's first-order-agreement coefficient (AC1) were used to assess the level of agreement between sample pairs. The PABAK and AC1 between LF and TFE applied to the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test and the necropsy-confirmed D. immitis status indicated a very high level of agreement for all sample pairs. Compared to necropsy-confirmed D. immitis status, the estimated sensitivity and specificity of the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test for D. immitis antigen in LE was 80 % (95 % CI 44.4-97.5%) and 98.9 % (95 % CI 96.2-99.9%), respectively. For the TFE, the sensitivity was 70 % (95 % CI 34.8-93.3%) and the specificity was 97.9 % (95 % CI 94.7-99.4%). With respect to the tick-borne pathogen components, 1.5 % (3/199; 95 % CI 0.3-4.5%) of wild canids tested positive for B. burgdorferi antibody; 1.0 % (2/199; 95 % CI 0-3.8%) of LE samples were positive and 0.5 % (1/199; 95 % CI 0-3.1%) of TFE samples were positive. No samples tested positive for antibody to Anaplasma spp. (95 % CI 0-2.3%) or Ehrlichia spp. (95 % CI 0-2.3%). Collectively, the results suggest that the SNAP® 4Dx® Plus test may be a suitable test for use with LE and TFE for the detection of D. immitis antigen in wild canids from southern Ontario."

While loss of humoral tolerance has been associated with microbial infections, the pathways involved in balancing protective versus autoreactive antibody responses in humans are incompletely understood. Studies in classical mouse model systems have provided evidence that balancing of immune responses through inhibitory receptors is an important quality control checkpoint. Genetic differences between inbred mouse models and the outbred human population and allelic receptor variants not present in mice; however, argue for caution when directly translating these findings to the human system. By studying Borrelia burgdorferi infection in humanized mice reconstituted with human hematopoietic stem cells from donors homozygous for a functional or a non-functional FcγRIIb allele, we show that the human inhibitory FcγRIIb is a critical checkpoint balancing protective and autoreactive immune responses, linking infection with induction of autoimmunity in the human immune system."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) are considered to be the main vector of Lyme disease in eastern North America. They may parasitize a wide range of bird and mammal hosts. Northward dispersal of blacklegged ticks has been attributed largely to movement of hosts to areas outside of the current range of the tick, in conjunction with climate change. To better understand the drivers of range expansion in the blacklegged tick, we need investigations of the genetic connectivity and differentiation of tick populations at a fine spatial scale using appropriate markers. In this study, we investigated genetic connectivity and differentiation in blacklegged ticks, in an area of putatively recent advance in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, using microsatellite markers. Our findings suggest patchy differentiation of alleles, no spatial pattern of genetic structure, and genetic subdivision within sites, which are consistent with the very limited evidence available near the leading edge of range expansion of blacklegged ticks into Canada. These findings are consistent with the prevailing hypothesis, drawn from a variety of fields of study, suggesting that migratory birds from a variety of regions may be bringing hitchhiking ticks northward into Canada."

Because of the degree of atrophy and the variety of symptoms, the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of Parry-Romberg syndrome are a major challenge. The purpose of this case presentation is to highlight the difficulty of establishing the diagnosis, furthermore, to present the steps of examining the patient and to draw attention to the importance of proper timing of the surgery. Moreover, it wants to emphasize the importance of looking for diseases that often occur with the mentioned syndrome. Orv Hetil. 2020; 161(28): 1181-1185."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) and relapsing fevers (RF) are vector-borne diseases caused by bacteria of the Borrelia genus. Here, we report on the widespread infection by a non-described Borrelia species in passerine-associated ticks in tropical rainforests of French Guiana, South America. This novel Borrelia species is common in two tick species, Amblyomma longirostre and A. geayi, which feed on a broad variety of neotropical mammal and bird species, including migratory species moving to North America. The novel Borrelia species is divergent from the LD and RF species, and is more closely related to the reptile- and echidna-associated Borrelia group that was recently described. Genome sequencing showed that this novel Borrelia sp. has a relatively small genome consisting of a 0.9-Mb-large chromosome and an additional 0.3 Mb dispersed on plasmids. It harbors an RF-like genomic organization but with a unique mixture of LD- and RF-specific genes, including genes used by RF Borrelia for the multiphasic antigen-switching system and a number of immune-reactive protein genes used for the diagnosis of LD. Overall, our data indicate that this novel Borrelia is an intermediate taxon between the LD and RF species that may impact a large host spectrum, including American mammals. The designation \"Candidatus Borrelia mahuryensis\" is proposed for this species."

CGR has also many species of ticks and mosquitos that serve as competent vectors for important animal and human pathogens. In this study, we tested dogs from six different animal shelters in the CGR for Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), anaplasmosis, Lyme disease, canine ehrlichiosis and canine heartworm disease. Sera from 157 shelter dogs were tested for antibodies to RMSF agent, Rickettsia rickettsii, using an indirect immunofluorescence assay. Sixty-six dogs (42.0%) were positive for either IgM or IgG, or both IgM and IgG antibodies to R. rickettsii. Moreover, the same set of sera (n = 157) plus an and additional sera (n = 75) from resident dogs at the same shelters were tested using the SNAP 4Dx Plus. Of 232 dogs tested, two (0.9%) were positive for antibodies to Anaplasma phagocytophilum/A. platys, nine (3.9%) were positive for antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi, 23 (9.9%) for positive for antibodies to Ehrlichia canis/E. ewingii, and 13 (5.6%) were positive for Dirofilaria immitis antigen. Co-infection with two or more etiologic agents was detected in five animals. Three dogs had antibodies to both B. burgdorferi and E. canis/E. ewingii, and two dogs were positive for D. immitis antigen and antibodies to B. burgdorferi and E. canis/E. ewingii. Shelter dogs in the CGR are exposed to a number of important vector-borne pathogens. Further studies are required to ascertain the roles these animals play in maintenance and transmission of these pathogens."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in northern hemisphere. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes are transmitted by Ixodes species ticks. During a blood meal, these spirochetes are inoculated into the skin where they multiply and often spread to various target organs: disseminated skin sites, the central nervous system, the heart and large joints. The usual diagnosis of this disease relies on serological tests. However, in patients presenting persistent clinical manifestations, this indirect diagnosis is not capable of detecting an active infection. If the serological tests are positive, it only proves that exposure of an individual to Lyme spirochetes had occurred. Although culture and quantitative PCR detect active infection, currently used tests are not sensitive enough for wide-ranging applications. Animal models have shown that B. burgdorferi persists in the skin. We present here our targeted proteomics results using infected mouse skin biopsies that facilitate detection of this pathogen. We have employed several novel approaches in this study. First, the effect of lidocaine, a local anesthetic used for human skin biopsy, on B. burgdorferi presence was measured. We further determined the impact of topical corticosteroids to reactivate Borrelia locally in the skin. This local immunosuppressive compound helps follow-up detection of spirochetes by proteomic analysis of Borrelia present in the skin. This approach could be developed as a novel diagnostic test for active Lyme borreliosis in patients presenting disseminated persistent infection. Although our results using topical corticosteroids in mice are highly promising for recovery of spirochetes, further optimization will be needed to translate this strategy for diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients."

A serological examination as well as molecular examination (PCR) was done. In the sample of the serum, the presence of antibodies specific to Borrelia burgdorferi were detected. Antibiotic therapy with doxycycline did not cause significant improvement, so the owners of the dog decided about its euthanasia. During the necroscopy, a dilated heart was recognised. In the heart samples, the genetic material of Borrelia was detected. The results of serological and molecular examinations showed that in the discussed case, an etiological factor of the disease was spirochetes. In light of the research, veterinary practitioners should keep in mind the presence of Lyme disease in dogs in Poland and include it in differential diagnoses for lameness and cardiological problems."

Understanding the origin, maintenance, and spread of these ticks contributes much to our understanding of the spread of LB and other disease agents borne by these ticks. We collected 1232 Ixodes scapularis ticks from 17 east coast sites ranging from New Hampshire to Florida and used mtDNA, three nuclear genetic loci, and incorporated Bayesian analyses to resolve geographically distinct tick populations and compare their demographic histories. A sparse, stable, and genetically diverse population of ticks in the Southeastern US, that is rarely infected with the agent of LB is genetically distinct from an abundant, expanding, and comparatively uniform population in the Northeast, where epidemic LB now constitutes the most important vector borne disease in the United States. The contrasting geography and demography of tick populations, interpreted in the context of the geological history of the region, suggests that during the last glacial period such ticks occupied distinct refugia, with only the northern-most site of refuge giving rise to those ticks and pathogens now fueling the epidemic."

Physical exam revealed multiple large targetoid lesions on the back and extremities. The rash had raised borders and centralized clearing consistent with erythema migrans chronicum. Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a high-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone due to clinical suspicion for Lyme carditis. ELISA and Western blot tests were reactive for Lyme IgM and IgG, confirming the diagnosis. The AV block resolved by hospital day four and the patient was discharged with outpatient follow-up. Early identification of disease allowed for effective treatment with no adverse outcomes or sequelae."

		"abstract": "A single dose of doxycycline after a tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis in North America, but extrapolation to Europe is hampered by differences in Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies and tick species. We assessed the efficacy of prophylaxis after a tick bite in Europe. We conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial, administering a single dose of 200 mg doxycycline within 72 h after removing an attached tick from the skin, compared to no treatment. Potential participants ≥ 8 years of age who reported a recent tick bite online were invited for the study. After informed consent, they were randomly assigned to either the prophylaxis or the no-treatment group. Participants in the prophylaxis group were asked to visit their general practitioner to administer the antibiotics. All participants were followed up by online questionnaires. Our primary outcome was the development of physician-confirmed Lyme borreliosis in a modified-intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR3953) and is closed. Between April 11, 2013, and June 10, 2015, 3538 potential participants were randomized, of whom 1689 were included in the modified-intention-to-treat analysis. 10 cases of Lyme borreliosis were reported out of 1041 participants (0.96%) in the prophylaxis group, and 19 cases out of 648 no-treatment participants (2.9%), resulting in a relative risk reduction of 67% (95% CI 31 - 84%), and a number-needed-to-treat of 51 (95% CI 29 - 180). No serious adverse events were reported. This primary care-based trial provides evidence that a single dose of doxycycline can prevent the development of Lyme borreliosis after an Ixodes ricinus tick bite."

The aim of the study was a detection of Babesia antibodies level with the usage of experimental Babesia divergens whole-cell slide antigen and commercial B. microti immunofluorescence assay substrate slide (Fuller Laboratories, USA). Experimental B. divergens whole-cell slide antigen in addition to commercial B. microti IFA substrate slide was used to create a diagnostic kit for serum Babesia antibodies level detecting, as well as for a babesiosis serodiagnosis clinical trial of different origins blood samples (patients with Lyme disease, rheumatoid arthritis and toxoplasmosis; human blood donors; cattle). Antibodies to B. divergens (5.4%) and B. microti (2.3%) were detected with higher (p <0.05) frequency at Lyme disease patients (16.7%) than at blood donors (1.7%). Diagnostically significant IgG titres (= 1:128) were found in 13.3% of blood samples from Lyme disease patients and 1.7% from blood donors. Specific IgM were also found in 13.3% blood samples from Lyme disease patients. Among blood samples from Lyme disease patients, in which diagnostically significant titres of Babesia antibodies were detected (16.7%), 60% of them were represented by IgG and IgM (rA= 0.63), and in 40% only one of them reached diagnostically significant titre. Conclusions. Advantages of babesiosis IFA diagnostics. Advantages of babesiosis IFA diagnostics are combined with its significant disadvantages (principle of evaluation, low sensitivity in the initial period of the disease, probability of false positives, absence of validated test systems and research protocols for B. divergens and B. divergens-like species)."

A healthy female patient presented to the endodontist with toothache symptoms. Her symptoms included intense pain in the left mandible irradiating into the temporalis area and through her neck and tingling on the lower left lip and left side of her tongue. She also reported feeling of sweats and chills the night before, as well as an altered sensation in her shoulder and arm. The pain was not alleviated by over-the-counter analgesics. Both intraoral and radiographic examinations did not reveal any abnormalities, and the patient was presented with the following differential diagnoses: cardiac issues, trigeminal neuralgia, and temporomandibular dysfunction. She presented to the emergency department at the local hospital for assessment on the same day. After some tests were performed, both a stroke and myocardial infarction were ruled out. The following morning, she noticed a bump in the posterior area of her left upper thigh where an erythema with a bull's-eye appearance was observed. She presented to her family doctor's office on the same day and was diagnosed with Lyme disease. Because Lyme disease can present with symptoms similar to a toothache, dentists should be knowledgeable of its manifestations. Lyme disease should be considered as differential diagnosis in patients who present with compatible symptoms and signs, which may occur in the orofacial region."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is emerging in many parts of central and eastern Canada. Serological testing is most commonly used to support laboratory diagnosis of LD. Standard two-tiered testing (STTT) for LD involves detection of Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by IgM and/or IgG immunoblots. However, improved sensitivity has been demonstrated using a modified two-tiered testing (MTTT) approach, in which a second EIA instead of the traditional immunoblot is used. This article summarises the evidence supporting the MTTT versus STTT for laboratory diagnosis of LD in Canada. Peer reviewed literature on the sensitivity and specificity of different EIAs were compared by Canadian experts in LD diagnostic for MTTT vs STTT in patients with clinical history of LD residing in LD endemic areas or in samples from the LD serum repository. The MTTT approach consistently demonstrated improved sensitivity to detect early infections with B. burgdorferi and also maintained high specificity vs STTT. Diagnostic improvements in sensitivity of LD testing without significant loss of specificity have been consistently reported when MTTT is compared with STTT in studies conducted in highly LD endemic regions. Our working group agrees with the recommendation by the United States Centers for Disease Control that serological testing for LD using MTTT is an acceptable alternative to STTT. This recommendation is contingent on development and implementation of comprehensive validation studies on the performance of MTTT vs STTT within the Canadian context, including evaluation of the test performance in areas of low endemicity for LD."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The current therapeutic approach to this disease is limited to antibiotics. However, after their administration, about 20% of patients experience delayed onset of this illness manifesting as lingering persistent symptoms. To determine a suitable approach that would help reduce this number, we examined the efficacy of a composition of polyphenolic compounds (baicalein, luteolin, and rosmarinic acid) with fatty acids (monolaurin and cis-2-decenoic acid), and iodine/kelp in a Lyme disease animal model and volunteers. The results showed that 4 weeks of dietary intake of this composition reduced the spirochete burden in animal tissues by about 75%. Basic and differential blood parameters did not show significant differences between control animals and the animals fed with this composition. Also, hepatic and renal toxicity markers were not changed and apoptosis was not observed. Relevant inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-17, TNF-α, and INF-γ, were elevated in infected animals but normalized in infected and treated animals. A small observational study revealed that after administration of this composition to 17 volunteers three times per day for 6 months, 67.4% of the volunteers with late or persistent LD, and not receptive to previous antibiotic application, responded positively, in terms of energy status as well as physical and psychological wellbeing to supplementation with this composition, while 17.7% had slight improvement, and 17.7% were none responsive. We concluded that this specific composition revealed feasible benefits in late or persistent LD management, although double-blind controlled clinical trials are warranted."

We present magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and electroneurography findings of a young female patient suffering from neuroborreliosis-associated transverse myelitis with a wide constellation of symptoms including papilloedema. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine has shown an enlargement of the spinal cord in the mid-cervical region. Cerebrospinal fluid findings included lymphocytic pleocytosis, increased levels of anti - Borrelia antibodies, and increased intrathecal anti -Borrelia antibody index. Following the 28-day course of intravenous ceftriaxone, the patient attained complete recovery. Subacute transverse myelitis in the course of neuroborreliosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with abnormal magnetic resonance scans of the spinal cord, lymphocytic pleocytosis, and intrathecal antibody production, especially in the tick-endemic areas, even if the tick bite was not reported. Infrequent accompanying symptoms such as papilloedema are diagnostically challenging and cannot be treated as clinching evidence."

Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a pivotal protein in Borrelia infection, which is the etiological agent of Lyme disease. OspA exists in equilibrium with intermediate conformations, in which the central and the C-terminal regions of the protein have lower stabilities than the N-terminal. Here, we characterize pressure- and temperature-stabilized intermediates of OspA by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy combined with paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE). We found that although the C-terminal region of the intermediate was partially disordered, it retains weak specific contact with the N-terminal region, owing to a twist of the central β-sheet and increased flexibility in the polypeptide chain. The disordered C-terminal region of the pressure-stabilized intermediate was more compact than that of the temperature-stabilized form. Further, molecular dynamics simulation demonstrated that temperature-induced disordering of the β-sheet was initiated at the C-terminal region and continued through to the central region. An ensemble of simulation snapshots qualitatively described the PRE data from the intermediate and indicated that the intermediate structures of OspA may expose tick receptor-binding sites more readily than does the basic folded conformation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a complex multisystem illness with varying clinical manifestations. This tick-borne zoonosis is caused by the spirochetal bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) and, worldwide, presents with at least 20 different types of rashes. Certain cutaneous rashes are inherently interconnected to various stages of Lyme disease. In this study, five Canadian Lyme disease patients from a multi-age range presented various phases of the acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) rash. In each case of ACA, the underlying etiological pathogen was the Lyme disease spirochete. Although ACA rashes are normally found on the lower extremities, this study illustrates that ACA rashes are not directly correlated with a tick bite, geographic area, age, Bbsl genospecies, exercise, or any given surface area of the body. Case 4 provides confirmation for an ACA rash and gestational Lyme disease. One patient (Case 5) puts forth a Bbsl and Bartonella sp. co-infection with a complex ACA rash. This study documents ACA rashes on Lyme disease patients for the first time in Canada."

The β-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is one of the OMPs of Borrelia burgdorferi, the pathogenic spirochete that causes Lyme disease, and its BamA component (BbBamA) includes a C-terminal β-barrel domain and five N-terminal periplasmic polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains, which together perform a central transport function. In the current work, the production, crystallization and X-ray analysis of the three N-terminal POTRA domains of BbBamA (BbBamA-POTRA P1-P3; residues 30-273) were carried out. The crystals of BbBamA-POTRA P1-P3 belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 45.353, b = 111.538, c = 64.376 Å, β = 99.913°. The Matthews coefficient was calculated to be 2.92 Å3 Da-1, assuming the presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit, and the corresponding solvent content was 57.9%. Owing to the absence of an ideal homology model, numerous attempts to solve the BbBamA-POTRA P1-P3 structure using molecular replacement (MR) failed. In order to solve the structure, further trials using selenomethionine derivatization are currently being carried out."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia are divided into relapsing fever borreliae and Lyme disease borreliae. Immunoserological assays have been poorly developed for relapsing fever borreliae, where direct detection methods are more adapted to the pathophysiology of these infections presenting with massive bacteraemia. However, emergence of the novel agent of relapsing fever B. miyamotoi has renewed interest in serology in this context. In Lyme disease, because direct detection methods show low sensitivity, serology plays a central role in the diagnostic strategy. This diagnostic strategy is based on a two-tier methodology involving a first test (ELISA) with high sensitivity and acceptable specificity and a second, more specific test (western blot) for diagnostic confirmation. The most frequent limitations and pitfalls of serology are cross reactions, false IgM positivity, a seronegative window period at the early time of the infection, and serologic scars with a suspicion of reinfection. International guidelines have thus been proposed to avoid these difficulties with interpretation. Finally, unconventional diagnostic tests have been developed recently in the context of a highly publicized disease, with widely varying results, some of which have no available evidence-based data. New two-tier testing strategies using two ELISA tests (C6 and WCS for example) to replace immunoblot are currently proposed by some authors and guidelines, and promising new tests such as CXCL-13 in CSF are promising tools for the improvement of the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The complement system is an ancient arm of the innate immune system that plays important roles in pathogen recognition and elimination. Upon activation by microbes, complement opsonizes bacterial surfaces, recruits professional phagocytes, and causes bacteriolysis. Borreliella species are spirochetal bacteria that are transmitted to vertebrate hosts via infected Ixodes ticks and are the etiologic agents of Lyme disease. Pathogens that traffic in blood and other body fluids, like Borreliella, have evolved means to evade complement. Lyme disease spirochetes interfere with complement by producing a small arsenal of outer-surface lipoproteins that bind host complement components and manipulate their native activities. Here we review the current landscape of complement evasion by Lyme disease spirochetes and provide an update on recent discoveries."

Tick-borne pathogens include viruses (e.g. tick-borne encephalitis and Powassan); bacteria, such as the causative agents of Lyme disease, spotted fever rickettsiosis and human anaplasmosis; and malaria-like protozoan parasites causing babesiosis. Tick-borne diseases are emerging due to the geographical expansion of their tick vectors, especially in the northern hemisphere. Two examples of this phenomenon are Ixodes scapularis and Amblyomma americanum, which have expanded their ranges in the USA in recent decades and are responsible for the continuous emergence of Lyme disease and human ehrlichiosis, respectively. This phenomenon is also occurring worldwide and is reflected by the increasing number of tick-borne encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever cases in Europe and Asia. In this review, we provide a concise synopsis of the most medically important tick-borne pathogen worldwide, with a particular emphasis on emerging public health threats."

		"abstract": "A series of cases in the Northeast of the US during 2013-2015 described a new Borrelia species, Borrelia miyamotoi, which is transmitted by the same tick species that transmits Lyme disease and causes a relapsing fever-like illness. The geographic expansion of B. miyamotoi in the US also extends to other Lyme endemic areas such as the Midwestern US. Co-infections with other tick borne diseases (TBD) may contribute to the severity of the disease. On Long Island, NY, 3-5% of ticks are infected by B. miyamotoi, but little is known about the frequency of B. miyamotoi infections in humans in this particular region. The aim of this study was to perform a chart review in all patients diagnosed with B. miyamotoi infection in Stony Brook Medicine (SBM) system to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of B. miyamotoi infection in Suffolk County, NY. In a 5 year time period (2013-2017), a total of 28 cases were positive for either IgG EIA (n = 19) or PCR (n = 9). All 9 PCR-positive cases (median age: 67; range: 22-90 years) had clinical findings suggestive of acute or relapsing infection. All these patients were thought to have a TBD, prompting the healthcare provider to order the TBD panel which includes a B. miyamotoi PCR test. In conclusion, B. miyamotoi infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis for flu-like syndromes during the summer after a deer tick bite and to prevent labeling a case with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "This study addresses the modifications that future climate conditions could impose on the transmission cycles of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. by the tick Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Tracking the distribution of foci of a zoonotic agent transmitted by vectors as climate change shapes its spatial niche is necessary to issue self-protection measures for the human population. We modeled the current distribution of the tick and its predicted contact rates with 18 species of vertebrates known to act as reservoirs of the pathogen. We approached an innovative way for estimating the possibility of permanent foci of Borrelia afzelii or Borrelia garinii tracking separately the expected spatial overlap among ticks and reservoirs for these pathogens in Europe. Environmental traits were obtained from MODIS satellite images for the years 2002-2017 (baseline) and projected on scenarios for the years 2030 and 2050. The ratio between MODIS baseline/current interpolated climatologies (WorldClim), and the ratio between MODIS-projected year 2050 with five climate change scenarios for that year (WorldClim) revealed no significant differences, meaning that projections from MODIS are reliable. Models predict that contact rates between the tick and reservoirs of either B. garinii or B. afzelii are spatially different because those have different habitats overlap. This is expected to promote different distribution patterns because of the different responses of both groups of reservoirs to environmental variables. Models for 2030 predict an increase in latitude, mainly in the circulation of B. garinii, with large areas of expected permanent contact between vector and reservoirs in Nordic countries and central Europe. However, climate projections for the year 2050 predict an unexpected scenario of contact disruption. Though large areas in Europe would be suitable for circulation of the pathogens, the predicted lack of niche overlap among ticks and reservoirs could promote a decrease in permanent foci. This development represents a proof-of-concept for the power of jointly modeling both the vector and reservoirs in a common framework. A deeper understanding of the unanticipated result regarding the year 2050 is needed."

In this case, we report a 30-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with one week of diffuse, increasing weakness in the upper/lower extremities and face after a recent gastrointestinal illness and travel to the Northeastern United States. Areflexia was noted in bilateral lower extremities. Lumbar puncture results together with clinical presentation were consistent with a diagnosis of GBS. Lab results later revealed a possible Lyme infection in cerebrospinal fluid, which along with recent travel to endemic area gave high suspicion for Lyme disease.

The functional relationship between B. burgdorferi OMVs and host neuron homeostasis is not well understood. The objective of this study was to examine how B. burgdorferi OMVs impact the host cell environment. First, an in vitro model was established by co-culturing human BE2C neuroblastoma cells with B. burgdorferi B31. B. burgdorferi was able to invade BE2C cells within 24 h. Despite internalization, BE2C cell viability and levels of apoptosis remained unchanged, but resulted in dramatically increased production of MCP-1 and MCP-2 cytokines. Elevated secretion of MCP-1 has previously been associated with changes in oxidative stress. BE2C cell mitochondrial superoxides were reduced as early as 30 min after exposure to B. burgdorferi and OMVs. To rule out whether BE2C cell antioxidant response is the cause of decline in superoxides, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) gene expression was assessed. SOD2 expression was reduced upon exposure to B. burgdorferi, suggesting that B. burgdorferi might be responsible for superoxide reduction. These results suggest that B. burgdorferi modulates cell antioxidant defense and immune system reaction in response to the bacterial infection. In summary, these results show that B. burgdorferi OMVs serve to directly counter superoxide production in BE2C neurons, thereby 'priming' the host environment to support B. burgdorferi colonization."

		"abstract": "An estimated 300,000 cases of Lyme disease occur in the United States annually. Disseminated Lyme disease may result in carditis, arthritis, facial palsy or meningitis, sometimes requiring hospitalization. We describe the epidemiology and cost of Lyme disease-related hospitalizations. We analysed 2005-2014 data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Databases to identify inpatient records associated with Lyme disease based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. We estimated the annual number and median cost of Lyme disease-related hospitalizations in the United States in persons under 65 years of age. Costs were adjusted to reflect 2016 dollars. Of 20,983,165 admission records contained in the inpatient databases during the study period, 2,823 (0.01%) met inclusion criteria for Lyme disease-related hospitalizations. Over half of the identified records contained an ICD-9-CM code for meningitis (n = 614), carditis (n = 429), facial palsy (n = 400) or arthritis (n = 377). Nearly 60% of hospitalized patients were male. The median cost per Lyme disease-related hospitalization was $11,688 (range: $140-$323,613). The manifestation with the highest median cost per stay was carditis ($17,461), followed by meningitis ($15,177), arthritis ($13,012) and facial palsy ($10,491). Median cost was highest among the 15- to 19-year-old age group ($12,991). Admissions occurring in January had the highest median cost ($13,777) for all study years. Based on extrapolation to the U.S. population, we estimate that 2,196 Lyme disease-related hospitalizations in persons under 65 years of age occur annually with an estimated annual cost of $25,826,237. Lyme disease is usually treated in an outpatient setting; however, some patients with Lyme disease require hospitalization, underscoring the need for effective prevention methods to mitigate these serious cases. Information from this analysis can aid economic evaluations of interventions that prevent infection and advances in disease detection."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is the most common vectorborne disease in the northern hemisphere. It usually begins with erythema migrans; early disseminated infection particularly causes multiple erythema migrans or neurologic disease, and late manifestations predominantly include arthritis in North America, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) in Europe. Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is based on characteristic clinical signs and symptoms, complemented by serological confirmation of infection once an antibody response has been mounted. Manifestations usually respond to appropriate antibiotic regimens, but the disease can be followed by sequelae, such as immune arthritis or residual damage to affected tissues. A subset of individuals reports persistent symptoms, including fatigue, pain, arthralgia, and neurocognitive symptoms, which in some people are severe enough to fulfil the criteria for post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of such persistent symptoms following antimicrobial treatment varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is unclear. Persistent active infection in humans has not been identified as a cause of this syndrome, and randomized treatment trials have invariably failed to show any benefit of prolonged antibiotic treatment. For prevention of Lyme borreliosis, post-exposure prophylaxis may be indicated in specific cases, and novel vaccine strategies are under development."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere and is caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. Lyme borreliae infect diverse vertebrate reservoirs without triggering apparent manifestations in these animals; however, Lyme borreliae strains differ in their reservoir hosts. The mechanisms that drive those differences are unknown. To survive in vertebrate hosts, Lyme borreliae require the ability to escape from host defense mechanisms, in particular complement. To facilitate the evasion of complement, Lyme borreliae produce diverse proteins at different stages of infection, allowing them to persistently survive without being recognized by hosts and potentially resulting in host-specific infection. This review discusses the current knowledge regarding the ecology and evolutionary mechanisms of Lyme borreliae-host associations driven by complement evasion."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne human disease in Europe, and Borrelia garinii, which is associated with avian reservoirs, is one of the most genetically diverse and widespread human pathogenic genospecies from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex. The clinical manifestations of LD are known to vary between regions and depend on the genetic strain even within Borrelia genospecies. It is thus of importance to explore the genetic diversity of such pathogenic borreliae for the wide range of host and ecological contexts. In this study, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to investigate the local population structure of B. garinii in Ixodes ricinus ticks. The study took place in a natural wetland in Slovakia, temporally encompassing spring and autumn bird migration periods as well as the breeding period of resident birds. In total, we examined 369 and 255 ticks collected from 78 birds and local vegetation, respectively. B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 43.4% (160/369) of ticks recovered from birds and in 26.3% (67/255) of questing ticks, respectively. Considering the ticks from bird hosts, the highest prevalence was found for single infections with B. garinii (22.5%). Infection intensity of B. garinii in bird-feeding ticks was significantly higher than that in questing ticks. We identified ten B. garinii sequence types (STs) occurring exclusively in bird-feeding ticks, two STs occurring exclusively in questing ticks, and one ST (ST 244) occurring in both ticks from birds and questing ticks. Four B. garinii STs were detected for the first time herein. With the exception of ST 93, we detected different STs in spring and summer for bird-feeding ticks. Our results are consistent with previous studies of the low geographic structuring of B. garinii genotypes. However, our study reveals some consistency in local ST occurrence and a geographic signal for one of the clonal complexes."

Because of longevity of some reservoir hosts and the Ixodes tick vectors' life cycle, long-term studies are required to better understand species and population dynamics of these bacteria in their natural habitats. Ticks were collected between 1999 and 2010 in three ecologically different habitats in Latvia. We used multilocus sequence typing utilizing eight chromosomally located housekeeping genes to obtain information about species and population fluctuations and/or stability of B. burgdorferi s.l. in these habitats. The average prevalence over all years was 18.9%. From initial high-infection prevalences of 25.5%, 33.1% and 31.8%, from 2002 onwards the infection rates steadily decreased to 7.3%. Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii were the most commonly found genospecies but striking local differences were obvious. In one habitat, a significant shift from rodent-associated to bird-associated Borrelia species was noted whilst in the other habitats, Borrelia species composition was relatively stable over time. Sequence types (STs) showed a random spatial and temporal distribution. These results demonstrated that there are temporal regional changes and extrapolations from one habitat to the next are not possible."

		"abstract": "Diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is challenging, as long as Borrelia-specific intrathecal antibodies are not yet detectable. The chemokine CXCL13 is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of LNB patients. Here, we compared the performances of the Euroimmun CXCL13 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (CXCL13 ELISA) and the ReaScan CXCL13 lateral flow immunoassay (CXCL13 LFA), a rapid point-of-care test, to support the diagnosis of LNB. In a dual-center case-control study, CSF samples from 90 patients (34 with definite LNB, 10 with possible LNB, and 46 with other central nervous system [CNS] diseases [non-LNB group]) were analyzed with the CXCL13 ELISA and the CXCL13 LFA. Classification of patients followed the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines on LNB. The CXCL13 ELISA detected elevated CXCL13 levels in all patients with definite LNB (median, 1,409 pg/ml) compared to the non-LNB controls (median, 20.7 pg/ml; P < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 84.8% (cutoff value, 78.6 pg/ml; area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve, 0.93). Similarly, the CXCL13 LFA yielded elevated CXCL13 levels in 31 patients with definite LNB (median arbitrary value, 223.5) compared to the non-LNB control patients (median arbitrary value, 0; P < 0.0001) and had a sensitivity and specificity of 91.2% and 93.5%, respectively (cutoff arbitrary value, 22.5; area under the ROC curve, 0.94). The correlation between the CXCL13 levels obtained by ELISA and LFA was strong (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.89; P < 0.0001). The CXCL13 ELISA and the CXCL13 LFA are comparable diagnostic tools for the detection of CXCL13 in the CSF of patients with definite LNB. The advantage of the CXCL13 LFA is the shorter time to result."

		"abstract": "In Europe, ticks are major vectors of both human and livestock pathogens (e.g. Lyme disease, granulocytic anaplasmosis, bovine babesiosis). Agricultural landscapes, where animal breeding is a major activity, constitute a mosaic of habitat types of various quality for tick survival and are used at different frequencies by wild and domestic hosts across seasons. This habitat heterogeneity, in time and space, conditions the dynamics of these host-vector-pathogen systems and thus drives acarological risk (defined as the density of infected ticks). The principal objective of the OSCAR project (2011-2016) was to examine the links between this heterogeneity and acarological risk for humans and their domestic animals. Here, we present the data associated with this project. This paper reports a database on the distribution and densities of I. ricinus ticks - the most common tick species in French agricultural landscapes - and the prevalence of three tick-borne pathogens (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.) in two sites in north-western (\"Zone Atelier Armorique\": ZA site) and south-western (\"Vallées et Coteaux de Gascogne\": VG site) France. The distribution and density of ticks along a gradient of wooded habitats, as well as biotic variables, such as the presence and abundance of their principal domestic (livestock) and wild hosts (small mammals), were measured from forest cores and edges to more or less isolated hedges, all bordering meadows. Ticks, small mammals and information on local environmental conditions were collected along 90 transects in each of the two sites in spring and autumn 2012 and 2013 and in spring 2014, corresponding to the main periods of tick activity. Local environmental conditions were recorded along each tick and small mammal transect: habitat type, vegetation type and characteristics, slope and traces of livestock presence. Samples consisted of questing ticks collected on the vegetation (mainly I. ricinus nymphs), biopsies of captured small mammals and ticks fixed on small mammals. In the VG site, livestock occurrence and abundance were recorded each week along each tick transect.A total of 29004 questing ticks and 1230 small mammals were captured during the study across the two sites and over the five field campaigns. All questing nymphs (N = 12287) and questing adults (N = 646) were identified to species. Ticks from small mammals (N = 1359) were also identified to life stage. Questing nymphs (N = 4518 I. ricinus) and trapped small mammals (N = 908) were analysed for three pathogenic agents: A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp.In the VG site, the average prevalence in I. ricinus nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia spp. were, respectively 1.9% [95% CI: 1.2-2.5], 2.5% [95% CI: 1.8-3.2] and 2.7% [95% CI: 2.0-3.4]. In small mammals, no A. phagocytophilum was detected, but the prevalence for Borrelia spp. was 4.2% [95% CI: 0.9-7.5]. On this site, there was no screening of small mammals for Babesia spp. In ZA site, the average prevalence in nymphs for A. phagocytophilum, Borrelia spp. and Babesia were, respectively 2.2% [95% CI: 1.6-2.7], 3.0% [95% CI: 2.3-3.6] and 3.1% [95% CI: 2.5-3.8]. In small mammals, the prevalence of A. phagocytophilum and Borrelia spp. were, respectively 6.9% [95% CI: 4.9-8.9] and 4.1% [95% CI: 2.7-5.9]. A single animal was found positive for Babesia microti at this site amongst the 597 tested."

Patients with extremely high CK activity with preserved renal function are uncommon. This report describes a case of non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis, with a markedly elevated CK activity, without associated AKI. CASE REPORT A 22-year-old male presented with severe generalized myalgias and darkened urine for 1 week prior to his admission. The patient presented to the Emergency Department with initial CK activity of >40 000 U/L and a serum creatinine level of 0.77 mg/dL. Urinalysis was positive for myoglobinuria. Serum cystatin C confirmed an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 144 mL/min/1.73 m². Several causes of rhabdomyolysis, including viral infections, Lyme disease, viral hepatitis, hypothyroidism, and cocaine abuse were investigated; however, all were negative. He was given a bolus of 2 liters of normal saline and continued on intravenous normal saline at 250 mL/hour throughout his hospital stay. Urine output remained adequate. We were able to quantify his serum CK activity by dilution method, which revealed a serum CK activity of >150 000 U/L. His CK levels consistently trended down with treatment. CONCLUSIONS An extremely high CK activity in rhabdomyolysis may lead to AKI. However, preserved kidney function is possible. Young age, no concurrent cocaine use, and adequate oral fluid hydration may prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis. Physicians need to remain vigilant for cases of rhabdomyolysis that have not yet caused renal compromise."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi exhibits dramatic changes in gene expression as it transits between its tick vector and vertebrate host. A major hurdle to understanding the mechanisms underlying gene regulation in B. burgdorferi has been the lack of a functional assay to test how gene regulatory proteins and sigma factors interact with RNA polymerase to direct transcription. To gain mechanistic insight into transcriptional control in B. burgdorferi, and address sigma factor function and specificity, we developed an in vitro transcription assay using the B. burgdorferi RNA polymerase holoenzyme. We established reaction conditions for maximal RNA polymerase activity by optimizing pH, temperature, and the requirement for divalent metals. Using this assay system, we analyzed the promoter specificity of the housekeeping sigma factor RpoD to promoters encoding previously identified RpoD consensus sequences in B. burgdorferi. Collectively, this study established an in vitro transcription assay that revealed RpoD-dependent promoter selectivity by RNA polymerase and the requirement of specific metal cofactors for maximal RNA polymerase activity. The establishment of this functional assay will facilitate molecular and biochemical studies on how gene regulatory proteins and sigma factors exert control of gene expression in B. burgdorferi required for the completion of its enzootic cycle."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an emerging infection in Canada caused by the bacterium belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex, which is transmitted via the bite of an infected blacklegged tick. Populations of blacklegged ticks continue to expand and are now established in different regions in Canada. It usually takes more than 24 hours of tick attachment to transfer B. burgdorferi to a human. The diagnosis of early localized Lyme disease is made by clinical assessment, as laboratory tests are not reliable at this stage. Most patients with early localized Lyme disease will present with a skin lesion (i.e., erythema migrans) expanding from the tick bite site and/or non-specific \"influenza-like\" symptoms (e.g., arthralgia, myalgia, and fever). Signs and symptoms may occur from between 3 and 30 days following the tick bite. The care of pregnant patients with a tick bite or suspected Lyme disease should be managed similarly to non-pregnant adults, including the consideration of antibiotics for prophylaxis and treatment. The primary objective of this committee opinion is to inform practitioners about Lyme disease and provide an approach to managing the care of pregnant women who may have been infected via a blacklegged tick bite. Health care providers who care for pregnant women or women of reproductive age. Women of reproductive age. In November 2018, Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL databases were searched for 2 main categories: (1) Lyme disease and (2) other tick-borne diseases. Because the main focus was Lyme disease, and considering the limited number of the articles, no further filters were applied for publication time or type of study. For other tick-borne diseases, the results were restricted to a publication date within the last 10 years (2008-2018). The search terms were developed using MeSH terms and keywords including Lyme Disease, Pregnancy, Pregnant Women, Pregnancy Complications, Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, Babesiosis, Tularemia, Powassan Virus, Encephalitis Viruses, Tick-Borne, Tick-Borne Diseases, Colorado Tick Fever, Q Fever, Relapsing Fever, and Southern Tick-Associated Rash Illness. All articles on Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases with a target population of pregnant women were included; other groups and populations were excluded. The content and recommendations of this committee opinion were drafted and agreed upon by the authors. The Board of Directors of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada approved the final draft for publication."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, B. afzelii and B. garinii, is a chronic, multi-systemic infection and the spectrum of tissues affected can vary with the Lyme disease strain. For example, whereas B. garinii infection is associated with neurologic manifestations, B. burgdorferi infection is associated with arthritis. The basis for tissue tropism is poorly understood, but has been long hypothesized to involve strain-specific interactions with host components in the target tissue. OspC (outer surface protein C) is a highly variable outer surface protein required for infectivity, and sequence differences in OspC are associated with variation in tissue invasiveness, but whether OspC directly influences tropism is unknown. We found that OspC binds to the extracellular matrix (ECM) components fibronectin and/or dermatan sulfate in an OspC variant-dependent manner. Murine infection by isogenic B. burgdorferi strains differing only in their ospC coding region revealed that two OspC variants capable of binding dermatan sulfate promoted colonization of all tissues tested, including joints. However, an isogenic strain producing OspC from B. garinii strain PBr, which binds fibronectin but not dermatan sulfate, colonized the skin, heart and bladder, but not joints. Moreover, a strain producing an OspC altered to recognize neither fibronectin nor dermatan sulfate displayed dramatically reduced levels of tissue colonization that were indistinguishable from a strain entirely deficient in OspC. Finally, intravital microscopy revealed that this OspC mutant, in contrast to a strain producing wild type OspC, was defective in promoting joint invasion by B. burgdorferi in living mice. We conclude that OspC functions as an ECM-binding adhesin that is required for joint invasion, and that variation in OspC sequence contributes to strain-specific differences in tissue tropism displayed among Lyme disease spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Both incidence and geographical range of tick-borne disease has increased across the USA. Similar to people, dogs are hosts for Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs also share our homes and beds, making them both a sentinel for the ticks in our backyards but also increasing our exposure to ticks. Measures to better track, prevent, and/or treat tick-borne diseases in companion animals can lead to better control and prevention of human tick-borne disease. This study identifies demographic and co-infection risk factors for canine seropositivity to tick-borne infections in a cohort of hunting dogs across the USA. Human patterns of tick-borne disease co-infection in the USA have been predominantly driven by the geographical distribution of the tick vector. Dogs who tested seropositive for Anaplasma spp. were 1.40 times more likely (P = 0.0242) to also test seropositive for Babesia spp. and vice versa (1.60 times more likely, P = 0.0014). Dogs living in the West had 5% lower risk (P = 0.0001) for Ehrlichia spp. seropositivity compared to other regions. Controlling for age and Anaplasma spp. seroprevalence, dogs in all three other regions were 2.30 times more likely (P = 0.0216) to test seropositive for B. burgdorferi than dogs in the West. Dogs seropositive for B. burgdorferi were 1.60 times more likely (P = 0.0473) to be seropositive for Anaplasma spp. Tick geographical distributions have a prominent impact on the regional distribution of hunting dog exposure to tick-borne diseases. Education concerning regional tick prevalence and disease risk is important for everyone, but particularly dog owners, regarding ticks in their region and protection from infection and co-infection of tick-borne pathogens as they travel or move with their dogs. Dogs are sentinel species for human exposure to ticks, and as such surveillance of canine tick-borne infections and understanding the probability that these infections might be seen together as co-infections helps predict emerging areas where people are more likely to be exposed as well."

		"abstract": "In Lyme disease, the interpretation of diagnostic assays is often misunderstood. Cross-reactions of Borrelia proteins with antigens from other bacterial species are well known. Therefore, to diagnose Lyme disease, the finding of positive IgM antibodies must be accompanied by objectively verified clinical signs and a history of a possible tick exposure. Positive Borrelia IgM antibodies in healthy individuals with nonspecific clinical symptoms are likely a false-positive result for Lyme disease and neither long-term antibiotic treatment nor cycling of different antibiotic regimens is beneficial. To date, there is clear evidence that positive serology does not indicate infection with Borrelia species. Borrelia serology has been reported to be positive for months or years in ∼20% of healthy patients who had experienced Lyme disease in the past. Thus, serology as a single diagnostic tool has a very limited value and should be used only to support clinically suspected cases."

To evaluate the impact of Lyme borreliosis seroprevalence and serologic test characteristics on the probability of obtaining a false-positive result and impact on antimicrobial use. Cross-sectional serological survey and modelling. Sera from 303 horses in southern Belgium were analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Apparent seroprevalence was derived from serological data and a Bayesian estimate of true seroprevalence was computed. These were a starting point to model the impact of test and population characteristics on the probability of obtaining false-positive results and consequently unnecessary treatments and complications. Apparent and true seroprevalence were 22% (95% CI 18%-27%) and 11% (credible interval with 95% probability 0.6%-21%) respectively. We estimate that two-thirds of positive samples are false positive in southern Belgium, with one in five of tested horses potentially misdiagnosed as infected. Around 5% of antimicrobial use in equine veterinary practice in Belgium may be attributable to treatment of a false-positive result. There was uncertainty regarding the ELISA's sensitivity and specificity. This study highlights the importance of appreciating the poor diagnostic value of ELISA screening for Lyme borreliosis as demonstrated by this case study of seroprevalence in southern Belgium where we demonstrate that a nontrivial number of horses is estimated to receive unwarranted treatment due to poor appreciation of screening test characteristics by practitioners, contributing substantially to unnecessary use of antimicrobials."

In Northern Europe, LNB is primarily caused by the spirochete Borrelia garinii and transmitted by the tick Ixodes ricinus. This Danish observational epidemiologic case-control study includes every identified LNB patient (n = 401) on Funen, Denmark, from 1995-2014. We display spatial and temporal LNB incidence variation, seasonal distribution of cases and local spatial case clustering. Seasonal patterns show LNB symptom-onset peaking in July and a significant seasonal difference in number of cases (p < 0.01). We found no significant change in seasonality patterns over time when dividing the study period into 5-year intervals. We identified a significant local geographical hot-spot of cases with a relative risk of 2.44 (p = 0.013). Analysis revealed a significantly shorter distance to nearest forest for cases compared with controls (p < 0.001). We present a novel map of the focal geographical distribution of LNB cases in a high endemic borreliosis area. Continued studies of case clustering in the epidemiology of LNB are of key importance in guiding intervention strategies."

		"abstract": "Nonspecific symptoms in children suspected of Lyme borreliosis (LB) are challenging for clinicians. We assessed whether nonspecific symptoms are more prevalent among children with positive immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology or a history of clinical LB. We included children (<18 years) suspected of LB who visited the Lyme Center Apeldoorn of Gelre Hospital between 2008 and 2017. Serum samples were taken, and questionnaires on nonspecific symptoms completed. Clinical data were collected from patients' medical records. The prevalence of nonspecific symptoms was compared between patients with positive versus negative IgG serology and between patients with versus without previous LB with the χ and Fisher exact tests with Bonferroni correction. A history of LB was anamnestically determined. Patients with active Lyme manifestations were excluded. Included were 149 children (66% female; median age 13 years); 29 (19%) had positive IgG serology; 36 (24%) had previous LB; 12 (8%) had both. Common nonspecific symptoms were sleep disturbances (58%), severe fatigue (57%) and headache (42%). The prevalence of nonspecific symptoms was similar in children with positive versus negative IgG serology. None of the nonspecific symptoms occurred more frequently in children with previous LB compared with children without. More prevalent in children without previous LB were sleep disturbances (40 vs. 66%; P = 0.002) and tingling (6 vs. 34%; P < 0.001). Nonspecific symptoms were not more prevalent in children with positive IgG serology nor in children with previous LB, where some were significantly less prevalent. Hence, questionnaires on nonspecific symptoms cannot be used to identify children for serologic testing in Lyme centers."

		"abstract": "A growing global health concern, Lyme disease has become the most common tick-borne disease in the United States and Europe. Caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl), this disease can be debilitating if not treated promptly. Because diagnosis is challenging, prevention remains a priority; however, a previously licensed vaccine is no longer available to the public. Here, we designed a six component vaccine that elicits antibody (Ab) responses against all Borrelia strains that commonly cause Lyme disease in humans. The outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia was fused to a bacterial ferritin to generate self-assembling nanoparticles. OspA-ferritin nanoparticles elicited durable high titer Ab responses to the seven major serotypes in mice and non-human primates at titers higher than a previously licensed vaccine. This response was durable in rhesus macaques for more than 6 months. Vaccination with adjuvanted OspA-ferritin nanoparticles stimulated protective immunity from both B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii infection in a tick-fed murine challenge model. This multivalent Lyme vaccine offers the potential to limit the spread of Lyme disease."

Chagas' cardiomyopathy is a progressive process that can evolve into a dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure several decades after the acute infection; in contrast, although early-disseminated Lyme carditis has been relatively well characterized, the sequelae of Lyme disease on the heart are less well-defined. A century of research on Chagas' cardiomyopathy has generated compelling data for pathophysiological models, evaluated the efficacy of therapy in large randomized controlled trials, and explored the social determinants of health impacting preventative measures. Recognizing the commonalities between Chagas' disease and Lyme disease, we speculate on whether some of the lessons learned from Chagas' cardiomyopathy may be applicable to Lyme carditis."

		"abstract": "Recently, disulfiram has been proposed as a promising treatment for people suffering from persistent symptoms of Lyme Disease. Disulfiram has several distinct molecular targets. The most well-known is alcohol dehydrogenase, a key enzyme for detoxifying the organism after alcohol ingestion. Other targets and modes of action of disulfiram, that may present problematic side effects, are less commonly mentioned. The French Federation against Tick Borne Diseases (French acronym, FFMVT), which associates three main Lyme patient organizations, MDs and PhDs, has recently been alerted to severe and persistent toxic events in a patient suffering from a late disseminated form of Lyme Disease following disulfiram intake. FFMVT reacted by launching a national call to examine whether other patients in France following a similar treatment could be identified, and what benefits, or side effects could be reported. The statements of 16 patients taking disulfiram have been collected and are presented here. Thirteen out of 16 patients reported toxic events, and seven out of 16 reported benefits for at least part of their symptoms. Based on the collected observations, it seems too early to promote disulfiram as a promising new treatment until the reasons underlying the reported toxicities have been explored, and the results of a well-conducted double blind clinical trial published. The importance of taking into account patient-reported outcomes in Lyme Disease is underlined by the present study."

Infection results in Lyme disease with possible cardiac manifestations, which is also known as Lyme carditis. Patients can present with bradycardia due to rapidly fluctuating atrioventricular block (AVB), which is the hallmark of Lyme carditis. However, we present a rare case of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) without AVB in a 47-year-old man with Lyme disease. He initially presented with a headache and subsequently developed new onset bradycardia and a right cranial nerve (CN) VI palsy with diplopia. B. burgdorferi enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screen and IgM western blot were positive. He was admitted to the intensive care unit. Electrocardiography (EKG) indicated a heart rate in the high 30 s beats per minute (BPM) with several pauses, but no AVB was present. The patient responded well to therapy, and was discharged with an outpatient regimen of doxycycline. Lyme carditis should be considered in patients who develop new onset bradycardia and live in endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) spirochetes include the agents of Lyme borreliosis in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and merge their transmission cycles mainly with ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. Twenty genospecies compose Bbsl currently, and with the exception of Borrelia chilensis, and Borrelia garinii, all have been described only for North America, Europe, North Africa, and Asia. Here, we collected specimens of Ixodes paranaensis, a tick associated with swifts in a Brazilian natural park from the state of Minas Gerais, and performed a molecular characterization of 11 borrelial genes. Based on comparisons of inter and intraspecific genetic divergences, and Bayesian phylogenetic trees inferred for 16S rRNA, flaB, p66, and concatenated clpA, clpX, pepX, pyrG, recG, nifS rlpB, and uvrA genes, we demonstrate the occurrence of a new genospecies of Bbsl. \"Candidatus Borrelia ibitipoquensis\" Ip37 is closely related to Borrelia sp. Am501, and Borrelia valaisiana, a spirochete transmitted by ticks of the I. ricinus complex in Eurasia that uses birds as reservoirs. In a similar ecological scenario involving ticks and avian hosts, the migratory swift Streptoprocne biscutata is the sole-documented bird associated with I. paranaensis, and, although not assessed in this study, could correspond to the vertebrate reservoir of this newly described genospecies in Brazil. Pathogenic roles of \"Ca. B. ibitipoquensis\" are still unknown. However, its possible vector I. paranaensis is not an anthropophilic tick, so human infections would be unlikely to occur. Our finding enhances the knowledge on Bbsl in South America, highlights the occurrence of ecologically and genetically related genospecies with vastly separated geographical distributions, and calls for the attention to explore a barely known diversity of spirochetes of this group in the region."

		"abstract": "For the development of sustainable control of tick-borne diseases, insight is needed in biological factors that affect tick populations. Here, the ecological interactions among Ixodiphagus hookeri, Ixodes ricinus, and two vertebrate species groups were investigated in relation to their effects on tick-borne disease risk. In 1129 questing ticks, I. hookeri DNA was detected more often in I. ricinus nymphs (4.4%) than in larvae (0.5%) and not in adults. Therefore, we determined the infestation rate of I. hookeri in nymphs from 19 forest sites, where vertebrate, tick, and tick-borne pathogen communities had been previously quantified. We found higher than expected co-occurrence rates of I. hookeri with deer-associated Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and lower than expected rates with rodent-associated Borrelia afzelii and Neoehrlichia mikurensis. The prevalence of I. hookeri in nymphs varied between 0% and 16% and was positively correlated with the encounter probability of ungulates and the densities of all life stages of I. ricinus. Lastly, we investigated the emergence of I. hookeri from artificially fed, field-collected nymphs. Adult wasps emerged from seven of the 172 fed nymphs. From these observations, we inferred that I. hookeri is parasitizing I. ricinus larvae that are feeding on deer, rather than on rodents or in the vegetation. Since I. hookeri populations depend on deer abundance, the main propagation host of I. ricinus, these wasps have no apparent effect on tick populations. The presence of I. hookeri may directly interfere with the transmission cycle of A. phagocytophilum, but not with that of B. afzelii or N. mikurensis."

One class of sRNAs, termed trans-acting sRNAs, can affect the stability and/or the translational efficiency of regulated transcripts. In this study, we utilized a collaborative approach that employed data from infection with the Borrelia burgdorferi Tn library, coupled with Tn-seq, together with borrelial sRNA and total RNA transcriptomes, to identify an intergenic trans-acting sRNA, which we designate here as ittA for infectivity-associated and tissue-tropic sRNA locus A. The genetic inactivation of ittA resulted in a significant attenuation in infectivity, with decreased spirochetal load in ear, heart, skin and joint tissues. In addition, the ittA mutant did not disseminate to peripheral skin sites or heart tissue, suggesting a role for ittA in regulating a tissue-tropic response. RNA-Seq analysis determined that 19 transcripts were differentially expressed in the ittA mutant relative to its genetic parent, including vraA, bba66, ospD and oms28 (bba74). Subsequent proteomic analyses also showed a significant decrease of OspD and Oms28 (BBA74) proteins. To our knowledge this is the first documented intergenic sRNA that alters the infectivity potential of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is one of the major tick-borne diseases in Europe. Events of the translocation of Borrelia across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) involve multiple interactions between borrelial surface proteins and receptors on the brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs). In this study, we aimed to identify proteins of Borrelia that plausibly interact with hBMECs. The surface proteome of live Borrelia (a neuroinvasive strain of B. garinii) was crosslinked with biotin prior to its incubation with hBMECs. The interacting proteins were recovered by affinity purification, followed by SWATH-MS. Twenty-four interacting candidates were grouped into outer membrane proteins (n = 12) and inner membrane proteins (n = 12) based on the subcellular location as per the predictions of LocateP. Other algorithms like TMHMM 2.0 and LipoP, ontology search and literature review were subsequently applied to each of the identified protein candidates to shortlist the most probable interactors. Six proteins namely, LysM domain protein, BESBP-5, Antigen S1, CRASP-1 (Bg071), Erp23 protein and Mlp family Lipoprotein were selected to produce their recombinant forms and experimentally validate their interaction with hBMECs. All the recombinant proteins interacted with hBMECs, in ELISA and immunocytochemistry. We present here a high-throughput approach of generating a dataset of plausible borrelial ligands followed by a systematic bioinformatic pipeline to categorize the proteins for experimental validation."

		"abstract": "Tickborne diseases that affect patients in the United States include Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, babesiosis, tularemia, Colorado tick fever, and tickborne relapsing fever. Tickborne diseases are increasing in incidence and should be suspected in patients presenting with flulike symptoms during the spring and summer months. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can prevent complications and death. Location of exposure, identification of the specific tick vector, and evaluation of rash, if present, help identify the specific disease. Lyme disease presents with an erythema migrans rash in 70% to 80% of patients, and treatment may be initiated based on this finding alone. RMSF presents with a macular rash starting on the wrists, forearms, and ankles that becomes petechial. RMSF has a higher rate of mortality than other tickborne diseases; therefore, empiric treatment with doxycycline is recommended for all patients, including pregnant women and children, when high clinical suspicion is present. Testing patient-retrieved ticks for infections is not recommended. Counseling patients on the use of protective clothing and tick repellents during outdoor activities can help minimize the risk of infection. Prophylactic treatment after tick exposure in patients without symptoms is generally not recommended but may be considered within 72 hours of tick removal in specific patients at high risk of Lyme disease."

The Upper Midwest, particularly Wisconsin and Minnesota, are endemic to a diversity of tick-transmitted infectious diseases. Although Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, still accounts for the majority of diagnosed infections, I scapularis is known to transmit other bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents. To provide an overview of the array of pathogenic microorganisms carried by I scapularis ticks in the Upper Midwest. A literature review was conducted to collect and analyze current information about I scapularis lifestyle, transmission, microorganisms carried by the arthropod vector, and the diseases that occur as a result of infections with these microorganisms in the Upper Midwest. Diagnosis of co-infection from tick-borne zoonosis in humans has increased over the last 2 decades. Since I scapularis can transmit multiple pathogens, it is clinically important because different diagnostic testing and treatment strategies may need to be implemented for a patient with I scapularis-borne infection(s). This review has concentrated on I scapularis-transmitted diseases affecting the Upper Midwest and has explored the ecology of the I scapularis vector and its role in pathogen transmission."

		"abstract": "Global warming and the associated climate changes are predictable. They are enhanced by burning of fossil fuels and the emission of huge amounts of CO2 gas which resulted in greenhouse effect. It is expected that the average global temperature will increase with 2-5 °C in the next decades. As a result, the earth will exhibit marked climatic changes characterized by extremer weather events in the coming decades, such as the increase in temperature, rainfall, summertime, droughts, more frequent and stronger tornadoes and hurricanes. Epidemiological disease cycle includes host, pathogen and in certain cases intermediate host/vector. A complex mixture of various environmental conditions (e.g. temperature and humidity) determines the suitable habitat/ecological niche for every vector host. The availability of suitable vectors is a precondition for the emergence of vector-borne pathogens. Climate changes and global warming will have catastrophic effects on human, animal and environmental ecosystems. Pathogens, especially neglected tropical disease agents, are expected to emerge and re-emerge in several countries including Europe and North America. The lives of millions of people especially in developing countries will be at risk in direct and indirect ways. In the present review, the role of climate changes in the spread of infectious agents and their vectors is discussed. Examples of the major emerging viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases are also summarized."

Our aim was to substantiate the value of CXCL13 in a large unselected cohort and determine a practical cut-off value to diagnose LNB. We retrospectively studied clinical and CSF data of consecutive patients who underwent CSF CXCL13 testing over a period of three years (February 2015 to January 2018) at our academic teaching hospital. Patients were classified into 12 groups according to their final diagnosis. To diagnose LNB (definite or probable/possible), definitions of the respective guideline of the German Neurological Society were applied. Of 1410 patients, 29 were diagnosed with definite LNB and 9 with probable/possible LNB. Median CXCL13 levels were highly elevated in both LNB groups (554 pg/mL and 649 pg/mL, respectively) and the group with bacterial/fungal CNS infections (410 pg/mL; n = 6), while all other groups had markedly lower median CXCL13 levels (p < .001). For definite LNB, the best CXCL13 test cut-off was 55.5 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 96.6% (95% confidence interval, CI, 80.4%-99.8%) and a specificity of 94.9% (95% CI 93.5%-95.9%). All patients with LNB showed clinical improvement after antibiotic treatment. In this large monocentric cohort, CSF CXCL13 was found to be a highly sensitive and useful marker for LNB. In conditions with low index of suspicion for LNB, CXCL13 testing may be unwarranted. A review of the literature on the sensitivity and specificity of CSF CXCL13 in the differential of LNB is provided."

		"abstract": "Neuroborreliosis (NB) and neurosyphilis (NS) are abnormal conditions caused by spirochetal bacteria which affect the nervous system. Diagnosis of neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis is determined by clinical examination of visible symptoms, serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and serological detection of antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Treponema pallidum, respectively. Establishing a diagnosis may sometimes pose a number of diagnostic difficulties. A potential role of chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) as an accurate diagnostic biomarker of intrathecal inflammation has been suggested. In this review, we focused on changes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentration of chemokine ligand 13 in selected spirochetal neurological diseases neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis reported in the available literature. We performed an extensive search of the literature relevant to our investigation via the MEDLINE/PubMed database. It has been proven that CXCL13 determination can provide rapid information regarding central nervous system inflammation in patients with selected spirochetosis. We described that neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis are associated with an elevated CXCL13 concentration, mainly in the cerebrospinal fluid. Moreover, literature data suggest that CXCL13 determination is the most interesting additional marker for diagnosis and monitoring of neuroborreliosis and neurosyphilis thanks to its high sensitivity. Based on these published findings, we suggest that CXCL13 has high diagnostic utility and may be applied in laboratory diagnostics as a potential diagnostic marker in human spirochetal neurologic diseases."

Diagnostic criteria of Lyme disease based on the recommendation of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and criteria for the diagnosis of PS were used. PD was diagnosed by the criteria of the Parkinson's UK Brain Bank. Serological diagnosis of CB was carried out using immunoenzyme assay and immunoblotting in dynamics. The following scales were administered: HOEHN and YAHR, MMSE, MFI-20, CGI. All patients underwent MRI of the brain and spinal cord. PS in patients with CB in the Yaroslavl region was observed in 2.17% of cases among patients with CB and amounted to 0.25% of all cases of the revealed PS. The features that complicate the diagnosis of PS within chronic borreliosis were: the absence of erythema migrans in the history of 80% of patients and in more than half of the cases of the acute period of the disease, the presence in most patients (60%) of asymmetric onset of the PS with rest tremor in 40% cases and a significant reduction in the severity of PS as a result of therapy with levodopa. The onset of complete regression of the clinical manifestations of PS and reduction of the titer of antibodies and obtaining the negative results during dynamic serological study in response to prolonged antibiotic therapy provided a basis to verify the diagnosis of borreliosis with PS in these patients."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne disease surveillance in North America has long focused on Lyme disease, though there is currently a significant shift towards comprehensive pathogen surveillance in ticks. Central California has often been overlooked in regular tick-borne pathogen surveillance despite the presence of numerous medically important tick species. The bacterial genus Rickettsia contains tick-borne species that are known pathogens, such as those in the spotted fever group; nonpathogenic endosymbionts; and many species with unknown pathogenic potential. Five common tick species (Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls [Acari: Ixodidae], Dermacentor occidentalis Marx [Acari: Ixodidae], D. variabilis Say, Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latreille [Acari: Ixodidae], and Ornithodoros parkeri Cooley [Acari: Argasidae]) of California were collected by both traditional and modern techniques, and subsequently screened for Rickettsia spp. Many individuals from all five tick species were PCR positive for Rickettsia spp., and a combination of species-specific primers, a restriction fragment length polymorphism assay, and DNA sequencing was used to further characterize the species composition in these ticks. Probable Rickettsia philipii (Rickettsia 364D) was detected in one (1.56%) D. occidentalis collected in Fresno County; R. rhipicephali was detected in 23.4% of D. occidentalis from Fresno Co.; R. bellii was detected in 88.2% of D. variabilis, 7.8% of D. occidentalis, and in one R. rhipicephalus (1.1%) from Fresno Co.; R. monacensis str. Humboldt was detected in three (100%) of I. pacificus collected in both Fresno and Madera Co.; and an uncharacterized Rickettsia was detected in (26.4%) of O. parkeri collected in both Fresno and Madera Co. The findings in this study highlight the need for ongoing surveillance in this region of California."

		"abstract": "The deer tick Ixodes scapularis transmits a variety of disease agents in the United States, spreading the bacteria that causes Lyme borreliosis, the protozoan agent of babesiosis, and viruses such as Powassan. However, a variety of other organisms have also evolved symbiotic relationships with this tick species, and it seems likely that some of these microbes have simultaneously coevolved mechanisms to impact each other and their tick host. The number of organisms identified as I. scapularis symbionts has increased seemingly exponentially with the advent of PCR and next generation sequencing technologies, but convincing arguments have proposed that some of these are of environmental origin, unadapted to surviving the physiological conditions of the tick or that they are artifacts of ultrasensitive detection methods. In this review, we examine the diversity of the known microbes occurring within the I. scapularis microbiome, the evidence for interactions between microbes, and discuss whether some organisms reported to be symbionts of I. scapularis are experimental artifacts."

		"abstract": "Compared to the standard two-tiered testing (STTT) algorithm for Lyme disease serology using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) followed by Western blotting, data from the United States suggest that a modified two-tiered testing (MTTT) algorithm employing two EIAs has improved sensitivity to detect early localized Borrelia burgdorferi infections without compromising specificity. From 2011 to 2014, in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, where Lyme disease is hyperendemic, sera submitted for Lyme disease testing were subjected to a whole-cell EIA, followed by C6 EIA and subsequently IgM and/or IgG immunoblots on sera with EIA-positive or equivocal results. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of the MTTT algorithm compared to the STTT approach in a Nova Scotian population. Retrospective chart reviews were performed on patients testing positive with the whole-cell and C6 EIAs (i.e., the MTTT algorithm). Patients were classified as having Lyme disease if they had a positive STTT result, a negative STTT result but symptoms consistent with Lyme disease, or evidence of seroconversion on paired specimens. Of the 10,253 specimens tested for Lyme disease serology, 9,806 (95.6%) were negative. Of 447 patients who tested positive, 271 charts were available for review, and 227 were classified as patients with Lyme disease. The MTTT algorithm detected 25% more early infections with a specificity of 99.56% (99.41 to 99.68%) compared to the STTT. These are the first Canadian data to show that serology using a whole-cell sonicate EIA followed by a C6 EIA (MTTT) had improved sensitivity for detecting early B. burgdorferi infection with specificity similar to that of two-tiered testing using Western blots."

We attempted to determine the prevalence of antibodies against several vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens among homeless adults living in Marseille. During the 2005-2015 period, we collected sera samples from 821 homeless adults living in shelters. Antibodies against Bartonella quintana, Bartonella henselae, Borrelia recurrentis, Coxiella burnetii, Francisella tularensis (with a cut-off of 1:100), Rickettsia akari, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia felis, Rickettsia prowazekii, and Rickettsia typhi (with a cut-off of 1:64) were searched by microimmunofluorescence (MIF). MIF-positive serum samples were confirmed by cross-adsorption to characterise cross-reacting antigens and immunoblotting. Positive sera by Western blot were further tested using qPCR. We evidenced a prevalence of 4.9% seroreactivity to at least one pathogen including phase II C. burnetii (2.1%), B. quintana (1.7%), R. conorii (0.4%), R. prowazekii (0.4%), R. typhi (0.1%), B. recurrentis (0.1%), and F. tularensis (0.1%). No DNA from any pathogens was detected. A comparison with studies conducted prior to the 2000-2003 period showed a decrease in the overall seroprevalence of several vector-borne and zoonotic infections."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). After an initial tick bite, it spreads from the deposition site in the dermis to distant tissues of the host. It is generally believed that this spirochete disseminates via the hematogenous route. Borrelia persica causes relapsing fever and is able to replicate in the blood stream. Currently the exact dissemination pathway of LB pathogens in the host is not known and controversially discussed. In this study, we established a strict intravenous infection murine model using host-adapted spirochetes. Survival capacity and infectivity of host-adapted B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) were compared to those of B. persica (Bp) after either intradermal (ID) injection into the dorsal skin of immunocompetent mice or strict intravenous (IV) inoculation via the jugular vein. By in vitro culture and PCR, viable spirochetes and their DNA load in peripheral blood were periodically monitored during a 49/50-day course post-injection, as well as in various tissue samples collected at day 49/50. Specific antibodies in individual plasma/serum samples were detected with serological methods. Regardless of ID or IV injection, DNA of Bp was present in blood samples up to day 24 post-challenge, while no Bbss was detectable in the blood circulation during the complete observation period. In contrast to the brain tropism of Bp, Bbss spirochetes were found in ear, skin, joint, bladder, and heart tissue samples of only ID-inoculated mice. All tested tissues collected from IV-challenged mice were negative for traces of Bbss. ELISA testing of serum samples showed that Bp induced gradually increasing antibody levels after ID or IV inoculation, while Bbss did so only after ID injection but not after IV inoculation. This study allows us to draw the following conclusions: (i) Bp survives in the blood and disseminates to the host's brain via the hematogenous route; and (ii) Bbss, in contrast, is cleared rapidly from the blood stream and is a tissue-bound spirochete."

Human disease caused by B. miyamotoi was first described in Russia and later in the USA and Japan. Additionally, five cases of meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised patients and one case in an apparently immunocompetent patient were described. We investigated the presence of B. miyamotoi in I. ricinus nymphs and in patients suspected of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, in Alsace (France), an endemic area for I. ricinus ticks and Lyme borreliosis, using direct (PCR) and indirect diagnosis (glycerophosphoryldiester-phosphodiesterase (GlpQ) serology). Borrelia miyamotoi was found in 2.2% of 4354 ticks collected between 2013 and 2016. None of the 575 blood samples, collected from the patients suspected of HGA, was found positive for B. miyamotoi by PCR. Acute and late sera from 138 of these 575 patients were available. These paired sera were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies against the B. miyamotoi GlpQ antigen. A total of 14 out of 138 patients had at least one positive parameter (i.e. anti-GlpQ IgG and/or IgM). One patient seroconverted for IgG, and three had isolated IgM in the acute serum. These three patients were treated with doxycycline which could have prevented seroconversion. After reviewing clinical data and other biological tests performed, co-exposure among different microorganisms vectored by ticks or serological cross-reactivity could not be ruled out in these different cases. One patient had persistent IgG, which strongly suggests previous exposure to B. miyamotoi. Humans can be exposed to B. miyamotoi through tick bites in Alsace. We present serological data for possible B. miyamotoi exposure or infection of patients with fever after tick bite. Future studies should determine the incidence, clinical course and burden of this emerging tick-borne disease in other parts of Western Europe."

Our goal was to use expert consensus to develop a daily measurement instrument for assessing clinical improvement in children with Lyme meningitis. We assembled a panel of 24 nationally recognized Lyme disease experts to develop a pediatric daily symptom measurement instrument. Experts responded to four rounds of surveys, receiving feedback about the previous round prior to each subsequent round with anonymity for participants and responses. Using modified Delphi methods, we established a novel Lyme meningitis outcome instrument. The final Pediatric Lyme Meningitis Symptom Measurement instrument includes five items: headache (Likert scale), neck pain/stiffness (Likert scale), fever (yes/no), light sensitivity (yes/no) and vision problems (yes/no). We defined three consecutive days with a symptom score of zero as the minimum to define clinical improvement. Using expert consensus, we developed a novel Pediatric Lyme Meningitis Symptom Measurement instrument to measure treatment response daily for children with Lyme meningitis enrolled in clinical studies."

Despite this, there is limited published data regarding Lyme disease patients accessing primary care in the UK. We aim to describe trends in the incidence of a new diagnosis, and demographics of patients identified in a primary care electronic health database. A descriptive epidemiological study of Lyme disease coded patients in UK primary care. 3725 patients coded for Lyme disease during 1998-2016 were identified within The Health Improvement Network (THIN). Incidence rates and the demographics of cases identified were described. Poisson regression was used to analyse socio-demographic characteristics of the cases. There was an increase in annual crude incidence rates, peaking in 2015 at 5.47 (95% CI 4.85-6.14) cases per 100,000 population per year. Multivariable analysis showed there were significant differences in the ages of those affected, incidence of a new diagnosis rose as deprivation levels improved, and that there was a higher incidence of cases living in rural areas compared to urban areas. There was no significant difference between sexes for the UK. Cases were significantly more likely to identify with being white compared to the national population. An increasing incidence of patients newly coded with Lyme disease related Read codes was identified using data from a UK national primary care database. By comparing these incidence figures with national laboratory-confirmed surveillance data, a multiplication factor of 2.35 (95%CI 1.81-2.88) can be calculated in order to estimate the annual number of cases seen in primary care. The significant socio-demographic variables associated with a Lyme disease diagnosis likely reflect a complex interplay of socio-economic issues, which needs to be further explored. Future work is needed to examine the treatment and management of patients within this database."

The biological impacts of A. sagrei invading California are currently unknown. Evidence from the invasion in Taiwan shows that they spread quickly and when immediate action is not taken eradication stops being a viable option. In Orange County, California, five urban sites, each less than 100 ha, were surveyed for an average of 49.2 min. Approximately 200 A. sagrei were seen and verified across all survey sites. The paucity of native lizards encountered during the surveys within these sites suggests little to no overlap between the dominant diurnal western fence lizard, Sceloporus occidentalis, and A. sagrei. This notable lack of overlap could indicate a potentially disturbing reality that A. sagrei are driving local extirpations of S. occidentalis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the USA, Canada, and Europe. Clinical manifestations vary greatly, with localized skin findings functioning as early signs of the disease, followed by disseminated disease. The rarest dermatologic presentation of Lyme is a borrelial lymphocytoma, occurring distinctly in Europe and caused typically by Borrelia afzelii. We report a case of a Caucasian 5-year-old European-American boy with slowly progressing, painless edema and erythema of his right pinna. Travel history revealed significant exposure to ticks during a recent trip to Eastern Europe. Laboratory testing for Borrelia burgdorferi demonstrated mixed positivity. He was treated with a 21-day course of amoxicillin, with complete resolution of symptoms and no sign of secondary Lyme disease. Borrelial lymphocytoma is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease in North America, although not uncommon in Europe. Diagnosis is made by the presence of a painless erythematous swelling typically found on the ear lobe, nipples, or testes. Laboratory tests are available but with low sensitivity, therefore, a high index of suspicion is necessary for a clinical diagnosis to be made. Treatment for isolated borrelial lymphocytoma is doxycycline 4 mg/kg up to 100 mg twice daily, whereas for children less than 8 years of age amoxicillin 50 mg/kg divided three times daily, for 3-4 weeks, is preferred."

		"abstract": "With more than 300,000 new cases reported each year in the United States of America (USA), Lyme disease is a major public health concern. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) is considered the primary agent of Lyme disease in North America. However, multiple genetically diverse Borrelia species encompassing the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex and the Relapsing Fever Borrelia (RFB) group are capable of causing tickborne disease. We report preliminary results of a serological survey of previously undetected species of Bbsl and RFB in California and Mexico using a novel immunoblot technique. Serum samples were tested for seroreactivity to specific species of Bbsl and RFB using an immunoblot method based on recombinant Borrelia membrane proteins, as previously described. A sample was recorded as seropositive if it showed immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or IgG reactivity with at least two proteins from a specific Borrelia species. The patient cohort consisted of 90 patients residing in California or Mexico who met the clinical case definition of chronic Lyme disease. Immunoblot testing revealed that 42 patients were seropositive for Bbsl (Group 1), while 56 patients were seropositive for RFB (Group 2). Eight patients were seropositive for both Bbsl and RFB species. Group 1 included patients who were seropositive for Bbss (14), B. californiensis (eight), B. spielmanii (10), B. afzelii/B. garinii (10), and mixed infections that included B. mayonii (three). Group 2 included patients who were seropositive for B. hermsii (nine), B. miyamotoi (seven), B. turicatae (nine), and B. turcica (two). In the remaining Group 1 and Group 2 patients, the exact Borrelia species could not be identified using the immunoblot technique. Lyme disease is associated with a diverse group of Borrelia species in California and Mexico. Current testing for Lyme disease focuses on detection of Bbss, possibly resulting in missed diagnoses and failure to administer appropriate antibiotic therapy in a timely manner. The genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes must be considered in future Lyme disease test development."

Objectives: We estimated the prevalence of questing blacklegged ticks vectoring three zoonotic pathogens in Vilas County, Wisconsin. Materials and Methods: We collected 461 adult blacklegged ticks and used PCR to screen for the presence of pathogens that cause Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA, Anaplasma phagocytophilum), and babesiosis (Babesia microti). Results: We found that 52.5% of ticks carried at least one pathogen. The estimated infection prevalence in the tick population was 17.4% (Lyme disease), 14.3% (HGA), and 6.5% (babesiosis). Multiple pathogens were present in 14.3% of ticks surveyed. Conclusion: About half of questing ticks tested in this study carried at least one zoonotic pathogen. Coinfection was common in our study area and, if not properly recognized, leads to greater risk of underdiagnosis."

		"abstract": "In many cases, atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with a history of cardiac inflammation. One of the potential pathogens responsible for atrial inflammation might be Borrelia burgdorferi - a pathogen involved in Lyme carditis. This study aimed to assess whether the serological history of Borrelia infection was associated with the risk of AF. The study included 113 AF patients and 109 patients in sinus rhythm. All patients underwent a clinical evaluation, echocardiography and had their blood taken for the assessment of anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies. Patients with AF compared with the non-AF group had more often serological signs of Borrelia infection (34.5% vs 6.4%; p <0.0001). The multivariate analysis showed that positive results for anti-Borrelia IgG antibodies were a strong independent predictor of AF (odds ratio 8.21; 95% confidence interval 3.08 to 21.88; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, presented data show that exposure to Borrelia spp. infection is associated with an increased risk of AF. Whether the early treatment of Lyme disease lowers the risk of AF development remains to be explored."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are a growing threat to public health in the United States, especially among outdoor workers who experience high occupational exposure to ticks. Long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing has demonstrated high initial protection against bites from blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), in laboratory settings, and sustained protection against bites from the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae), in field tests. However, long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has not been field tested among outdoor workers who are frequently exposed to blacklegged ticks. We conducted a 2-yr randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial among 82 outdoor workers in Rhode Island and southern Massachusetts. Participants in the treatment arm wore factory-impregnated permethrin clothing, and the control group wore sham-treated clothing. Outdoor working hours, tick encounters, and bites were recorded weekly to assess protective effectiveness of long-lasting permethrin-impregnated garments. Factory-impregnated clothing significantly reduced tick bites by 65% in the first study year and by 50% in the second year for a 2-yr protective effect of 58%. No significant difference in other tick bite prevention method utilization occurred between treatment and control groups, and no treatment-related adverse outcomes were reported. Factory permethrin impregnation of clothing is safe and effective for the prevention of tick bites among outdoor workers whose primary exposure is to blacklegged ticks in the northeastern United States."

		"abstract": "To monitor the adoption of climate change adaptive behaviors in the population, public health authorities have to conduct national surveys, which can help them target vulnerable subpopulations. To ensure reliable estimates of the adoption of these preventive behaviors, many data collection methods are offered by polling firms. The aim of this study was to compare a telephone survey with a web survey on Lyme disease with regard to their representativeness. The data comes from a cross-sectional study conducted in the Province of Québec (Canada). In total, 1003 people completed the questionnaire by telephone and 956 filled in a web questionnaire. We compared the data obtained from both survey modes with the census data in regard to various demographic characteristics. We then compared the data from both samples in terms of self-reported Lyme disease preventive behaviors and other theoretically associated constructs. We also assessed the measurement invariance (equivalence) of the index of Lyme disease preventive behaviors across the telephone and web samples. Findings showed that neither the telephone nor the web panel modes of data collection can be considered more representative of the target population. The results showed that the proportion of item non-responses was significantly higher with the web questionnaire (5.6%) than with the telephone survey (1.3%), and that the magnitude of the differences between the two survey modes was nil for 19 out of the 30 items related to Lyme disease, and small for 11 of them. Results from invariance analyses confirmed the measurement invariance of an index of adaptation to Lyme disease, as well as the mean invariance across both samples. Our results suggested that both samples provided similar estimates of the level of adaptation to Lyme disease preventive behaviors. In sum, the results of our study showed that neither survey mode was superior to the other. Thus, in studies where adaptation to climate change is monitored over time, using a web survey instead of a telephone survey could be more cost-effective, and researchers should consider doing so in future surveys on adaptation to climate. However, we recommend conducting a pretest study before deciding whether to use both survey modes or only one of them."

The incidence of human diseases caused by pathogenic spirochetes, e.g., leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis, has been recently increased, posing a threat to public health. Mechanisms of spirochete pathogenicity are not yet fully understood, and no safe and effective vaccine to prevent and control the infection by pathogenic spirochetes is currently available. In this article, we review the progress of research into the pathogenic spirochete vaccine, mainly in terms of vaccine types. The development of relevant vaccines against pathogenic spirochetes has generally proceeded via several stages, such as the whole-cell inactivated vaccine, live attenuated vaccine, and gene-engineered vaccine, and will likely enter a new stage with the application of gene editing technology. In this review, we mainly summarized the types of pathogenic spirochete vaccines and conducted a preliminary analysis on the protective effect of immunity, and proposed a further prospect for the development of pathogenic spirochete vaccines."

Under laboratory conditions, a transovarial transmission to the next tick generation is described for Rickettsia spp. and Borrelia spp., especially regarding B. miyamotoi, whereas the efficiency of transovarial transfer under field conditions is largely unstudied. In order to better estimate the potential infection risk by tick larvae for humans and animals, 1500 I. ricinus larvae from 50 collected \"nests\" (larvae adhering to the flag in a clumped manner) were individually examined for Borrelia, Rickettsia and A. phagocytophilum DNA using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Thirty-nine of 50 nests each (78.0%, 95% CI: 64.0-88.5%) were positive for Borrelia spp. and Rickettsia spp. DNA, and in three nests (6.0%, 95% CI: 1.3-16.5%) A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected. Overall, DNA from at least one pathogen could be detected in 90.0% (45/50, 95% CI: 78.2-96.7%) of the nests. Of the 1500 larvae, 137 were positive for Borrelia spp. DNA (9.1%, 95% CI: 7.7-10.7%), 341 for Rickettsia spp. DNA (22.7%, 95% CI: 20.6-24.9%) and three for A. phagocytophilum DNA (0.2%, 95% CI: 0-0.6%). Quantity of Borrelia spp. and Anaplasma spp. DNA in positive larvae was low, with 2.7 × 100Borrelia 5S-23S gene copies and 2.4 × 101A. phagocytophilum msp2/p44 gene copies detected on average, while Rickettsia-positive samples contained on average 5.4 × 102gltA gene copies. Coinfections were found in 66.0% (33/50, 95% CI: 51.2-78.8%) of the nests and 8.6% (38/443, 95% CI: 6.1-11.6%) of positive larvae. In fact, larvae had a significantly higher probability of being infected with Borrelia spp. or Rickettsia spp. when both pathogens were present in the nest. This study provides evidence for transovarial transmission of Rickettsia spp. and Borrelia spp. in I. ricinus under field conditions, possibly facilitating pathogen persistence in the ecosystem and reducing the dependence on the presence of suitable reservoir hosts. Further studies are needed to prove transovarial transmission and to explain the surprisingly high proportion of nests containing Rickettsia and/or Borrelia DNA-positive larvae compared to infection rates in adult ticks commonly reported in other studies."

Some members of the spirochetes are pathogenic, including the causative agents of syphilis, Lyme disease, swine dysentery, and leptospirosis. Furthermore, their unique morphologies have attracted attention of structural biologists; however, the underlying physics of viscoelasticity-dependent spirochetal motility is a longstanding mystery. Elucidating the molecular basis of spirochetal invasion and interaction with hosts, resulting in the appearance of symptoms or the generation of asymptomatic reservoirs, will lead to a deeper understanding of host-pathogen relationships and the development of antimicrobials. Moreover, the mechanism of propulsion in fluids or on surfaces by the rotation of PFs within the narrow periplasmic space could be a designing base for an autonomously driving micro-robot with high efficiency. This review describes diverse morphology and motility observed among the spirochetes and further summarizes the current knowledge on their mechanisms and relations to pathogenicity, mainly from the standpoint of experimental biophysics."

		"abstract": "The Asian longhorned tick (Haemaphysalis longicornis) was reported for the first time in the U.S.A. in 2017 and has now spread across 12 states. The potential of this invasive tick vector to transmit pathogens will be determined through its association to hosts, such as the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus), which is the primary reservoir for the causative agent of Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi) and other zoonotic pathogens. Larval H. longicornis were placed on P. leucopus; 65% of the larvae (n = 40) moved off the host within a short period of time, and none engorged. By contrast, larval blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) did not move from where they were placed in the ear of the mouse. A laboratory behavioural assay was then conducted to assess the interaction of H. longicornis with the hair of potential mammalian host species in the U.S.A. H. longicornis larvae were significantly less likely to enter the hair zone of P. leucopus and humans compared to the hair of domestic cats, domestic dogs and white-tailed deer. This study identifies a tick-host interaction behaviour, which can be quantified in a laboratory assay to predict tick-host associations and provides insights into how ticks select a host."

		"abstract": "To investigate to what extent early Lyme borreliosis patients with erythema migrans are infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Three hundred ten patients from Poland with erythema migrans were included in the study. One hundred and eighty-three patients (59%) agreed to have both skin biopsy and blood samples analysed for Borrelia burgdorferi, A. phagocytophilum and 'Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis', with PCR. Positive samples were confirmed with sequencing. B. burgdorferi DNA was detected in 49.7% of the skin samples and in 1.1% of the blood samples. A. phagocytophilum DNA was found in 7.1% blood samples, and in 8.2% of the skin biopsies. In four patients, A. phagocytophilum DNA was detected only in blood; in one case A. phagocytophilum DNA was found simultaneously in blood and skin, and additionally in this patients' blood Borrelia DNA was detected. In four skin samples B. burgdorferi DNA was detected simultaneously with A. phagocytophilum DNA, indicative of a co-infection. A. phagocytophilum may be present in early Lyme borreliosis characterized by erythema migrans and should always be considered as a differential diagnostic following a tick bite and considered in treatment schemes, as these differs (in early stage of Lyme borreliosis doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil and azithromycin are recommended, while in anaplasmosis the most effective courses of treatment are doxycycline, rifampin and levofloxacin). Consequently, the role of A. phagocytophilum in erythema migrans should be further studied."

		"abstract": "The role of bats in the enzootic cycle of Lyme disease and relapsing fever-causing bacteria is a matter of speculation. In Canada, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) is the genospecies that is responsible for most cases of Lyme disease in humans. In this study, we determined if big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, have been exposed to spirochetes from the genus Borrelia. We collected serum from 31 bats and tested them for the presence of anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We detected cross-reactive antibodies to Borrelia spp. in 14 of 31 bats. We confirmed the ELISA data using a commercial immunoblot assay. Pooled sera from ELISA-positive bats also cross-reacted with Borrelia antigens coated on the immunoblot strips, whereas pooled sera from ELISA-negative bats did not bind to Borrelia spp. antigens. Furthermore, to identify if bat ectoparasites, such as mites, can carry Borrelia spp., we analyzed DNA from 142 bat ectoparasites that were collected between 2003 and 2019. We detected DNA for the Borrelia burgdorferi flaB gene in one bat mite, Spinturnix americanus. The low detection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in bat ectoparasites suggests that bats are not reservoirs of this bacterium. Data from this study also raises intriguing questions about Borrelia infections in bats, including the role of humoral immunity and the ability of bats to be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. This study can lead to more sampling efforts and controlled laboratory studies to identify if bats can be infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and the role of bat ectoparasites, such as S. americanus, in the transmission of this spirochete. Furthermore, we outlined reagents that can be used to adapt ELISA kits and immunoblot strips for use with bat sera."

Due to the increasing number of symptoms attributed to this infection, the diagnostic is often controversy between different specialists and is often a subject of discussion. The diagnostic of Lyme disease lays particularly on the knowledge of cutaneous signs which are the only specific. Despite recent scientific progress, microbiological diagnostic is still delicate and serological tests currently used do not differentiate between an active infection versus a serological marker. Here we describe the different clinical presentations of Lyme disease diagnosis and management procedures according to stages of evolution."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases are an important cause of human morbidity and mortality in the United States. The past several decades have witnessed an increase in both the number of recognized tick-borne pathogens and the number of tick-borne disease cases, whereas tick surveys have revealed substantial geographic expansions of tick populations throughout the country. Multiple laboratory testing options exist for diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, including serology, microscopy, and molecular-based methods. The preferred approach varies by the specific disease, locally available test options, and the stage of illness at patient presentation. Accurate and timely detection of tick-borne illness is of utmost importance, as prompt treatment is strongly linked to better outcomes. This review covers the clinical manifestations and preferred diagnostic approaches for important bacterial, viral, and parasitic tick-borne diseases in the United States, including Lyme disease, tick-borne relapsing fever, anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, spotted fever rickettsioses, and babesiosis. Infection with emerging pathogens such as Borrelia miyamotoi, Powassan virus, Heartland virus, Colorado tick fever virus, and Bourbon virus are also covered. Our understanding of tick-borne diseases in the United States continues to improve with the detection of novel pathogens and development of new diagnostic modalities. While conventional diagnostic methods, including serology and microscopy, will play an ongoing role in the diagnosis of tick-borne diseases, implementation of advanced molecular diagnostics will further broaden our understanding of these diseases by facilitating detection of emerging pathogens and providing more accurate and timely diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), are the primary vectors of Lyme disease in the U.S.A. In this study, adult ticks were observed on public trails exhibiting increasing levels of terrain complexity with a potential host nearby. The goal of this study was to (a) examine the extent to which adult ticks may actively search (vs. sit-and-wait) for a nearby host, (b) determine whether or not ticks could locate the position of the host in natural conditions and (c) determine the role of terrain complexity on the distances ticks travelled in a short period of time (30 min). Results indicate that, when a potential stationary host is within 50 cm, ticks will utilize an active-search strategy. The majority of ticks moved in the direction of the host in natural conditions. Finally, ticks in a less complex terrain were more active and travelled greater horizontal distances than ticks in a more complex terrain. In conclusion, the use of an active-search approach would likely increase the foraging success of ticks, especially in terrains with minimal complexity, near host animals that have stopped to rest or feed, reinforcing that humans should be vigilant about checking for ticks after being outdoors."

To date, the contribution of DksA to B. burgdorferi infection remains unknown. We report here that DksA is essential for B. burgdorferi to infect a mammalian host. dksA expression was highly induced during infection. Moreover, a dksA-deficient mutant was incapable of infecting mice. The mutant displayed growth defects when cultured in vitro and resistance to osmotic pressure was markedly reduced. These phenotypes were fully restored to those of the wild type when dksA mutation was complemented. We further showed that DksA controlled the expression of virulence-associated lipoprotein OspC, likely via the central alternative sigma factor RpoS. Synthesis of RpoS was abolished in the dksA mutant, but rpoS transcription remained unaffected. Additionally, we found that the expression of clpX, clpA, clpP, and clpP2 was significantly increased in the mutant, suggesting that DksA may post-transcriptionally regulate rpoS expression via its effect on ClpXP and/or ClpAP proteases. These combined data demonstrate that DksA regulates B. burgdorferi virulence at least partially through its influence on RpoS and OspC. This study thus elucidates that, in addition to function as a stringent response regulator, DksA promotes the transcription and/or translation of genes contributing to B. burgdorferi infectivity."

Antibody detection is the most frequently used laboratory test, favoring a two-step serodiagnostic algorithm; immunoenzymatic detection of antibodies to C6 has been shown to perform similarly to a standard two-step workflow. The aim of this study was the performance evaluation of the C6 Lyme ELISA kit compared to a standard two-step algorithm in three laboratories located in the northeastern region of Italy which cater to areas with different LD epidemiology. A total of 804 samples were tested, of which 695 gave concordant results between C6 testing and routine workflow (564 negative, 131 positive). Wherever available, clinical presentation and additional laboratory tests were analyzed to solve discrepancies. The C6 based method showed a good concordance with the standard two-step algorithm (Cohen's κ = 0.619), however, the distribution of discrepancies seems to point towards a slightly lower specificity of C6 testing, which is supported by literature and could impact on patient management. The C6 ELISA, therefore, is not an ideal stand-alone test; however, if integrated into a two-step algorithm, it might play a part in achieving a sensitive, specific laboratory diagnosis of LD."

Pregnant women represent the single largest vulnerable group in populations due to a relative immune deficiency status. Infections in pregnant women have the added gravity of potential infection in the developing fetus which may have catastrophic consequences including death in-utero or lifelong debilitation. Currently there is a paucity of data surrounding tick-borne infections in pregnancy and long-term outcomes for mother and infant for conditions like Lyme disease and co-infections. At present there are no established international surveillance systems to identify and gain understanding of these infections in pregnancy. Furthermore, the removal of Congenital Lyme Disease from ICD-11 codes hampers dialogue and characterization of borreliosis in pregnancy and stifles future developments of this understudied domain. This review makes the case for further study and re-opening a dialogue of tick-borne infections in pregnancy."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the major vector of Lyme disease in the Eastern United States. Each active life stage (larva, nymph, and adult) takes a blood meal either for developing and molting to the next stage (larvae and nymphs) or for oviposition (adult females). This protein-rich blood meal is the only food taken by Ixodes ticks and therefore efficient blood digestion is critical for survival. Studies in partially engorged ticks have shown that the initial stages of digestion are carried out by cathepsin proteases within acidic digestive cells. In this study, we investigated the potential role of serine proteases in blood digestion in replete ticks. RNA interference was used for functional analysis and a trypsin-benzoyl-D, L-arginine 4-nitoanilide assay was used to measure active trypsin levels. Hemoglobinolytic activity was determined in vitro, with or without a serine protease inhibitor. Our data suggest that trypsin levels increase significantly after repletion. Knockdown of serine proteases negatively impacted blood feeding, survival, fecundity, levels of active trypsin in the midgut, and resulted in lower hemoglobin degradation. Incubation of midgut extract with a trypsin inhibitor resulted in 65% lower hemoglobin degradation. We provide evidence of the serine proteases as digestive enzymes in fully engorged, replete females. Understanding the digestive profile of trypsin during blood meal digestion in I. scapularis improves our understanding of the basic biology of ticks and may lead to new methods for tick control."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne agents of disease continue to emerge and subsequently expand their geographic distribution. The threat to blood safety by tick-borne agents is ever increasing and requires constant surveillance concomitant with implementation of appropriate intervention methods. In April 2017, the Food and Drug Administration organized a public workshop on emerging tick-borne pathogens (excluding Babesia microti and Lyme disease) designed to provide updates on the current understanding of emerging tick-borne diseases, thereby allowing for extended discussions to determine if decisions regarding mitigation strategies need to be made proactively. Subject matter experts and other stakeholders participated in this workshop to discuss issues of biology, epidemiology, and clinical burden of tick-borne agents, risk of transfusion-transmission, surveillance, and considerations for decision making in implementing safety interventions. Herein, we summarize the scientific presentations, panel discussions, and considerations going forward."

		"abstract": "In the pre-antibiotic era, neurosyphilis (NS) was common, occurring in 34% of patients with syphilis. Currently, there has been a rising trend in syphilis with HIV-infected patients being more prone to develop NS. Ocular involvement is very rare in NS and accounts for only 1%-5% of the cases in the United States. We report the case of a 53-year-old male with a past medical history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and hyperlipidemia who presented to his ophthalmologist for blurred vision in both eyes. He had been noticing a black spot in the visual field of his left eye for two weeks. He had also noticed a rash on his forearms. His past and social history was significant for treated Lyme disease, having pet cats. He identified as a heterosexual male, married, and with five children. However, on further history taking, he reported a homosexual exposure about five years prior. He denied any history of genital ulcer or penile discharge. On examination at the ophthalmology clinic, he was found to have a visual acuity of 20/20 right eye and 20/100 left eye. Posterior segment examination of the both eyes showed subtle neuritis and vasculitis. Fundus photography revealed subtle neuroretinitis bilaterally. Work up was initiated for inflammatory and infectious causes. His rapid plasma reagin and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption showed positive titers for syphilis. His presentation was most consistent with ocular syphilis. A lumbar puncture (LP) was done with Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) positivity in the spinal fluid. He was therefore initiated on intravenous (IV) penicillin four million units every four hours for 14 days. His ophthalmology follow-up after one month showed both subjective and objective improvement in his visual symptoms. He also followed with the infectious disease team and a repeat LP done three months later showed nonreactive VDRL in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Ocular syphilis is increasing in incidence. Clinical presentation is variable, and a high index of suspicion with a low threshold for serological testing are important as early treatment can reverse retinal changes and restore visual acuity. There is a recommendation for CSF examination in all patients with ocular syphilis including HIV-negative cases. There have been studies showing a high CSF abnormal rate in HIV-negative patients with ocular syphilis. The recommended treatment for NS is aqueous crystalline penicillin G (18 to 24 million units per day, administered as three to four million units IV every four hours, or 24 million units daily as a continuous infusion) for 10 to 14 days. Follow-up is a key component of management with neurological examination and LP for CSF VDRL performed three months after treatment and every six months after, until the CSF is nonreactive for VDRL with normal white blood cell count. It is important to be cognizant of the rising trend of ocular syphilis, even in HIV-negative individuals. Early treatment is time sensitive to preventing permanent vision loss. Our case also emphasizes on thorough history taking, even for patients who appear to be at a low risk for sexually transmitted infections."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a functional homolog of canonical Lon protease termed Lon-2. In addition, B. burgdorferi encodes a second Lon homolog called Lon-1. Recent studies suggest that Lon-1 may function differently from the prototypical Lon protease. However, the function of Lon-1 in B. burgdorferi biology remains virtually unknown. Particularly, the contribution of Lon-1 to B. burgdorferi fitness and infection remains hitherto unexplored. Herein, we show that Lon-1 plays a critical role for the infection of B. burgdorferi in a mammalian host. We found that lon-1 was highly expressed during animal infection, implying an important function of this protein in bacterial infection. We further generated a lon-1 deletion mutant and an isogenic complemented strain. Relative to that of the wild-type strain, the infectivity of the mutant was severely attenuated in a murine infection model. Our data also showed that the mutant displayed growth defects in regular BSK-II medium. Furthermore, bacterial resistance to osmotic stress was markedly reduced when lon-1 was inactivated. When exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, survival of the lon-1 mutant was impaired. In addition, production of several virulence factors, such as BosR, RpoS, and OspC, was elevated in the mutant. These phenotypes were restored when the lon-1 mutation was complemented. Finally, we created a lon-1(S714A) mutant and found that this mutant failed to infect mice, suggesting that the proteolytic activity of Lon-1 is essential for bacterial infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Lon-1 is required by B. burgdorferi to infect animal hosts and to cope with environmental stresses."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease remains a contested illness in Canada, thereby making the diagnostic and treatment journeys difficult for some people. One outcome of this is that increasing numbers of people are turning to medical crowdfunding to support access to alternative therapies, non-local health care providers and assist with managing the costs of everyday life. In this analysis, we qualitatively explore the narratives shared in Canadians' crowdfunding campaigns to support Lyme disease treatment or diagnosis to identify whether or not any common elements shared in these narratives exist, and if so, what they are. We identified 238 campaigns for inclusion from three prominent crowdfunding platforms. Thematic analysis of the campaign narratives shows four consistent themes shared in these campaigns: what is lost (e.g. bodily ability), what is missing (e.g. local care options), what is sought (e.g. funds to cover treatment abroad) and what is hoped for (e.g. return to wellbeing). These themes demonstrate the highly personal and emotional nature of medical crowdfunding, particularly in the context of a contested illness that may lead some to question the legitimacy of one's financial need. This analysis contributes valuable new insights to the nascent scholarship on medical crowdfunding, and particularly to our understanding of how people communicate about their health and bodily needs on this public platform. It also identifies important directions for future research, including the potential for crowdfunding narratives to be used for advocacy."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), which is neurotropic, can attack the central nervous system (CNS), leading to the development of various neurologic symptoms. The pathogenesis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) remains poorly understood. Presently, there is a lack of knowledge of the changes in mRNA and proteins in the CNS following early disseminated Lyme disease. Explants from the frontal cortex of 3 rhesus brains were incubated with medium alone or with medium containing live Bb for 6, 12, or 24 hours. Then, we analyzed identified mRNA and proteins in the frontal cortex tissues, allowing for an in-depth view of the transcriptome and proteome for a macroscopic and unbiased understanding of early disseminated Lyme disease in the brain. Through bioinformatics analysis, a complex network of enriched pathways that were mobilized during the progression of Lyme spirochete infection was described. Furthermore, based on the analysis of omics data, translational regulation, glycosaminoglycan/proteoglycan-binding activity in colonization and dissemination to tissues, disease-associated genes, and synaptic function were enriched, which potentially play a role in pathogenesis during the interaction between frontal cortex tissues and spirochetes. These integrated omics results provide unbiased and comprehensive information for the further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of LNB."

		"abstract": "We characterized the antibody response to decorin-binding protein A (DbpA) or DbpB from immune serum samples collected from 27 dogs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to DbpA or DbpB were rarely detected, but high levels of IgG antibodies to DbpA were detected in 16 of 27 of the immune sera collected 1 mo after infection, 20 of 25 of the sera collected after 2 mo, and each of the 23, 17, or 11 serum samples evaluated after 3, 4, or 5 mo, respectively. In addition, IgG antibodies to DbpB were detected in 22 of 27 (p = 0.005) tested dogs after 1 mo, and the frequency of detecting the antibodies thereafter closely mimicked the antibody responses to DbpA. Moreover, antibodies to DbpA or DbpB were not produced by dogs vaccinated with a whole-cell B. burgdorferi bacterin; removing the antibodies to DbpA by adsorption to recombinant DbpA (rDbpA) did not affect the reactivity detected by a rDbpB ELISA. Therefore, the findings from our preliminary study showed that antigenically distinct antibodies to DbpA or DbpB are produced reliably during canine infection with B. burgdorferi, and the response is not confounded by vaccination with a Lyme disease bacterin. Larger studies are warranted to more critically evaluate whether detecting the antibody responses can improve serodiagnostic confirmation of canine Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multisystem infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi that mainly affects the joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Neurological complications usually manifest in untreated patients and present as meningitis, cranial neuropathies, and radiculoneuritis. The authors present the case of a 48-year-old male who developed loss of vision in the right eye over a period of two months. On physical examination a relative afferent pupillary defect of the right eye was noted. Visual evoked potential test revealed delayed P100 latency bilaterally, confirming a bilateral optic neuropathy. The analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a lymphocytic meningitis. After an extensive work-up, a diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis with meningitis and optic neuritis was made. The patient was treated with antibiotics and showed gradual improvement. The follow-up brain MRI revealed a mild T2 hyperintensity on the right optic nerve with gliosis, sequelae of the inflammatory process. Lyme disease should always be considered in patients from endemic areas with nonspecific symptoms. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is challenging, but prompt identification and treatment can prevent the development of complications and sequelae."

However, this approach suffers from a lack of sensitivity in early Lyme disease. Ongoing efforts to develop more sensitive antibody detection technologies and other diagnostic approaches are dependent upon the availability of quality-assured biospecimens linked to reliable clinical data. In this issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, Horn et al. (E. J. Horn, G. Dempsey, A. M. Schotthoefer, U. L. Prisco, et al., J Clin Microbiol 58:e00032-20, 2020, https://doi.org/10.1128/JCM.00032-20) described the development of the Lyme Disease Biobank. Clinically categorized case patients with early Lyme disease and healthy controls were identified (without laboratory diagnostic testing) from three sites where Lyme disease is endemic. Subjects provided whole blood and urine, which were processed and stored at a central biorepository. Whole blood, serum, and urine aliquots were prepared and are available to investigators developing laboratory diagnostics for Lyme disease. After obtaining samples, extensive laboratory testing was performed, including serologic and nucleic acid amplification testing for B. burgdorferi and other tick-borne pathogens. Direct detection methods yielded few positive results. Relative to the findings for another commonly used biorepository cohort, the results of this testing demonstrated a low seropositive rate, as determined by standard two-tiered testing. Additionally, relatively few subjects demonstrated seroconversion with testing of convalescent-phase samples. This clinical and serologically defined cohort of samples from Lyme disease and control cases from areas of Lyme disease endemicity offers an additional valuable resource for novel test development that includes alternate specimen types."

		"abstract": "Arp is an immunogenic protein of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and contributes to joint inflammation during infection. Despite Arp eliciting a strong humoral response, antibodies fail to clear the infection. Given previous evidence of immune avoidance mediated by the antigenically variable lipoprotein of B. burgdorferi, VlsE, we use passive immunization assays to examine whether VlsE protects the pathogen from anti-Arp antibodies. The results show that spirochetes are only able to successfully infect passively immunized mice when VlsE is expressed. Subsequent immunofluorescence assays reveal that VlsE prevents binding of Arp-specific antibodies, thereby providing an explanation for the failure of Arp antisera to clear the infection. The results also show that the shielding effect of VlsE is not universal for all B. burgdorferi cell-surface antigens. The findings reported here represent a direct demonstration of VlsE-mediated protection of a specific B. burgdorferi surface antigen through a possible epitope-shielding mechanism."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease, are becoming increasingly common in Europe. Lyme disease has a wide variety of clinical manifestations, as a result of which physicians of diverse disciplines are coming into contact with such patients. A 58-year-old man was seen at the emergency room with a symptomatic Wenckebach-type second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block and periods of 2:1 AV block. Four weeks previously the patient had noticed a red skin lesion on his left lower leg. Under the working diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme disease with cardiac involvement, treatment with ceftriaxone was started. This diagnosis was supported by a positive Borrelia PCR and culture of a skin biopsy and positive Borreliaserology. The AV conduction disorders resolved completely after 2 weeks of treatment with antibiotics and it was not necessary to implant a pacemaker. A Borrelia infection is a reversible but rare cause of AV conduction disorders. In the event of sudden onset of symptoms or a severe or progressive AV conduction disorder, Lyme carditis should be considered, especially if the medical history or physical examination provides clues for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Ticks and tickborne diseases are increasingly problematic. There have been positive developments that should result in improved strategies and better tools to suppress ticks, reduce human tick bites, and roll back tickborne diseases. However, we equally need to address the question of who is responsible for implementing the solutions. The current model of individual responsibility for tick control evolved from a scenario in the 1990s focusing strongly on exposure to blacklegged ticks and Lyme disease spirochetes in peridomestic settings of the northeastern United States. Today, the threat posed by human-biting ticks is more widespread across the eastern United States, increasingly complex (multiple tick species and >10 notable tickborne pathogens), and, across tick species, more spatially diffuse (including backyards, neighborhood green spaces, and public recreation areas). To mitigate tick-associated negative societal effects, we must consider shifting the responsibility for tick control to include both individual persons and professionally staffed tick-management programs."

		"abstract": "A bioinformatics approach was employed to identify transcriptome alterations in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of well-characterized human subjects who were diagnosed with early disseminated Lyme disease (LD) based on stringent microbiological and clinical criteria. Transcriptomes were assessed at the time of presentation and also at approximately 1 month (early convalescence) and 6 months (late convalescence) after initiation of an appropriate antibiotic regimen. Comparative transcriptomics identified 335 transcripts, representing 233 unique genes, with significant alterations of at least 2-fold expression in acute- or convalescent-phase blood samples from LD subjects relative to healthy donors. Acute-phase blood samples from LD subjects had the largest number of differentially expressed transcripts (187 induced, 54 repressed). This transcriptional profile, which was dominated by interferon-regulated genes, was sustained during early convalescence. 6 months after antibiotic treatment the transcriptome of LD subjects was indistinguishable from that of healthy controls based on two separate methods of analysis. Return of the LD expression profile to levels found in control subjects was concordant with disease outcome; 82% of subjects with LD experienced at least one symptom at the baseline visit compared to 43% at the early convalescence time point and only a single patient (9%) at the 6-month convalescence time point. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we developed an efficient computational framework to identify sets of 20 classifier genes that discriminated LD from other bacterial and viral infections. These novel LD biomarkers not only differentiated subjects with acute disseminated LD from healthy controls with 96% accuracy but also distinguished between subjects with acute and resolved (late convalescent) disease with 97% accuracy.IMPORTANCE Lyme disease (LD), caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in the United States. We examined gene expression patterns in the blood of individuals with early disseminated LD at the time of diagnosis (acute) and also at approximately 1 month and 6 months following antibiotic treatment. A distinct acute LD profile was observed that was sustained during early convalescence (1 month) but returned to control levels 6 months after treatment. Using a computer learning algorithm, we identified sets of 20 classifier genes that discriminate LD from other bacterial and viral infections. In addition, these novel LD biomarkers are highly accurate in distinguishing patients with acute LD from healthy subjects and in discriminating between individuals with active and resolved infection. This computational approach offers the potential for more accurate diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme disease. It may also allow improved monitoring of treatment efficacy and disease resolution."

		"abstract": "This study provides a novel method of documenting established populations of bird-feeding ticks. Single populations of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and the rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, were revealed in southwestern Québec, Canada. Blacklegged tick nymphs and, similarly, larval and nymphal rabbit ticks were tested for the Lyme disease bacterium, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl), using PCR and the flagellin (flaB) gene, and 14 (42%) of 33 of blacklegged tick nymphs tested were positive. In contrast, larval and nymphal H. leporsipalustris ticks were negative for Bbsl. The occurrence of Bbsl in I. scapularis nymphs brings to light the presence of a Lyme disease endemic area at this songbird nesting locality. Because our findings denote that this area is a Lyme disease endemic area, and I. scapularis is a human-biting tick, local residents and outdoor workers must take preventive measures to avoid tick bites. Furthermore, local healthcare practitioners must include Lyme disease in their differential diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Background:Borrelia species are divided into three groups depending on the induced disease and the tick vector. Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever Borrelia but can induce symptoms related to Lyme disease. Discovered in 1995, it is found in ticks around the world. In France, this species of Borrelia has been isolated in ticks and rodents, but was not yet observed in humans. Objective: The aim of the study was to look for B. miyamotoi in symptomatic patients. Methods: Real-time PCR was performed on 824 blood samples from patients presenting symptoms of persistent polymorphic syndrome possibly due to tick bite, a syndrome recognized by the French Authority for Health, which is close to the post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. PCR was also performed on 24 healthy control persons. The primers were specifically designed for this particular species of Borrelia. The sequence of interest of 94 bp is located on the glpQ gene. Sequencing of amplification products, randomly chosen, confirmed the amplification specificity. To better investigate cases, a clinical questionnaire was sent to the patients PCR-positive for B. miyamotoi and to their physician. Results: This search revealed a positive PCR for B. miyamotoi in the blood from 43 patients out of 824 (5.22%). PCR was negative in all control persons. A clinical chart was obtained from 31 of the 43 patients. A history of erythema migrans was reported in five of these 31 patients (16%). All patients complained about fatigue, joint pain and neuro-cognitive disorders. Some patients complained about respiratory problems (chest tightness and/or lack of air in 41.9%). Episodes of relapsing fever were reported by 11 of the 31 patients (35.5%). Chilliness, hot flushes and/or sweats were reported by around half of the patients. B. miyamotoi may not cross-react with B. burgdorferi serology. Conclusion: This study is the first to detect B. miyamotoi in human blood in France. This series of human B. miyamotoi infection is the largest in patients with long term persistent syndrome. Our data suggest that this infection may be persistent, even on the long term."

		"abstract": "Ticks are important human and animal parasites and vectors of many infectious disease agents. Control of tick activity is an effective tool to reduce the risk of contracting tick-transmitted diseases. The castor bean tick (Ixodes ricinus) is the most common tick species in Europe. It is also a vector of the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis, which are two of the most important arthropod-borne diseases in Europe. In recent years, increases in tick activity and incidence of tick-borne diseases have been observed in many European countries. These increases are linked to many ecological and anthropogenic factors such as landscape management, climate change, animal migration, and increased popularity of outdoor activities or changes in land usage. Tick activity is driven by many biotic and abiotic factors, some of which can be effectively managed to decrease risk of tick bites. In the USA, recommendations for landscape management, tick host control, and tick chemical control are well-defined for the applied purpose of reducing tick presence on private property. In Europe, where fewer studies have assessed tick management strategies, the similarity in ecological factors influencing vector presence suggests that approaches that work in USA may also be applicable. In this article we review key factors driving the tick exposure risk in Europe to select those most conducive to management for decreased tick-associated risk."

A total of 2215 serum samples collected from 938 companion dogs, 969 shelter dogs, and 308 military working dogs were examined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect fluorescence immunoassay (IFA) kits. Data collected for each animal, including breed, sex, age, region, season, and dog type, were used for statistical analysis. The overall seroprevalence was highest for Anaplasma spp. (15.1 %), followed by Ehrlichia spp. (10.3 %), B. burgdorferi sensu lato (6.4 %), E. chaffeensis (2.3 %), and B. gibsoni (1.7 %). One hundred and sixty-one dogs had antibodies against two or three different pathogens. The most common combinations were Anaplasma spp. - Ehrlichia spp. (2.1 %), Anaplasma spp. - E. chaffeensis (1.4 %), and Anaplasma spp. - B. burgdorferi sensu lato (1.2 %). Season was significantly associated with the seroprevalences of B. burgdorferi sensu lato and Ehrlichia spp., with dogs presenting the highest percentage of positive results during summer. Anaplasma spp. and B. gibsoni were significantly more prevalent in the northern and southern regions, respectively. The seroprevalences of Anaplasma spp., B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and Ehrlichia spp. were significantly higher in military working dogs, while the seroprevalence of E. chaffeensis was higher in companion dogs. The current findings are important for future surveillance of canine tick-borne pathogens and designing appropriate approaches for the diagnosis and control of these pathogens in the Republic of Korea."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is one of the most prevalent and fastest growing vector-borne bacterial illnesses in the United States, with over 25,000 new confirmed cases every year. Humans contract the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi through the bite of the tick Ixodes scapularis. The tick can receive the bacterium from a variety of small mammal and bird species, but the white-footed mouse Peromyscus leucopus is the primary reservoir in the northeastern United States, especially near human settlement. The tick's life cycle and behavior depend greatly on the season, with different stages of tick biting at different times. Reducing the infection in the tick-mouse cycle may greatly lower human Lyme incidence in some areas. However, research on the effects of various mouse-targeted interventions is limited. One particularly promising method involves administering vaccine pellets to white-footed mice through special bait boxes. In this study, we develop and analyze a mathematical model consisting of a system of nonlinear difference equations to understand the complex transmission dynamics and vector demographics in both tick and mice populations. We evaluate to what extent vaccination of white-footed mice can affect Lyme incidence in I. scapularis, and under which conditions this method saves money in preventing Lyme disease. We find that, in areas with high human risk, vaccination can eliminate mouse-tick transmission of B. burgdorferi while saving money."

		"abstract": "Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies provide opportunities to gain novel insights into the genetic basis of phenotypic trait variation. Yet to date, progress in our understanding of genotype-phenotype associations in nonmodel organisms in general and natural vertebrate populations in particular has been hampered by small sample sizes typically available for wildlife populations and a resulting lack of statistical power, as well as a limited ability to control for false-positive signals. Here we propose to combine a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and FST -based approach with population-level replication to partly overcome these limitations. We present a case study in which we used this approach in combination with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data to identify genomic regions associated with Borrelia afzelii resistance or susceptibility in the natural rodent host of this Lyme disease-causing spirochete, the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). Using this combined approach we identified four consensus SNPs located in exonic regions of the genes Slc26a4, Tns3, Wscd1 and Espnl, which were significantly associated with the voles' Borrelia infectious status within and across populations. Functional links between host responses to bacterial infections and most of these genes have previously been demonstrated in other rodent systems, making them promising new candidates for the study of evolutionary host responses to Borrelia emergence. Our approach is applicable to other systems and may facilitate the identification of genetic variants underlying disease resistance or susceptibility, as well as other ecologically relevant traits, in wildlife populations."

		"abstract": "It has long been observed in clinical practice that a subset of patients with Lyme disease report a constellation of symptoms such as fatigue, cognitive difficulties, and musculoskeletal pain, which may last for a significant period of time. These symptoms, which can range from mild to severe, have been reported throughout the literature in both prospective and population-based studies in Lyme disease endemic regions. The etiology of these symptoms is unknown, however several illness-causing mechanisms have been hypothesized, including microbial persistence, host immune dysregulation through inflammatory or secondary autoimmune pathways, or altered neural networks, as in central sensitization. Evaluation and characterization of persistent symptoms in Lyme disease is complicated by potential independent, repeat exposures to B. burgdorferi, as well as the potential for co-morbid diseases with overlapping symptom profiles. Antibody testing for B. burgdorferi is an insensitive measure after treatment, and no other FDA-approved tests currently exist. As such, diagnosis presents a complex challenge for physicians, while the lived experience for patients is one marked by uncertainty and often illness invalidation. Currently, there are no FDA-approved pharmaceutical therapies, and the safety and efficacy of off-label and/or complementary therapies have not been well studied and are not agreed-upon within the medical community. Post-treatment Lyme disease represents a narrow, defined, mechanistically-neutral subset of this larger, more heterogeneous group of patients, and is a useful definition in research settings as an initial subgroup of study. The aim of this paper is to review the current literature on the diagnosis, etiology, risk factors, and treatment of patients with persistent symptoms in the context of Lyme disease. The meaning and relevance of existing patient subgroups will be discussed, as will future research priorities, including the need to develop illness biomarkers, elucidate the biologic mechanisms of disease, and drive improvements in therapeutic options."

The clinical manifestations of Lyme endocarditis are non-specific and can be very challenging diagnosis to make when it is the only manifestation of the disease. Until now, only a few cases where reported. Physicians should keep in mind the possibility of borrelial etiology of endocarditis in endemic areas. Appropriate valve tissue sample should be sent for histopathology, culture, and PCR especially in case of endocarditis of unknown origin PCR on heart valve samples is recommended. With more frequent PCR, Borrelia spp. may be increasingly found as a cause of infective endocarditis. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of Lyme carditis may prevent surgical treatment and pacemaker implantations. Due to climate change and global warming Lyme disease is a growing problem. Rising number of Lyme disease cases we can expect and rising number of Lyme endocarditis."

Compared with other European countries, the United Kingdom (UK) is considered to have a low incidence of LB, although this varies regionally. To determine whether an association exists between tick bite consultations and LB incidence in the UK, retrospective questionnaires were sent to general practitioners (GPs) in high (Wiltshire), medium (Cumbria) and low (Wales) incidence areas. During 2011, the greatest incidence of consultations for tick bites was reported by GPs in Cumbria (204 consultations per 100,000 inhabitants), followed by Wiltshire (160 per 100,000 population) and Wales (54 per 100,000 population). In Wiltshire and Cumbria, GPs predominantly provided advice on tick removal, whilst Welsh GPs mostly advised patients on tick bite prevention. Focusing on Cumbria during 2011-2013, 72.5% of GPs removed ticks from patients (incidence of 101 consultations per 100,000 population), and more GPs diagnosed LB based on clinical features than laboratory-confirmed diagnoses. To date, this is the first study to investigate the incidence of tick bite consultations and LB in England and Wales."

Quantitative descriptive studies have demonstrated non-adherence to the guidelines for testing for Lyme Borreliosis.Objectives: To gain insight into the diagnostic practices that general practitioners apply for Lyme Borreliosis, their motives for ordering tests and how they act upon test results.Methods: A qualitative study among 16 general practitioners using semi-structured interviews and thematic content analysis.Results: Five themes were distinguished: (1) recognising localised Lyme Borreliosis and symptoms of disseminated disease, (2) use of the guideline, (3) serological testing in patients with clinically suspect Lyme Borreliosis, (4) serological testing without clinical suspicion of Lyme Borreliosis, and (5) dealing with the limited accuracy of the serological tests. Whereas the national guideline recommends using serological tests for diagnosing, general practitioners also use them for ruling out disseminated Lyme Borreliosis. Reasons for non-adherence to the guideline for testing were to reassure patients with non-specific symptoms or without symptoms who feared to have Lyme disease, confirmation of localised Lyme Borreliosis and routine work-up in patients with continuing unexplained symptoms. Some general practitioners referred all patients who tested positive to medical specialists, where others struggled with the explanation of the results.Conclusion: Both diagnosis and ruling out of disseminated Lyme Borreliosis can be difficult for general practitioners. General practitioners use serological tests to reassure patients and rule out Lyme Borreliosis, thereby deviating from the national guideline. Interpretation of test results in these cases can be difficult."

		"abstract": "The sensu lato (s.l.) complexes of Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum include pathogenic genospecies each with distinct ecologies in northern California, yet, most work conflates the genospecies of each pathogen into one sensu lato species. Detailed understanding of the differences in geographic distributions and ecology among genospecies is lacking. We aimed to evaluate whether two B. burgdorferi and two A. phagocytophilum genospecies in high-risk locations in coastal northern California were spatially clustered and if presence of a particular genospecies was associated with geographical site, host species, or other demographic or ecological variables. DNA sequencing was performed to differentiate genospecies of Borreliae and Anaplasma from PCR-positive dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes) and sciurids (chipmunks, Tamias spp., and Douglas squirrels, Tamiasciurus douglasii) at four sites in northwestern California. Logistic regression was performed to assess associations of genospecies with the predictor variables host species, host sex, site, season, and year. Spatial clustering was assessed using a Poisson spatial scan statistic in SaTScan. Host species was a significant predictor for Borrelia bissettiae, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.), A. phagocytophilum s.s., and the DU1 Anaplasma genospecies. Woodrats were significantly more likely to be PCR-positive for B. bissettiae and A. phagocytophilum DU1 genospecies, while A. phagocytophilum s.s. and B. burgdorferi s.s. were significantly associated with sciurids. We report a single Borrelia lanei in an Allen's chipmunk (Tamias senex) from the Hoopa Valley Tribal Reservation. A significant spatial cluster of A. phagocytophilum s.s. was detected at Hendy Woods State Park in Mendocino County. These results highlight the need to better understand genospecies partitioning according to host species to further assess human risks, aid in future surveillance, and inform targeted research."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the US and Europe. Although the current recommended Lyme antibiotic treatment is effective for the majority of Lyme disease patients, about 10-20% of patients continue to suffer from persisting symptoms. There have been various anecdotal reports on the use of herbal extracts for treating patients with persisting symptoms with varying degree of improvements. However, it is unclear whether the effect of the herb products is due to their direct antimicrobial activity or their effect on host immune system. In the present study, we investigated the antimicrobial effects of 12 commonly used botanical medicines and three other natural antimicrobial agents for potential anti-Borrelia burgdorferi activity in vitro. Among them, 7 natural product extracts at 1% were found to have good activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi culture compared to the control antibiotics doxycycline and cefuroxime. These active botanicals include Cryptolepis sanguinolenta, Juglans nigra (Black walnut), Polygonum cuspidatum (Japanese knotweed), Artemisia annua (Sweet wormwood), Uncaria tomentosa (Cat's claw), Cistus incanus, and Scutellaria baicalensis (Chinese skullcap). In contrast, Stevia rebaudiana, Andrographis paniculata, Grapefruit seed extract, colloidal silver, monolaurin, and antimicrobial peptide LL37 had little or no activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of Artemisia annua, Juglans nigra, and Uncaria tomentosa were quite high for growing B. burgdorferi, despite their strong activity against the non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi. On the other hand, the top two active herbs, Cryptolepis sanguinolenta and Polygonum cuspidatum, showed strong activity against both growing B. burgdorferi (MIC = 0.03-0.06% and 0.25-0.5%, respectively) and non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi. In subculture studies, only 1% Cryptolepis sanguinolenta extract caused complete eradication, while doxycycline and cefuroxime and other active herbs could not eradicate B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells as many spirochetes were visible after 21-day subculture. Further studies are needed to identify the active constituents of the effective botanicals and evaluate their combinations for more effective eradication of B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo. The implications of these findings for improving treatment of persistent Lyme disease are discussed."

		"abstract": "Background and objective: Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis (LB), is a tick-borne infectious disease caused by the spirochete bacteria Borrelia. The risk of infection depends on the geographical area, ecological factors, and human behavior. Clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis have a wide range, but the most frequent clinical symptom, which is also a diagnostic symptom, is a skin rash called erythema migrans (EM). The disease is very common worldwide. In Lithuania, the disease frequency is 99.9 cases per 100,000 population (Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS, Lithuania, 2017). The main aim of this study was to obtain the baseline characteristics of the disease regarding the infected Lithuanian population. Materials and Methods: We analyzed data from the Centre for Communicable Diseases and AIDS about all Lyme disease (A69.2) diagnosed patients over a three-year period (from 2014 to 2016) in Lithuania. Results: In 2014-2016, 7424 (crude incidence rate 85.4) cases with LB were diagnosed in Lithuania. Most of them (4633 (62.4%)) were identified in women. Older people were more likely to suffer from LB. Urban residents were 2.6 times more often affected that those living in villages. Tick bites were primarily observed in high season months, from May to September (90%), with the highest peak in July. There was a higher number of observed tick bites (p = 0.003) in the urban residents. Erythema migrans occurred in 75.6% LB cases, while other symptoms did not exceed a quarter of all LB cases. There were 7353 (99.6%) cases where LB was confirmed via clinical symptoms and/or laboratory tests. Also, 1720 (23.2%) patients were tested for LB immunoglobulins. Conclusions: This study found a high incidence of Lyme disease in Lithuania. We elucidated the baseline characteristics regarding the infected Lithuanian population which may ease medical clinicians' work on new Lyme diagnoses."

However, deviations from this pattern were described, such as focal interface changes or spongiosis, potentially posing a clinicopathological challenge. In this study, cases submitted with a serologically confirmed, clinically unequivocal, or highly suspicious diagnosis of ECM/Lyme disease between January 01, 2016, and September 01, 2018, were retrieved from the electronic database system and reviewed to delineate the histopathologic features of ECM. The series consisted of 14 cases. A superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate was noted in all biopsies, accompanied by a deep and/or interstitial inflammatory infiltrate in 9 cases (64%). The inflammation ranged from relatively sparse to dense and prominent. At least focal interface changes were noted in 12 biopsies (86%). Eosinophils and plasma cells were noted in 7 (50%) and 10 (71%) cases, respectively. From a histologic standpoint, ECM is a protean entity and may manifest with a variable density of perivascular and/or interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate admixed with eosinophils and/or plasma cells and accompanied by focal interface dermatitis. Within the appropriate clinical context, ECM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal interface and/or sparse perivascular dermatitis."

The disease causes rash, acute systemic illness, and in some untreated patients, inflammatory arthritis. This review examines the emergence, clinical features and management of early Lyme disease and Lyme arthritis. There has been continuing progress in characterizing the clinical manifestations, diagnostic testing and treatment of Lyme disease. Almost all patients with early Lyme disease can be cured with antibiotic treatment. In most cases, Lyme arthritis also responds to antibiotics, but some patients require additional treatment approaches. The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical manifestations and adjunctive laboratory testing. For the rheumatologist, Lyme arthritis should be recognized by a pattern of attacks of asymmetric, oligo-arthritis, recognizable by clinical manifestations in the same way that other rheumatic diseases, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, are diagnosed."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex spirochetes. Through a complex enzootic cycle, the bacteria transfer between two different hosts: Ixodes ticks and mammalian organisms. At the start of the tick blood meal, the spirochetes located in the tick gut upregulate the expression of several genes, mainly coding for outer surface proteins. Outer surface proteins belonging to the paralogous gene family 54 (PFam54) have been shown to be the most upregulated among the other borrelial proteins and the results clearly point to the potential importance of these proteins in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. The significance of PFam54 proteins is confirmed by the fact that of all ten PFam54 proteins, BBA64 and BBA66 are necessary for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from infected Ixodes ticks to mammalian hosts. To enhance the understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and to promote the development of novel therapies against Lyme disease, we solved the crystal structure of the PFam54 member BBA65. Additionally, we report the structure of the B. burgdorferi BBA64 orthologous protein from B. spielmanii. Together with the previously determined crystal structures of five PFam54 members and several related proteins, we performed a comprehensive structural analysis for this important group of proteins. In addition to revealing the molecular aspects of the proteins, the structural data analysis suggests that the gene families PFam54 and PFam60, which have long been referred to as separate paralogous families, should be merged into one and designated as PFam54_60."

Asymptomatic subjects from endemic and nonendemic origins demonstrated a seroreactivity rate of approximately 4% that was similar to other commercial assays evaluated in this study. Coupled to this result was the observation that the Lyme Total assay retained a high first-tier specificity of 96% while demonstrating a relatively high sensitivity of 91% among a well-characterized CDC Premarketing Lyme serum panel. The Lyme Total assay also performs well under a modified two-tier algorithm (sensitivity, 84.4 to 88.9%; specificity, 98.4 to 99.5%). Furthermore, the new assay is able to readily detect early Lyme infection in patient samples from outside North America."

		"abstract": "The incidence and geographic range of Lyme disease continues to increase in the United States because of the expansion of Ixodes scapularis, the species of tick that is the main Lyme disease vector. Currently, no dynamic model for the disease spread exists that integrates information of both acarological and human case surveillance data. To characterize the spatiotemporal spread of Lyme disease in humans among counties in US endemic regions. This cross-sectional study modeled the spread of Lyme disease county-level case reporting, accounting for county-level demographic factors, environmental factors associated with tick presence and human exposure, and the spatiotemporal association between counties. The analyses were conducted between January and August 2019. The setting was 1405 counties in the following regions of the United States: West North Central, East North Central, New England, Middle Atlantic, and the South. Assessments were based on publicly available Lyme disease case data reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between January 2000 and December 2017. Probability of reporting the first case of Lyme disease by county by year. Between 2000 and 2017, a total of 497 569 Lyme disease cases were reported to the CDC in the study area. Reporting a first case of Lyme disease was associated with a county's and county's neighbors' forest coverage, elevation, percentage of population living in the wildland-urban interface, tick presence, county's population size, proportion of neighbors reporting cases, and neighbors' years since first reporting. The model that included these variables showed high predictive power, with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 81.1 (95% CI, 68.5-86.2). The model predicted the first reported Lyme disease case a mean (SD) of 5.5 (3.5) years earlier than was reported to the CDC, with a mean spread velocity estimated at 27.4 (95% CI, 13.6-54.4) km per year. Among 162 counties without reported cases, 47 (29.0%) had a high probability of reporting Lyme disease by 2018. The estimated mean time lag between the first reported case in a neighboring county and any county was 7 (95% CI, 3-8) years. This study's findings suggest that, if updated regularly and expanded geographically, this predictive model could enable states and counties to develop more specific Lyme disease prevention and control plans, including improved sensitization of the general population and medical community."

Differential gene expression at different times throughout its infectious cycle allows the spirochete to survive very diverse environments within different mammalian hosts as well as the tick vector. To date, the vast majority of data about spirochetal proteins and their functions are from genetic studies carried out on North American strains of a single species, i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The whole-genome sequences recently obtained for several European species/strains make it feasible to adapt and use genetic techniques to study inherent differences between them. This review highlights the crucial need to undertake independent studies of genospecies within Europe, given their varying genetic content and pathogenic potential, and differences in clinical manifestation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is one of most common vector-borne diseases, reporting more than 300,000 cases annually in the United States. Treating Lyme disease during its initial stages with traditional tetracycline antibiotics is effective. However, 10-20% of patients treated with antibiotic therapy still shows prolonged symptoms of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and perceived cognitive impairment. When these symptoms persists for more than 6 months to years after completing conventional antibiotics treatment are called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Though the exact reason for the prolongation of post treatment symptoms are not known, the growing evidence from recent studies suggests it might be due to the existence of drug-tolerant persisters. In order to identify effective drug molecules that kill drug-tolerant borrelia we have tested two antibiotics, azlocillin and cefotaxime that were identified by us earlier. The in vitro efficacy studies of azlocillin and cefotaxime on drug-tolerant persisters were done by semisolid plating method. The results obtained were compared with one of the currently prescribed antibiotic doxycycline. We found that azlocillin completely kills late log phase and 7-10 days old stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Our results also demonstrate that azlocillin and cefotaxime can effectively kill in vitro doxycycline-tolerant B. burgdorferi. Moreover, the combination drug treatment of azlocillin and cefotaxime effectively killed doxycycline-tolerant B. burgdorferi. Furthermore, when tested in vivo, azlocillin has shown good efficacy against B. burgdorferi in mice model. These seminal findings strongly suggests that azlocillin can be effective in treating B. burgdorferi sensu stricto JLB31 infection and furthermore in depth research is necessary to evaluate its potential use for Lyme disease therapy."

Such binding downregulates activation of host complement to facilitate spirochete evasion of complement killing. However, vaccination with CspZ does not protect against LD infection. In this study, we demonstrated that immunization with CspZ-YA, a CspZ mutant protein with no FH-binding activity, protected mice from infection by several spirochete genotypes introduced via tick feeding. We found that the sera from CspZ-YA-vaccinated mice more efficiently eliminated spirochetes and blocked CspZ FH-binding activity than sera from CspZ-immunized mice. We also found that vaccination with CspZ, but not CspZ-YA, triggered the production of anti-FH antibodies, justifying CspZ-YA as an LD vaccine candidate. The mechanistic and efficacy information derived from this study provides insights into the development of a CspZ-based LD vaccine."

In the Northeast and Upper Midwest, Lyme disease is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis. Currently, many studies have been conducted to identify factors influencing Lyme disease risk in the Northeast, however, relatively few studies focused on the Upper Midwest. In this study, we explored and compared the climatic and landscape factors that shape the spatial patterns of human Lyme cases in these two regions, using the generalized linear mixed models. Our results showed that climatic variables generally had opposite correlations with Lyme disease risk, while landscape factors usually had similar effects in these two regions. High precipitation and low temperature were correlated with high Lyme disease risk in the Upper Midwest, while with low Lyme disease risk in the Northeast. In both regions, size and fragmentation related factors of residential area showed positive correlations with Lyme disease risk. Deciduous forests and evergreen forests had opposite effects on Lyme disease risk, but the effects were consistent between two regions. In general, this study provides new insight into understanding the differences of risk factors of human Lyme disease risk in these two regions."

		"abstract": "The black-legged (or deer) tick, Ixodes scapularis, commonly infests dogs in the USA and is the vector of important zoonotic pathogens, including Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Rapid onset of activity is important in reducing the feeding activity of ticks, thereby reducing the possibility of transmission of infections. The speed of kill of a novel oral combination product, Simparica Trio™ containing sarolaner, moxidectin and pyrantel was evaluated in a well-controlled laboratory study against an existing infestation and subsequent weekly induced infestations of I. scapularis ticks on dogs. Dogs were allocated randomly based on host suitability tick counts to treatment with a single dose of either placebo or Simparica Trio™ at the minimum label dose of 1.2 mg/kg sarolaner, 24 µg/kg moxidectin and 5 mg/kg pyrantel (as pamoate salt). All dogs were infested with approximately 50 unfed adult I. scapularis ticks at a 1:1 sex ratio on Days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Tick counts were conducted at 8, 12 and 24 h after treatment on Day 0 and after each subsequent infestation. No treatment-related adverse events occurred during the study. Dogs in the placebo-treated group maintained adequate tick infestations for the duration of the study. Day 0 tick counts at 8 h after treatment with Simparica Trio™ were reduced relative to placebo against an existing infestation with efficacy of 67.5%, demonstrating that Simparica Trio™ started killing ticks soon after treatment. Efficacy was 98.4 % at 12 h and 99.4% at 24 h. Rapid speed of kill was maintained throughout the month, with efficacy of ≥ 94.2% at 24 h after re-infestation through Day 28. A single dose of Simparica Trio™ administered orally to dogs at the minimum label dose of 1.2 mg/kg sarolaner, 24 µg/kg moxidectin and 5 mg/kg pyrantel (as pamoate salt) was safe and began to kill existing I. scapularis ticks within 8 h after treatment and resulted in ≥ 94.2% efficacy within 24 h against re-infestations for a month."

		"abstract": "Morgellons disease (MD) is a contested dermopathy that is associated with Borrelia spirochetal infection. A simple classification system was previously established to help validate the disease based on clinical features (classes I-IV). Drawing on historical and pathological parallels with syphilis, we formulated a more detailed staging system based on clinical features as well as severity of skin lesions and corresponding histopathological infection patterns, as determined by anti-Borrelia immunohistochemical staining. Clinical classes I-IV of MD are further categorized as mild, moderate and severe, or stages A, B and C, respectively, based on histopathological findings. Stage A lesions demonstrated little or no immune infiltrates and little or no disorganization of cells; macrophages were not present, and hemorrhage was negligible. Extracellular isolated spirochetes and intracellular staining of keratinocytes in the lower epidermis was occasionally seen. Stage C lesions demonstrated positive staining of keratinocytes in the stratum basale and stratum spinosum and positive intracellular staining of macrophages for Borrelia. Aggregate Borrelia colonies were frequently encountered, hemorrhage was frequent, and intracellularly stained fibroblasts were occasionally seen. Stage B lesions demonstrated a pattern intermediate between Stages A and C. The enhanced staging system provides objective criteria to assess the severity of dermopathy in MD. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal treatment for MD based on this staging system related to Borrelia infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an increasing public health problem. Current laboratory testing is insensitive in early infection, the stage at which appropriate treatment is most effective in preventing disease sequelae. The Lyme Disease Biobank (LDB) collects samples from individuals with symptoms consistent with early LD presenting with or without erythema migrans (EM) or an annular, expanding skin lesion and uninfected individuals from areas of endemicity. Samples were collected from 550 participants (298 cases and 252 controls) according to institutional review board-approved protocols and shipped to a centralized biorepository. Testing was performed to confirm the presence of tick-borne pathogens by real-time PCR, and a subset of samples was tested for Borrelia burgdorferi by culture. Serology was performed on all samples using the CDC's standard two-tiered testing algorithm (STTTA) for LD. LD diagnosis was supported by laboratory testing in 82 cases, including positive results by use of the STTTA, PCR, or culture or positive results by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for cases presenting with EM lesion sizes of >5 cm. The remaining 216 cases had negative laboratory testing results. For the controls, 43 were positive by at least one of the tiers and 6 were positive by use of the STTTA. The results obtained with this collection highlight and reinforce the known limitations of serologic testing in early LD, with only 29% of individuals presenting with EM lesion sizes of >5 cm yielding a positive result using the STTTA. Aliquots of whole blood, serum, and urine from clinically characterized patients with and without LD are available to investigators in academia and industry for evaluation or development of novel diagnostic assays for LD, to continue to improve upon currently available methods."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD), which is caused by genospecies of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, is the most common vector-borne disease in the Northern hemisphere. Spirochetes are transmitted by Ixodes ticks and maintained in diverse vertebrate animal hosts. Following tick bite, spirochetes initially establish a localized infection in the skin. However, they may also disseminate hematogenously to several distal sites, including heart, joints, or the CNS. Because they need to survive in diverse microenvironments, from tick vector to mammalian hosts, spirochetes have developed multiple strategies to combat the numerous host defense mechanisms. One of these strategies includes the production of a number of complement-regulator acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) which encompass CspA, CspZ, and OspE paralogs to blunt the complement pathway. These proteins are capable of preventing complement activation on the spirochete surface by binding to complement regulator Factor H. The genes encoding these CRASPs differ in their expression patterns during the tick-to-host infection cycle, implying that these proteins may exhibit different functions during infection. This review summarizes the recent published reports which investigated the roles that each of these molecules plays in conferring tick-borne transmission and dissemination in vertebrate hosts. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights into LD pathobiology and may facilitate the identification of new targets for preventive strategies against Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Use of emerging technology allowing for identification of genetic material from pathogens and endosymbionts in ticks collected from humans, domestic animals, wildlife, or the environment has resulted in an avalanche of new data on tick-microorganism associations. This rapidly growing stream of new information is a tremendous resource but also presents challenges, including how detection of pathogen genetic material in ticks should best be interpreted. There is a tendency in the more recent published literature to incorrectly use the term \"vector\" based on detection of pathogen genetic material from tick species not experimentally confirmed to serve as vectors of the pathogen in question. To serve as a vector of a horizontally maintained pathogen, such as a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) Lyme borreliosis spirochete, the tick species in question must be capable of acquiring the pathogen while feeding in the larval or nymphal stage on an infectious host, maintaining it transstadially through the molt, and then transmitting the pathogen to a naïve host while feeding in the subsequent nymphal or adult stage. This review examines the experimental evidence for and against species of hard (ixodid) ticks from different genera to serve as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. Of the 18 Ixodes species ticks evaluated to date, 13 were experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. These studies focused primarily on the three major Lyme borreliosis agents: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii. In striking contrast, none of 8 tick species from other genera (1 Amblyomma species, 5 Dermacentor species, and 2 Haemaphysalis species) evaluated to date were unequivocally experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. The strength of the evidence for or against each tick species to serve as a vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes is discussed together with key knowledge gaps and research challenges."

We wanted to study whether plasma cytokine profile differed in liver transplanted children, with and without food allergy, and whether it differed from untransplanted children with CLD. Plasma cytokines, total and specific IgE in nine patients with food allergy were compared with 13 patients without food allergy following LTX, and also with seven untransplanted patients with CLD. No difference was found in the cytokine profile between liver transplanted patients with and without food allergy. Transplanted patients with food allergy having received a prescription of epinephrine had a significantly higher total IgE (2033 [234-2831] vs 10 [5-41] IU/L, P = .002) and MIP-1b (52 [37-96] vs 36 [32-39], P = .035) compared with transplanted patients without food allergy. Two patients with severe food allergy responded favorably to conversion from tacrolimus-based immunosuppression to MMF and corticosteroids with reduction in clinical symptoms, total IgE, specific IgE, IL-1ra, IL-4, RANTES, PDGF, MIP-1a, and TNFα. The transplantation group had higher levels of IL-1b, IL-5, IL-7, IL-13, GCSF, IFNγ, and MIP-1a compared with the CLD group. No overall difference was found in plasma cytokine profile between patients with and without food allergy. Patients with severe food allergy had significant elevation of MIP-1b. Discontinuation of tacrolimus reduced total and specific IgE and changed plasma cytokine profile. The plasma cytokine profile in liver transplanted children was different compared with children with CLD."

		"abstract": "To describe the implementation of a pharmacist-run Lyme disease postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) clinic augmented by academic detailing within a health care system. Butler Veterans Affairs Health Care System. A pharmacist-run clinic, referred to as a PharmLD clinic, was established. A patient presenting to the health care system with a chief complaint of a tick bite would be scheduled to the PharmLD clinic for the evaluation of appropriateness of Lyme disease PEP. The pharmacist prescribed a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg and provided education on Lyme disease, provided education only, or referred the patient to their primary care provider (PCP). Academic detailing with PCPs, nurses, and pharmacists was used to improve outcomes in those not seen in the clinic. To our knowledge, the evaluation of a pharmacist-run Lyme disease PEP clinic in a health care system alone or in combination with academic detailing has not been previously described in the literature. Doxycycline PEP prescriptions from April through September 2016 (preimplementation) were compared with prescriptions from April through September 2018 (postimplementation). A retrospective chart review was performed to evaluate prescribing appropriateness on the basis of Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines. The postimplementation group saw a 55.9% improvement in doxycycline prescribing appropriateness. The improvement in appropriateness stemmed largely from the dose and duration prescribed. Eighteen of the 39 prescriptions (46%) came from the PharmLD clinic. During the postimplementation period, 40 patients were seen in the PharmLD clinic. Of these patients, 18 were prescribed doxycycline PEP (45%), 12 received education only (30%), and 10 were referred to their PCP for further evaluation (25%). These PharmLD clinic encounters resulted in the mitigation of 30 PCP visits. A pharmacist-run Lyme disease PEP clinic, coupled with academic detailing, has increased access to care and improved the quality of care received."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne diseases result in significant morbidity and mortality in domestic dogs in tropical and subtropical regions and also pose a potential threat to wildlife species and humans. Ehrlichia canis, the causative agent of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (CME), has a high reported seroprevalence in dogs on Santa Cruz in the Galápagos Islands, Ecuador. Veterinary diagnostic and treatment resources are often scarce and clinical follow-up is lacking in the Galápagos. This study evaluated 58 dogs presenting to the Darwin Animal Doctors clinic in the city of Puerto Ayora on Santa Cruz Island during August of 2018. The seroprevalence of E. canis/Ehrlichia ewingii (48.3%), Anaplasma phagocytophilum/Anaplasma platys (12.1%), and Borrelia burgdorferi (0%), as well as the proportion of dogs actively infected with E. canis (12.1%) and E. ewingii (0%), are reported. Active infection was defined as the identification of antigen by PCR. Dogs with a packed cell volume (PCV) ≤ 30% had a 10-fold risk of active infection with E. canis compared to dogs with a PCV ≥ 31% (p = .0124). A PCV cutoff of 30% may be a useful screening tool for active E. canis infection in regions with high Ehrlichia seroprevalence, in the absence of other apparent causes of anemia. Dirofilaria immitis antigen was present in 6.9% of examined dogs, with the highest prevalence in the barrio Las Ninfas. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to provide the first molecular identification of D. immitis in the Galápagos. This study updates the seropositivity and prevalence data of these canine vector-borne pathogens and highlights the need for continued surveillance in the region."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an increasing public health threat in temperate zones of the northern hemisphere, yet relatively few methods exist for reducing LD risk in endemic areas. Disrupting the LD transmission cycle in nature is a promising avenue for risk reduction. This experimental study evaluated the efficacy of fluralaner, a recent oral acaricide with a long duration of effect in dogs, for killing Ixodes scapularis ticks in Peromyscus maniculatus mice, a known wildlife reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi in nature. We assigned 87 mice to 3 fluralaner treatment groups (50 mg/kg, 12.5 mg/kg and untreated control) administered as a single oral treatment. Mice were then infested with 20 Ixodes scapularis larvae at 2, 28 and 45 days post-treatment and we measured efficacy as the proportion of infesting larvae that died within 48 h. At each infestation, blood from 3 mice in each treatment group was tested to obtain fluralaner plasma concentrations (Cp). Treatment with 50 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg fluralaner killed 97% and 94% of infesting larvae 2 days post-treatment, but no significant effect of treatment on feeding larvae was observed 28 and 45 days post-treatment. Mouse Cp did not differ significantly between the two tested doses. Mean Cp decreased from 13,000 ng/ml in the 50 mg/kg group and 4000 ng/ml in the 12.5 mg/kg group at Day 2 to < 100 ng/ml in both groups at Day 45. We provide the first evidence that fluralaner is effective for killing immature ticks in Peromyscus mice, a first step in evaluating its potential for treating wild rodents as a public health intervention to reduce LD risk in endemic areas."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Existing estimates of Lyme disease spread are delayed a year or more. We introduce Lymelight-a new method for monitoring the incidence of Lyme disease in real-time. We use a machine-learned classifier of web search sessions to estimate the number of individuals who search for possible Lyme disease symptoms in a given geographical area for two years, 2014 and 2015. We evaluate Lymelight using the official case count data from CDC and find a 92% correlation (p < 0.001) at county level. Importantly, using web search data allows us not only to assess the incidence of the disease, but also to examine the appropriateness of treatments subsequently searched for by the users. Public health implications of our work include monitoring the spread of vector-borne diseases in a timely and scalable manner, complementing existing approaches through real-time detection, which can enable more timely interventions. Our analysis of treatment searches may also help reduce misdiagnosis of the disease."

		"abstract": "The Channel Islands are British Crown dependencies located in the English Channel to the west of the Normandy coast in northern France. Whilst there have been studies investigating tick occurrence and distribution in different habitats on the mainland of the UK and in France, the Channel Islands have been relatively understudied. As such, little is known about whether the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus, is present, and whether there is a potential risk of Lyme borreliosis on the Channel Islands. To ascertain the presence of I. ricinus on the three largest islands in the archipelago: Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney, surveys of ticks questing in the vegetation and ticks feeding on hosts were undertaken during April and May 2016. Across all three islands, the highest numbers of ticks were found in woodland habitats. Ixodes ricinus was the predominant questing tick species found on Jersey, and Ixodes ventalloi the most common questing tick species on Alderney and Guernsey, with little or no evidence of questing I. ricinus on either island. During field studies on small mammals, I. ricinus was the predominant tick species feeding on Jersey bank voles (Myodes glareolus caesarius), with Ixodes hexagonus the most common species infesting hedgehogs on Guernsey. We propose that the greater diversity of small mammals on Jersey may be important in supporting immature stages of I. ricinus, in contrast to Guernsey and Alderney. Morphological identification of tick species was confirmed by PCR sequencing based on amplification of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit one (cox1) gene (COI DNA barcoding). To date, there have been few records of human tick bites in the Channel Islands, suggesting that the current risk from tick-borne disease may be low, but continued reporting of any human tick bites, along with reporting of cases of Lyme borreliosis will be important for continued assessment of the impact of tick-borne diseases in the Channel Islands."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) diagnosis using the current two-tier algorithm is constrained by low sensitivity for early-stage infection and ambiguity in determining treatment response. We recently developed a protein microarray biochip that measures diagnostic serum antibody targets using grating-coupled fluorescent plasmonics (GC-FP) technology. This strategy requires microliters of blood serum to enable multiplexed biomarker screening on a compact surface and generates quantitative results that can be further processed for diagnostic scoring. The GC-FP biochip was used to detect serum antibodies in patients with active and convalescent LD, as well as various negative controls. We hypothesized that the quantitative, high-sensitivity attributes of the GC-FP approach permit: 1) screening of antibody targets predictive for LD status, and 2) development a diagnostic algorithm that is more sensitive, specific, and informative than the standard ELISA and Western blot assays. Notably, our findings led to a diagnostic algorithm that may be more sensitive than the current standard for detecting early LD, while maintaining 100% specificity. We further show that analysis of relative antibody levels to predict disease status, such as in acute and convalescent stages of infection, is possible with a highly sensitive and quantitative platform like GC-FP. The results from this study add to the urgent conversation regarding better diagnostic strategies and more effective treatment for patients affected by tick-borne disease."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi has 7-11 periplasmic flagella (PF) that arise from the cell poles and extend toward the midcell as a flat-ribbon, which is distinct from other bacteria. FlhF, a signal recognition particle (SRP)-like GTPase, has been found to regulate the flagellar number and polarity; however, its role in B. burgdorferi remains unknown. B. burgdorferi has an FlhF homolog (BB0270). Structural and biochemical analyses show that BB0270 has a similar structure and enzymatic activity as its counterparts from other bacteria. Genetics and cryo-electron tomography studies reveal that deletion of BB0270 leads to mutant cells that have less PF (4 ± 2 PF per cell tip) and fail to form a flat-ribbon, indicative of a role of BB0270 in the control of PF number and configuration. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that BB0270 localizes at the cell poles and controls the number and position of PF via regulating the flagellar protein stability and the polar localization of the MS-ring protein FliF. Our study not only provides the detailed characterizations of BB0270 and its profound impacts on flagellar assembly, morphology and motility in B. burgdorferi, but also unveils mechanistic insights into how spirochetes control their unique flagellar patterns."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of tickborne diseases worldwide is increasing virtually unchecked due to the lack of effective control strategies. The transmission dynamics of tickborne pathogens are influenced by the tick microbiome, tick co-infection with other pathogens, and environmental features. Understanding this complex system could lead to new strategies for pathogen control, but will require large-scale, high-resolution data. Here, we introduce Project Acari, a citizen science-based project to assay, at single-tick resolution, species, pathogen infection status, microbiome profile, and environmental conditions of tens of thousands of ticks collected from numerous sites across the United States. In the first phase of the project, we collected more than 2,400 ticks wild-caught by citizen scientists and developed high-throughput methods to process and sequence them individually. Applying these methods to 192 Ixodes scapularis ticks collected in a region with a high incidence of Lyme disease, we found that 62% were colonized by Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen. In contrast to previous reports, we did not find an association between the microbiome diversity of a tick and its probability of carrying B. burgdorferi. However, we did find undescribed associations between B. burgdorferi carriage and the presence of specific microbial taxa within individual ticks. Our findings underscore the power of coupling citizen science with high-throughput processing to reveal pathogen dynamics. Our approach can be extended for massively parallel screening of individual ticks, offering a powerful tool to elucidate the ecology of tickborne disease and to guide pathogen-control initiatives."

		"abstract": "Changes in cellular metabolism have proven to be important factors in driving cell behavior. It has been shown that cellular metabolism of immune cells changes when exposed to or infected by several pathogens: while this is often an adaptation of the host cells to the infection, sometimes it represents a mechanism through which the pathogens evade immune activation. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, is a pathogen that highly depends on the host to survive, as the bacterium lacks many central metabolic pathways to generate its own nutrients. It is therefore quite likely that the bacterium interacts with host cells to obtain these metabolites and thereby affects metabolism in the host. Previously, several studies have assessed metabolic pathways in B. burgdorferi s.l. and how it adapts to its different host species. However, few studies have looked into how the interaction with the bacterium might affect the host cell metabolism. In this review we present the major metabolic pathways activated during Lyme borreliosis, viewed from both bacterium and host metabolism, and we discuss how these pathways interact with each other, and how they influence pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Cases of tick-borne diseases are increasing in the United States, and new tick-borne pathogen species causing human illness are being discovered. The specific etiology is generally difficult to diagnose based on clinical signs and symptoms alone, because of their generalized nature and often lack of a known tick bite. For some infections, such as Lyme disease and spotted fever group rickettsioses, serology remains the most appropriate laboratory diagnostic tool, but for others such as anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and babesiosis, direct detection in the blood is preferred for rapid diagnosis. In Kentucky, USA, the area served by our laboratory, the most commonly reported tick-borne illnesses include spotted fever group rickettsiosis, ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease, but of these three diseases, only ehrlichiosis is well-suited for direct detection using PCR methods during the acute stage of illness. We report here the validation of a duplex real-time PCR assay using whole blood specimens on the Luminex ARIES® instrument, combining DNA extraction, amplification and detection into a one-step process. This method allows for rapid and sensitive detection of acute infections with Ehrlichia spp. and Anaplasma phagocytophilum using whole blood specimens. We included A. phagocytophilum to monitor emergence of this pathogen in Kentucky, since surrounding states have reported many more cases than Kentucky."

The UK county of Hampshire is a high incidence area of Lyme disease. We conducted a retrospective review of the investigation and management of paediatric FNP at a large University hospital, including serologic testing and treatment of Lyme disease. We conducted a retrospective chart review of children under 18 presenting between January 1st, 2010 and December 31st, 2017 with a diagnosis of FNP. Patients with clear non-Lyme aetiology at presentation were excluded. Data was collected on demographics, initial presentation, investigations including Lyme serology, and management. A total of 93 children were identified, with an even proportion of male to female and median age 9.3 years (IQR 4.6-12 years). A history of rash was present in 5.4%, tick bite in 14% and recent travel to, or residence in the New Forest in 22.6%. Lyme serology was performed in 81.7% of patients, of which 29% were positive. Antibiotics were prescribed for 73.1% of patients, oral steroids for 44% and aciclovir for 17.2%. Lyme disease is a significant cause of FNP in this endemic area of the UK, and there was a large degree of variability in management prior to national guideline publication. Areas with endemic Lyme disease should consider introducing local guidelines supporting routine investigation and management for FNP, including empiric treatment for Lyme disease in accordance with NICE guidelines to improve care and reduce variability."

Public health data are often available for zoonotic pathogens but can lead to erroneous conclusions if the data have been spatially or temporally aggregated. As an illustration, we use human Lyme disease incidence data as a case study to examine correlations between mammalian biodiversity, fried chicken restaurants and obesity rates on human disease incidence. We demonstrate that Lyme disease incidence is negatively correlated with mammalian biodiversity, the abundance of fried chicken restaurants and obesity rates. We argue, however, that these correlations are spurious, representing both an 'ecologic fallacy' and Simpson's paradox, and are generated by the use of aggregated data. We argue that correlations based on aggregated data across large spatial scales must be rigorously examined before being invoked as proof of disease ecology theory or as a rationale for public health policy."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is endemic in many regions of the Northeastern United States. Given the elusive nature of the disease, a systematic approach to identify efficient interventions would be useful for policymakers in addressing LD. We used Markov modeling to investigate the efficiency of interventions. These interventions range from awareness-based to behavioral-based strategies. Targeting animal reservoirs of LD using fungal spray or bait boxes did not prove to be an effective intervention. Results of awareness-based interventions, including distribution of signage, fliers, and presentations, implementable in different geographical scales, suggest that policymakers should focus on these interventions, as they are both cost-effective and have the highest impact on lowering LD risk. Populations may lose focus of LD warnings over time, thus quick succession of these interventions is vital. Our modeling results identify the awareness-based intervention as the most cost-effective strategy to lower the number of LD cases. These results can aid in the establishment of effective LD risk reduction policy at various scales of implementation."

This retrospective study included 1,200 patients (15-80 years of age) treated via laparotomy or laparoscopy, at two different institutions, for endometriosis, between 1990 and 2017. Data were collected and analyzed from medical and pathological reports. The statistical methods used included the Student's t-test and χ2 test, as well as the Mann-Whitney U test. A total of 600 women from Yale University and 600 women from Greece participated in this study. Endometrioma was confirmed in 359 (29.9%) cases. Women were compatible in terms of the site of endometriomas. Left-sided cysts were observed (P<0.001) significantly more often compared with right-sided cysts in both groups. The two groups of patients had similar rates of endometriosis stages. A statistically significant positive association (P<0.001) was found for the co-existence of benign gynecological tumors (apart from endometrioma), endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer and for post-menopausal endometriosis in women with endometriosis from Greece. Moreover, similar results were observed as regards endometriosis following in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, endometriosis-associated Lyme disease, human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), melanoma and endometriosis in adolescents, between the two groups. To conclude, the two populations exhibited similar results as regards the surgical outcomes of endometriosis laparoscopic or open surgery. Endometriosis represents a multifactorial entity that depends on complex interactions of hormonal, genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Gynecologists should be aware that there is an association between endometriosis and cancerous diseases. It is thus suggested that the presence of comorbidities in women with endometriosis."

This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted at two German neurological centers. Serological parameters (ELISA or CLIA analysis) and clinical presentation of 28 patients with definite LNB were compared to those of 36 patients with neurological symptoms mimicking LNB (mimics). Analysis was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and binary logistic regression. Elevated IgG-titers had a high sensitivity for neuroborreliosis in both centers (0.95 and 1.0). The optimal cutoff-values were set to 26.35 in center A (ELISA), and 64.0 in center B (CLIA). Diagnostic specificity was 0.41 and 0.89 in this constellation. Elevated IgM-titers showed a high diagnostic specificity for a cutoff at 68.10 (A) and 47.95 (B) (0.93 and 0.89). Sensitivity was 0.45 and 0.5. Overall diagnostic accuracy was low in both centers (A: IgG AUC = 0.665, IgM AUC = 0.629; B: IgG AUC = 0.917, IgM AUC = 0.556). In logistic regression of antibody titers and clinical measures, prediction of LNB was significantly better than the \"null hypothesis\". Clinical measures showed the highest odds ratio. Data show that in addition to the clinical presentation of patients with symptoms suggesting central or peripheral nervous system manifestation, serum IgG- and IgM-titers help to identify LNB-patients. The results should guide physicians counseling patients with suspected LNB about further diagnostic steps and treatment."

Numerous in vitro studies were conducted to better understand the role of specific skin cells and tick saliva in host defense, vector feeding, and pathogen transmission.

These cells revive rapidly when the stress is removed and are likely the cause of many recurring infections such as those associated with tuberculosis, cystic fibrosis, and Lyme disease. However, how persister cells are formed is not understood well. Here we propose the ppGpp ribosome dimerization persister (PRDP) model in which the alarmone guanosine pentaphosphate/tetraphosphate (henceforth ppGpp) generates persister cells directly by inactivating ribosomes via the ribosome modulation factor (RMF), the hibernation promoting factor (Hpf), and the ribosome-associated inhibitor (RaiA). We demonstrate that persister cells contain a large fraction of 100S ribosomes, that inactivation of RMF, HpF, and RaiA reduces persistence and increases single-cell persister resuscitation and that ppGpp has no effect on single-cell persister resuscitation. Hence, a direct connection between ppGpp and persistence is shown along with evidence of the importance of ribosome dimerization in persistence and for active ribosomes during resuscitation."

		"abstract": "The relapsing fever spirochete Borrelia hermsii and the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto each produces an abundant, orthologous, outer membrane protein, Vtp and OspC, respectively, when transmitted by tick bite. Gene inactivation studies have shown that both proteins are essential for spirochete infectivity when transmitted by their respective tick vectors. Therefore, we transformed a vtp-minus mutant of B. hermsii with ospC from B. burgdorferi and examined the behavior of this transgenic spirochete in its soft tick vector Ornithodoros hermsi. IFA staining indicated up to 97.8 % of the transgenic B. hermsii upregulated OspC in the ticks' salivary glands compared to no more than 12.8 % in the midgut, similar to our previous findings with wild-type B. hermsii producing Vtp. Transformation with ospC also restored B. hermsii infectivity to mice when fed upon by infected ticks. Previous sequence analysis of Vtp for 79 isolates and DNA samples of B. hermsii in our laboratory showed this protein is highly polymorphic with 9 divergent amino acid types, yet strikingly the signal peptide is identical among all samples and the same for all OspC signal peptides for B. burgdorferi and related species examined to date. Searches in multiple genome sequences for other species of relapsing fever spirochetes failed to find the same signal peptide sequence to help identify potential transmission-associated proteins. However, some candidate signal peptides with highly similar sequences were found and worthy of future efforts with other species. While OspC of B. burgdorferi restored infectivity to a Vtp-minus mutant of B. hermsii, the functions of these proteins are not known. Our results should stimulate investigators to search for orthologous transmission-associated proteins in other tick-borne spirochetes to better understand how this group of pathogens has coevolved with diverse tick vectors."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the United States, and the number of cases reported each year continues to rise. The complex nature of the relationships between the pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto), the tick vector (Ixodes scapularis Say), multiple vertebrate hosts, and numerous environmental factors creates challenges for understanding and predicting tick population and pathogen transmission dynamics. LYMESIM is a mechanistic model developed in the late 1990s to simulate the life-history of I. scapularis and transmission dynamics of B. burgdorferi s.s. Here we present LYMESIM 2.0, a modernized version of LYMESIM, that includes several modifications to enhance the biological realism of the model and to generate outcomes that are more readily measured under field conditions. The model is tested for three geographically distinct locations in New York, Minnesota, and Virginia. Model-simulated timing and densities of questing nymphs, infected nymphs, and abundances of nymphs feeding on hosts are consistent with field observations and reports for these locations. Sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of temperature in host finding for the density of nymphs, the importance of transmission from small mammals to ticks on the density of infected nymphs, and temperature-related tick survival for both density of nymphs and infected nymphs. A key challenge for accurate modeling of these metrics is the need for regionally representative inputs for host populations and their fluctuations. LYMESIM 2.0 is a useful public health tool that downstream can be used to evaluate tick control interventions and can be adapted for other ticks and pathogens."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ticks are the main vectors for a number of zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease. Ticks secrete saliva directly into a mammalian host while feeding on the host's blood. This action serves to modulate host immunity and coagulation, thus allowing ticks to attach and feed upon their host. One of the most extensively studied components of tick saliva is Salp15. Research has shown that this protein binds specifically to CD4 molecules on the surface of T lymphocytes, interferes with TCR-mediated signaling transduction, inhibits CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation, and impedes the secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Salp15 also binds specifically to dendritic cell dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) to up-regulate the expression of CD73 in regulatory T cells. Collectively, these findings render this salivary protein a potential candidate for a range of therapeutic applications. Here, we discuss our current understanding of Salp15 and the mechanisms that might be used to treat disease."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans is the most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease. Despite antibiotic therapy, typically at least 10% of adult patients with erythema migrans experience persistence of at least 1 subjective symptom for ≥6 months (posttreatment Lyme disease symptoms [PTLDS]). This study was designed to determine whether the frequency and severity (based on a visual analogue scale) of 12 particular symptoms in patients with erythema migrans (n = 52) differed from matched control subjects (n = 104) followed prospectively for 12 months. At baseline, patients with Lyme disease were more likely than controls to have at least 1 symptom (P = .006). Among symptomatic subjects, Lyme disease patients had a higher mean number of symptoms (P < .001) and a higher mean total symptom severity score (P < .001). At both 6 and 12 months, however, there were no significant differences for these variables and no significant differences in the frequency or severity of any of the 12 individual symptoms assessed. However, 10 patients were clinically assessed as having possible PTLDS. Patients with erythema migrans were more likely than matched control subjects to be symptomatic at baseline with a greater symptom severity score, but this was not found at ≥6 months. Use of symptom survey data alone, however, was less likely to identify patients with possible PTLDS compared with individual clinical assessments. Because it is very challenging to be certain that the presence of long-term symptoms in a particular patient is correctly attributable to having had Lyme disease, an objective biomarker would be highly desirable."

Using X-ray crystallography, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, microscale thermophoresis, and cellular localization studies, we show that basic membrane protein D (BmpD) is a periplasmic substrate-binding protein of an ABC transporter system binding to purine nucleosides. Nucleosides are essential for bacterial survival in the host organism, and these studies suggest a key role for BmpD in the purine salvage pathway of B. burgdorferi sensu lato Because B. burgdorferisensu lato lacks the enzymes required for de novo purine synthesis, BmpD may play a vital role in ensuring access to the purines needed to sustain an infection in the host. Furthermore, we show that, although human LB patients develop anti-BmpD antibodies, immunization of mice with BmpD does not confer protection against B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe. In addition, the relapsing-fever spirochaete Borrelia miyamotoi, which has been associated with febrile illness and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised persons, is present in Europe. This study investigated Borrelia prevalence and species distribution in ticks removed from humans and sent as diagnostic material to the Institute for Parasitology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, in 2013-2017. A probe-based real-time PCR was carried out and Borrelia-positive samples were subjected to species determination by reverse line blot (RLB), including a B. miyamotoi-specific probe. The overall Borrelia-infection rate as determined by real-time PCR was 20.02 % (510/2547, 95 % CI: 18.48-21.63 %), with annual prevalences ranging from 17.17 % (90/524, 95 % CI: 14.04-20.68 %) in 2014 to 24.12 % (96/398, 95 % CI: 19.99-28.63 %) in 2015. In total, 271/475 (57.1 %) positive samples available for RLB were successfully differentiated. Borrelia afzelii was detected in 30.53 % of cases (145/475, 95 % CI: 26.41-34.89), followed by B. garinii/B. bavariensis (13.26 % [63/475], 95 % CI: 10.34-16.65). Borrelia valaisiana occurred in 5.89 % (28/475, 95 % CI: 3.95-8.41), B. spielmanii in 4.63 % (22/475, 95 % CI: 2.93-6.93), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.)/B. carolinensis in 2.32 % (11/475, 95 % CI: 1.16-4.11), B. lusitaniae in 0.63 % (3/475, 95 % CI: 0.13-1.83) and B. bisettiae in 0.42 % (2/475, 95 % CI: 0.05-1.51) of positive ticks. Borrelia kurtenbachii was not detected, while B. miyamotoi was identified in 7.37 % (35/475, 95 % CI: 5.19-10.10) of real-time PCR-positive samples. Sanger sequencing of B. garinii/B. bavariensis-positive ticks revealed that the majority were B. garinii-infections (50/52 successfully amplified samples), while only 2 ticks were infected with B. bavariensis. Furthermore, 6/12 B. burgdorferi s.s./B. carolinensis-positive samples could be differentiated; all of them were identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Thirty-nine ticks (8.21 %, 95 % CI: 5.90-11.05) were coinfected with two different species. Comparison of the species distribution between ticks removed from humans in 2015 and questing ticks collected in the same year and the same area revealed a significantly higher B. afzelii-prevalence in diagnostic tick samples than in questing ticks, confirming previous observations. The obtained data indicate that Borrelia prevalence fluctuated in the same range as observed in a previous study, analysing the period from 2006 to 2012. Detection of B. miyamotoi in 7.37 % of Borrelia-positive samples points to the fact that clinicians should be aware of this pathogen as a differential diagnosis in cases of febrile illness."

Sampling of white-footed mice allows for year-round B. burgdorferi surveillance as well as opportunities to establish the diversity of the different variants in a geographic region. This study explores the prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections in the tissues of white-footed mice, investigates the correlations between B. burgdorferi infected tissues, and determines the optimum field methods for surveillance of B. burgdorferi in P. leucopus. A total of 90 mice and 573 tissues (spleen, liver, ear, tongue, tail, heart, and kidney) were screened via nested PCR for B. burgdorferi infections. A large number of infections were found in the 90 mice as well as multiple infections within individual mice. Infections in a single mouse tissue (spleen, liver, ear, tongue and tail) were predictive of concurrent infection in other tissues of the same mouse at a statistically significant level. Ear tissue accounted for 68.4% of detected infections, which increased to 78.9% of the infected mice with the inclusion of tail samples. The use of ear punch or tail snip samples (used individually or in tandem) have multiple advantages over current Lyme disease ecological studies and surveillance methodologies, including lower associated costs, minimization of delays, year-round B. burgdorferi testing opportunities, as well as longitudinal monitoring of B. burgdorferi in defined geographic regions. In the absence of an effective vaccine, personal prevention measures are currently the most effective way to reduce Lyme disease transmission to humans. Thus, the identification and monitoring of environmental reservoirs to inform at-risk populations remains a priority. The sampling methods proposed in this study provide a reasonable estimate of B. burgdorferi in white-footed mice in a timely and cost-effective manner."

We screened 459 I. scapularis ticks submitted to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Tick Testing Laboratory with the objectives to (1) examine differences in infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti, and Borrelia miyamotoi, (2) evaluate whether prevalence of co-infections occur at the same frequency that would be expected based on single infection, and (3) determine the presence of rickettsial endosymbionts in I. scapularis. The prevalence of infection in I. scapularis was highest with Bo. burgdorferi sensu lato (nymph = 45.8%; female = 47.0%), followed by A. phagocytophilum (nymph = 4.0%; female = 6.9%), Ba. microti (nymph = 5.7%; female = 4.7%), and Bo. miyamotoi (nymph = 0%; female = 7.3%). We also identified rickettsial endosymbionts in 93.3% of I. scapularis. Nymphs were significantly more likely to be infected with Bo. burgdorferi if they were infected with Ba. microti, whereas adult females were significantly more likely to be infected with Bo. burgdorferi if they were infected with A. phagocytophilum. Our study suggests that the infection prevalence of Bo. burgdorferi is not independent of other co-circulating pathogens and that there is a substantially higher infection of Bo. miyamotoi in I. scapularis females compared with nymphs in this study. High prevalence of infection and co-infection with multiple pathogens in I. scapularis highlights the public health consequences in Connecticut, a state endemic for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl). After transmission to humans by ticks, Bbsl spreads to multiple organs, leading to arthritis, carditis, and neuroborreliosis. No effective prophylaxis against human LD prior to tick exposure is currently available. Thus, a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against LD is needed. The establishment of LD bacteria at diverse sites is dictated partly by the binding of Bbsl to proteoglycans (PGs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in tissues. The drug heparin is structurally similar to these GAGs and inhibits Bbsl attachment to PGs, GAGs, cells, and tissues, suggesting its potential to prevent LD. However, the anticoagulant activity of heparin often results in hemorrhage, hampering the development of this compound as LD PrEP. We have previously synthesized a non-anticoagulant version of heparin (NACH), which was verified for safety in mice and humans. Here, we showed that NACH blocks Bbsl attachment to PGs, GAGs, and mammalian cells. We also found that treating mice with NACH prior to the exposure of ticks carrying Bbsl followed by continuous administration of this compound prevents tissue colonization by Bbsl. Furthermore, NACH-treated mice develop greater levels of IgG and IgM against Bbsl at early stages of infection, suggesting that the upregulation of antibody immune responses may be one of the mechanisms for NACH-mediated LD prevention. This is one of the first studies examining the ability of a heparin-based compound to prevent LD prior to tick exposure. The information presented might also be extended to prevent other infectious diseases agents."

		"abstract": "Experimental Outer surface protein (Osp) C based subunit chimeritope vaccinogens for Lyme disease (LD) were assessed for immunogenicity, structure, ability to elicit antibody (Ab) responses to divergent OspC proteins, and bactericidal activity. Chimeritopes are chimeric epitope based proteins that consist of linear epitopes derived from multiple proteins or multiple variants of a protein. An inherent advantage to chimeritope vaccinogens is that they can be constructed to trigger broadly protective Ab responses. Three OspC chimeritope proteins were comparatively assessed: Chv1, Chv2 and Chv3. The Chv proteins possess the same set of 18 linear epitopes derived from 9 OspC type proteins but differ in the physical ordering of epitopes or by the presence or absence of linkers. All Chv proteins were immunogenic in mice and rats eliciting high titer Ab. Immunoblot and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays demonstrated that the Chv proteins elicit IgG that recognizes a diverse array of OspC type proteins. The panel included OspC proteins produced by N. American and European strains of the LD spirochetes. Rat anti-Chv antisera uniformly labeled intact, non-permeabilized Borreliella burgdorferi demonstrating that vaccinal Ab can bind to targets that are naturally presented on the spirochete cell surface. Vaccinal Ab also displayed potent complement dependent-Ab mediated killing activity. This study highlights the ability of OspC chimeritopes to serve as vaccinogens that trigger potentially broadly protective Ab responses. In addition to the current use of an OspC chimeritope in a canine LD vaccine, chimeritopes can serve as key components of human LD subunit vaccines."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a functional homolog of canonical Lon protease termed Lon-2. To date, the contribution of Lon-2 to B. burgdorferi fitness and infection remains unexplored. Herein, we showed that expression of lon-2 was highly induced during animal infection, suggesting that Lon-2 is important for B. burgdorferi infection. We further generated a lon-2 deletion mutant. Compared with that of wild-type (WT) strain, the infectivity of the mutant was severely attenuated in a murine infection model. Although no growth defect was observed for the mutant in normal BSK-II medium, resistance of the lon-2 mutant to osmotic stress was markedly reduced. In addition, when exposed to tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, survival of the lon-2 mutant was impaired. In addition, we found that the protein levels of RpoS and RpoS-dependent OspC were decreased in the mutant. All these phenotypes were restored to WT or near-WT levels when lon-2 mutation was complemented in cis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Lon-2 is critical for B. burgdorferi to establish infection and to cope with environmental stresses. This study provides a foundation for further uncovering the direct link between the dual roles of Lon-2 in protein quality control and bacterial pathogenesis."

Nearly four decades have elapsed since the discovery of the disease agent called Borrelia burgdorferi. Although there is a plethora of knowledge on the infectious agent and thousands of scientific publications, an effective way on how to combat and prevent Lyme borreliosis has not been found yet. There is no vaccine for humans available, and only one active vaccine program in clinical development is currently running. A spirited search for possible disease interventions is of high public interest as surveillance data indicates that the number of cases of Lyme borreliosis is steadily increasing in Europe and North America. This review provides a condensed digest of the history of vaccine development up to new promising vaccine candidates and strategies that are targeted against Lyme borreliosis, including elements of the tick vector, the reservoir hosts, and the Borrelia pathogen itself."

Infectious disease testing included serology for Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Borrelia burgdorferi, and PCR for B burgdorferi antigen in both cats. Case 1 was also assessed by PCR for Bartonella henselae antigen and case 2 was assessed for Dirofilaria immitis by serology. All infectious disease tests, other than for B burgdorferi, were negative. Case 1 was diagnosed with Lyme carditis based on marked bradydysrhythmia, positive B burgdorferi serology, a structurally normal heart and clinical resolution with appropriate treatment with a 4-year follow-up. Case 2 was diagnosed with Lyme carditis based on marked bradydysrhythmia and positive B burgdorferi PCR; however, this cat had structural heart disease that did not resolve with treatment. This small case series describes two B burgdorferi positive cats presenting with newly diagnosed cardiac abnormalities consistent with those found in humans and dogs with Lyme carditis. Both cats were asymptomatic as perceived by their owners; the arrhythmia was detected by their veterinarians."

The current study compared the level of knowledge and the knowledge needs about Lyme disease among individuals that spend time outdoors for work and for recreational purposes. Between December 2018 and February 2019, a survey was distributed to outdoor organizations across New Brunswick, Canada. Within the current sample of 137 individuals, 36% spent time outdoors for their occupation and 64% for recreational activities. Results showed no significant difference between these groups with regard to their level of knowledge, perceived efficacy and performance of various methods of prevention, and educational needs. Overall, the entire sample reported a low level of knowledge about Lyme disease. Participants perceived each prevention behavior to be at least somewhat effective, and behaviors perceived to be more effective were more likely to be carried out, but the performance of the behaviors varied. The most frequently performed behaviors included wearing long pants and protective footwear. Participants identified several aspects of Lyme disease about which they would like to have more information. The findings call attention to the specific needs of at-risk groups that must be considered when developing educational interventions."

However, enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammals and ticks is poorly characterized throughout much of the region. Here we report prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in small mammal and tick communities in the understudied region of southern California. We found B. burgdorferi s.l. in 1.5% of Ixodes species ticks and 3.6% of small mammals. Infection was uncommon (~0.3%) in Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls (Acari: Ixodidae), the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent to humans in western North America, but a diversity of spirochetes-including Borrelia bissettiae, Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, and B. burgdorferi s.s.-were identified circulating in Ixodes species ticks and their small mammal hosts. Infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. is more common in coastal habitats, where a greater diversity of Ixodes species ticks are found feeding on small mammal hosts (four species when compared with only I. pacificus in other sampled habitats). This provides some preliminary evidence that in southern California, wetter coastal areas might be more favorable for enzootic transmission than hotter and drier climates. Infection patterns confirm that human transmission risk of B. burgdorferi s.s. is low in this region. However, given evidence for local maintenance of B. burgdorferi s.l., more studies of enzootic transmission may be warranted, particularly in understudied regions where the tick vector of B. burgdorferi s.s. occurs."

		"abstract": "Understanding the drivers of Lyme disease incidence at broad spatial scales is critical for predicting and mitigating human disease risk. Previous studies have identified vector phenology and behavior, host community composition, and landscape features as drivers of variable Lyme disease risk. However, while the Lyme disease transmission cycles in the eastern and western USA involve different vector species (Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes pacificus, respectively), the role of vector-specific differences in transmission efficiency has not been directly examined. By comparing the performance of traits involved in vector competence between these two species, this study aims to identify how vector competence contributes to variable Lyme disease risk. We used a suite of laboratory experiments to compare the performance of traits related to vector competence for the two USA Lyme disease vectors. For each species, we measured the rate of attachment to a common rodent host, the engorgement weight, and the efficiency of pathogen acquisition (host to tick) and pathogen transmission (tick to host) from laboratory mice. In measuring pathogen acquisition and transmission, we used two different pathogen strains, one sympatric with I. scapularis and one sympatric with I. pacificus, to assess the importance of vector-pathogen coevolutionary history in transmission dynamics. We found I. pacificus had significantly higher host attachment success and engorgement weights, but significantly lower pathogen transmission efficiency relative to I. scapularis. Molting success and pathogen acquisition did not differ between these two species. However, pathogen acquisition efficiency was significantly higher for both sympatric vector and pathogen strains than the allopatric pairings. This study identified species-specific vector traits as a potential driver of broad scale variation in Lyme disease risk in the USA. In particular, the exceedingly low rates of pathogen transmission from tick to host observed for I. pacificus may limit Lyme disease transmission efficiency in the western USA. Further, observed variation in pathogen acquisition between sympatric and allopatric vector-pathogen strains indicate that vector-pathogen coevolutionary history may play a key role in transmission dynamics. These findings underscore the need to consider vector traits and vector-pathogen coevolution as important factors governing regional Lyme disease risk."

The patient presented in late summer 2019 with radicular pains followed by a foot drop and peripheral facial palsy, both right-sided. Due to a history of breast cancer, disseminated malignant disease was initially suspected. Bone metastasis was ruled out by skeletal scintigraphy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neuroaxis and a whole body 18F-FDG PET-CT was performed within 48 hours. The MRI revealed a strong contrast enhancement of the conus medullaris and fibers of the cauda equina, while the 18F-FDG PET/CT was without pathological findings. Examination of cerebrospinal fluid led to the definitive diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis with monocytic pleocytosis and a positive intrathecal test for Borrelia burgdorferi. The patient became pain-free after 10 days of ceftriaxone, and the paralysis slowly regressed the following month. This case highlights the difficulty of the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis and discusses the relevant imaging findings."

		"abstract": "Many late-stage chronic Lyme disease clinical findings are neuropsychiatric. A total clinical assessment is critical in diagnosis, especially since controversy surrounds the reliability of laboratory testing. The clinical findings of one hundred Lyme disease patients with chronic neuropsychiatric symptoms were entered into a database. The prevalence of each clinical finding pre-infection and post-infection was compared and calculated within the 95% confidence interval. Patients had minimal symptoms pre-infection, but a high post-infection prevalence of a broad spectrum of acquired multisystem symptoms. These findings included impairments of attention span, memory, processing, executive functioning, emotional functioning, behavior, psychiatric syndromes, vegetative functioning, neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, upper respiratory, dental, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and other symptoms. The most prevalent symptoms included sustained attention impairments, brain fog, unfocused concentration, joint symptoms, distraction by frustration, depression, working memory impairments, decreased school/job performance, recent memory impairments, difficulty prioritizing multiple tasks, fatigue, non-restorative sleep, multitasking difficulties, sudden mood swings, hypersomnia, mental apathy, decreased social functioning, insomnia, tingling, word finding difficulties, name retrieval, headaches, sound hypersensitivity, paresis, anhedonia, depersonalization, cold intolerance, body temperature fluctuations, light sensitivity and dysfluent speech. The average patient had five symptoms pre-infection and 82 post-infection. Pattern recognition is critical in making a diagnosis. This study was used to develop three clinical assessment forms."

		"abstract": "The development of vaccines for prevention of diseases caused by pathogenic species can encounter major obstacles if high sequence diversity is observed between individual strains. Therefore, development might be restricted either to conserved antigens, which are often rare, or to multivalent vaccines, which renders the production more costly and cumbersome. In light of this complexity, we applied a structure-based surface shaping approach for the development of a Lyme borreliosis (LB) vaccine suitable for the United States and Europe. The surface of the C-terminal fragment of outer surface protein A (OspA) was divided into distinct regions, based primarily on binding sites of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). In order to target the six clinically most relevant OspA serotypes (ST) in a single protein, exposed amino acids of the individual regions were exchanged to corresponding amino acids of a chosen OspA serotype. Six chimeric proteins were constructed, and, based on their immunogenicity, four of these chimeras were tested in mouse challenge models. Significant protection could be demonstrated for all four proteins following challenge with infected ticks (OspA ST1, OspA ST2, and OspA ST4) or with in vitro-grown spirochetes (OspA ST1 and OspA ST5). Two of the chimeric proteins were linked to form a fusion protein, which provided significant protection against in vitro-grown spirochetes (OspA ST1) and infected ticks (OspA ST2). This article presents the proof-of-concept study for a multivalent OspA vaccine targeting a wide range of pathogenic LB Borrelia species with a single recombinant antigen for prevention of Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Articular joints are a major target of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme arthritis. Despite antibiotic treatment, recurrent or persistent Lyme arthritis is observed in a significant number of patients. The host immune response plays a crucial role in this chronic arthritic joint complication of Borrelia infections. During the early stages of B. burgdorferi infection, a major hinder in generating a proper host immune response is the lack of induction of a strong adaptive immune response. This may lead to a delayed hyperinflammatory reaction later in the disease. Several mechanisms have been suggested that might be pivotal for the development of Lyme arthritis and will be highlighted in this review, from molecular mimicry of matrix metallopeptidases and glycosaminoglycans, to autoimmune responses to live bacteria, or remnants of Borrelia spirochetes in joints. Murine studies have suggested that the inflammatory responses are initiated by innate immune cells, but this does not exclude the involvement of the adaptive immune system in this dysregulated immune profile. Genetic predisposition, via human leukocyte antigen-DR isotype and microRNA expression, has been associated with the development of antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. Yet the ultimate cause for (antibiotic-refractory) Lyme arthritis remains unknown. Complex processes of different immune cells and signaling cascades are involved in the development of Lyme arthritis. When these various mechanisms are fully been unraveled, new treatment strategies can be developed to target (antibiotic-refractory) Lyme arthritis more effectively."

We evaluated serological evidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), West Nile (WN), Hepatitis E virus (HEV), Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), Yersiniosis, Lyme Disease (LD), and brucellosis in 1033 patients presenting with acute febrile illness at 9 health care facilities from diverse ecological zones of Kenya: arid and semiarid (Garissa District Hospital, Lodwar District Hospital, Marigat District Hospital, Gilgil District Hospital), Lake Victoria basin (Kisumu District Hospital, Alupe District Hospital, Kombewa Sub-County Hospital), Kisii highland (Kisii District Hospital), and coastal (Malindi District Hospital). Epidemiological information of the patients such as geography, age, gender, and keeping animals were analyzed as potential risk factors. Of the 1033 samples, 619 (59.9%) were seropositive to at least one pathogen by IgM (current exposure), IgG/IgM (recent exposure), and IgG (past exposure). Collective seroprevalence for current, recent, and past to the pathogens was 9.4%, 5.1%, and 21.1% for LD; 3.6%, 0.5%, and 12.4% for WN; 0.9%, 0.5%, and 16.9% for HEV; 5.8%, 1.3%, and 3.9% for brucellosis; 5.7%, 0.2%, and 2.3% for yersiniosis; 1.7%, 0%, and 6.2% for TBE; and 0.4%, 0%, and 1.9% for CCHF. Brucellosis risk was higher in patients recruited at Garissa District Hospital (odds ratio [OR] = 3.41), HEV (OR = 2.45) and CCHF (OR = 5.46) in Lodwar District Hospital, LD in Alupe District Hospital (OR = 5.73), Kombewa Sub-district hospital (OR = 8.17), and Malindi District hospital (OR = 3.3). Exposure to LD was highest in the younger age group, whereas yersiniosis did not vary with age. Age was a significant risk for WN, brucellosis, CCHF, TBE, and HEV and in those aged >14 years there was an increased risk to WN (OR = 2.30, p < 0.0001), brucellosis (OR = 1.84, p = 0.005), CCHF (OR = 4.35, p = 0.001), TBE (OR = 2.78, p < 0.0001), and HEV (OR = 1.94, p = 0.0001). We conclude that LD is pervasive and constitutes a significant health burden to the study population, whereas yersiniosis and CCHF are not significant threats. Going forward, community-based studies will be needed to capture the true seroprevalence rates and the associated risk factors."

However, some insist that such symptoms are due to a persistent Borrelia burgdorferi infection requiring prolonged antibiotic therapy to resolve. This unproven view is bolstered by the results of in vitro experiments where small numbers of viable B. burgdorferi can be detected after treatment with antibiotics. The results described in the present work suggest that the presence of persisters can best be explained by classic biochemical kinetics and that there are alternative explanations for this phenomenon that appears to have no clinical significance."

With a wide spectrum of possible symptoms, the microbiological diagnosis of this disease is associated with a wide variety of ideas, divergent approaches and much uncertainty. The aim of the article is to introduce the treating physicians to a meaningful microbiological diagnostic procedure. Most important messages include that (I) the suspected diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is first based on anamnestic data and clinical symptoms (compare \"case definitions\") which is substantiated by microbiological examinations; (II) microbiological diagnostics - primarily antibody detection, downstream PCR and culture - are only indicated if there are indicative symptoms, with typical erythema migrans not requiring microbiological diagnostics; (III) keep in mind: The more unspecific the symptoms are the lower the positive and the higher the negative predictive value of microbiological testing; (IV) serological diagnosis should follow a two-step procedure: a sensitive ELISA as first step, if reactive followed by immunoblot (IgM and IgG). Detection rates are ca. 50 % in localized, 70- > 90 % in disseminated early and nearly 100 % (only IgG relevant) in late disease; (V) in the immunoblot early forms of disease show a narrow band spectrum, late forms show a broad spectrum; (VI) methods that are not recommended for diagnostic purposes include lymphocyte activation or transformation tests (LTT, MELISA, ELISPOT), PCR or antigen detection from urine or blood, lymphocyte subpopulations, or direct detection of borreliae from patient material using dark field- or focus floating microscopy."

Early manifestations are erythema migrans, multiple erythemata migrantia, and (less frequently) borrelial lymphocytoma. A typical late manifestation is acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Lyme neuroborreliosis is much less common with an incidence of about 0.8/100 000 inhabitants in Germany. Bannwarth's syndrome (painful radiculoneuritis) is the most common manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis in adults followed by meningitis. International case definitions exist regarding the likelihood of Lyme neuroborreliosis on the basis of diagnostic test results. A CSF analysis should be performed in patients with suspected Lyme neuroborreliosis. The first line treatment for dermatological manifestations of Lyme borreliosis is doxycycline, in children and pregnant women amoxicillin. Doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics show similar efficacy regarding neurological symptoms and adverse effects for treatment of neurological manifestations. Treatment duration for early manifestations is 10 to 14 days, in Lyme neuroborreliosis it should not exceed 21 days. All manifestations, also Lyme neuroborreliosis, usually show a favourable prognosis after antibiotic treatment. Antibiotic treatment does not show any efficacy in patients with unspecific symptoms and concurrent positive anti-borrelial serology."

		"abstract": "Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) have the potential to act as disease reservoirs for wildlife and are important sentinels for common circulating pathogens. Therefore, the infectious disease seroprevalence among domestic dogs in northern Botswana may be indicative of pathogen exposure of various wildlife species. The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of Ehrlichia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria immitis, canine adenovirus, canine parvovirus, and canine distemper virus in domestic dogs as proxies of disease prevalence in the local wildlife in the Okavango Delta region of Botswana. Statistical analysis assessed crude and factor-specific seroprevalence proportions in relation to age, sex, and geographical location as predictors of seropositivity. Logistic regression was used to identify adjusted predictors of seropositivity for each of the pathogens of interest. Samples from 233 dogs in a total of seven locations in Maun, Botswana, and surrounding villages were collected and serologically analyzed. No dogs were seropositive for B. burgdorferi, while low seroprevalence proportions were observed for Anaplasma spp. (2.2%) and D. immitis (0.9%). Higher seroprevalence proportions were observed for the tick-borne pathogen Ehrlichia spp. (21.0%), and 19.7% were seropositive for canine adenovirus (hepatitis). The highest seroprevalence proportions were for canine parvovirus (70.0%) and canine distemper virus (44.8%). The predictors of seropositivity revealed that adults were more likely to be seropositive for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, and canine parvovirus than juveniles, and location was a risk factor for canine adenovirus, canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, and Ehrlichia spp. Results indicate that increasing tick control and vaccination campaigns for domestic dogs may improve the health of domestic animals, and potentially wildlife and humans in the Okavango Delta since viral and vector-borne bacterial pathogens can be transmitted between them."

Out of the 1,858 tested, 465 (25.0%) were infected with Rickettsia amblyommatis Karpathy, a species of undetermined pathogenicity found frequently in A. americanum, while 1/1,858 (0.05%) contained Rickettsia rickettsii Brumpt, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever. No ticks tested positive for mildly pathogenic Rickettsia parkeri Lackman, and no ticks were co-infected with multiple Rickettsia spp. Our results indicate that A. americanum could be involved in transmission of R. rickettsii to humans in New Jersey, albeit rarely. The much higher rates of R. amblyommatis infection are consistent with hypotheses that human sera reacting to this species could contribute to reports of mild SFGR cases."

The clinical features are well-characterized and treatment is usually curative, but misperceptions about morbidity persist. The purpose of this review is to examine advances in the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease, as well as ongoing management challenges. It is useful to recognize that Lyme disease occurs in stages, with early- and late-stage disease. Clinical expression is in part determined by Borrelial variability. For example, some strains of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative organism in North America, are particularly arthritogenic. Most patients with early Lyme disease can be cured with a single course of oral antibiotic therapy, in contrast to some patients with Lyme arthritis, a late-stage manifestation, who are more antibiotic refractory and require other treatment strategies. Successful treatment of Lyme disease begins with successful diagnosis and with an understanding of the emergence, clinical features, and impact of Lyme disease over the past half century."

		"abstract": "This study is aimed at evaluating the awareness among hunters and foresters concerning the activities undertaken for the prevention of <i>Borrelia burgdorferi</i> infections. The study group included 236 hunters from Poland and 339 foresters from Ukraine. The study was based on an original questionnaire including questions which concerned the applied methods of removing ticks attached to the skin, the kind of preventive measures undertaken to avoid tick bites, the evaluation of knowledge concerning the prevention of tick-borne diseases, as well as the participants' willingness to be educated on this issue. Removing a tick with a pair of tweezers by a simple vertical move was more frequently practiced by the hunters (16.5%). Spreading an oily substance over a tick to make it go out on its own was more often applied by the foresters (18.8%). The occurrence of <i>erythema migrans</i> was more frequently reported by the foresters (47.2%). Among the persons declaring no knowledge of the prevention of tick-borne diseases, 77.8% of the hunters and 61.5% of the foresters were willing to gain such knowledge, and 11.1% of the hunters and 21.2% of the foresters did not want any education on this issue. The hunters more often than the foresters applied repellents and checked their body after returning from green areas. Education is needed in certain groups undertaking hobby or vocational activities in forest areas of Poland and Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake research on the preferences concerning the choice of repellents among the groups at risk of tick bites. Med Pr. 2020;71(1):59-68."

We previously reported the infection of C3H 5-lipoxygenase (LO)-deficient mice with Borrelia burgdorferi results in prolonged nonresolving Lyme arthritis. Here we define the role of the 5-LO metabolite leukotriene (LT)B4 and its high-affinity receptor, BLT1, in this response. C3H and C3H BLT1-/- mice were infected with B. burgdorferi and arthritis progression was monitored by ankle swelling over time. Similar to 5-LO-/- mice, BLT1-/- mice developed nonresolving Lyme arthritis characterized by increased neutrophils in the joint at later time points than WT mice, but with fewer apoptotic (caspase-3+ ) neutrophils. In vitro, BLT1-/- neutrophils were defective in their ability to undergo apoptosis due to the lack of LTB4 -mediated down-regulation of cAMP, subsequent failure to induce Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) components, and decreased FasL and CD36 expression. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with SQ 22,536 restored BLT1-/- BMN apoptosis, FasL and CD36 expression, and clearance by macrophages. We conclude that LTB4/BLT1 signaling has an unexpected critical role in mediating neutrophil apoptosis via the down-regulation of cAMP. Loss of BLT1 signaling led to defective clearance of neutrophils from the inflamed joint and failed arthritis resolution."

		"abstract": "The genus Borrelia comprises spirochaetal bacteria maintained in natural transmission cycles by tick vectors and vertebrate reservoir hosts. The main groups are represented by a species complex including the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis and relapsing fever group Borrelia. Borrelia miyamotoi belongs to the relapsing fever group of spirochetes and forms distinct populations in North America, Asia, and Europe. As all Borrelia species B. miyamotoi possess an unusual and complex genome consisting of a linear chromosome and a number of linear and circular plasmids. The species is considered an emerging human pathogen and an increasing number of human cases are being described in the Northern hemisphere. The aim of this study was to produce a high quality reference genome that will facilitate future studies into genetic differences between different populations and the genome plasticity of B. miyamotoi. We used multiple available sequencing methods, including Pacific Bioscience single-molecule real-time technology (SMRT) and Oxford Nanopore technology (ONT) supplemented with highly accurate Illumina sequences, to explore the suitability for whole genome assembly of the Russian B. miyamotoi isolate, Izh-4. Plasmids were typed according to their potential plasmid partitioning genes (PF32, 49, 50, 57/62). Comparing and combining results of both long-read (SMRT and ONT) and short-read methods (Illumina), we determined that the genome of the isolate Izh-4 consisted of one linear chromosome, 12 linear and two circular plasmids. Whilst the majority of plasmids had corresponding contigs in the Asian B. miyamotoi isolate FR64b, there were only four that matched plasmids of the North American isolate CT13-2396, indicating differences between B. miyamotoi populations. Several plasmids, e.g. lp41, lp29, lp23, and lp24, were found to carry variable major proteins. Amongst those were variable large proteins (Vlp) subtype Vlp-α, Vlp-γ, Vlp-δ and also Vlp-β. Phylogenetic analysis of common plasmids types showed the uniqueness in Russian/Asian isolates of B. miyamotoi compared to other isolates. We here describe the genome of a Russian B. miyamotoi clinical isolate, providing a solid basis for future comparative genomics of B. miyamotoi isolates. This will be a great impetus for further basic, molecular and epidemiological research on this emerging tick-borne pathogen."

White-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) are the primary and most competent reservoir host of B. burgdorferi in the Northeast. Live reservoir-targeted vaccines (RTVs) to limit enzootic transmission of B. burgdorferi were previously developed and successfully evaluated in laboratory and controlled field trials. A novel, inactivated RTV was developed to minimize regulatory and market challenges facing previous RTVs based on live bacterial or viral vehicles. Thirty-two residential properties in Redding, Connecticut, participated in a field trial of an orally delivered, inactivated RTV efficacy study (2015-2016). During the two-year vaccination period, a significant decrease in the percentage of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis larvae parasitizing P. leucopus was observed, as was a significant reduction in the percentage of infected P. leucopus on RTV-treated properties when compared to control properties. This novel inactivated RTV was effective in reducing numbers of B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi-infected P. leucopus on properties where it was distributed."

		"abstract": "Increases in tick-borne disease prevalence and transmission are important public health issues. Efforts to control these emerging diseases are frustrated by the struggle to control tick populations and to detect and treat infections caused by the pathogens that they transmit. This review covers tick-borne infectious diseases of nonrickettsial bacterial, parasitic, and viral origins. While tick surveillance and tracking inform our understanding of the importance of the spread and ecology of ticks and help identify areas of risk for disease transmission, the vectors are not the focus of this document. Here, we emphasize the most significant pathogens that infect humans as well as the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases that they cause. Although detection via molecular or immunological methods has improved, tick-borne diseases continue to remain underdiagnosed, making the scope of the problem difficult to assess. Our current understanding of the incidence of tick-borne diseases is discussed in this review. An awareness of the diseases that can be transmitted by ticks in specific locations is key to detection and selection of appropriate treatment. As tick-transmitted pathogens are discovered and emerge in new geographic regions, our ability to detect, describe, and understand the growing public health threat must also grow to meet the challenge."

The aim of the present study was to investigate if there is a constitutional difference in complement activation between individuals with previous subclinical Lyme borreliosis (SB) and patients previously diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).Lepirudin plasma for activation studies was collected from 60 SB individuals and from 22 patients pre-diagnosed with LNB. The plasma was incubated with live Borrelia spirochetes of two strains (complement sensitive B. garinii Lu59 and complement resistant B. afzelii ACA1).Complement factor C3 was measured in non-activated lepirudin plasma with immune-nephelometry and C3a and sC5b-9 generated during complement activation were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We found that the complement sensitive Lu59 induced higher complement activation than the complement resistant ACA1 when measuring activation products C3a and sC5b-9 in SB and LNB patients, p < 0.0001. No significant difference was found between SB and LNB patients in systemic levels of C3. Furthermore, SB individuals generated a higher activation of C3 cleavage to C3a (C3a/C3 ratio) than LNB patients after activation with ACA1, p < 0.001, but no significant differences were found in response to Lu59. In conclusion, Lu59 induced higher complement activation than ACA1 and individuals with previous SB showed increased generation of C3a compared with patients with previous LNB. In our study population, this mechanism could lead to less elimination of spirochetes in LNB patients and thereby be a factor contributing to the clinical outcome."

		"abstract": "Despite the constant development of biotechnology, laboratory diagnostics of Lyme disease in children still poses a significant challenge. The aim of this article is to present the current methods of Lyme disease diagnosis and its future perspectives. A serological test is often the first step in supporting clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Recently, a new generation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays has been created. These assays use recombinant proteins or synthetic peptides in their antigenic spectrum. It is postulated that these tests may replace the classic immunoblot as the second step in the Lyme disease diagnostic protocol. Direct detection methods based on bacterial culture techniques or using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have inadequate sensitivity, which prevents their widespread use in clinical practice. Recently, a number of other tools have been developed that are of supportive importance. Among them, measuring of the CXCL13 chemokine concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has the potential to become a routine procedure in the diagnosis of Lyme disease in children. Future diagnostic strategies of Lyme disease might include: innovative immunological tests using new antigens, combining serology with direct methods in order to increase sensitivity, standardization of selected unconventional tests, identification of host response biochemical metabolic markers or linking clinical symptoms reported by patients with appropriate test panels. In the absence a vaccine which protects against the disease, the preventive recommendations given to parents to prevent tick bites in children remain valid."

		"abstract": "Complement is a key first line innate host defense system in the blood of vertebrates. Upon activation, this powerful defense mechanism can elicit inflammatory responses, lyse non-self-cells, or mark them for opsonophagocytic removal. Blood-feeding arthropods thus require the ability to block host complement activation in the bloodmeal to prevent undesired cell or tissue damage during feeding. The soft tick Ornithodoros moubata produces a complement inhibitory protein, OmCI. This protein binds to a mammalian complement protein C5 and blocks further activation of complement cascades, which results in the prevention of complement-mediated bacterial killing through membrane attack complex. Interestingly, the amino acids involved in OmCI binding are highly conserved among mammalian and avian C5, but the ability of this protein to inhibit the complement from birds remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that OmCI is capable of preventing quail complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis, inhibiting the capability of this animal's complement to eliminate a serum-sensitive Lyme disease bacterial strain. We also found that the ability of OmCI to inhibit quail complement-mediated killing of Lyme disease bacteria can be extended to different domestic and wild birds. Our results illustrate the utility of OmCI to block bird complement. These results provide the foundation for further use of this protein as a tool to study the molecular basis of avian complement and pathogen evasion to such a defense mechanism."

National surveillance shows that children are an at-risk age group. To study the epidemiology of LD in Canadian children using the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) to better understand exposure history, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of paediatric LD cases in Canada. A structured questionnaire was completed by paediatricians for each LD case reported as part of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from 2014 to 2017. There were 95 cases that met inclusion criteria as confirmed or probable cases. The median age was 7 years; 38 % were 5-9 years and 35 % were 10-15 years of age. Most cases were acquired in known Canadian endemic locations; 5 were acquired during travel to the US. Most cases were reported from Nova Scotia and Ontario (46 % and 38 % respectively). The most common clinical presentation was arthritis (59 % of all cases), which is a manifestation of the late disseminated stage of LD. Late disseminated disease presented through the year, whereas early LD (Erythema migrans) and early disseminated LD presented during the summer and fall. Antibiotic choice and duration of therapy generally followed accepted guidelines. This study of the clinical spectrum of LD in Canadian children underlines the need for preventive measures to protect children in Canada from emerging LD, and the need for health care provider awareness."

Screening included a detailed questionnaire for Lymes disease, complete ocular and systemic examination by an ophthalmologist and infectious disease specialist and blood collection. ELISA for IgM and IgG antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi were performed on the collected sera samples. Western blot confirmation was done on the seropositive samples. Ticks were also collected from these forest areas for future studies to detect if they harbor B. burgdorferi. Seroprevalence of 19.9% was noted by ELISA. Western blot confirmation was seen in 15.6% of the seropositive samples. There was significant correlation between seropositivity and exposure to tick bites (P = 0.023). There is a high seroprevalence of infection with B. burgdorferi in the forest areas of Nagarahole and Bandipur ranges in south India."

Weighted seroprevalence for CCHF among all participants was 1.2%, increasing to 3.4% in villages with a known history of CCHF circulation. Weighted seroprevalence was 2.4% for Lyme disease and 1.3% for Q fever. We found evidence of CCHF virus circulation in areas not known to harbor the virus. We noted that activities that put persons at high risk for zoonotic or tickborne disease also were risk factors for seropositivity. However, recognition of the role of livestock in disease transmission and use of personal protective equipment when performing high-risk activities were low among participants."

		"abstract": "The incidence of tick-borne infections in the United States has risen significantly in the past decade. Ticks can transmit a variety of pathogens, including bacteria, protozoa, and viruses, that can cause serious illnesses. Therefore, the use of rapid, sensitive, and specific multiplex tests is important to identify the pathogen(s) in the acute phase and determine appropriate treatment to minimize the severity of the disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate ChromaCode's research use only (RUO) nine-target high-definition PCR (HDPCR) tick-borne pathogen (TBP) panel using 379 retrospective, remnant whole-blood and synovial fluid specimens previously submitted to Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Laboratories and tested by clinically validated real-time PCR assays for Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia spp., or Lyme Borrelia spp. The performance characteristics evaluated included positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) with the ARUP laboratory-developed tests (LDTs). All tested targets had an initial PPA greater than 97.0%, except Ehrlichia ewingii, with a PPA of 88.9%. The NPAs for all targets were between 98.8% and 100%. The TBP panel detected three coinfections, with two of Babesia microti and A. phagocytophilum and one of B. microti and E. chaffeensis, which were confirmed by the LDTs. There were 16 samples with discordant results compared to the LDT results, five of which were resolved by repeat testing on the TBP panel and bidirectional sequencing. Following discrepant resolution, the final PPA and NPA for the TBP panel were 97.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 95.2% to 99.0%) and 99.6% (95% CI, 99.3% to 99.8%), respectively, with an overall agreement of 99.5% (95% CI, 99.2% to 99.7%) with the LDTs."

Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression, current tests are insensitive in early stage LD, with a sensitivity of <50%. Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 h). To address these challenges, we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care (POC) test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA). We trained a deep-learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets and then blindly tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-) = 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0%, respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning, the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3%, with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7%, respectively."

		"abstract": "Birds are hosts for several zoonotic pathogens. Because of their high mobility, especially of longdistance migrants, birds can disperse these pathogens, affecting their distribution and phylogeography. We focused on Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which includes the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, as an example for tick-borne pathogens, to address the role of birds as propagation hosts of zoonotic agents at a large geographical scale. We collected ticks from passerine birds in 11 European countries. B. burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in Ixodes spp. was 37% and increased with latitude. The fieldfare Turdus pilaris and the blackbird T. merula carried ticks with the highest Borrelia prevalence (92 and 58%, respectively), whereas robin Erithacus rubecula ticks were the least infected (3.8%). Borrelia garinii was the most prevalent genospecies (61%), followed by B. valaisiana (24%), B. afzelii (9%), B. turdi (5%) and B. lusitaniae (0.5%). A novel Borrelia genospecies \"Candidatus Borrelia aligera\" was also detected. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis of B. garinii isolates together with the global collection of B. garinii genotypes obtained from the Borrelia MLST public database revealed that: (a) there was little overlap among genotypes from different continents, (b) there was no geographical structuring within Europe, and (c) there was no evident association pattern detectable among B. garinii genotypes from ticks feeding on birds, questing ticks or human isolates. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that the population structure and evolutionary biology of tick-borne pathogens are shaped by their host associations and the movement patterns of these hosts."

		"abstract": "Cattle grazing has been suggested to reduce the risk for Lyme borreliosis by decreasing the density of questing Ixodes ricinus infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We tested the hypotheses that cattle grazing used in woodland management decreases the density of questing I. ricinus, and that it decreases the nympal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. We further expected the nympal infection prevalence of tick-borne pathogens that utilize cattle as amplifying hosts, namely Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia sensu stricto, to increase. To test these hypotheses, we compared the densities of questing I. ricinus between twenty pairs of plots in grazed and ungrazed forest areas. The density of I. ricinus adults, but not nymphs, was lower in areas grazed by cattle than in ungrazed areas. Nymphs were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia s.s. DNA from twelve paired areas. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia s.s. from qPCR-positive tick lysates were identified further to the ecotype and species level, respectively, by DNA sequencing. The infection prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was lower, and infection prevalence of Babesia s.s., identified as Babesia venatorum, was higher in grazed areas. In contrast, infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi s.l. or B. miyamotoi did not differ between grazed and ungrazed areas. As a consequence, conventional cattle grazing in forested areas had no effect on the densities of questing nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and B. miyamotoi. Similarly, we found no effect of cattle grazing on the density of infected nymphs with B. venatorum. The marked difference in the densities of questing nymphs infected with A. phagocytophilum could potentially be explained by the presence of a higher density of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in ungrazed areas, as the majority of typed A. phagocytophilum from ungrazed areas were the non-zoonotic ecotype II, which is associated with roe deer."

		"abstract": "In Lyme disease endemic areas, initial management of children with arthritis can be challenging because diagnostic tests take several days to return results, leading to potentially unnecessary invasive procedures. Our objective was to examine the role of the C6 peptide enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test to guide initial management. We enrolled children with acute arthritis undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease presenting to a participating Pedi Lyme Net emergency department (2015-2019) and performed a C6 EIA test. We defined Lyme arthritis with a positive or equivocal C6 EIA test result followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot result and defined septic arthritis as a positive synovial fluid culture result or a positive blood culture result with synovial fluid pleocytosis. Otherwise, children were considered to have inflammatory arthritis. We report the sensitivity and specificity of the C6 EIA for the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis. Of the 911 study patients, 211 children (23.2%) had Lyme arthritis, 11 (1.2%) had septic arthritis, and 689 (75.6%) had other inflammatory arthritis. A positive or equivocal C6 EIA result had a sensitivity of 100% (211 out of 211; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.2%-100%) and specificity of 94.2% (661 out of 700; 95% CI: 92.5%-95.9%) for Lyme arthritis. None of the 250 children with a positive or equivocal C6 EIA result had septic arthritis (0%; 95% CI: 0%-1.5%), although 75 children underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis and 27 underwent operative joint washout. In Lyme disease endemic areas, a C6 EIA result could be used to guide initial clinical decision-making, without misclassifying children with septic arthritis."

		"abstract": "Background: The Lyme PCR is a direct detection test, but has not been rigorously evaluated in children undergoing evaluation for acute Lyme disease. Methods: We performed a six-center prospective cohort study of children aged 1 to 21 years undergoing acute evaluation for Lyme disease. For this planned secondary analysis, we limited our cohort to children undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease who had any Lyme PCR test obtained by a treating clinician (blood, synovial fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid). We defined a case of Lyme disease with a positive two-tier Lyme disease serology: a positive or equivocal enzyme immunoassay followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot interpreted using standard criteria. We report the test characteristics of Lyme PCR for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Results: We identified 124 children of whom 54 (43.5%) had Lyme disease. Overall, 23 had a positive PCR test (sensitivity 41.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.7-55.0; specificity 100%, 95% CI: 94.2-100). All children with a positive Lyme PCR also had a positive two-tiered Lyme disease serology. Conclusions: The Lyme disease PCR test did not improve the diagnosis of children undergoing evaluation for acute Lyme disease. Given the additional costs of this low utility test, clinicians should not order Lyme PCR testing in the acute care setting."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial illness that occurs in areas of North America, Europe, and Asia. Early infection typically presents as generalized symptoms with an erythema migrans (EM) skin lesion. Dissemination of the pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi can result in multiple EM skin lesions or in extracutaneous manifestations such as Lyme neuroborreliosis. Metabolic biosignatures of patients with early Lyme disease can potentially provide diagnostic targets as well as highlight metabolic pathways that contribute to pathogenesis. Sera from well-characterized patients diagnosed with either early localized Lyme disease (ELL) or early disseminated Lyme disease (EDL), plus healthy controls (HC), from the United States were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative analyses were performed between ELL, or EDL, or ELL combined with EDL, and the HC to develop biosignatures present in early Lyme disease. A direct comparison between ELL and EDL was also performed to develop a biosignature for stages of early Lyme disease. Metabolic pathway analysis and chemical identification of metabolites with LC-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated alterations of eicosanoid, bile acid, sphingolipid, glycerophospholipid, and acylcarnitine metabolic pathways during early Lyme disease. These metabolic alterations were confirmed using a separate set of serum samples for validation. The findings demonstrated that infection of humans with B. burgdorferi alters defined metabolic pathways that are associated with inflammatory responses, liver function, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial function. Additionally, the data provide evidence that metabolic pathways can be used to mark the progression of early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus (Rafinesque), is a reservoir for the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in the eastern half of the United States, where the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say (Acari: Ixodidae), is the primary vector. In the Midwest, an additional Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia mayonii, was recorded from naturally infected I. scapularis and P. leucopus. However, an experimental demonstration of reservoir competence was lacking for a natural tick host. We therefore experimentally infected P. leucopus with B. mayonii via I. scapularis nymphal bites and then fed uninfected larvae on the mice to demonstrate spirochete acquisition and passage to resulting nymphs. Of 23 mice fed on by B. mayonii-infected nymphs, 21 (91%) developed active infections. The infection prevalence for nymphs fed as larvae on these infected mice 4 wk post-infection ranged from 56 to 98%, and the overall infection prevalence for 842 nymphs across all 21 P. leucopus was 75% (95% confidence interval, 72-77%). To assess duration of infectivity, 10 of the P. leucopus were reinfested with uninfected larval ticks 12 wk after the mice were infected. The overall infection prevalence for 480 nymphs across all 10 P. leucopus at the 12-wk time point was 26% (95% confidence interval, 23-31%), when compared with 76% (95% confidence interval, 71-79%) for 474 nymphs from the same subset of 10 mice at the 4-wk time point. We conclude that P. leucopus is susceptible to infection with B. mayonii via bite by I. scapularis nymphs and an efficient reservoir for this Lyme disease spirochete."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia miyamotoi has recently been shown to cause relapsing fever. Like the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks; however, little is known about the response of the immune system upon infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the early immune response against B. burgdorferi We investigated the response of DCs to two different strains of B. miyamotoi using in vitro and ex vivo models and compared this to the response elicited by B. burgdorferi. Our findings show that B. miyamotoi is phagocytosed by monocyte-derived DCs, causing upregulation of activation markers and production of proinflammatory cytokines in a similar manner to B. burgdorferi. Recognition of B. miyamotoi was demonstrated to be partially mediated by TLR2. DCs migrated out of human skin explants upon inoculation of the skin with B. miyamotoi. Finally, we showed that B. miyamotoi-stimulated DCs induced proliferation of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to a larger extent than B. burgdorferi. In conclusion, we show in this study that DCs respond to and mount an immune response against B. miyamotoi that is similar to the response to B. burgdorferi and is able to induce T cell proliferation."

There are not many data available regarding the differences in the course of NB in children and adults. The aim of our study was to compare the clinical course of NB between children and adults. Retrospective analysis of medical documentation of 181 patients with NB was performed. The patients were divided into 2 groups: Group I: 57 children with NB; Group II: 124 adults with NB. Medical data, such as patients' age, sex, place of living (residence), time from a tick bite, subjective complaints, general examination results, laboratory parameters and treatment were analyzed. In children, the most common symptoms were headache (89.5%), neck stiffness (64.9%) and nausea and vomiting (56.1%). In adults, the most common symptoms were headache (77.4%), facial nerve palsy (59.7%), neck stiffness (59.7%), vertigo (41.9%) and lumbosacral region pain (37.1%). Bannwarth's syndrome was observed in 10.5% of children and 36.3% of adults. In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in children, the pleocytosis at admission was higher than in adults, but protein concentration was significantly lower. There were no differences in percentage of mononuclear cells in CSF smear between the groups. In CSF examination after treatment, a decrease in pleocytosis and protein concentration was observed in both groups. Analysis of effectiveness of treatment mostly with third generation cephalosporins (defined as complete recovery) between the groups, calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the use of the log-rank test, showed no significant differences between children and adults (log-rank P = 0.619). In children, NB more frequently presented as meningitis, and in adults in the form of Bannwarth's syndrome. CSF pleocytosis in children with NB was higher than in adults, while the protein concentration in children was lower. Outcomes in children and adults were favorable and did not differ after standard NB treatment."

A significant increase in cases was found for both the Upper Hudson Valley (UHV) region (P < 0.001) as well as for the Lower Hudson Valley region (P = 0.03). The greatest increase in the incidence rate was found for the UHV, with a 16.8-fold increase in incidence over the 8-year time period.

		"abstract": "Prey modify their behavior in response to variation in predation risk, and such modifications can affect trophic processes such as disease transmission. However, variation in predation risk is complex, arising from direct risk from the predator itself and indirect risk due to the environment. Moreover, direct risk typically stems from multiple predators and varies over timescales (e.g., a predator nearby vs. its seasonal activities). We implemented a field-based experiment to disentangle these sources of risk and relate them to antipredator behavior in rodents. We modeled rodent occurrence and activity as a function of short- and long-term risk from a primary predator, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), long-term risk from a second predator, coyotes (Canis latrans), and environmental variables. We found that long-term red fox activity strongly reduced rodent occurrence and that cues of nearby red fox presence decreased rodent activity by > 50%. In addition, this activity reduction was dynamic in that varied according to the background level of long-term red fox activity. Importantly, rodents did not respond to environmental variables (moonlight, temperature, and habitat) or long-term coyote activity. These results bear upon recent work that suggests predators can alter tick-borne disease dynamics via induced antipredator behavior of rodents, which are hosts for pathogens and ticks. Specifically, our study corroborates the hypothesis that red foxes act as important proximal agents in regulating tick-borne diseases by reducing rodent activity. More generally, this study highlights the need to consider the dynamic nature of prey antipredator response across landscapes with variable long-term predation risk."

Maine, USA, is a high Lyme disease incidence state, with rising incidence of Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses associated with increasing I. scapularis abundance and northward range expansion. Members of the public submitted ticks to a tick identification program (1990-2013). From these passive surveillance data, we characterized temporal trends in I. scapularis submission rate (an index of abundance), comparing Maine's northern tier (seven counties) versus southern tier (nine counties). In the northern tier, the I. scapularis submission rate increased throughout the duration of the time series, suggesting I. scapularis was emergent but not established. By contrast, in the southern tier, submission rate increased initially but leveled off after 10-14 yr, suggesting I. scapularis was established by the mid-2000s. Active (field) surveillance data from a site in the southern tier-bird tick burdens and questing adult tick collections-corroborated this leveling pattern. Lyme disease incidence and I. scapularis submission rate were temporally correlated in the northern but not southern tier. This suggested a decoupling of reported disease incidence and entomological risk."

To date, the consistency of information across Canadian websites devoted to Lyme disease (LD) prevention has not been evaluated. The first aim of this study was to describe the contents and recommendations of LD prevention websites provided by two types of Canadian organizations: government (n = 3) and patient groups (n = 3). A second objective was to analyse the level of convergence among these websites in terms of their prevention-related content. Initial coding of the content resulted in information segments grouped into 114 subthemes related to nine overarching themes: tick habitat suitability, risk period, transmission, personal protection, peridomestic environmental management, tick identification and removal, early symptoms, testing and diagnosis and preventive treatment. Comparative content analyses were performed both within and between the content of websites of the two organization types. The themes most frequently addressed by both organization types were personal protection (20% of the prevention-related content in patient group websites and 22% of the prevention-related content in government websites), transmission (12% and 16%, respectively) and tick identification and removal (19% and 15%, respectively). Government websites' information was generally convergent with that of patient group websites (four highly convergent themes, three moderately convergent and two divergent). Nevertheless, of particular concern were divergent messages and inaccurate information found on 11 subthemes out of 103. Examples included other possible modes of transmission and the ineffectiveness of DEET insect repellent. These results suggest the need for public health and health communications research on the issue of the quality of LD prevention information found on the Internet."

So far, Lyme borreliosis has not been diagnosed in Uruguay and the medical relevance of the genus Ixodes in South America is uncertain. However, the growing number of new genospecies of Bbsl in the southern cone region and the scarce information about its pathogenicity, reservoirs and vectors, highlights the importance of further studies about spirochetes present in Uruguay and the region. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Bbsl in Ixodes auritulus ticks collected from birds and vegetation in two localities of southeastern Uruguay. In total 306 I. auritulus were collected from 392 passerine birds sampled and 1110 ticks were collected by flagging in vegetation. Nymphs and females were analyzed for Borrelia spp. by PCR targeting the flagellin (fla) gene and the rrfA-rrlB intergenic spacer region (IGS). The phylogenetic analysis of Borrelia spp. positive samples from passerine birds and vegetation revealed the presence of four fla haplotypes that form a clade within the Bbsl complex. They were closely related to isolates of Borrelia sp. detected in I. auritulus from Argentina and Canada."

		"abstract": "In an update of earlier surveys conducted in Connecticut and New Jersey in the mid-1990s, an online survey of private commercial pest control firms engaged in residential tick control showed that the application of synthetic acaricides continues to be the primary method of control used. The carbamate and organophospate acaricides, previously the most commonly used against ticks, have given way to synthetic pyrethroids and, to a lesser extent, the use of natural product/organic acaricides. Typical costs for a single acaricide application today ($100-$200 for a 1 acre [0.4 ha] property) remain similar to those reported from the earlier surveys, although the frequency of applications and, therefore, also the overall annual cost has increased. The application habitats within residential properties, life stages targeted, and application equipment used have not changed appreciably since the mid-1990s. While most survey respondents expressed knowledge of natural product acaricides and Damminix Tick Tubes, many reported that they either did not employ or knew very little about other alternative tick control methods (including entomopathogenic fungus and topical application of acaricides to tick hosts via 4-Poster deer treatment stations or Select TCS rodent bait boxes). This suggests either a failure to adequately inform the pest management industry and their potential client base of the availability of alternate methods, and/or industry concerns about cost and effectiveness of the alternatives."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex spirochetes. The spirochete is located in the gut of the tick; as the infected tick starts the blood meal, the spirochete must travel through the hemolymph to the salivary glands, where it can spread to and infect the new host organism. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of the key outer surface protein BBE31 from B. burgdorferi and its orthologous protein BSE31 (BSPA14S_RS05060 gene product) from B. spielmanii. BBE31 is known to be important for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from the gut to the hemolymph in the tick after a tick bite. While BBE31 exerts its function by interacting with the Ixodes scapularis tick gut protein TRE31, structural and mass spectrometry data revealed that BBE31 has a glutathione (GSH) covalently attached to Cys142 suggesting that the protein may have acquired some additional functions in contrast to its orthologous protein BSE31, which lacks any interactions with GSH. In the current study, in addition to analyzing the potential reasons for GSH binding, the three-dimensional structure of BBE31 provides new insights into the molecular details of the transmission process as the protein plays an important role in the initial phase before the spirochete is physically transferred to the new host. This knowledge will be potentially used for the development of new strategies to fight against Lyme disease."

We performed searches in 6 electronic databases up to December 2018 following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, including observational studies reporting long-term sequelae, HRQoL, and prognostic factors. We included 46 studies, published between 1994 and 2019. Based on 21 studies reporting attributable outcomes, higher proportions of sequelae reported from exposed patients were: neck pain, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, sleep disorder, poor appetite, and concentration difficulties. Patients with PTLDS reported impaired HRQoL compared to the general US population. Included studies were highly heterogeneous in terms of study design, settings, patient characteristics, and quality. Patients with LD are more likely to report nonspecific long-term sequelae, especially those experiencing persistent symptoms posttreatment. Opportunities exist for prospective longitudinal studies to better understand LD outcomes."

Although both gene products can function as potential porins, only BB0405 is essential for infection. Here we show that, despite sequence homology and coexpression from the same operon, both proteins differ in their membrane localization attributes, antibody accessibility, and immunogenicity in mice. BB0406 is required for spirochete survival in mammalian hosts, particularly for the disseminated infection in distant organs. We identified that BB0406 interacts with laminin, one of the major constituents of the vascular basement membrane, and facilitates spirochete transmigration across host endothelial cell barriers. A better understanding of how B. burgdorferi transmigrates through dermal and tissue vascular barriers and establishes disseminated infections will contribute to the development of novel therapeutics to combat early infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and other related Borrelia species. One of the many fascinating features of this unique pathogen is an elaborate system for antigenic variation, whereby the sequence of the surface-bound lipoprotein VlsE is continually modified through segmental gene conversion events. This perpetual changing of the guard allows the pathogen to remain one step ahead of the acquired immune response, enabling persistent infection. Accordingly, the vls locus is the most evolutionarily diverse genetic element in Lyme disease-causing borreliae. Small stretches of information are transferred from a series of silent cassettes in the vls locus to generate an expressed mosaic vlsE gene version that contains genetic information from several different silent cassettes, resulting in ∼1040 possible vlsE sequences. Yet, despite its extreme evolutionary flexibility, the locus has rigidly conserved structural features. These include a telomeric location of the vlsE gene, an inverse orientation of vlsE and the silent cassettes, the presence of nearly perfect inverted repeats of ∼100 bp near the 5' end of vlsE, and an exceedingly high concentration of G runs in vlsE and the silent cassettes. We discuss the possible roles of these evolutionarily conserved features, highlight recent findings from several studies that have used next-generation DNA sequencing to unravel the switching process, and review advances in the development of a mini-vls system for genetic manipulation of the locus."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti can lead to severe babesiosis in immunosuppressed populations, but due to high numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical reporting is unable to define its geographic distribution. Although Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is endemic throughout Pennsylvania (PA), human babesiosis is under recognized, despite sharing the same vector and primary reservoir host. Ixodes ticks are known to carry B. microti throughout PA, but information about pathogen prevalence in small mammal reservoirs remains limited. Characterizing B. microti prevalence in these small mammals can elucidate mechanisms of pathogen spread and define geographic areas where humans are at risk of infection. We tested 692 small mammals across eight contiguous counties in central PA for molecular evidence of B. microti and B. burgdorferi. In total, six different small mammal species were collected. The overall prevalence of B. microti was 32% with similar rates observed across all counties. Surprisingly, this was higher than the prevalence of B. burgdorferi at 21%. In fact, high rates of B. microti were found in all six species, and both pathogens were identified in 11% of mammals tested. The prevalence of B. microti was highest in Myodes gapperi (southern red-backed vole) at 39% despite Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) being considered the primary reservoir host for B. microti. In conclusion, B. microti has a high prevalence across multiple small mammal species throughout central PA. This prevalence is greater than B. burgdorferi despite a much higher incidence of Lyme disease compared to babesiosis in PA. Although it remains unknown how the prevalence of B. microti in small mammal hosts corresponds to human infection rates, the high pathogen prevalence of B. microti suggests that it is an emerging pathogen in this area. Currently, babesiosis is not a reportable disease in PA, and additional studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical significance in this geographic region."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a highly motile spirochete due to its periplasmic flagella. Unlike flagella of other bacteria, spirochetes' periplasmic flagella possess a complex structure called the collar, about which little is known in terms of function and composition. Using various approaches, we have identified a novel protein, BB0326, as a key component of the collar. We show that a peripheral portion of the collar is diminished in the Δbb0326 mutant and restored in the complemented bb0326+ cells, leading us to rename BB0326 as periplasmic flagellar collar protein A or FlcA. The ΔflcA mutant cells produced fewer, abnormally tilted and shorter flagella, as well as diminished stators, suggesting that FlcA is crucial for flagellar and stator assemblies. We provide further evidence that FlcA interacts with the stator and that this collar-stator interaction is essential for the high torque needed to power the spirochete's periplasmic flagellar motors. These observations suggest that the collar provides various important functions to the spirochete's periplasmic flagellar assembly and rotation."

In this study, we examined the role of 6S RNA in murine infectivity and tick persistence of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi 6S RNA (Bb6S RNA) binds to RNA polymerase, is expressed independent of growth phase or nutrient stress in culture, and is processed by RNase Y. We found that rny (bb0504), the gene encoding RNase Y, is essential for B. burgdorferi growth, while ssrS, the gene encoding 6S RNA, is not essential, indicating a broader role for RNase Y activity in the spirochete. Bb6S RNA regulates expression of the ospC and dbpA genes encoding outer surface protein C and decorin binding protein A, respectively, which are lipoproteins important for host infection. The highest levels of Bb6S RNA are found when the spirochete resides in unfed nymphs. ssrS mutants lacking Bb6S RNA were compromised for infectivity by needle inoculation, but injected mice seroconverted, indicating an ability to activate the adaptive immune response. ssrS mutants were successfully acquired by larval ticks and persisted through fed nymphs. Bb6S RNA is one of the first regulatory RNAs identified in B. burgdorferi that controls the expression of lipoproteins involved in host infectivity."

In each study, one group served as non-treated control, whereas the other groups were treated with the Seresto® collar. All dogs were exposed to naturally Bbsl- and Ap-infected hard ticks (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis). In study 1, tick infestation was performed on study day (SD) 63 (2 months post-treatment [p.t.]); in study 2, it was performed on SD 32 (one month p.t.) respectively SD 219 (seven months p.t.). In situ tick counts were performed 2 days after infestation. Tick counts and removals followed 6 (study 1) or 5 days (study 2) later. Blood sampling was performed for the detection of specific Bbsl and Ap antibodies and, in study 1, for the documentation of Ap DNA by PCR. Skin biopsies were examined for Bbsl by PCR and culture (only study 1). The efficacy against Ixodes spp. was 100% at all time points. In study 1, two of six non-treated dogs became infected with Bbsl, and four of six tested positive for Ap; none of the treated dogs tested positive for Bbsl or Ap. In study 2, ten of ten non-treated dogs became infected with Bbsl and Ap; none of the treated dogs tested positive for Bbsl or Ap; 100% acaricidal efficacy was shown in both studies. Transmission of Bbsl and Ap was successfully blocked for up to 7 months."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens pose a considerable disease burden in Europe and North America, where increasing numbers of human cases and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens has renewed interest in resolving the mechanisms underpinning their geographical distribution and abundance. For Borrelia burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, transmission of infection from one generation of ticks to another occurs when older nymphal ticks infect younger larval ticks feeding on the same host, either indirectly via systemic infection of the vertebrate host or directly when feeding in close proximity. Here, expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, and the related tick type-reproduction number, T, are derived that account for the observation that larval and nymphal ticks tend to aggregate on the same minority of hosts, a tick feeding behaviour known as co-aggregation. The pattern of tick blood meals is represented as a directed, acyclic, bipartite contact network, with individual vertebrate hosts having in-degree, kin, and out-degree, kout, that respectively represent cumulative counts of nymphal and larval ticks fed over the lifetime of the host. The in- and out-degree are not independent when co-aggregation occurs such that [Formula: see text] where 〈.〉 indicates expected value. When systemic infection in the vertebrate host is the dominant transmission route R02=T, whereas when direct transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host is dominant then R0=T and the effect of co-aggregation on R0 is more pronounced. Simulations of B. burgdorferi and TBE virus transmission on theoretical tick-mouse contact networks revealed that aggregation and co-aggregation have a synergistic effect on R0 and T, that co-aggregation always increases R0 and T, and that aggregation only increases R0 and T when larvae and nymphs also co-aggregate. Co-aggregation has the greatest absolute effect on R0 and T when the mean larval burden of hosts is high, and the largest relative effect on R0 for pathogens sustained by co-feeding transmission, e.g. TBE virus in Europe, compared with those predominantly spread by systemic infection, e.g. B. burgdorferi. For both pathogens, though, co-aggregation increases the mean number of ticks infected per infectious tick, T, and so too the likelihood of pathogen persistence."

		"abstract": "We sought to characterize the shifting epidemiology and resource utilization of Lyme disease and associated carditis in US children's hospitals. We hypothesized that the Lyme carditis burden has increased and that hospitalizations for Lyme carditis are costlier than those for Lyme disease without carditis. The PHIS database was queried for Lyme disease encounters between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013. Additional diagnostic codes consistent with carditis identified Lyme carditis cases. Demographic, clinical, and resource utilization data were analyzed. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Lyme disease was identified in 3620 encounters with 189 (5%) associated with carditis. Lyme disease (360 cases in 2007 vs. 672 in 2013, p = 0.01) and Lyme carditis (17 cases in 2007 vs. 40 in 2013, p = 0.03) both significantly increased in frequency. This is primarily accounted for by their increase within the Midwest region. Carditis frequency among cases of Lyme disease was stable (p = 0.15). Encounters for Lyme carditis are dramatically costlier than those for Lyme disease without carditis [median $9104 (3741-19,003) vs. 922 (238-4987), p < 0.001] The increase in Lyme carditis cases in US children's hospitals is associated with an increased Lyme disease incidence, suggesting that there has not been a change in its virulence or cardiac tropism. The increasing number of serious cardiac events and costs associated with Lyme disease emphasize the need for prevention and early detection of disease and control of its spread."

We provide evidence that CXCL13 elevation occurs at variable extent in the majority of neuroinflammatory diseases. The exact role of CXCL13 in CSF is elusive, but the broad occurrence in neuroinflammation points at CNS immune activation, which is not exclusive for LNB."

		"abstract": "As tick-borne diseases continue to emerge across the United States, there is need for a better understanding of the tick and pathogen communities in the southern states and of habitat features that influence transmission risk. We surveyed questing and on-host ticks in pine-dominated forests with various fire management regimes in the Sam Houston National Forest, a popular recreation area near Houston, Texas. Four linear transects were established- two with a history of controlled burns, and two unburned. Systematic drag sampling yielded 112 ticks from two species, Ixodes scapularis (n=73) and Amblyomma americanum (n=39), with an additional 106 questing ticks collected opportunistically from drag cloth operators. There was a significant difference in systematically-collected questing tick density between unburned (15 and 18 ticks/1000 m2) and burned (2 and 4 ticks/1000 m2) transects. We captured 106 rodents and found 74 ticks on the rodents, predominantly Dermacentor variabilis. One unburned transect had significantly more ticks per mammal than any of the other three transects. DNA of Rickettsia species was detected in 146/292 on and off-host ticks, including the 'Rickettsial endosymbiont of I. scapularis' and Rickettsia amblyommatis, which are of uncertain pathogenicity to humans. Borrelia lonestari was detected in one A. americanum, while Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the agent of Lyme disease, was not detected in any tick samples. Neither Borrelia nor Rickettsia spp. were detected in any of the mammal ear biopsies (n=64) or blood samples (n=100) tested via PCR. This study documents a high prevalence in ticks of Rickettsia spp. thought to be endosymbionts, a low prevalence of relapsing fever group Borrelia in ticks, and a lack of detection of Lyme disease-group Borrelia in both ticks and mammals in an east Texas forested recreation area. Additionally, we observed low questing tick density in areas with a history of controlled burns. These results expand knowledge of tick-borne disease ecology in east Texas which can aid in directing future investigative, modeling, and management efforts."

		"abstract": "Chronic Lyme disease (LD) is a matter of debate worldwide and has emerged as a social problem. We aim to analyze the media content and describe the transformation process of a collective pain into a social problem in France. Using social science methodology, a corpus of articles from 20 newspapers and videos from seven major TV stations from 1987 to 2017 were analyzed for discourse content. The speaking times and the frequency of interventions between doctors supporting the official guidelines and those against them were compared using the Mann-Whitney test and the Chi-square test, respectively. In France, the media discourse is carried through testimonials from patient organizations and a professor of infectiology who acted as a whistleblower (WB). We showed that the emergence of the LD alert in the media corresponds to the process described by social sciences as 'naming, blaming, claiming'. Since his first article in 2014, the WB has featured in 24% (22/89) of newspaper articles compared with 20% (18/89) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.52). Since his first appearance on a TV newscast in 2014, the WB has appeared in 45% (22/49) of news reports on LD with 24% of the speaking time compared with 22% (11/49) for doctors defending the official guidelines (P = 0.018). Media coverage of LD has been unbalanced since 2014 and promotes associations as well as the WB, who seems to be better identified than any of the different doctors defending the official guidelines."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes in eastern and central North America, and local densities of this tick can affect human disease risk. We sampled larvae and nymphs from sites in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, USA, using flag/drag devices and by collecting ticks from hosts, and measured environmental variables to evaluate the environmental factors that affect local distribution and abundance of I. scapularis. Our sites were all forested areas with known I. scapularis populations. Environmental variables included those associated with weather (e.g., temperature and relative humidity), vegetation characteristics (at canopy, shrub, and ground levels), and host abundance (small and medium-sized mammals and reptiles). The numbers of larvae on animals at a given site and season showed a logarithmic relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples, suggesting limitation in the numbers on host animals. The numbers of nymphs on animals showed no relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples. These results suggest that only a small proportion of larvae and nymphs found hosts because in neither stage did the numbers of host-seeking ticks decline with increased numbers on hosts. Canopy cover was predictive of larval and nymphal numbers in flag/drag samples, but not of numbers on hosts. Numbers of small and medium-sized mammal hosts the previous year were generally not predictive of the current year's tick numbers, except that mouse abundance predicted log numbers of nymphs on all hosts the following year. Some measures of larval abundance were predictive of nymphal numbers the following year. The mean number of larvae per mouse was well predicted by measures of overall larval abundance (based on flag/drag samples and samples from all hosts), and some environmental factors contributed significantly to the model. In contrast, the mean numbers of nymphs per mouse were not well predicted by environmental variables, only by overall nymphal abundance on hosts. Therefore, larvae respond differently than nymphs to environmental factors. Furthermore, flag/drag samples provide different information about nymphal numbers than do samples from hosts. Flag/drag samples can provide information about human risk of acquiring nymph-borne pathogens because they provide information on the densities of ticks that might encounter humans, but to understand the epizootiology of tick-borne agents both flag/drag and host infestation data are needed."

The only suggested reservoir hosts of B. turcica are tortoises of the genus Testudo. Borrelia turcica has been described to occur in several Southeastern European countries including Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece but so far nothing is known about the relationship of these populations and whether or how they are structured. Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on eight chromosomally located housekeeping loci (clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB and uvrA) we analyzed 43 B. turcica isolates from Serres, Greece (n = 15) collected in 2017 and Izmir, Turkey (n = 28) collected in 2018. To understand their relationship a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree and goeBURST analysis were done based on MLST sequence data and allelic profiles, respectively. The data we generated confirmed that the samples of B. turcica investigated here were divergent from Lyme disease (LD) and relapsing fever (RF) species. Within the B. turcica clade, samples of different geographic origin (Greece, Turkey) clustered together in terminal branches; no obvious differences between the Greek and Turkish samples were noticeable. A goeBURST analysis using triple-locus variants revealed very few clonal complexes with the majority of samples appearing as singletons. Minor clonal complexes (consisting of two sequence types) comprised only Greek isolates, only Turkish isolates or both, so no pattern of clustering of isolates from the two geographical regions was observed. Interestingly, very little population structure was discerned in our study. This was surprising in view of the large geographic distance between collection sites of B. turcica and raises questions about the evolution or spatial spread of this species."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the occurrence of Lyme disease in the U.S. has now reached approximately 300,000 cases annually. Early stage Borrelia burgdorferi infections are generally treatable with oral antibiotics, but late stage disease is more difficult to treat and more likely to lead to post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Here we examine three unique 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/SAH) nucleosidases (MTNs or MTANs, EC 3.2.2.9) responsible for salvage of adenine and methionine in B. burgdorferi and explore their potential as antibiotic targets to treat Lyme disease. Recombinant Borrelia MTNs were expressed and purified from E. coli. The enzymes were extensively characterized for activity, specificity, and inhibition using a UV spectrophotometric assay. In vitro antibiotic activities of MTN inhibitors were assessed using a bioluminescent BacTiter-Glo™ assay. The three Borrelia MTNs showed unique activities against the native substrates MTA, SAH, and 5'-deoxyadenosine. Analysis of substrate analogs revealed that specific activity rapidly dropped as the length of the 5'-alkylthio substitution increased. Non-hydrolysable nucleoside transition state analogs demonstrated sub-nanomolar enzyme inhibition constants. Lastly, two late stage transition state analogs exerted in vitro IC50 values of 0.3-0.4 μg/mL against cultured B. burgdorferi cells. B. burgdorferi is unusual in that it expresses three distinct MTNs (cytoplasmic, membrane bound, and secreted) that are effectively inactivated by nucleoside analogs. The Borrelia MTNs appear to be promising targets for developing new antibiotics to treat Lyme disease."

This study evaluated the utility of an in-house and a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay for the diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). Prospectively, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients and controls and analysed using an in-house Borrelia ELISpot assay and the commercial LymeSpot assay. B. burgdorferi B31 whole cell lysate and a mixture of outer surface proteins were used to stimulate the PBMCs and the numbers of interferon-gamma-secreting T cells were measured. Results were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Eighteen active and 12 treated LNB patients, 10 healthy individuals treated for an early (mostly cutaneous) manifestation of LB in the past and 47 untreated healthy individuals were included. Both assays showed a poor diagnostic performance with sensitivities, specificities, positive and negative predictive values ranging from 44.4-66.7%, 42.0-72.5%, 21.8-33.3% and 80.5-87.0%, respectively. The LymeSpot assay performed equally poorly when the calculation method of the manufacturer was used. Both the in-house and the LymeSpot assay are unable to diagnose active LNB or to monitor antibiotic treatment success."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis remains a matter of debate, but it can be estimated using the incidence of erythema migrans (EM), which is pathognomonic of the first phase. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to assess the feasibility of the on-line declaration of EM in rural areas where the incidence of Lyme borreliosis was previously estimated at 85 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The study was limited to a rural area (Les Combrailles, Auvergne) of approximately 52,800 inhabitants and was preceded by an information campaign for the inhabitants and the healthcare professionals. Patients who sent a photo of the suspected EM by email or MMS message between April 2017 and April 2018 and who accepted to answer a questionnaire were included in the study. Two physicians then evaluated the quality of the photographs and the probability of EM. In parallel, the number of EM seen by physicians and pharmacists in the area over the given period was recorded. Out of the 113 emails and MMS messages received, 73 people were outside of the trial area or period and 9 did not complete the questionnaire. The photos of the remaining 31 people were analysed. The median age was 51.5 years old ([38-58] IQR) and 18 (58%) were women. Seven people (25%) stated that they did not have a smartphone and in 9 cases (29%) the photo was sent by a third party. The quality of the photos was considered very good in 22 (71%) cases, good in 7 (23%) cases, and average in 2 (6%) cases. The probability of EM was determined to be strong or possible in 12 (38%) cases, i.e. an estimated incidence of 22.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the study period, 40 physicians and 20 pharmacists were contacted on a monthly basis. A median of 5 physicians [3;7] and 4 pharmacists [3 ;7] answered each month for a total of 18 and 36 declared EM respectively. The EM (strong probability/possible) collected by on-line declaration and those declared by healthcare professionals were all sent between April and October 2017. The total time spent on the information campaign and collection has been estimated at 265 h (divided between 10 people) for an overall cost of 10,669 Euros. The incidence of EM recorded by on-line self-declaration in our study seems to be lower than in previous studies, the under-reporting was probably linked to the low use of new technologies in the rural areas. Increasing the human resources and finances appears difficult to achieve in practice over a longer time period but the development of an application for the automatic recognition of EM could be one method for a more exhaustive collection in the long term and at lower cost."

		"abstract": "The invasive, human-biting Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, was detected in New Jersey in the eastern United States in August of 2017 and by November of 2018 this tick had been recorded from 45 counties across 9 states, primarily along the Eastern Seaboard. The establishment of H. longicornis in the United States has raised the questions of how commonly it will bite humans and which native pathogens may naturally infect this tick. There also is a need for experimental vector competence studies with native pathogens to determine if H. longicornis can acquire a given pathogen while feeding, pass it transstadially, and then transmit the pathogen in the next life stage. In this experimental study, we evaluated the vector competence of a population of H. longicornis originating from the United States (New York) for a native isolate (B31) of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). In agreement with a previous experimental study on the vector competence of H. longicornis for Borrelia garinii, we found that uninfected H. longicornis larvae could acquire B. burgdorferi s.s. while feeding on infected Mus musculus mice (infection prevalence >50% in freshly fed larvae) but that the infection was lost during the molt to the nymphal stage. None of 520 tested molted nymphs were found to be infected, indicating that transstadial passage of B. burgdorferi s.s. is absent or rare in H. longicornis; and based on the potential error associated with the number of nymphs testing negative in this study, we estimate that the upper 95% limit for infection prevalence was 0.73%. An Ixodes scapularis process control showed both effective acquisition of B. burgdorferi s.s. from infected mice by uninfected larvae and transstadial passage to the nymphal stage (infection prevalence of 80-82% for both freshly fed larvae and molted nymphs). We also observed that although H. longicornis larvae could be compelled to feed on mice by placing the ticks within feeding capsules, attachment and feeding success was minimal (<0.5%) when larvae were placed freely on the fur of the mice. We conclude that H. longicornis is unlikely to contribute more than minimally, if at all, to transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes in the United States."

		"abstract": "Zoonotic diseases represent a significant public health concern worldwide due to the emergence/re-emergence of vector-borne diseases in the last decade. Ticks are the most important vectors in the northern hemisphere and can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and spotted fever rickettsioses, among others. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop better and faster diagnostic tools that can detect zoonotic human pathogens in clinical samples. In this study, we present the results for a new kit tick-borne bacteria flow chip (TBFC), which allows the simultaneous screening of seven different bacterial pathogens in human samples using a DNA flow technology platform (hybriSpot system). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were calculated spiking bacterial DNA in human DNA samples, and the results were compared with an in-house single PCR-reverse line blot (RLB) routinely used for diagnosis at the National Center for Microbiology in Spain. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were almost identical to the PCR-RLBs used in diagnosis. In addition, samples from patients (n = 212) with a wide range of clinical signs/symptoms consistent with multisystem disorders suggestive of a tick-borne infection were tested using the TBFC, and the results were compared with those obtained by PCR-RLB. The concordance of both methods using patient samples was 97.2%. The TBFC kit is a rapid new and cost-efficient diagnostic molecular tool capable of detecting tick-borne pathogens in clinical samples."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infection common in Europe. In Finland, the LB seroprevalence in the healthy population was 3.9% in 2011. While the present-day seroprevalence of LB is well characterized in several European areas, there are no studies on the seroprevalence of LB before the description of the infection in the late 1970s. We used a subset of historical serum samples (n = 994) collected during the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Survey, a nationwide cross-sectional health survey of the 1960s and 1970s. All samples were screened with Borrelia burgdorferi whole-cell sonicate IgG ELISA. The seropositivity of the samples was further confirmed by the C6 peptide ELISA and recomBead IgG 2.0 bead immunoassay. The association of LB seropositivity with risk factors and with self-reported diseases and symptoms relating to disseminated LB were analysed by logistic regression. B. burgdorferi IgGs were detected in 199 of 994 analysed samples; hence, the overall seroprevalence was 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 17.6-22.6). The highest seroprevalence was observed in persons aged ≥50 years (165/696), in those currently not working (92/383), and in the regions of South and Central Finland (91/226 and 27/88, respectively). Further, perception of feeling unhealthy (129/197 versus 412/794) was higher among LB-seropositive individuals compared to LB-seronegative participants. LB seroprevalence was considerably higher in Finland in the late 1960s and early 1970s than in 2011. This result questions the perception of an unprecedentedly high LB seroprevalence in present-day Europe."

Previously identified B. burgdorferi proteins, lipid immunogens, and live mutants lead the design of canonical vaccines aimed at disrupting infection in the host. Discovery of the mechanism of action of the first vaccine catalyzed the development of new strategies to control Lyme disease that bypassed direct vaccination of the human host. Thus, novel prevention concepts center on proteins produced by B. burgdorferi during tick transit and on tick proteins that mediate feeding and pathogen transmission. A burgeoning area of research is tick immunity as it can unlock mechanistic pathways that could be targeted for disruption. Studies that shed light on the mammalian immune pathways engaged during tick-transmitted B. burgdorferi infection would further development of vaccination strategies against Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease results from infection of humans with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The first and most common clinical manifestation is the circular, inflamed skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans; later manifestations result from infections of other body sites. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease can be challenging in patients with erythema migrans because of the time delay in the development of specific diagnostic antibodies against Borrelia. Reliable blood biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with erythema migrans are needed. Here, we performed selected reaction monitoring, a targeted mass spectrometry-based approach, to measure selected proteins that (1) are known to be predominantly expressed in one organ (i.e., organ-specific blood proteins) and whose blood concentrations may change as a result of Lyme disease, or (2) are involved in acute immune responses. In a longitudinal cohort of 40 Lyme disease patients and 20 healthy controls, we identified 10 proteins with significantly altered serum levels in patients at the time of diagnosis, and we also developed a 10-protein panel identified through multivariate analysis. In an independent cohort of patients with erythema migrans, six of these proteins, APOA4, C9, CRP, CST6, PGLYRP2, and S100A9, were confirmed to show significantly altered serum levels in patients at time of presentation. Nine of the 10 proteins from the multivariate panel were also verified in the second cohort. These proteins, primarily innate immune response proteins or proteins specific to liver, skin, or white blood cells, may serve as candidate blood biomarkers requiring further validation to aid in the laboratory diagnosis of early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is an infectious disease caused by the spirochetes of genus borrelia, which are transmitted by the ticks of the genus ixodes. LD is transmitted by the spirochete B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Once in contact with the host through a tick bite, the pathogen comes into contact with the host defense, and must escape this machinery to establish LD, thus using a large number of mechanisms involving the vector of the pathogen, the pathogen itself and also the host. The initial diagnosis of the disease can be made based on the clinical symptoms of LD and the disease can be treated and cured with antibiotics if the diagnosis is made early in the beginning of the disease. Contrariwise, if LD is left untreated, the pathogen disseminates throughout the tissues and organs of the body, where it establishes different types of disease manifestations. In the nervous system, the inflammation caused by B. burgdorferi is known as Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). LNB is one of the principal manifestations of LD. In this review, we systematically describe the different molecular interactions among B. burgdorferi, the vector (tick) and the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "Wild birds are frequently exposed to the zoonotic tick-borne bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and some bird species act as reservoirs for some Borrelia genospecies. Studying the tropism of Borrelia in the host, how it is sequestered in different organs, and whether it is maintained in circulation and/or in the host's skin is important to understand pathogenicity, infectivity to vector ticks and reservoir competency.We evaluated tissue dissemination of Borrelia in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and great tits (Parus major), naturally and experimentally infected with Borrelia genospecies from enzootic foci. We collected both minimally invasive biological samples (feathers, skin biopsies and blood) and skin, joint, brain and visceral tissues from necropsied birds. Infectiousness of the host was evaluated through xenodiagnoses and infection rates in fed and moulted ticks. Skin biopsies were the most reliable method for assessing avian hosts' Borrelia infectiousness, which was supported by the agreement of infection status results obtained from the analysis of chin and lore skin samples from necropsied birds and of their xenodiagnostic ticks, including a significant correlation between the estimated concentration of Borrelia genome copies in the skin and the Borrelia infection rate in the xenodiagnostic ticks. This confirms a dermatropism of Borrelia garinii, B. valaisiana and B. turdi in its avian hosts. However, time elapsed from exposure to Borrelia and interaction between host species and Borrelia genospecies may affect the reliability of skin biopsies. The blood was not useful to assess infectiousness of birds, even during the period of expected maximum spirochetaemia. From the tissues sampled (foot joint, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, gut and brain), Borrelia was detected only in the gut, which could be related with infection mode, genospecies competition, genospecies-specific seasonality and/or excretion processes."

In a nationwide, population-based cohort study, we examined the associations between LNB and dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease, epilepsy, and Guillain-Barré syndrome. We used national registers to identify all Danish residents diagnosed during 1986-2016 with LNB (n = 2067), created a gender- and age-matched comparison cohort from the general population (n = 20 670), and calculated risk estimates and hazard ratios. We observed no long-term increased risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron diseases, or epilepsy. However, within the first year, 8 (0.4%) of the LNB patients developed epilepsy, compared with 20 (0.1%) of the comparison cohort (difference, 0.3%; 95% confidence interval, .02-.6%). In the LNB group, 11 (0.5%) patients were diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome within the first year after LNB diagnosis, compared with 0 (0.0%) in the comparison cohort. After the first year, the risk of Guillain-Barré was not increased. LNB patients did not have increased long-term risks of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron diseases, epilepsy, or Guillain-Barré. Although the absolute risk is low, LNB patients might have an increased short-term risk of epilepsy and Guillain-Barré syndrome."

Testing and positivity for most NLTBIs increased dramatically from 2010 through 2016 based on testing from a large reference laboratory. The number of positive cases, though not as stringent as criteria for public health reporting, generally exceeds that reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The frequency of NLTBI in the US is seasonal but testing activity and positive test results are observed throughout all months of the year. Positive results for NLTBI testing mostly originated from a limited number of states, indicating the geographic concentration and distribution of NLTBIs reported in this study. This report provides an important complementary source of data to best understand trends in and spread of NLTBI."

I. scapularis ticks submitted by state residents to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station-Tick Testing Laboratory between 2015 and 2018 were screened using standard PCR and pathogen-specific primers. Infection and coinfection prevalence in I. scapularis was estimated to assess differences in infection status by life stage (nymph or adult female), county, and year, as well as whether infection with B. burgdorferi changes the likelihood of infection with either B. microti or A. phagocytophilum. Of the 11,254 I. scapularis acquired in Connecticut, 40.7% tested positive for at least one pathogen and the remaining 59.3% were negative. Most I. scapularis ticks tested positive for a single pathogen (33.6%), and only 7.2% were infected with more than one pathogen, of which 93.2% were identified with dual infection and 6.8% tested positive for all three pathogens. Adults were more likely than nymphs to be infected or coinfected with these pathogens. Furthermore, we found that ticks were 74% more likely to be infected with B. microti and 98% more likely to be infected with A. phagocytophilum if infected with B. burgdorferi compared with those not infected. We did not find spatial differences in infection or coinfection prevalence, but between 2015 and 2018, the likelihood that a tick was coinfected increased with time. These results from Connecticut, an endemic state for Lyme disease with long-established populations of I. scapularis, suggest that the increased likelihood of coinfection prevalence over time may have significant implications for clinical diagnosis, course, severity, and treatment of human disease cases."

We hereby report a case of a morphological anomaly in I. scapularis, biting a human host residing in Norwich, Connecticut. Using a dichotomous morphological key, high-resolution and scanning electron microscopy images, as well as DNA sequencing, the tick was identified as an adult female I. scapularis with three legs on the left side of the abdomen versus four on the right side, which we believe is the first case of ectromely in an adult I. scapularis. Using diagnostic genes in polymerase chain reaction, the specimen tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agents for Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, respectively, and also showed evidence of a rickettsial endosymbiont. Here we discuss recent reports of morphological anomalies in I. scapularis, and emphasize the significance of additional studies of teratology in this important tick species and its potential implications."

The serological study included 164 foresters and farmers with a history of tick bite. The molecular study included 540 patients, hospitalized because of various symptoms after tick bite. The control group consisted of 20 honorary blood donors. Anti-Coxiella burnetii antibodies titers were determined by Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Phase 1 IgG ELISA (DRG International Inc. USA). PCR was performed to detect DNA of C. burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in six foresters (7.3%). All foresters with the anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and anti-TBE (tick-borne encephalitis). Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in five farmers (6%). Four farmers with anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and two with anti-TBE. Among them one was co-infected with B. burgdorferi and TBEV. Correlations between anti-C. burnetii IgG and anti-B. burgdorferi IgG presence and between anti-C. burnetii IgG presence and symptoms of Lyme disease were observed. C. burnetii DNA was not detected in any of the 540 (0%) patients. C. burnetii is rarely transmitted by ticks, but we proved that it is present in the environment, so it may be a danger to humans. The most common co-occurrence after tick bite concerns C. burnetii and B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most commonly reported vector-borne illness and sixth most commonly reported notifiable infectious disease in the United States. The majority of cases occur in the Northeast and upper-Midwest, and the number and geographic distribution of cases is steadily increasing. The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis Say) is the principal vector of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto) in eastern North America. Although Lyme disease risk has been studied in residential and recreational settings across rural to urban landscapes including metropolitan areas, risk within U.S. cities has not been adequately evaluated despite the presence of natural and undeveloped public parkland where visitors could be exposed to B. burgdorferi-infected I. scapularis. We studied the occurrence of I. scapularis and infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in four insular regional parks within the city of Pittsburgh to assess Lyme disease risk of exposure to infected adults and nymphs. We found that the density of I. scapularis adults (1.16 ± 0.21 ticks/100 m2) and nymphs (3.42 ± 0.45 ticks/100 m2), infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in adults (51.9%) and nymphs (19.3%), and density of infected adults (0.60 ticks/100 m2) and nymphs (0.66 ticks/100 m2) are as high in these city parks as nonurban residential and recreational areas in the highly endemic coastal Northeast. These findings emphasize the need to reconsider, assess, and manage Lyme disease risk in greenspaces within cities, especially in high Lyme disease incidence states."

		"abstract": "To correctly interpret the serological markers of Lyme disease, it is very important to determine the region's infection rate. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in a rural district in northern Spain. The presence of IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi was determined by qualitative enzyme immunoassay in the serum of 1,432 people divided into 3groups: 316 blood donors, 432 individuals who attended the hospital without infection and 684 for whom Lyme serology testing was specifically requested as part of a differential diagnosis. In the latter group, the presence or absence of an occupational risk factor was recorded. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were detected in 189 individuals (13.2%): 16 (5.1%) in the blood donors group, 62 (14.4%) in subjects who attended hospital without infection and 111 (16.2%) in subjects in whom a differential diagnosis of Lyme disease was requested (p < 0.0001). In subjects with an occupational risk factor, the prevalence was 23.5%, peaking at 45.8% in men over 65 years. Our study showed a high prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi and higher than that seen in other areas with similar characteristics in Spain. However, our results are similar to those published from other European regions. The prevalence in the blood donors group was lower than that observed in the other groups. Older age, the male gender and occupational risks were associated with a higher prevalence of Lyme disease."

In the current study, our structural analysis of BB0365 revealed the same structural fold as that found in the NqrC and RnfG subunits of the NADH:quinone and ferredoxin:NAD+ sodium-translocating oxidoreductase complexes, which points to a potential role for BB0365 as a component of the sodium pump. Additionally, BB0365 coordinated Zn2+ by the His51, His55, His140 residues, and the Zn2+ -binding site indicates that BB0365 could act as a potential metalloenzyme; therefore, this structure narrows down the potential functions of BB0365, an essential protein for B. burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Tick-borne diseases (T-BD) represent a potential health threat for outdoor workers in endemic areas, such as the Autonomous Province of Trento (APT). We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to assess T-BD knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices among APT farmers, specifically focusing on the use of protective habits and the uptake of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine.Methods: A convenience sample of 106 farmers (all males, mean age 47.3 ± 13.6 years) attending pesticide training courses (12/2016-03/2017) completed the anonymous survey. Binary regression analysis, calculations of multivariate odds ratios (mOR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and risk perceptions as predictors of preventive measures.Results: Though general understanding of T-BD was fairly low, the majority of the participants perceived TBE infection as a frequent (73.6%) and severe disease (61.3%). Overall, 43.3% of participants knew a TBE vaccine was available, and 24.5% had been vaccinated. Protective habits were reported by 53.8% of respondents, with self-checks for tick bites particularly low at 2.8% of participants. Better knowledge of T-BD and favorable attitudes toward vaccinations were associated with TBE immunization (mOR 4.708; 95%CI 1.273-17.409 and mOR 3.555; 95%CI 1.175-10.760, respectively), while previous history of tick bite and any interaction with T-BD significantly predicted adherence to protective measures (mOR 4.458; 95%CI 1.808-10.991, and mOR 9.433; 95%CI 1.127-78.973, respectively).Conclusions: Adherence to preventive measures (TBE vaccine) and protective habits was unsatisfactory in our sampled group, being a possible consequence of significant knowledge gaps. Public health communication on T-BD in farmers should, therefore, target understanding of health issues and appropriate preventive measures."

		"abstract": "The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, is the primary Lyme disease vector in the eastern United States. Both immature stages of I. scapularis take blood meals from mice belonging to the genus Peromyscus. Mice are active during the night and spend the majority of diel periods in nests. Thus, immature I. scapularis have a greater opportunity to drop from Peromyscus hosts while in nests compared with the forest floor. Here, we collected 11 Peromyscus nests during a 3-mo period during which the immature I. scapularis are known to be active. We then examined nesting materials for the presence of I. scapularis. Immature I. scapularis were detected in 64% of Peromyscus nests examined. Additionally, 55% of the nests contained at least one Dermacentor variabilis Say larva. Eighty-seven percent of all larval ticks found within nests were blood-fed. Because Peromyscus spp. are highly competent reservoirs of numerous tick-borne pathogens, the ticks that detach in their nests may be important for the maintenance of tick-borne diseases. However, further studies are needed to determine the fate of the I. scapularis that detach in Peromyscus nests."

		"abstract": "Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever Borrelia, transmitted by hard (Ixodes) ticks, which are also the main vector for Borrelia burgdorferi. A widely used test for serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on the C6 peptide of the B. burgdorferi sl VlsE protein. We set out to study C6 reactivity upon infection with B. miyamotoi in a large well-characterized set of B. miyamotoi disease (BMD) patient sera and in experimental murine infection. We performed in silico analyses, comparing the C6-peptide to immunodominant B. miyamotoi variable large proteins (Vlps). Next, we determined C6 reactivity in sera from mice infected with B. miyamotoi and in a unique longitudinal set of 191 sera from 46 BMD patients. In silico analyses revealed similarity of the C6 peptide to domains within B. miyamotoi Vlps. Cross-reactivity against the C6 peptide was confirmed in 21 out of 24 mice experimentally infected with B. miyamotoi. Moreover, 35 out of 46 BMD patients had a C6 EIA Lyme index higher than 1.1 (positive). Interestingly, 27 out of 37 patients with a C6 EIA Lyme index higher than 0.9 (equivocal) were negative when tested for specific B. burgdorferi sl antibodies using a commercially available immunoblot. We show that infection with B. miyamotoi leads to cross-reactive antibodies to the C6 peptide. Since BMD and Lyme borreliosis are found in the same geographical locations, caution should be used when relying solely on C6 reactivity testing. We propose that a positive C6 EIA with negative immunoblot, especially in patients with fever several weeks after a tick bite, warrants further testing for B. miyamotoi."

		"abstract": "Vector feeding behavior can have a profound influence on the transmission of vector-borne diseases. In the case of black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, which vectors the agents of Lyme disease, babesiosis, and other pathogens, the timing and propensity of questing can determine which hosts are fed upon as well as the risk of contact with humans. Yet we know little about the controls and constraints on tick host-finding behavior under natural conditions. Ticks must balance the need to quest for blood meal hosts with the risk of desiccation, all on a fixed energy budget. Prior research, primarily in the laboratory, has shown that questing activity varies with conditions (e.g., temperature, relative humidity), light-dark cycles, and energy reserves, but the findings have been idiosyncratic and the dominant factor(s) in nature remains unknown. We measured questing activity of nymphs and larvae throughout the day and night and over several weeks in enclosures across a range of suitable tick habitats within a site in the Northeast. Activity of nymphs increased slightly during dawn and dusk, opposite of larvae, and declined slightly with air temperature and rain, but these patterns were weak and inconsistent among replicate sites. Rather it appears a fraction of ticks were questing most of the time, regardless of conditions. Our study suggests neither climatic conditions or light-dark cycles have appreciable influence on tick questing behavior."

However, other biological assays are being developed to try to improve Borrelia-infection diagnosis and/or monitoring. To analyse available data on these unconventional LB diagnostic assays through a systematic literature review. We searched PubMed and Cochrane Library databases according to the PRISMA-DTA method and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We analysed controlled and uncontrolled studies (published 1983-2018) on biological tests for adults to diagnose LB according to the European Study Group for Lyme Borreliosis or the Infectious Diseases Society of America definitions, or identify strongly suspected LB. Two independent readers evaluated study eligibility and extracted data from relevant study reports; a third reader analysed full texts of papers to resolve disagreements. The quality of each included study was assessed with the QUADAS-2 evaluation scale. Forty studies were included: two meta-analyses, 25 prospective controlled studies, five prospective uncontrolled studies, six retrospective controlled studies and two case reports. These biological tests assessed can be classified as: (i) proven to be effective at diagnosing LB and already in use (CXCL-13 for neuroborreliosis), but not enough to be standardized; (ii) not yet used routinely, requiring further clinical evaluation (CCL-19, OspA and interferon-α); (iii) uncertain LB diagnostic efficacy because of controversial results and/or poor methodological quality of studies evaluating them (lymphocyte transformation test, interferon-γ, ELISPOT); (iv) unacceptably low sensitivity and/or specificity (CD57+ natural killer cells and rapid diagnostic tests); and (v) possible only for research purposes (microscopy and xenodiagnoses). QUADAS-2 quality assessment demonstrated high risk of bias in 25/40 studies and uncertainty regarding applicability for 32/40, showing that in addition to PCR and serology, several other LB diagnostic assays have been developed but their sensitivities and specificities are heterogeneous and/or under-evaluated or unassessed. More studies are warranted to evaluate their performance parameters. The development of active infection biomarkers would greatly advance LB diagnosis and monitoring."

We report the identification and successful treatment of an adolescent male with Lyme arthritis who recently relocated with his family from a US Military base in Japan to Virginia. This case highlights the importance of obtaining a travel history from military members and their families who frequently relocate due to military orders. Military medical providers must be aware of tropical and travel-related illnesses and infections that may have been acquired at a prior duty station."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease incidence rates have steadily increased since its official recognition in 1975. Since exposure to Lyme is associated with activities conducted in and around tick-habitats including tall grass, shrubs, deciduous forest, and leaf litter, it has been suggested that service members, who are thought to spend higher amounts of time in these habitats due to training requirements, may have higher risk for exposure. Specifically, this study looks at service member and family member exposure to Ixodes scapularis, the vector for Lyme in the Northeastern and Midwestern United States. While literature pertaining to occupational and military specific exposures to Lyme vectors have attempted to quantify the possible elevated risk of Lyme disease for service members, thus far, studies have not consistently confirmed that service members are at a greater risk than family members. This cross-sectional study looks at cases of Lyme disease at Keller Army Community Hospital (KACH) on the West Point Military Reservation in New York during Fiscal Year (FY) 2016 through FY2018. Lyme cases were pulled from Military Health System Mart using current ICD-10-CM codes for Lyme related conditions (A69.20 and A69.29). In total, 144 cases were considered for the analysis. Totaling all service members and family members enrolled at KACH over the three-year period account for 35,526 person-years. Period prevalence, attributable risk percentage, population attributable risk percentage, and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated for service members and family member categories. This study was conducted on human subject research according to 32CFR219 and meets the requirements of exempt status under 32CFR219.101(b)(4) because it is a cross-sectional study on existing de-identified patient data. During FY2016-2018, service members accounted for 63 cases of Lyme totaling 21,595 person-years with a period prevalence of 292 cases per 100,000 (219.8, 363.7). Family members accounted for 81 cases with a total of 13,931 person-years with a period prevalence of 581 cases per 100,000 (455.2, 707.7). The percentage of attributable risk during the three-year period credited to military status is -99.30% (-145.69%, -52.91%). The population attributable risk percentage is -43.4%. While this study was unable to capture the military specific occupational exposure to I. scapularis, it does show a difference in period prevalence between service members and family members with the family members being at higher risk to contract Lyme instead of service members as is commonly suggested in the literature. Additional studies may be conducted to see if this holds true across service member Military Occupational Specialties as a proxy for occupational exposure. Similar studies should be conducted at military installations situated in Lyme endemic areas to determine if these results are comparable across the military or specific to West Point. Future research should attempt to identify all the service member protective factors against Lyme with attribution to permethrin-treated uniforms and other military interventions designed to defend soldiers against vector-borne diseases."

We reported here a case series of seven patients with uveitis related to Lyme disease and a review of the literature. A retrospective study in our university hospital between 1 May 2003 and 31 July 2016 on 1006 uveitis patients and review of Pubmed library. Seven patients (71.4% male, mean age = 53 (38-70)) were diagnosed with a Lyme-associated uveitis. All anatomical types of uveitis were found (four intermediate, three anterior, and three posterior uveitis); most were unilateral (n = 6; 85.7%), one granulomatous and two with synechiae. Peripheral retinal vasculitis was present in four patients. They all had a risk of exposure or extra-ophthalmological symptoms. Antibiotic and steroid treatment was rapidly effective in all patients. Four patients presented recurrences of uveitis, of whom two received a second antibiotic treatment, which is quite common in literature. Persistent or recurrence of symptoms can be explained by three hypotheses: (1) reinfection, (2) relapse of original infection, and (3) autoimmune reaction. Lyme-associated uveitis appears varied. Hyalitis and involvement of the posterior segment and retinal vasculitis seem to be rather frequent. Its prognosis is mainly good, even if inflammation can be resistant or recurring."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness, which is typically caused by Borrelia Burgdoferi. Over time, a typical Borreliosis skin reaction takes shape, i.e. the formation of an annular erythema that tends to expand centrifugally with erythematous edges whose diameter can reach up to 20 cm. The symptoms of Lyme disease are not only cutaneous but there may be a systemic involvement. Obviously, this disease can also affect pregnant women and for this reason this review aims to summarize the main ways of treatment to avoid worsening of the clinical condition in the mother and an eventual, albeit rare, involvement of the fetus."

Despite typical symptoms including fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash, sometimes we cannot find those due to the lack of physician consultation in those early stages. If this disease is left untreated, infection could spread to the nervous system causing neuroborreliosis, an atypical and complicated manifestation of this disease. We present the case of an atypical papillitis, probably caused by this bacterium. We suspected this because of the results on the indirect test bloods and the improvement of the symptoms after treatment. This entity should be considered as a possible diagnosis of atypical optical neuropathies, particularly if it occurs in an endemic area."

In this study, we compared paired results of clinical 2-tier Lyme disease tests to those of the C6 peptide EIA followed by supplemental immunoblotting (C6 2-tier test). We performed a prospective cohort study of children aged ≥1 to ≤21 years who were undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease in the emergency department at 1 of 6 centers located in regions in which Lyme disease is endemic. The clinical first-tier test and a C6 EIA were performed on the same serum sample with supplemental immunoblotting if the first-tier test result was either positive or equivocal. We compared the results of the paired clinical and C6 2-tier Lyme disease test results using the McNemar test. Of the 1714 children enrolled, we collected a research serum sample from 1584 (92.4%). The clinical 2-tier EIA result was positive in 316 (19.9%) children, and the C6 2-tier test result was positive or equivocal in 295 (18.6%) children. The clinical and C6 2-tier test results disagreed more often than they would have by chance alone (P = .002). Of the 39 children with either a positive clinical or C6 2-tier test result alone, 2 children had an erythema migrans (EM) lesion, and 29 had symptoms compatible with early disseminated Lyme disease. Two-tier Lyme disease test results differed for a substantial number of children on the basis of the specific first-tier test used. In children for whom there is a high clinical suspicion for Lyme disease and who have an initially negative test result, clinicians should consider retesting for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Pediatric bilateral facial nerve paralysis (FNP) is a rare condition, representing less than 2% of all cases of FNP. The differential diagnosis of FNP is extensive (ranging from infectious, traumatic, neurologic, to idiopathic) and often can present as a diagnostic challenge. In contrast to unilateral presentation, bilateral FNP presents as a manifestation of serious systemic conditions, including meningitis (infectious and neoplastic), brain stem encephalitis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, human immunodeficiency virus infection, leukemia, and vasculitis. In the evaluation of a child who presents with bilateral FNP, history plays the utmost role in the diagnosis. A history of rash consistent with erythema chronicum migrans, recent tick exposure, or travel to a Lyme disease-endemic area is highly suggestive that the facial paralysis is a result of Lyme disease. It is also important to recognize that Lyme disease is emerging as the most common infectious etiology of bilateral FNP in the pediatric population. In this case report, we describe a 16-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with complaints of headache and bilateral FNP, an unusual presentation of Lyme disease."

Since 2015 a multidisciplinary group has been established in Sacco Hospital for the management of the patients affected by Lyme disease (LD). A retrospective evaluation (2015-2017) was performed for LD in non-endemic areas. Retrospective analysis of all 1000 samples for 800 patients screened for LD antibodies at the Sacco Hospital in 3 years (2015-2017). Clinical and epidemiological data were collected and compared with the serological results. Among the 800 patients screened, 134 of them were diagnosed with borreliosis during 2015 (37 cases), 2016 (31 cases) and 2017 (66 cases). Localized LD was diagnosed 100 out of 134 cases (69%): in most of them (N.=63) erythema migrans has been documented; in 37 out of 100 it was not possible to detect it. In only three cases, patients complained of different clinical symptoms such as headache, arm and facial pain respectively. 23 out of 134 cases (16%) showed a persistence of serological positivity and symptoms with osteomuscular involvement and fatigue, despite the therapy (late LD). In that same study 11 out of 134 patients (7%) received a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. Our data reported a high percentage of LD infection (19%) in a non-endemic area. The definition of a Multidisciplinary Working Group and a clinical care pathway allowed a better clinical management of LD cases treated in Sacco Hospital, Milan."
