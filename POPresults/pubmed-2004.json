		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a multisystem disorder that usually begins with a skin lesion called erythema migrans and with constitutional symptoms. If the disease is left untreated or treated inappropriately, dissemination of the organism can lead to more severe sequelae, including nervous system disorders or arthritis. Vaccinations with B. burgdorferi or several individual B. burgdorferi proteins induce borreliacidal antibodies that provide protection against infection by inducing a complement cascade that kills the spirochetes without the necessity of scavenging by phagocytic cells. Detection of borreliacidal antibodies is therefore useful for serodiagnosing Lyme disease and monitoring immune status after vaccination. This unit provides a technique for detecting anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies, as well as for preparing and determining the quality of Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK medium) and complement. In addition, methods are provided for preparation of a B. burgdorferi stock and Mueller-Hinton agar containing Bacillus subtilis spores."

		"abstract": "Many epidemiological studies were conducted for studying Lyme borreliosis (LB) which represents a new global public health problem. It is now the most common vector-borne disease in Europe and North America. The causative agent Borrelia burgdorferi sl is a bacterial species complex comprising 12 delineated and named species. In North Africa, few studies based on clinical and serological features, have suggested that LB could occur. Indeed, recent studies conducted in Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco have showm that Ixodes ricinus is present in cooler and humid area of these regions. These studies also revealed that this species is a vector of B. burgdorferi sl with high prevalence of infection. Using IFI and PCR tests, the mean rate of Borrelia-infection ranged from 50 to 60% in I. ricinus adult collected in Tunisia and Morocco and from 30 to 40% in nymphs; in contrast, the prevalence in larvae is less than 2.5%. Several strains of B. burgdorfer were isolated from adult and nymph I ricinus collected in Tunisia and Morocco. The identification of these strains and DNAs directly extracted from Ixodes was done by PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis. The results showed that B. lusitaniae (genotypes Poti B2 and Poti B3) is the predominant species circulating in I. ricinus in Tunisia and Morocco, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi ss and B lusitaniae were also present but very rare. These results provide the evidence for the existence of B. burgdorferi sl in North Africa; however, the impact of LB in the human population seem to be negligible and the seroprevalence of Borrelia in forest workers (considered as population at high risk) in Tunisia is less than 4%."

		"abstract": "Infections caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato may be accompanied by other microorganisms, such as Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Babesia. These pathogens are transmitted by the ticks and are a risk to humans and animals. Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from recreational areas of Szczecin and northwestern Poland contained DNA of the pathogens mentioned above and cases of double and triple coinfection have been documented. The aim of this paper was to determine if dogs suspect to tick infestation in the area of study are a reservoir for these pathogens and to examine the possibility of coinfection. Canine blood was sampled, part of the material originated from dogs exhibiting symptoms of borreliosis. In an earlier study, the samples were screened for DNA from B. burgdorferi sensu lato. In order to screen for A. phagocytophila and Babesia sp. DNA, a PCR-based method was used with the following primers: EHR521/EHR747 for Anaplasma and FOR1/REV1 for Babesia. In 192 samples only two contained A. phagocytophila DNA. One of these samples originated from a healthy canine, the other from an individual with symptoms of borreliosis. The examined samples were not positive for Babesia sp. DNA. Coinfection was not discovered. The low level of A. phagocytophila infection may indicate that the domestic dog is not a reservoir for Anaplasma and Babesia in Szczecin and northwestern Poland. Moreover, this area does not have populations of the brown dog tick (Rhipicephalus sanguineus) or Dermacentor reticulates--both of which are vectors of E. canis and B. canis and commonly induce ehrlichiosis and babesiosis in canines."

Basing on the prevalence data of B. burgdorferi s.l.

		"abstract": "The present study deals with the ecology of Lyme borreliosis in Northern Poland. The complexity of environmental conditions are: (1) the presence of certain rodent hosts for the Borrelia, (2) the seasonal patterns of abundance and infection rate of I. ricinus in the population of rodents and on vegetation, (3) the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l., B. garinii and B. afzelii. The long-term studies were carried out on a monthly basis from April to October (1998-2001) in woodlands at Urwitałt near Mikołajki on the Mazury Lakes. Two methods of spirochate detection were used: indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The dynamics of ticks infestation, differences in infestation rates between years, months, age and sex for two species of rodents (Clethrionomys glareolus, Apodemus flavicollis) were analysed using the software package Statgraphics version 7 and GLIM 4 (statistical system for generalized linear interactive modeling, Royal Statistical Society 1993). We were able to demonstrate that in selected habitat of Mazury Lakes the spirochaetal agent of Lyme borreliosis occurs quite frequently, both in rodents and in vector-I. ricinus. Comparing C. glareolus and A. flavicollis, each rodent species showed different, seasonal and sex dependent, host infection with Borrelia. Due to the courses of prevalence of infection, both for partially engorged ticks and questing ticks, the risk of human infection seems to be highest in spring. The infection rate of engorged larvae was much higher than in questing larvae. We conclude that both species of rodents, highly abounded in the Mazury Lakes district, may represent significant zoonotic reservoir for B. burgdorferii sl., B. garinii and B. aftelii."

		"abstract": "The emergence of Lyme borreliosis as a public health burden within the last two decades has stimulated renewed interest in tick-borne infections. This attention towards ticks, coupled with advances in detection technologies, has promoted the recognition of diverse emergent or potentially emerging infections, such as monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichiosis, local variants of spotted fever group rickettsioses, WA-1 babesiosis, or a Lyme disease mimic (Masters' Disease). The distribution of pathogens associated with well-described tick-borne zoonoses such as human babesiosis due to Babesia microti or B. divergens seems wider than previously thought. Bartonellae, previously known to be maintained by fleas, lice or sandflies, have been detected within ticks. Purported 'new' agents, mainly identified by sequencing of PCR products and comparison with those sequences present in GenBank, are being increasingly reported from ticks. We briefly review the diversity of these infectious agents, identify aetiological enigmas that remain to be solved, and provide a reminder about 'old friends' that should not be forgotten in our pursuit of novelty. We suggest that newly recognised agents or tick/pathogen associations receive careful scrutiny before being declared as potential public health burdens."

Moreover, we have detailed the ecology of the Ixodes ticks that transmit this infection and the reservoir hosts that maintain the spirochete cycle in nature. Finally, we have examined the transmission dynamics of the spirochete on both continents, as well as the available prevention strategies. Although it has been over two decades since the discovery of the Lyme disease spirochete, Lyme borreliosis is an expanding public health problem that has defied our attempts to control it. By comparing the accumulated experience of investigators in North America and Europe, where the disease is most frequently reported, we hope to advance the cause of developing novel approaches to combat Lyme borreliosis."

Cardiac involvement usually occurs within weeks to months of the infecting tick bite and includes varying degrees of atrioventricular block as the commonest manifestation and tachyarrhythmias, myopericarditis, mild cardiac muscle dysfunction. There has been evidence that long standing dilated cardiomyopathy may be associated with chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Patients with atrioventricular block have good prognosis. Most cases resolve within 1 to 2 weeks. Temporary, but almost never permanent, cardiac pacing may be required for some patients. Cardiac manifestations of Lyme disease are treatable with antibiotics.

All the cases described so far were noted in the area of endemic prevalence of Lyme borreliosis (north-east of Poland). Lack of characteristic symptoms makes the diagnosis of HGE difficult. It should be suspected in patients exposed to tick bites during the preceding few weeks, in whom acute, febrile illness accompanied by leucopenia and thrombocytopenia develops. The course of infection may be serious, or even life-threatening, in patients more than 40 years old; consequences of co-infection with A. phagocytophila and other tick-borne pathogens remain not well known. There is probably no risk of the development of chronic HGE. As specific diagnostic methods are not widely accessible in Poland, empirical therapy with doxycycline may be of benefit in suspected HGE cases."

Study group consisted of 18 patients aged 18-72 years (x=46) hospitalized in Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfections of Medical Academy in Białystok with diagnosis of chronic arthritis in course of borreliosis. Control consisted of 20 healthy volunteers (health services employees) aged 25-65 years (x=45), with no detectable anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies in serum. In all borreliosis patients serum activity of: N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (HEX), beta-galactosidase and alpha-mannosidase was measured before and after 4 weeks of doxycycline treatment. Results were analyzed with Statistica 6.0 software. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. HEX activity was significantly increased in serum of Lyme arthritis patients before treatment compared to controls. It decreased after 4-week treatment, remaining insignificantly higher than in controls. b-galactosidase and a-mannosidase activities in serum of Lyme arthritis patients were insignificantly higher than in controls and fell after treatment to the levels observed in control group. N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (HEX) is sensitive enzymatic marker of Lyme arthritis. It may be used to monitor course of the disease and its efficiency of treatment."

Present arthralgia was the most frequently reported by persons who initially were diagnosed as suffering from Lyme arthritis. Ischialgia and brachialgia were the most prevalent in patients with previous neuroboreliosis. Psychiatric evaluation demonstrated significantly more frequent prevalence of sleep and cognitive disturbances in persons with previously diagnosed neuroboreliosis. Persons with initial joint manifestations of Lyme borreliosis more frequently report arthralgia in further follow-up.

Epidermal cells were derived from C3H/HeN mice, susceptible to Lyme disease, and BALB/c mice, which are resistant. In cultures from C3H/HeN mice, SGE down regulated production of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and up regulated Th2 cytokine, interleukin 4 (IL-4). Cultures from BALB/c mice produced higher basal levels of monitored cytokines, but their production was affected by SGE a different way. While Th2 cytokines IL-6 and IL-10 were down regulated, the effect on TNF-alpha and IL-4 was ambiguous. These results indicate that the effect of tick saliva on the epidermal cells of Lyme disease-susceptible C3H/HeN mice mirrors its effect on other cells of the immune system."

Because the cotton mouse is known to be a reservoir of more vector-borne zoonotic pathogens than the golden mouse, we hypothesized that it would be parasitized by more ectoparasites that are known to be vectors of these pathogens. Cotton mice (n = 202) were parasitized by 19 species of arthropods, whereas golden mice (n = 46) were parasitized by 12 species. Eleven species of arthropods were recovered from both host species, whereas 7 were recorded only from cotton mice, and 1 species only from golden mice. Infestation prevalences (percent of mice parasitized) were significantly higher for 1 species of arthropod (the tropical rat mite Ornithonyssus bacoti (Hirst)) infesting cotton mice and for 4 species (the flea Peromyscopsylla scotti Fox and the mites Glycyphagus hypudaei Koch, Androlaelaps casalis (Berlese), and Androlaelaps fahrenholzi (Berlese)) infesting golden mice. Mean intensities (mean per infested mouse) were significantly higher for 2 species (the flea Orchopeas leucopus (Baker) and the blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis Say) infesting cotton mice and for 2 species (G. hypudaei and A. fahrenholzi) infesting golden mice. Ectoparasites that are known to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens were significantly more common on cotton mice than on golden mice. These ectoparasites included the rhopalopsyllid flea Polygenis gwyni (Fox), a vector of the agent of murine typhus; I. scapularis, the principal vector of the agents of Lyme borreliosis, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and human babesiosis; and O. bacoti, a laboratory vector of several zoonotic pathogens. However, 2 species of ixodid ticks that can transmit zoonotic pathogens were recovered from both host species. These were the American dog tick Dermacentor variabilis (Say), the principal vector of the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever in eastern North America, and Ixodes minor Neumann, an enzootic vector of the agent of Lyme borreliosis. Overall, the cotton mouse was parasitized by significantly more ectoparasites that are known to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens than was the golden mouse. These data support the hypothesis that the cotton mouse has greater epidemiological importance for zoonotic vector-borne pathogen transmission than does the golden mouse."

Lizards were infested only by Ixodes pacificus Cooley and Kohls, birds by I. pacificus and Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (Packard), and rodents by I. pacificus, I. spinipalpis Hadwen and Nuttall, I. woodi Bishopp, Dermacentor occidentalis Marx, and D. variabilis (Say). Infestation by I. pacificus larvae and nymphs of lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis Baird and Girard; Elgaria spp.) and western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus Ord) (means of 9-35 larvae and 5-6 nymphs per animal) was several times greater than for Neotoma fuscipes Baird woodrats, Peromyscus spp. mice, and birds (means of 0.9-3.5 larvae and 0-0.3 nymphs). Overall, Borrelia-refractory lizards accounted for 84% of I. pacificus larvae and 91% of nymphs collected from animals in dense woodlands. Bird species frequently utilizing tick-questing substrates such as leaf litter (guild I birds) were more heavily infested by I. pacificus subadults (5.2 larvae and 1.0 nymphs per bird) than guild IV birds with minimal perceived contact with tick-questing substrates (0.08 larvae and 0.06 nymphs per bird). Notably, guild I birds carried similar larval loads and at least 20-fold higher nymphal loads relative to woodrats and mice. Only guild IV birds carried as few I. pacificus nymphs as did these rodents. The ratios of larvae to nymphs suggest that, relative to birds, lizards, and squirrels (infested by 1.3-6.0 larvae per nymph), nocturnally active ground-dwelling rodents such as woodrats and mice are underutilized by the nymphal stage (69 to >100 larvae per nymph). The western gray squirrel and guild I-II birds (e.g., the dark-eyed junco, Junco hyemalis [L.]) were the only potential reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner (the causative agent of Lyme disease in North America) that were frequently infested with both I. pacificus larvae and nymphs and commonly utilized dense woodland habitats."

These microsatellite alleles differentiated populations located in the southeastern, northcentral and northeastern United States, respectively. Although evident heterozygous genotypes are about as frequent as would be expected in randomly mating populations, particular microsatellite alleles and diploid genotypes occur more frequently in certain populations than in others. Ticks from the Northeast and upper Midwest are markedly more related to each other than to ticks from the Southeast. Patterns of diversity present in this nuclear microsatellite marker correspond to those evident at a mitochondrial locus and indicate that the deer ticks of the Northeast and upper Midwest are genetically isolated from those in the Southeast. The Ixodes ricinus-like ticks that impose a public health burden in the northeastern and northcentral United States originated recently in a common founder population."

		"abstract": "There are huge numbers of wild animals distributed throughout the world and the diversity of wildlife species is immense. Each landscape and habitat has a kaleidoscope of niches supporting an enormous variety of vertebrate and invertebrate species, and each species or taxon supports an even more impressive array of macro- and micro-parasites. Infectious pathogens that originate in wild animals have become increasingly important throughout the world in recent decades, as they have had substantial impacts on human health, agricultural production, wildlife-based economies and wildlife conservation. The emergence of these pathogens as significant health issues is associated with a range of causal factors, most of them linked to the sharp and exponential rise of global human activity. Among these causal factors are the burgeoning human population, the increased frequency and speed of local and international travel, the increase in human-assisted movement of animals and animal products, changing agricultural practices that favour the transfer of pathogens between wild and domestic animals, and a range of environmental changes that alter the distribution of wild hosts and vectors and thus facilitate the transmission of infectious agents. Two different patterns of transmission of pathogens from wild animals to humans are evident among these emerging zoonotic diseases. In one pattern, actual transmission of the pathogen to humans is a rare event but, once it has occurred, human-to-human transmission maintains the infection for some period of time or permanently. Some examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission are human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome, influenza A, Ebola virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome. In the second pattern, direct or vector-mediated animal-to-human transmission is the usual source of human infection. Wild animal populations are the principal reservoirs of the pathogen and human-to-human disease transmission is rare. Examples of pathogens with this pattern of transmission include rabies and other lyssaviruses, Nipah virus, West Nile virus, Hantavirus, and the agents of Lyme borreliosis, plague, tularemia, leptospirosis and ehrlichiosis. These zoonotic diseases from wild animal sources all have trends that are rising sharply upwards. In this paper, the authors discuss the causal factors associated with the emergence or re-emergence of these zoonoses, and highlight a selection to provide a composite view of their range, variety and origins. However, most of these diseases are covered in more detail in dedicated papers elsewhere in this Review."

		"abstract": "The cause, or causes, of the vast majority of Alzheimer's disease cases are unknown. A number of contributing factors have been postulated, including infection. It has long been known that the spirochete Treponema pallidum, which is the infective agent for syphilis, can in its late stages cause dementia, chronic inflammation, cortical atrophy and amyloid deposition. Spirochetes of unidentified types and strains have previously been observed in the blood, CSF and brain of 14 AD patients tested and absent in 13 controls. In three of these AD cases spirochetes were grown in a medium selective for Borrelia burgdorferi. In the present study, the phylogenetic analysis of these spirochetes was made. Positive identification of the agent as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto was based on genetic and molecular analyses. Borrelia antigens and genes were co-localized with beta-amyloid deposits in these AD cases. The data indicate that Borrelia burgdorferi may persist in the brain and be associated with amyloid plaques in AD. They suggest that these spirochetes, perhaps in an analogous fashion to Treponema pallidum, may contribute to dementia, cortical atrophy and amyloid deposition. Further in vitro and in vivo studies may bring more insight into the potential role of spirochetes in AD."

The other 54 sera of 52 children were tested for suspicion for LB which was later excluded, and for cross-reacting antibodies. They represented the control group of children with other infectious or autoimmune diseases. The EIA B. recombinant IgM kit (Test-Line, CR) is based on the selected antigen fragments: outer surface protein C (OspC) and internal flagellin (p41i). The fragments were selected according to the most frequent Borrelia spp. in the Czech Republic. Samples compared 101/147 (69 %) with both tests showed correspondent reactions. 46 samples reacted inconsistently, 26 from children with LB and 20 from the control group. The total specificity and sensitivity of the recombinant kit in IgM antibody class was 88,9 % and 26,9 %, respectively. In the case of early disseminated LB infection the sensitivity was 35,6 % and it is comparable with the sensitivity of immunoblot. Statistically, there is no difference in the sensitivity (p = 0,101) and specificity (p = 0,383) of EIA B. recombinant IgM and immunoblot. The EIA B. recombinant IgM kit shows comparable diagnostic sensitivity in children with acute LB together with significantly higher specificity in children with non-specific response in kits based on the whole cell antigen and at the same time high conformity with results of IgM class immunoblot. This kit of the 3rd generation is reliable for screening of IgM antibodies."

These have generally been attributed to either persistent infection or pathogen-induced autoimmunity. In this study, we investigated the presence of cross-reactive human neural epitopes that share amino acid sequences with Borrelia burgdorferi OspA protein. Sequence similarity analysis was carried out by searching known cDNA sequences from brain tissue. The cDNA database search yielded three sequences that were identical to sequences in OspA. Corresponding peptides were synthesized and antibodies were generated against them in rabbits. Antibodies against two of the homologous OspA peptides were found to react with neurons in human brain, spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia by immunohistochemistry."

		"abstract": "The spread of borreliosis depends on geographical, environmental and climatic factors as well as on the pathogenesis of the causative agent of the group of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The rise in the incidence of the disease and emergence of new symptoms are of concern. Relationships between genospecies and symptoms, their geographical spread and possible interference of other pathogens are the subject of the present study. Eighty-seven patients with borreliosis from Central and Eastern Bohemia and Moravia were enrolled in the study. Forty-nine patients of group 1 showed clinical positivity, 21 patients of group 2 tested positive at PCR screening and 17 patients of group 3 were culture positive. Forty-eight patients and 17 isolated strains showed positivity for plasmids and the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genome in conventional nested PCR. Borrelial genotypes and subtypes were detected by direct sequencing of OspA and OspC products. Quantitative data were determined from specific product melting temperature curves for real time PCR. Based on sequencing of the OspA gene, B. garinii (subtypes 6, 5, 4 and 3), B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. afzelii were detected in 14 (51.8%), 8 (29.6%) and 5 (18.5%) out of 27 Central Bohemian patients, respectively. Eastern Bohemian patients showed predominance of B. garinii subtype 5 and co-infection with Anaplasmaphagocytophilum in 7.6%. The predominant causative agent in 25 Moravian patients was B. afzelii (11 patients, i.e. 44%), followed by B. burgdorferi s.s. (9 patients, 36%) and B. garinii 5 patients, i.e. 20%). Sequences of two hypervariable regions of the OspA and OspC genes and distances in phylogenetic trees showed differences not only between genospecies and subtypes but also between wild strains detected by direct sequencing from patient specimens and in vitro cultured strains. The greatest differences were found for patients with long-term borrelial infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most frequently reported human vector-associated disease in the United States. Infection occurs after the bite of an Ixodid tick that is infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Dogs have often been reported to serve as effective sentinel animals to assess the risk of human B. burgdorferi infection. Based on published data of human Lyme disease case numbers and our clinical impressions, we hypothesized that canine exposure to B. burgdorferi would be lower in North Carolina when compared to the exposure in Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. To address this hypothesis, we evaluated B. burgdorferi exposure status utilizing a specific and sensitive C6 peptide-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Our convenience sample included 1,666 canine serum samples submitted to the Vector Borne Disease Diagnostic Laboratory from North Carolina (n = 987), Virginia (n = 472), Maryland (n = 167), and Pennsylvania (n = 40). Comparisons among states were made using the Chi-square test or the Fisher's exact test; p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni correction. A Chi-square test for trend was used to determine if there was an increase in the frequency of seroreactors associated with the geographical origin of the samples. The proportion of seroreactive dogs in North Carolina was markedly lower (p < 0.008) than that observed in dogs from Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania. These results support the hypothesis that B. burgdorferi transmission seems to occur infrequently in North Carolina dogs as compared to dogs residing in other southeastern and mid-Atlantic states. Furthermore, they support the utility of dogs as a sentinel to characterize the risk of B. burgdorferi transmission to humans in a defined geographical location."

Mountain grasslands and woods have made it also a suitable habitat for sheep and bovine cattle, as well as for wild animals such as the wild bore and the roe deer. Therefore, a preliminary investigation was conducted to assess the risk of transmission of tick-borne zoonoses, such as Lyme disease and Babesiosis, by actively looking for both the arthropod vector and the causative agent. For two consecutive years, ambushing ticks were collected in four distinct geographical areas, comprehensive of many highly frequented tourist places. The tick fauna, tick habitats and the seasonal distribution of the different tick life stages collected with the method of \"flagging and dragging\" have been reported. Almost all the collected specimens belonged to the species Haemaphysalis punctata (Canestrini and Fanzago) (Acari: Ixodidae), which was found moderately infected with Babesia spp. Only a few Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus) ticks, the most competent vector of Lyme disease, were found and on PCR examination all of them resulted negative as far as the infectious agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Johnson) is concerned."

The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was based on medical history, clinical manifestations, epidemiological data about tick contact, determinations of antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi by serological assays, immunoblot analysis, therapeutic results and exclusion of other infectious agents of ocular disease. Of the eleven patients reported here with clinical manifestations of ocular Lyme borreliosis, 6 had chorioretinitis, 1 papillitis, 2 iridocyclitis, 1 occlusion of the arteriae centralis retinae, 1 neuritis retrobulbaris and 1 neuroretinitis. Diagnostic confirmation of LB was in most patients done by serological tests and/or by immunoblot method in serum. In the last few years we have also done culture and molecular diagnostic methods polymerase chain reaction (PCR)) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The patients were treated with 2 g of ceftriaxon i.v. per day for 14-21 days and/or with doxucyclin orally in a daily dose of 2 x 100 mg for 2-4 weeks. The therapeutic effect was followed up by regression of clinical symptoms (better visual acuity of the infected eye) and in changing of the specific antibody titer in serological tests. The authors emphasise the more detailed diagnostic proceedings of ocular Lyme borreliosis in patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis, an algorithm which contains data about residence in endemic area for LB, positive contact with ticks and/or the history of erythema migrans or any other Lyme borreliosis-like symptoms. For diagnostic confirmation it is necessary to use enzymeimmunoassay and immunoblot methods in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and aqueous humor, and isolation by culture or PCR can be used in the same diagnostic samples. Ocular Lyme borreliosis is an underdiagnosed disorder, because it is often unrecognised by ophthalmologists and due to weak seropositivity and seronegativity in the late ocular Lyme borreliosis. This is especially important in a highly endemic area for Lyme borreliosis like northwest Croatia, a border area of the central European andemic area for Lyme borreliosis."

A total of 96 hospitalised patients infected or suspected of being infected with borreliosis were screened for A. phagocytophilum and Babesia sp. DNA. Positive results of PCRs for A. phagocytophilum DNA were obtained for 10 patients, 8 of whom were diagnosed with borreliosis earlier, and 4 of whom were diagnosed with tick-borne encephalitis (on the basis of serological studies of serum and cerebrospinal fluid). None of the 10 patients had clinical or biochemical markers of anaplasmosis, corroborating the existence of asymptomatic anaplasmosis or self-limiting course. in Europe. Similarly, Babesia DNA was not found in the blood of any of the patients. The results of the studies show that in diagnosing tick-borne diseases, clinical examinations should consider infection by two or even three tick-borne pathogens."

To compare the year range of seroprevalence in other small mammals was not feasible due to the small sample number. Area-wise distribution of anti-Borrelia antibodies was even (18.75% to 20%) in this study, except in the Bot'any province (0%).

In Northern Asian countries, Ixodes persulcatus carries Eurasian-type Borrelia garinii (20047 type), Borrelia afzelii, and Asian-type B. garinii (variant NT29), whereas Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto has not been isolated. In contrast, Asian-type B. garinii has not been found in the European vector tick Ixodes ricinus. These Borrelia spp. cause Lyme borreliosis in their respective countries. The specificity between Borrelia spp. and tick spp. has been confirmed from studies in the Moscow region, which is a sympatric region for the tick spp. I. persulcatus and I. ricinus. In Southeast Asian countries including the southernmost island of Okinawa, the Borrelia valaisiana-related genomic group is carried by Ixodes granulatus. In Japan, a similar borrelia strain Am501, is transmitted by Ixodes columnae. Ixodes ovatus transmits Borrelia japonica but not other species. On other hand, in central China and Nepal, the ticks harbor Borrelia sinica. It is believed that these molecular epidemiological surveys will provide useful information for the diagnoses and prevention of Lyme borreliosis in these countries."

The persistent nature of infection by B. burgdorferi can lead to development of chronic disease, as found in patients infected before recognition of the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy. Much speculation has surrounded the possibility that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in chronic symptoms. In most cases, involvement of autoimmunity in Lyme disease has not received experimental support. The exception is in a small group of patients with chronic arthritis whose abnormal joint symptoms persist after apparent elimination of the bacteria. In this review, the evidence supporting autoimmune mechanisms in Lyme disease will be discussed."

		"abstract": "Many pathogens, such as the agents of West Nile encephalitis and plague, are maintained in nature by animal reservoirs and transmitted to humans by arthropod vectors. Efforts to reduce disease incidence usually rely on vector control or immunization of humans. Lyme disease, for which no human vaccine is currently available, is a commonly reported vector-borne disease in North America and Europe. In a recently developed, ecological approach to disease prevention, we intervened in the natural cycle of the Lyme disease agent (Borrelia burgdorferi) by immunizing wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus), a reservoir host species, with either a recombinant antigen of the pathogen, outer surface protein A, or a negative control antigen in a repeated field experiment with paired experimental and control grids stratified by site. Outer surface protein A vaccination significantly reduced the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in nymphal blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) collected at the sites the following year in both experiments. The magnitude of the vaccine's effect at a given site correlated with the tick infection prevalence found on the control grid, which in turn correlated with mouse density. These data, as well as differences in the population structures of B. burgdorferi in sympatric ticks and mice, indicated that nonmouse hosts contributed more to infecting ticks than previously expected. Thus, where nonmouse hosts play a large role in infection dynamics, vaccination should be directed at additional species."

		"abstract": "Ticks are obligate haematophagous acarines that parasitise every class of vertebrate (including man) and have a worldwide distribution. An increasing awareness of tick-borne diseases among clinicians and scientific researchers has led to the recent description of a number of emerging tick-borne bacterial diseases. Since the identification of Borrelia burgdorferi as the agent of Lyme disease in 1982, 11 tick-borne human bacterial pathogens have been described in Europe. Aetiological diagnosis of tick-transmitted diseases is often difficult and relies on specialised laboratories using very specific tools. Interpretation of laboratory data is very important in order to establish the diagnosis. These guidelines aim to help clinicians and microbiologists in diagnosing infection transmitted by tick bites and to provide the scientific and medical community with a better understanding of these infectious diseases."

Sera from 181 forestry rangers were examined with two-tiered serological tests for TBE, Lyme borreliosis and ehrlichiosis. Information about risk factors such as job location, residence, number of tick bites and outdoor leisure activities was collected with a questionnaire. Seropositivity was 0.6% for TBE virus, 23.2% for Lyme borreliosis and 0.6% for ehrlichiosis. Lyme borreliosis positivity, as determined by Western blot, was associated with working in the foothills, with gardening in the northeastern part of the region, and with a history of yearly tick bites. Risk factors were similar when a case of Lyme borreliosis was defined either by Western blot positivity or by clinical history."

Results indicated that modified commercial bait boxes were effective as an acaricide delivery method for reducing nymphal and larval tick infestations on white-footed mice by 68 and 84%, respectively. Passive application of fipronil significantly reduced the infection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi among white-footed mice by 53%. Moreover, the abundance of questing I. scapularis adults on treated properties was reduced by 77% and fewer were infected with spirochetes (31%) compared with untreated sites (47%) after 3 yr of treatment. Likewise, the abundance of host-seeking nymphs was significantly reduced on treated properties by >50%. Finally, infection rates in flagged nymphal ticks for both B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum were reduced by 67 and 64%, respectively, after only 2 yr of treatment. Results from this 3-yr trial indicate that the use of fipronil passively applied to reservoir animals by bait boxes is an environmentally acceptable means to control ticks, interrupt the natural disease transmission cycle, and reduce the risk of Lyme disease for residents of treated properties."

		"abstract": "Components of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ( B. burgdorferi s.l.) do not have chemotactic activity. However, B. burgdorferi s.l. causes a chemotactic response, probably by stimulating synthesis of cytokines of the chemokine family by host cells. Our aim was to confirm that the synthesis of chemokines is increased in Lyme borreliosis and that they may account for leukocyte migration, thus being involved in inflammatory response. We measured concentrations of chemokines: interleukin 8 (Il-8) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha and 1beta (MIP-1alpha, -1beta) in serum of 20 patients with erythema migrans (early localized infection, group I), of 19 patients with Lyme arthritis (chronic infection, group II), and in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 20 patients with neuroborreliosis (early disseminated infection, group III), before and after 2 weeks of antibiotic therapy (examinations 1 and 2), as well as in the sera of 12 healthy blood donors and CSF of ten patients in whom Lyme borreliosis and meningitis were excluded (control group). Interleukin 1beta (Il-1beta) level in serum and CSF and pleocytosis of CSF were assessed simultaneously. The mean concentrations of all studied chemokines in serum were significantly elevated in all study groups in examination 1 and decreased in examination 2. The concentration of Il-8 in serum was higher in group I and the concentration of MIP-1alpha in group III was higher in comparison with group II. Serum concentrations of all chemokines in group I and III correlated with the concentration of Il-1beta, while in group II this correlation appeared only for Il-8 in examination 2. Concentrations of all chemokines in CSF were significantly increased, but as for MIP-1alpha and 1beta they remained lower than in serum. The concentration of Il-8 in CSF was variable and reached values several fold higher than in the serum in some patients. There was no correlation between chemokine concentrations and CSF pleocytosis. The synthesis of chemokines (Il-8, MIP-1alpha and 1beta) is increased in Lyme borreliosis and, at least in the early stages of the disease, is related to the synthesis of Il-1beta. Chemokine concentrations depend on the clinical form of Lyme borreliosis, with a tendency for higher values in early infection (erythema migrans and neuroborreliosis). Of the chemokines studied, Il-8 created a chemotactic gradient towards the inflammation site, and thus might be responsible for leukocyte migration."

All three Borrelia strains grew well in both media. In the majority of the experiments the number of B. afzelii cells was higher in MKP than in BSK-II medium while for B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. a tendency for better growth in BSK-II than MKP was established. In a mixture of equivalent amounts of two species, B. burgdorferi s.s. as a rule overgrew the other two species while in the mixture of B. afzelii and B. garinii the latter was a \"dominant\" strain. Comparing the performance of the two media, B. burgdorferi s.s. usually overgrew either B. afzelii or B. garinii in MKP as well as in BSK-II medium, however, the results were found to be statistically significant only for MKP medium. In the mixture of B. afzelii and B. garinii the latter was the predominant species but significant differences were established only for BSK-II medium. It seems that the overgrowth is predominantly the result of the characteristics of the individual Borrelia species and most probably not a consequence of growth differences in the two culture media. Further work with a larger number of strains is needed to confirm these findings."

We propose an effective and specific test for detection of TBEV in a single tick or a pool of ticks based on the detection of TBEV RNA using an RT-PCR technique without RNA purification. The method is very sensitive with the detection limit of about 14 fg TBEV RNA in total RNA obtained from brain suspension from suckling mice infected with TBEV per reaction. The primers were derived from the 5'-terminal non-coding region, a highly conserved part of the virus. The method was successfully applied to field-collected ticks in detecting TBEV RNA. This method can be used in studies of several aspects of TBEV: epidemiology, screening of natural foci, circulation and detection of virus genome sequences in clinical materials."

Six months after the first symptoms, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed bone marrow oedema within the proximal phalanx of the right fifth toe, adjacent to an ACA rash. A year after the onset of the disease, swelling at the right scapular region occurred, and MRI showed osseous, periosteal and soft tissue involvement of the superior margin of the right scapula and adjacent rib. On MRI of the spine, there was bone marrow infiltration with irregular delineation of the anterior corner of the thoracic vertebrae 4 to 6, corresponding to an osteoblastic bony lesion on radiographic examination. This case report is unique, because MRI documentation of bony abnormalities and periarticular soft tissue swelling, accompanying an attack of ACA has never been reported previously. Moreover, involvement of the osseous spine and the scapular bone have never been described in the radiological literature."

Several human pathogens have been shown to bind fH to their surface, a process that facilitates immune evasion or cell to cell interaction. Among the pathogens that bind fH are some Borrelia species associated with Lyme disease and relapsing fever. The fH-binding proteins of the Lyme spirochetes form two classes (I and II). In Borrelia burgdorferi B31MI, class I includes the outer surface protein E (OspE) paralogs, L39, N38, and P38, whereas the class II group includes A68 and additional proteins that have not yet been identified. To identify the OspE determinants involved in fH and OspE-targeting infection-induced Ab (iAb) binding, deletion, random, and site-directed mutagenesis of L39 were performed. Mutations in several different regions of L39 abolished fH and or iAb binding, indicating that separable domains and residues of OspE are required for ligand binding. Some of the mutants that lost the ability to bind fH, iAb, or both had only a single amino acid change. Site-directed mutagenesis of three putative coiled coil motifs of OspE revealed that these higher order structures are required for fH binding but not for iAb binding. The data presented within demonstrate that the binding of fH and iAb to the OspE protein is mediated by higher order structures and protein conformation. These studies advance our understanding of fH binding as a virulence mechanism and facilitate ongoing efforts to use fH-binding proteins in the development of microbial vaccines."

For those of us who live within an endemic area the shower after a days gardening is not just to remove sweat and dirt but also an opportunity to check for, and if necessary remove, any ticks that may have chosen a human host. Fortunately, the liberal use of insecticide around our house combined with one of our cat's single pawed attempt to eliminate the local white-footed mouse population appears to have been effective in reducing the tick count."

The function of sRNAs depends in many cases on the RNA-binding protein Hfq, especially for sRNAs with an antisense function. In this study, the genome of Borrelia burgdorferi was subjected to different searches for sRNAs, including direct homology and comparative genomics searches and ortholog- and annotation-based search strategies. Two new sRNAs were found, one of which showed complementarity to the rpoS region, which it possibly controls by an antisense mechanism. The role of the other sRNA is unknown, although observed complementarities against particular mRNA sequences suggest an antisense mechanism. We suggest that the low level of sRNAs observed in B. burgdorferi is at least partly due to the presumed lack of both functional Hfq protein and RNase E activity."

		"abstract": "Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B12 deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability."

A review of literature about SBFP is made, studing specially the one caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. We present a diagnostic guideline of SBFP. Suspect diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on clinical and epidemiological criteria. Culture isolation of this bacteria is difficult, therefore serologic testing is required. Neuroborreliosis treatment is intravenous Ceftriaxone or Cefotaxime. Oral Doxycycline is useful in the treatment of neuritis without central nervous system involvement."

The transformation efficiency with the shuttle vector pBSV2C03::gntDeltakan was increased from <1 to approximately 10 colonies per mug of DNA for 5A4 and 5A4 BBE02::Kan(r) and from 14 to approximately 600 colonies per mug of DNA for 5A18 and 5A18 BBE02::Kan(r). lp25, which is required for infectivity in mice, was retained in BBE02 mutants transformed with pBSV2C03::gntDeltakan, but lp25 was not detected in transformants of the parental clones 5A4 and 5A18. BBE02 disruptants and pBSV2C03::gntDeltakan transformants of these clones remained infectious in C3H/HeN mice, and the 50% infective doses of the BBE02 disruptants were <10(2) organisms per mouse. The inactivation of BBE02 thus eliminates a transformation barrier for infectious B. burgdorferi B31 and will provide a valuable tool for studying the virulence factors of Lyme disease."

The piece of genes coding flagellin from Chinese Borrelia burgdorferi PD91 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was obtained, and constructed recombinant plasmid, before transformed into E. coli BL21 strain, and induced. The recombinant plasmid was identified with enzyme cutoff and gene sequence comparison. Efficient expression strain was selected and the expression product was analyzed with sodium amplified polymorphic-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western-blot method. The recombinant protein (r-flagellin) expressed in host bacteria was successful. By means of western-blot assay, the immunological response showed the same antigenicity between r-flagellin and PD91 flagellin. The piece of genes coding flagellin of PD91 was 1011 bp, but when comparing with that of North American Borrelia burgdorferi it showed 94.70% homology. Homology between the sequence of amino acid of the r-flagellin and that of B31 flagellin was 95.85%. Flagellin gene of Borrelia garinii of Chinese Lyme disease spirochete was successfully cloned and expressed for the first time. It was proved that the immunoreactivity of r-flagellin was the same as the natural flagellin."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the aetiologic agent of Lyme disease, modulates gene expression in response to changes imposed by its arthropod vector and mammalian hosts. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to vary in these environments, we asked how B. burgdorferi responds to oxidative stress. The B. burgdorferi genome encodes a PerR homologue (recently designated BosR) that represses the oxidative stress response in other bacteria, suggesting a similar function in B. burgdorferi. When we tested the sensitivity of B. burgdorferi to ROS, one clonal non-infectious B. burgdorferi isolate exhibited hypersensitivity to t-butyl hydroperoxide when compared with infectious B. burgdorferi and other non-infectious isolates. Sequence analysis indicated that the hypersensitive non-infectious isolates bosR allele contained a single nucleotide substitution, converting an arginine to a lysine (bosRR39K). Mutants in bosRR39K exhibited an increase in resistance to oxidative stressors when compared with the parental non-infectious strain, suggesting that BosRR39K functioned as a repressor. Complementation with bosRR39K and bosR resulted in differential sensitivity to t-butyl hydroperoxide, indicating that these alleles are functionally distinct. In contrast to BosR, BosRR39K did not activate transcription of a napA promoter-lacZ reporter in Escherichia coli nor bind the napA promoter/operator domain. However, we found that both BosR and BosRR39K bound to the putative promoter/operator region of superoxide dismutase (sodA). In addition, we determined that cells lacking BosRR39K synthesized fourfold greater levels of the decorin binding adhesin DbpA suggesting that BosRR39K regulates genes unrelated to oxidative stress. Based on these data, we propose that the single amino acid substitution, R39K, dramatically alters the activity of BosR by altering its ability to bind DNA at target regulatory sequences."

		"abstract": "From March to October 2003, a total of 2,518 host-seeking Ixodes ricinus ticks (1,944 nymphs, 264 females, 310 males) were collected by blanket dragging at 45 sites all over the city area of Bonn, western Germany, to be checked for Borrelia burgdorferi infection. The collection sites included 20 private gardens, nine public recreational parks, the boundaries of 14 sylvatic suburban areas and two footpaths between suburban farmed fields. Generally, numbers of specimens collected along sylvatic suburban areas and at urban sites with dense tree populations were significantly higher than at the other collection sites. Out of 1,394 specimens (865 nymphs, 241 females, 288 males) that were randomly chosen for Borrelia analysis by a simple PCR, 250 (17.9 %) were found to be infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. While the infection prevalences varied significantly between females (26.6%), males (12.5%) and nymphs (17.3%), there were no striking differences between sylvatic and unwooded sites. A total of 92.8% of the ticks Borrelia-positive by the simple PCR were also positive in a diagnostic nested PCR. Using genospecies-specific oligonucleotide probes, single Borrelia genospecies infections (91.4%) could be assigned to B. afzelii (39.5%), B. garinii (27.9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (15.6%) and B. valaisiana (8.6%) by DNA hybridization. Various combinations of double infections were observed in 4.3% of the infected ticks. Another 4.3% of the Borrelia infections were untypeable. The B. burgdorferi genospecies distribution in the city area was shown to be variable from site to site and, even more, it was distinct from rural collection sites near Bonn. This is ascribed to a different spectrum of reservoir hosts. Taking into account the infection prevalences of host-seeking ticks in the forested surroundings of Bonn, our study demonstrates that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease after a tick bite in urban/suburban areas is comparably as high as in woodlands outside of the city."

Depending on the Borrelia species involved, the borreliosis differs in its clinical symptoms. Comparative genomics opens up a way to elucidate the underlying differences in Borrelia species. We analysed a low redundancy whole-genome shotgun (WGS) assembly of a B.garinii strain isolated from a patient with neuroborreliosis in comparison to the B.burgdorferi genome. This analysis reveals that most of the chromosome is conserved (92.7% identity on DNA as well as on amino acid level) in the two species, and no chromosomal rearrangement or larger insertions/deletions could be observed. Furthermore, two collinear plasmids (lp54 and cp26) seem to belong to the basic genome inventory of Borrelia species. These three collinear parts of the Borrelia genome encode 861 genes, which are orthologous in the two species examined. The majority of the genetic information of the other plasmids of B.burgdorferii is also present in B.garinii although orthology is not easy to define due to a high redundancy of the plasmid fraction. Yet, we did not find counterparts of the B.burgdorferi plasmids lp36 and lp38 or their respective gene repertoire in the B.garinii genome. Thus, phenotypic differences between the two species could be attributable to the presence or absence of these two plasmids as well as to the potentially positively selected genes."

Specifically, CD4+ CD25+ T cells have been shown to prevent insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, inflammatory bowel disease, and pancreatitis. Here, we present evidence that CD4+ CD25+ T cells also play a major role in controlling the severity of arthritis detected in Borrelia burgdorferi-vaccinated gamma interferon-deficient (IFN-gamma degrees ) C57BL/6 mice challenged with the Lyme spirochete. When B. burgdorferi-vaccinated and challenged IFN-gamma degrees mice were treated with anti-interleukin-17 (IL-17) antibody, the number of CD4+ CD25+ T cells increased in the local lymph nodes. Furthermore, histopathologic examination showed the mice to be free of destructive arthritis. When these anti-IL-17-treated B. burgdorferi-vaccinated and challenged mice were also administered anti-CD25 antibody, the number of CD4+ CD25+ T cells in the local lymph nodes decreased. More importantly, severe destructive arthropathy was induced. In addition, delayed administration of anti-CD25 antibody decreased the severity of the arthritis. These results suggest that CD4+ CD25+ T cells are involved in regulation of a severe destructive arthritis induced with an experimental model of vaccination and challenge with B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi naturally persists in a cycle that primarily involves ticks and mammals. We have now identified a tick receptor (TROSPA) that is required for spirochetal colonization of Ixodes scapularis. B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A, which is abundantly expressed on spirochetes within the arthropod and essential for pathogen adherence to the vector, specifically bound to TROSPA. TROSPA mRNA levels in ticks increased following spirochete infestation and decreased in response to engorgement, events that are temporally linked to B. burgdorferi entry into and egress from the vector. The blockade of TROSPA by TROSPA antisera or by the repression of TROSPA expression via RNA interference reduced B. burgdorferi adherence to the I. scapularis gut in vivo, thereby preventing efficient colonization of the vector and subsequently reducing pathogen transmission to the mammalian host. Identification of an I. scapularis receptor for B. burgdorferi is the first step toward elucidating arthropod ligands that are required for survival of spirochetes in nature."

We tested the hypothesis that distributions of nymphal I scapularis ticks at the fine scale of an endemic community also are spatially autocorrelated. Nymphal tick densities were determined by collecting ticks from 51 and 47 wooded residential properties in a southern Rhode Island town in 2002 and 2003, respectively. The average tick density at residences during 2002 was 51.17 ( +/- 46.04) nymphs per hour, with a range of 3-297 and median of 40.82. In 2003, the average tick density was 44.48 (+/- 38.31) nymphs per hour, with a range of 3-153 and median of 36. Semivariance analysis revealed no spatial autocorrelation in tick densities between residences, likely due to the high variability of tick distributions at this scale. Further analysis of drag-sampling data at individual residences by using Lloyd's patchiness index (m*/m) demonstrated a patchy distribution of nymphs. High variability of nymphal I. scapularis densities may greatly affect predicting spatial patterns of ticks at a fine scale."

With respect to the pathogenesis of neuroborreliosis this topographical association was investigated in an animal model. A Borrelia garinii strain, isolated from the CSF of a child with acute facial palsy, was injected in 9 rats intracutaneously in the right subauricular region. Infected rats were examined for clinical symptoms of Lyme disease, the spread of the spirochetes was investigated by PCR of necropsies (facial nerves, trigeminus nerves, heart, brain, skin) up to 47 days after infection. The nerve tissues were investigated by histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. None of the rats developed a facial palsy or other symptoms of Lyme disease. Borrelia DNA was found in the heart after 5 days and in the brain after 7 days of infection up to the end of investigation (47 days), as well as in the ipsilateral peripheral nerves after 7 to 33 days. Borrelia was detected by electron microscopy near endoneural vessels of the facial nerve. Peri-, epi-, and endoneural infiltrations of macrophages, plasma cells and B cells characterized an inflammation of the facial and trigeminus nerves ipsilateral to the infection site. An infection with Borrelia garinii in the subauricular region induces an ipsilateral neuritis of peripheral nerves. The particular vulnerability of the human facial nerve may be a result of its long intraosseus course. Thus, an inflammatory edema may injure the nerve in the canalis facialis."

Two groups of mice were infected with either BL206 (RST1) or B348 (RST3). Two weeks later, experimental mice were challenged with the opposite strain, while control mice were challenged with the same strain as that used for the primary infection. The transmission of BL206 and B348 from infected mice was then determined by xenodiagnosis with uninfected larval ticks at weekly intervals for 42 days. Mice in both experimental groups were permissive for infection with the second strain and were able to transmit both strains to the xenodiagnostic ticks. However, the overall transmission efficiencies of BL206 and B348 were significantly different. BL206 was more efficiently transmitted than B348 to xenodiagnostic ticks. Significantly fewer double infections than expected were detected in xenodiagnostic ticks. The results suggest that some B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains, such as BL206, may be preferentially maintained in transmission cycles between ticks and white-footed mice. Other strains, such as B348, may be more effectively maintained in different tick-vertebrate transmission cycles."

		"abstract": "To determine whether the pathogenic variant of Lyme disease spirochetes, isolate A14S, is perpetuated in a particular reservoir-vector relationship, we screened vector ticks in various Central European sites for a related spirochete and determined its host association. A14S-like spirochetes infect numerous questing ticks in the Petite Camargue Alsacienne (PC). They frequently infect dormice, but no mice or voles. Garden dormice appear to be better reservoir hosts for A14S-like spirochetes than for Borrelia afzelii, because these spirochetes are retained longer and infect ticks more readily. Spirochetes associated with garden dormice in the PC site form a homologous entity with those isolated from a human patient in The Netherlands. Its unique biological relationship together with previous genetic characterization justifies designating this dormouse-associated genospecies as a distinct entity. Garden dormice serve as the main reservoir hosts of a novel genospecies, Borrelia spielmani sp. nov., one of several that cause Lyme disease in people."

Three genotypes of B. burgdorferi: sensu stricto B-31, B. garinii 20047 and B. afzelii--VS 46110 were used for stimulation. The study group consisted of 23 patients (13 males and 10 females). The control group (K) consisted of 10 healthy people. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were incubated in atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 degrees C after the addition of spirochetes of B. afzelii (VS 46110), B. garinii (20047), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (B-31) in the concentration of 10(8) spirochetes/well, for 5 days. The supernatants were analyzed for concentration of sCD4, sCD8, sCD25 and IL-4, IFN-gamma by means of ELISA method. The increase in sCD4, sCD8 and sCD25 concentrations indicates the activation of these lymphocytes with CD4, CD8, CD25 receptors in this group of patients. A significantly higher concentration of IFN-gamma shows the long-lasting cellular response with the advantage of Th1 type profile cytokines. All used strains had immunogenic properties but B. afzelii had the strongest in patients with chronic borreliosis."

The frequency distributions of ospC within populations suggest that this locus is under balancing selection. In multiple-niche polymorphism, a type of balancing selection, diversity within a population can be maintained when the environment is heterogeneous and no one genotype has the highest fitness in all environments. Genetically different individuals within vertebrate species and different vertebrate species constitute diverse environments for B. burgdorferi. We examined four important host species of B. burgdorferi and found that the strains that infected each species had different sets of ospC major groups. We found no variation among conspecific hosts in the ospC major groups of their infecting strains. These results suggest multiple niches create balancing selection at the ospC locus."

The first patient had oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in remission. Five months after an infected tick bite, she developed a relapse of arthritis in the same knee. We considered Lyme borreliosis as the possible trigger for this reactivation. The disease history of the second patient was that of a classical non-responder. After extensive antibiotic treatment osteolytic lesions became visible. MRI images suggested an erosive arthropathy and arthroscopy was used to investigate possible erosive arthritis. Studies on collected material made us consider the following hypothesis. Despite demonstration of a spirochete fragment in a synovial biopsy, the patient recovered without additional antibiotic treatment. delay of antibiotic treatment after appearance of erythema migrans may cause systemic spread of the antigen and predispose to Lyme arthritis. If intra-articular steroids are considered when spontaneous resolution of Lyme arthritis does not occur, magnetic resonance imaging of the affected joint, prior to administration, may provide additional information. The success of synovectomy may be related to removal of undegraded antigenic material which may prolong the inflammation."

By contrast, arthritis was observed in only 25 of 60 (42%) mice inoculated with two of these B. burgdorferi strains grown in a different lot of BSK-H medium (P < 0.001). In a prospective study, mice inoculated with a B. burgdorferi clinical isolate grown in a BSK medium prepared in-house produced significantly greater disease than those injected with the same isolate cultured in BSK-H medium (P < 0.05).

The recombinant shuttle vector pBBE22, which includes the virulence determinant BBE22 from lp25 and restores infectivity to readily transformable B. burgdorferi lacking lp25 and lp56, was used to determine the effect of trans expression of vlsE on virulence. Spirochetes lacking lp28-1 were complemented with the plasmid pBBE22:vlsE, containing both BBE22 and vlsE. VlsE protein produced by this construct was expressed and surface accessible in in vitro-cultured B. burgdorferi, as determined by surface proteolysis and immunoblot analysis. Clones lacking lp25 but containing lp28-1 and either pBBE22 or pBBE22:vlsE were reisolated consistently from immunocompetent mice 8 weeks after infection. In contrast, a clone lacking both lp25 and lp28-1 and complemented with pBBE22:vlsE was isolated from only a single tissue of one of six C3H/HeN mice 8 weeks postinfection. These results indicate that either an intact vls antigenic variation locus or another determinant on lp28-1 is required to restore complete infectivity. In addition, an isogenic clone that retained lp28-1 was complemented with the vlsE shuttle plasmid and was examined for vlsE sequence variation and infectivity. Sequence variation was not observed for the shuttle plasmid, indicating that the cis arrangement of vlsE and the vls silent cassettes in lp28-1 facilitate vlsE gene conversion. Lack of vlsE sequence variation on the shuttle plasmid thus did not result in clearance of the trans-complemented strain in immunocompetent mice under the conditions tested."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, undergoes dramatic changes in antigenic composition as it cycles between its arthropod and mammalian hosts. A growing body of evidence suggests that these changes reflect, at least in part, the need for spirochetes to adapt to the physiological stresses imposed by abrupt changes in environmental conditions and nutrient availability. In many microorganisms, global responses are mediated by master regulators such as alternative sigma factors, with Escherichia coli RpoS (sigmaS) serving as a prototype. The importance of this transcriptional activator in other bacteria, coupled with the report by Hubner et al. (A. Hubner, X. Yang, D. M. Nolen, T. G. Popova, F. C. Cabello, and M. V. Norgard, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:12724-12729, 2001) demonstrating that the borrelial RpoS ortholog controls expression of OspC and decorin-binding protein A (DbpA), prompted us to examine more closely the roles of RpoS-dependent and -independent differential gene expression in physiological adaptation by the Lyme disease spirochete. We observed that B. burgdorferi rpoS (rpoSBb) was induced following temperature shift and transcript levels were further enhanced by reduced pH (pH 6.8). Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), we demonstrated that, in contrast to its ortholog (rpoSEc) in Escherichia coli, rpoSBb was expressed at significant levels in B. burgdorferi throughout all phases of growth following temperature shift. By comparing a B. burgdorferi strain 297 rpoSBb mutant to its wild-type counterpart, we determined that RpoSBb was not required for survival following exposure to a wide range of environmental stresses (i.e., temperature shift, serum starvation, increased osmolality, reactive oxygen intermediates, and increased or reduced oxygen tension), although the mutant was more sensitive to extremes of pH. While B. burgdorferi strains lacking RpoS were able to survive within intraperitoneal dialysis membrane chambers at a level equivalent to that of the wild type, they were avirulent in mice. Lastly, RT-PCR analysis of the ospE-ospF-elp paralogous lipoprotein families complements earlier findings that many temperature-inducible borrelial loci are controlled in an RpoSBb-independent manner. Together, these data point to fundamental differences between the role(s) of RpoS in B. burgdorferi and that in E. coli. Rather than functioning as a master regulator, RpoSBb appears to serve as a stress-responsive activator of a subset of virulence determinants that, together with the RpoS-independent, differentially expressed regulon, encompass the spirochete's genetic programs required for mammalian host adaptation."

Spirochete gene expression as a function of temperature, pH, growth phase, and host milieu is well studied, and recent work suggests that regulatory networks are involved. Here, we examine the release of Borrelia burgdorferi strain B31 proteins into conditioned medium. Spirochetes intrinsically radiolabeled at concentrations ranging from 10(7) to 10(9) cells per ml secreted Oms28, a previously characterized outer membrane porin, into RPMI medium. As determined by immunoblotting, this secretion was not associated with outer membrane blebs or cytoplasmic contamination. A similar profile of secreted proteins was obtained for spirochetes radiolabeled in mixtures of RPMI medium and serum-free Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly (BSK II) medium. Proteomic liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic fragments derived from strain B31 culture supernatants confirmed the identity of the 28-kDa species as Oms28 and revealed a 26-kDa protein as 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase (Pfs-2), previously described as Bgp, a glycosaminoglycan-binding protein. The release of Oms28 into the culture medium is more selective when the spirochetes are in logarithmic phase of growth compared to organisms obtained from stationary phase. As determined by immunoblotting, stationary-phase spirochetes released OspA, OspB, and flagellin. Oms28 secreted by strains B31, HB19, and N40 was also recovered by radioimmunoprecipitation. This is the first report of B. burgdorferi protein secretion into the extracellular environment. The possible roles of Oms28 and Bgp in the host-pathogen interaction are considered."

		"abstract": "Treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis, which may result from infection-induced autoimmunity, is associated with reactivity to a T cell epitope of outer-surface protein A (OspA(161-175)) of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bb). This syndrome has been noted primarily in the United States where only Bb is present, and rarely in Europe where Borrelia garinii (Bg) and Borrelia afzelii (Ba) predominate. To gain a better understanding of this epitope, we identified its species-specific polymorphisms, determined their immunogenicity, and characterized the contribution of individual amino acids. Based on published sequences the Bb peptide differed from the Ba peptide in six of the nine core residues (amino acids 165-173), whereas the Bg peptide usually differed in three of the nine residues. Lymphocytes from seven patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis proliferated in response to the Bb peptide, but not to the Ba or Bg peptide. Substitution analysis showed that valine166 and threonine172 were critical for the immunogenicity of the Bb peptide. Thus, consistent with the geographic distribution of the illness, the European causative agents of Lyme borreliosis usually lack the putative pathogenic OspA epitope. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that T cell recognition of this epitope is important in the induction of autoimmunity in treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "We recently described the inhibition of host B lymphocytes by Ixodes ricinus tick saliva. In this study, we characterized the factor responsible for this activity and examined the modulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein (Osp)-induced proliferation of naive murine B lymphocytes by an enriched fraction of this factor. The B-lymphocyte inhibitory activity was destroyed by trypsin treatment, indicating that a proteinaceous factor was responsible for this activity. The removal of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) from tick salivary glands extracts (SGE) showed that this B-cell inhibitory protein (BIP) was not a GST. Gel filtration liquid chromatography indicated that BIP has a native molecular weight of approximately 18,000. An enrichment protocol, using a combination of anion-exchange and reverse-phase liquid chromatography, was established. BIP-enriched fractions did not suppress T-cell proliferation. Delayed addition of BIP-enriched fractions, up to 7 hr after LPS addition, inhibited the proliferation of isolated B cells. BIP-enriched fractions dramatically inhibited both OspA- and OspC-induced proliferation of isolated B cells. These results strongly suggest that BIP may facilitate B. burgdorferi transmission by preventing B-cell activation, and also highlights the potential of BIP as a therapeutic agent in B-cell maladies."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, encodes an RpoS ortholog (RpoS(Bb)) that controls the temperature-inducible differential expression of at least some of the spirochete's lipoprotein genes, including ospC and dbpBA. To begin to dissect the determinants of RpoS(Bb) recognition of, and selectivity for, its dependent promoters, we linked a green fluorescent protein reporter to the promoter regions of several B. burgdorferi genes with well-characterized expression patterns. Consistent with the expression patterns of the native genes/proteins in B. burgdorferi strain 297, we found that expression of the ospC, dbpBA, and ospF reporters in the spirochete was RpoS(Bb) dependent, while the ospE and flaB reporters were RpoS(Bb) independent. To compare promoter recognition by RpoS(Bb) with that of the prototype RpoS (RpoS(Ec)), we also introduced our panel of constructs into Escherichia coli. In this surrogate, maximal expression from the ospC, dbpBA, and ospF promoters clearly required RpoS, although in the absence of RpoS(Ec) the ospF promoter was weakly recognized by another E. coli sigma factor. Furthermore, RpoS(Bb) under the control of an inducible promoter was able to complement an E. coli rpoS mutant, although RpoS(Ec) and RpoS(Bb) each initiated greater activity from their own dependent promoters than they did from those of the heterologous sigma factor. Genetic analysis of the ospC promoter demonstrated that (i) the T(-14) in the presumptive -10 region plays an important role in sigma factor recognition in both organisms but is not as critical for transcriptional initiation by RpoS(Bb) as it is for RpoS(Ec); (ii) the nucleotide at the -15 position determines RpoS or sigma(70) selectivity in E. coli but does not serve the same function in B. burgdorferi; and (iii) the 110-bp region upstream of the core promoter is not required for RpoS(Ec)- or RpoS(Bb)-dependent activity in E. coli but is required for maximal expression from this promoter in B. burgdorferi. Taken together, the results of our studies suggest that the B. burgdorferi and E. coli RpoS proteins are able to catalyze transcription from RpoS-dependent promoters of either organism, but at least some of the nucleotide elements involved in transcriptional initiation and sigma factor selection in B. burgdorferi play a different role than has been described for E. coli."

Despite extensive research into the complex nature of Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal agent of Lyme disease, controversy continues over the diagnosis and treatment of this protean illness. This report will focus on two aspects of the treatment of Lyme disease. First, the medical basis for diagnostic and therapeutic uncertainty in Lyme disease, including variability in clinical presentation, shortcomings in laboratory testing procedures, and design defects in therapeutic trials. Second, the standard of care and legal issues that have resulted from the clinical uncertainty of Lyme disease diagnosis and treatment. Specifically, the divergent therapeutic standards for Lyme disease are addressed, and the difficult process of creating treatment guidelines for this complex infection is explored. Consideration by healthcare providers of the medicolegal issues outlined in this review will support a more rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease and related tick-borne illnesses."

The neurological manifestations of Lyme disease are protean, and a potential contribution of concomitant disk disease to sciatica can lead to diagnostic wanderings. Disk lesions and infectious conditions that can cause sciatica are discussed. Whether a favorable response to antibiotic therapy should be taken as proof of B. burgdorferi radiculitis deserves discussion. In practice, in a patient with clinical manifestations suggesting disk-related nerve root pain and residing or having traveled to an endemic area, B. burgdorferi infection should be looked for, as both etiologies can coexist."

Ticks play an important role in transmitting several infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, spirochetes, rickettsia, and parasites, and tick bites cause a variety of acute and chronic infectious diseases, including Lyme disease, tick-borne relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain and Mediterranean spotted fevers, ehrlichiosis, Q fever, tularemia, babesiosis, and tick-borne viral encephalitis. Since its identification nearly 30 years ago, Lyme disease has continued to spread, and it is now the most commonly reported arthropod-borne illness in American and European countries. Rickettsial infections are widely distributed throughout the world and have a remarkable influence on public health and military activities as a possible biological weapon. Tick-borne encephalitis virus is endemic in central, eastern and northern Europe and may cause a wide spectrum of clinical forms, ranging from asymptomatic infection to severe meningo-encephalitis.

Many of the genetic factors affecting spirochete morphology and physiology are unknown due to the limited genetic tools available and the large number of open reading frames with unknown functions. By adapting a mariner transposon to function in B. burgdorferi, we have developed a random mutagenesis system that tags the mutated locus for rapid identification. Transposition occurs at saturating levels in B. burgdorferi and appears to be random, targeting both linear and circular replicons. By combining the transposon system with a screen for factors affecting growth rate, mutations were readily identified in genes putatively involved in cell division and chemotaxis and a hypothetical open reading frame involved in outer membrane integrity. The successful adaptation of a mariner transposon to function in B. burgdorferi should aid in identifying virulence factors and novel gene products related to spirochete physiology."

		"abstract": "Septic arthritis is an infectious disease emergency, requiring aggressive joint drainage and prompt antibiotic therapy. Because age and joint damage are major risk factors, septic arthritis may become more common as the baby-boom generation reaches senescence. Bacteremic joint infections have a high mortality, and long-term disability from joint damage is common. Lyme arthritis has a negligible mortality and low morbidity but causes disproportionate popular anxiety. Most patients with Lyme arthritis respond well to oral antibiotic regimens and recover completely. A few patients develop antibiotic-resistant Lyme arthritis, which is probably autoimmune in nature and responds to immunosuppressive therapy. This paper reviews the presentation, diagnosis, and management of bacterial and Lyme arthritis. Septic arthritis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and group B streptococci may be increasing in prevalence. Prospective studies are required to determine whether there is any benefit of surgical or arthroscopic joint drainage in septic arthritis, compared with serial arthrocentesis, and to determine the role of corticosteroid therapy in septic arthritis in adults, if any."

Spirochetal bacteria possess two membranes and the proteins present in the outer membrane are at the site of interaction with host tissue and the immune system. This review describes the current knowledge in the field of spirochetal outer membrane protein (OMP) biology. What is known concerning biogenesis and structure of OMPs, with particular regard to the atypical signal peptide cleavage sites observed amongst the spirochetes, is discussed. We examine the functions that have been determined for several spirochetal OMPs including those that have been demonstrated to function as adhesins, porins or to have roles in complement resistance. A detailed description of the role of spirochetal OMPs in immunity, including those that stimulate protective immunity or that are involved in antigenic variation, is given. A final section is included which covers experimental considerations in spirochetal outer membrane biology. This section covers contentious issues concerning cellular localization of putative OMPs, including determination of surface exposure. A more detailed knowledge of spirochetal OMP biology will hopefully lead to the design of new vaccines and a better understanding of spirochetal pathogenesis."

Five uninfected NHPs were used as controls. Infection and inflammation was studied in the hearts and the aorta removed at necropsy 2-32 months after inoculation by (1) H&E and trichrome-staining; (2) immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis; (3) Western blot densitometry; and (4) TaqMan RT-PCR. All NHPs inoculated with BbN40 became infected and showed carditis at necropsy. The predominant cells were T cells, plasma cells, and macrophages. There was increased IgG and IgM in the heart independent of immunosuppression. The B-cell chemokine BLC was significantly increased in IS-NHPs. There was increased deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) in TISP and IS-NHPs. The spirochetal load was very high in all BbN40-inoculated IS-NHPs but minimal if any in IC or TISP NHPs. Double-immunostaining revealed that many spirochetes in the heart of BbN40-IS NHPs had MAC on their membranes. We conclude that carditis in NHPs infected with B. burgdorferi is frequent and can persist for years but is mild unless they are immunosupressed."

(2003). Microbiology 149, 2539-2544]. Here is presented a detailed characterization of the spirochaete. Electron microscopy revealed that strain IST7T is morphologically similar to other spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia and possesses 15 to 16 flagellae that emerge from both polar regions. PFGE analysis revealed the genome to comprise a linear chromosome of approximately 1 Mb; two large linear plasmids of approximately 145 and 140 kb, and several small plasmids ranging from 50 to 20 kb in size were also found. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of this Borrelia isolate exhibited 99.4 to 99.8 % identity with other strains isolated from H. aegyptium and less than 99 % similarity with those of other Borrelia species. A phylogenetic tree, generated from 16S rRNA gene sequences, demonstrated that the spirochaete isolates from H. aegyptium clustered together and branched off from both Lyme-disease-related and relapsing-fever-associated Borrelia species. A single copy of the rrs gene was detected in the genome of strain IST7T by Southern hybridization. DNA-DNA hybridization results showed that strain IST7T was distinct from Lyme-disease-related Borrelia, Borrelia burgdorferi and the relapsing-fever-associated species Borrelia hermsii. The G+C content of strain IST7T is 30.0 mol%. From these genetic features, a novel Borrelia species, Borrelia turcica sp. nov., is proposed; the type strain is IST7T (= JCM 11958T = DSM 16138T)."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease in humans, has an unusual genome composed of a linear chromosome and up to 21 extrachromosomal elements. Experimental data suggest that two of these elements, linear plasmids lp25 and lp28-1, play essential roles for infectivity in mice. In this study, we prove the essential natures of these two plasmids by selectively displacing lp25 or lp28-1 in an infectious wild-type clone with incompatible shuttle vectors derived from the native plasmids, rendering the respective transformants noninfectious to mice. Conversely, restoration of plasmid lp25 or lp28-1 in noninfectious clones that naturally lack the corresponding plasmid reestablished infectivity in mice. This approach establishes the ability to manipulate the plasmid content of strains by eliminating or introducing entire plasmids in B. burgdorferi and will be valuable in assessing the roles of plasmids even in unsequenced B. burgdorferi strains."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes persistent mammalian infection despite the development of vigorous immune responses against the pathogen. To examine spirochetal phenotypes that dominate in the hostile immune environment, the mRNA transcripts of four prototypic surface lipoproteins, decorin-binding protein A (DbpA), outer surface protein C (OspC), BBF01, and VlsE, were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR under various immune conditions. We demonstrate that B. burgdorferi changes its surface antigenic expression in response to immune attack. dbpA expression was unchanged while the spirochetes decreased ospC expression by 446 times and increased BBF01 and vlsE expression up to 20 and 32 times, respectively, under the influence of immune pressure generated in immunocompetent mice during infection. This change in antigenic expression could be induced by passively immunizing infected severe combined immunodeficiency mice with specific Borrelia antisera or OspC antibody and appears to allow B. burgdorferi to resist immune attack."

		"abstract": "T helper (Th) lymphocytes mediate critical effector and regulatory functions in infectious, allergic, or autoimmune diseases. Th cells possess clonal receptors that recognize antigenic peptides that are complexed with self-molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen presenting cells. An organism's repertoire of T cell receptors must be broad enough to recognize any possible microbial antigen. At the same time, tissue destruction resulting from the attack of autoreactive T lymphocytes that recognize self-peptides must be avoided. It was therefore believed that the immune system could distinguish between self and non-self antigens. This hypothesis was supported by several lines of evidence, including the seemingly exquisite specificity of immune responses. What, then, triggers autoaggressive attacks by the immune system? Clinical and epidemiological observations strongly suggest a link between infection and autoimmunity. A popular hypothesis considers autoimmunity as a side effect of antimicrobial immune responses. Cross-reactive T cells, capable of recognizing both microbial and self-peptides, have been prime suspects as instigators of autoimmunity ever since computerized data base searches revealed astonishing sequence homologies between microbial and self-peptides. Here we review recent data that show a previously unexpected degeneracy of antigen recognition by T cells. It has become clear that each individual T cell receptor can recognize a large number of different ligands. Furthermore, structural criteria rather than sequence homology dictate the antigen recognition process. Thus, the idea that cross-reactivity per se would cause autoimmune disease is most likely too simple. Instead, a variety of different molecular mechanisms dictate the immunological outcome of ligand recognition by T cells."

The purpose of this work was to evaluate the concentration of proinflammatory cytokines: IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neuroborreliosis. 20 persons with diagnosed neuroborreliosis and 10 persons as a control group were examined in this study. The examination of serum and cerebrospinal fluid was performed twice, before and after 4-week therapy with antibiotics. The concentration of cytokines was measured by the ELISA method using kits of Bender Medical System and Quantikine RD Systems. The concentration of measured cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in serum and cerebrospinal fluid was significantly higher before therapy. After 4-week therapy with antibiotics the concentration of cytokines in cerebrospinal fluid decreased but was still higher than in the control group except for IL-1beta. The detection of proinflammatory cytokine concentration in serum and cerebrospinal fluid might be helpful as another parameter monitoring the inflammation course and therapy efficacy."

		"abstract": "The transcription factor serum amyloid A-activating factor-1 (SAF-1) has been identified as a regulator of a number of cellular genes. To assess the pleiotropic role of SAF-1 in vivo, we generated SAF-1 transgenic mice, in which CMV immediate-early promoter was used to direct expression of the SAF-1 transgene in multiple organs. Our study shows that overexpression of SAF-1 predisposes animals to arthritis. Although SAF-1 transgenic mice do not spontaneously develop arthritis, they develop a severe form of arthritis when challenged with the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, which is known to promote arthritis development in both humans and mice. CMV-SAF-1 transgenic mice, upon B. burgdorferi infection, showed increased joint swelling and synovial inflammation compared with nontransgenic littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis of joint tissues collected 21 days after B. burgdorferi infection revealed colocalization of matrix metalloproteinase-1, a degradative enzyme that destroys type II collagen, a major architectural component of articular cartilage, and SAF-1 in both SAF-1 transgenic and nontransgenic mice. Further analysis by RNase protection assay and Western immunoblot demonstrated the presence of higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 and SAF-1 in the inflamed joints of SAF-1 transgenic mice compared with their levels in nontransgenic mice. Consistent with these findings, reduced levels of proteoglycans were detected in the inflamed joint cartilage of transgenic mice, indicating damage to the cartilage structure. Together these results suggest a role of SAF-1 in the pathogenesis of inflammation-induced arthritis."

		"abstract": "The pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory joint diseases such as adult and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and Lyme arthritis is still poorly understood. Central to the various hypotheses in this respect is the notable involvement of T and B cells. Here we develop the premise that the nominal antigen-independent, polyclonal activation of preactivated T cells via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 has a pivotal role in the initiation and perpetuation of pathogen-induced chronic inflammatory joint disease. We support this with the following evidence. Both naive and effector T cells express TLR-2. A prototypic lipoprotein, Lip-OspA, from the etiological agent of Lyme disease, namely Borrelia burgdorferi, but not its delipidated form or lipopolysaccharide, was able to provide direct antigen-nonspecific co-stimulatory signals to both antigen-sensitized naive T cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines via TLR-2. Lip-OspA induced the proliferation and interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion of purified, anti-CD3-sensitized, naive T cells from C57BL/6 mice but not from TLR-2-deficient mice. Induction of proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion of CTL lines by Lip-OspA was independent of T cell receptor (TCR) engagement but was considerably enhanced after suboptimal TCR activation and was inhibitable by monoclonal antibodies against TLR-2."

		"abstract": "Comparative genomics of closely related bacterial isolates is a powerful method for uncovering virulence and other important genome elements. We determined draft sequences (8-fold coverage) of the genomes of strains JD1 and N40 of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the causative agent of Lyme disease, and we compared the predicted genes from the two genomes with those from the previously sequenced B31 genome. The three genomes are closely related and are evolutionarily approximately equidistant ( approximately 0.5% pairwise nucleotide differences on the main chromosome). We used a Poisson model of nucleotide substitution to screen for genes with elevated levels of nucleotide polymorphisms. The three-way genome comparison allowed distinction between polymorphisms introduced by mutations and those introduced by recombination using the method of phylogenetic partitioning. Tests for recombination suggested that patches of high-density nucleotide polymorphisms on the chromosome and plasmids arise by DNA exchange. The role of recombination as the main mechanism driving B. burgdorferi diversification was confirmed by multilocus sequence typing of 18 clinical isolates at 18 polymorphic loci. A strong linkage between the multilocus sequence genotypes and the major alleles of outer-surface protein C (ospC) suggested that balancing selection at ospC is a dominant force maintaining B. burgdorferi diversity in local populations. We conclude that B. burgdorferi undergoes genome-wide genetic exchange, including plasmid transfers, and previous reports of its clonality are artifacts from the use of geographically and ecological isolated samples. Frequent recombination implies a potential for rapid adaptive evolution and a possible polygenic basis of B. burgdorferi pathogenicity."

These antibiotics possess a comparable in vitro effect, tissue penetration, pharmacokinetics, and therapeutic effect. The treatment of disseminated infections in the second stage, such as neuroborreliosis, carditis, and iritis, is difficult and with relative success they are treated with large doses of penicillin G, or cefriaxon, and doxycycline. The treatment of the third stage of borreliosis aims at chronic inflammatory changes in the affected organs. Antibiotics, however, are successfully effective only in 50% of cases. Administration of antibiotics, such as tetracycline, cefuroxim, doxycycline, or large doses of penicillin is a long-term one, coming up to four weeks. A special therapeutic regimen is used in pregnant women and children."

These findings paralleled those determined by indirect fluorescent antibody staining methods with whole cells (43% and 30%). Moreover, there was good agreement (74%) in results of Western blot analyses and an ELISA when a subset of 39 sera was screened with whole-cell or recombinant p44 antigens of A. phagocytophilum. An ELISA with highly specific recombinant VlsE or p44 antigens can be used in conjunction with other antibody tests to determine whether deer living in different regions of eastern United States were exposed to B. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum."

Four false-positive C6 results were identified in patients that had clinically and microbiologically confirmed Lyme disease but were not detected by the CDC reference methods.

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem infectious disease caused by the tick-transmitted spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. About 80% of all Lyme borreliosis cases represent skin manifestations (dermatoborrelioses). The three characteristic dermatoborrelioses are erythema migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which occur in different stages of the disease. Erythema migrans is the hallmark of early Lyme borreliosis, whereas acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is the characteristic manifestation of late Lyme borreliosis. Several spirochetal factors (e.g. infection with different genospecies, co-infection with other tick-transmitted pathogens) as well as host factors (e.g. cytokine patterns at the site of infection) influence the course of the disease. Diagnosis in the early stage of Lyme borreliosis relies on the clinical picture, whereas serological, molecular, microbiological, and histopathological findings are important adjuncts in the diagnosis of later stages of the infection. Antibiotic treatment is necessary for all stages and manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Doxycycline is the antibiotic of choice for most patients with dermatoborrelioses."

In the current study, we compared the immunoglobulin G (IgG) VlsE (sixth invariant region) peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the current two-tier approach of sonicate ELISA and Western blot in the serodiagnosis of Lyme facial paralysis. Retrospective. Tertiary referral center. Serum samples from 47 Lyme patients with facial paralysis and 86 control subjects were analyzed for IgG antibodies to VlsE peptide of Borrelia burgdorferi and for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to sonicate antigens of B. burgdorferi using the two-tier approach. Diagnostic. Serum IgG antibody responses to VlsE (IR6) peptide. All 47 (100%) patients with facial paralysis and 4 (5%) of 86 controls had positive antibody responses to the VlsE peptide. In the two-tier test, 41 (87%) patients had positive IgM, 31 (66%) had positive IgG, and all 47 patients had positive IgM or IgG responses. Of the 86 control subjects, 2 (2%) had positive results with the two-tier test. Thus, the sensitivities of the VlsE and the two-tier tests were 100%; the specificity of the VlsE ELISA was 95% and the specificity of the two-tier test was 98%. The VlsE peptide ELISA showed a high sensitivity and specificity in the serological diagnosis of Lyme facial paralysis, similar to the two-tier test. The principal advantage of the VlsE peptide ELISA is that it requires only one test rather than four tests. However, the specificity of the VlsE test may not be as high as that of the two-tier test."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative organism of Lyme borreliosis, is a heterogeneous group of spirochetes, consisting of at least three pathogenic species. To test the hypothesis that the genetic heterogeneity is the reason for the clinical differences, we investigated whether the experimental disease induced by European isolates is different from that induced by American isolates. Two American isolates of species B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were compared with three European isolates, two of species B. garinii, and one of species B. afzelii. The patterns of infection, immunity, and inflammation induced by the different species was distinctive. Inflammatory cells and levels of antibody in B. garinii- and B. afzelii-infected animals were lower than in B. burgdorferi s.s.-infected animals, whereas levels of spirochetal infection in the skin and nervous system were higher in the former group of animals. These data demonstrate that B. burgdorferi s.s. strains are more infective and inflammatory, whereas B. garinii and B. afzelii strains can survive the adaptive immune response to a greater degree and persist at greater numbers in the skin and nervous system. The results explain to a large extent the disparities between LNB in humans in the United States and Europe."

A majority (68%) of the supplied I. ricinus ticks were nymphs, 25% were females and 7% were larvae. Overall, 20% of 74 examined females and 9% of 203 examined nymphs (but none of 21 examined larvae) were infected with borreliae.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-transmitted disease caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The bacterium adopts different strategies for its survival inside the immunocompetent host from the time of infection until dissemination in different parts of body tissues. The success of this spirochete depends on its ability to colonise the host tissues and counteract the host's defence mechanisms. During this process borrelia seems to maintain its vitality to ensure long-term survival in the host. Borrelia's proteins are encoded by plasmid and chromosomal genes. These genes are differentially regulated and expressed by different environmental factors in ticks as well as in the mammalian host during infection. In addition, antigenic diversity enables the spirochete to escape host defence mechanisms and maintain infection. In this review we focus on the differential expression of proteins and genes, and further molecular mechanisms used by borrelia to maintain its survival in the host. In light of these pathogenetic mechanisms, further studies on spirochete host interaction are needed to understand the complex interplay that finally lead to host autoimmunity."

We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of clinicians to assess the use and appropriateness of Lyme disease serologic tests (LDSTs). LDSTs performed at 2 large Wisconsin reference laboratories were systematically sampled for 12 consecutive months. A standardized questionnaire was used to gather data about the submitting clinician and the patient tested. Tests were categorized as appropriate, inappropriate, or discretionary, and associations were assessed using logistic regression analysis. A test was defined as inappropriate if the patient was asymptomatic, had erythema migrans, or was treated empirically, or if the test was ordered as a test of cure. We surveyed 303 clinicians regarding 356 LDSTs: 72 tests (20%) were appropriate, 95 (27%) were inappropriate, and 189 (53%) were discretionary. Tests were more likely to be inappropriate if they were ordered by an emergency or urgent care physician compared with other specialists (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 5.2, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-20.6), or if preceded by a known tick bite (AOR 6.8, 95% CI, 2.6-17.6). The patient rather than the clinician requested 26% of tests, which were more likely to be inappropriate than clinician-requested tests (crude odds ratio [COR] 5.8, 95% CI, 2.5-13.6). Tests were more likely to be patient-requested if they were ordered by an internist (AOR 2.6, 95% CI, 1.4-4.8) or if the patient was > or =40 years old (AOR 2.2, 95% CI, 1.3-3.9). Many LDSTs are ordered inappropriately, often influenced by patient demand. Education of clinicians and patients about testing indications and contraindications is needed to reduce the number of inappropriate LDSTs."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, is an extracellular microbe that causes persistent infection despite the development of strong immune responses against the bacterium. B. burgdorferi expresses several ligand-binding lipoproteins, including the decorin-binding proteins (Dbps) A and B, which may mediate attachment to decorin, a major component of the host extracellular matrix during murine infection. We show that B. burgdorferi was better protected in the joints and skin, two tissues with a higher decorin expression, than in the urinary bladder and heart, two tissues with a lower decorin expression, during chronic infection of wild-type mice. Targeted disruption of decorin alone completely abolished the protective niche in chronically infected decorin-deficient mice but did not affect the spirochete burden during early infection. The nature of protection appeared to be specific because the spirochetes with higher outer surface protein C expression were not protected while the protective niche seemed to favor the spirochetes with a higher dbpA expression during chronic infection. These data suggest that spirochetal DbpA may interact with host decorin during infection and such interactions could be a mechanism that B. burgdorferi uses to evade humoral immunity and establish chronic infection."

The causative spirochetes of Lyme disease often similarly co-exist in ticks.

Physicians practicing throughout Pennsylvania have identified patients with symptomatic babesiosis, but without governmental surveillance or health registries that require doctors to consider and report babesiosis, these cases have not prompted epidemiological concern.

In order to determine whether transmission by tick bite would alter the dissemination dynamics and disease produced by distinct genotypes, disseminated isolates (RST1), nondisseminated isolates (RST3), and a standard laboratory strain (B-31) were established in a murine cycle utilizing infections transmitted by ticks. B-31 spirochetes circulated in the blood of inbred C3H/HeJ mice longer than in the blood of outbred mice. The majority of C3H mice exposed to RST1-infected ticks contained cultivable spirochetes in their blood for up to 17 days; in contrast, mice exposed to RST3 isolates demonstrated a precipitous decline in infection after day 7 postexposure. A quantitative PCR (q-PCR) assay demonstrated that the densities of spirochetes in blood were similar for the RST1 and RST3 isolates, except during the 2nd week postexposure, when the RST1 isolates displayed a markedly higher density in blood. Spirochete load in the heart and bladder of infected mice was measured by q-PCR at 8 weeks postexposure; the numbers of spirochetes in these tissues were similar for mice infected with either disseminated or nondisseminated strains. Similarly, histopathology samples of heart, bladder, and joint tissue obtained at 8 weeks postexposure did not reveal greater pathology in mice infected with the disseminated isolates. We conclude that although the spirochetemia induced by tick-transmitted disseminated isolates was more intense and of longer duration than that induced by nondisseminated isolates, the resultant pathologies produced by these strains were ultimately similar."

Maximal numbers were found at day 11, while spirochete numbers decreased by more than 30-fold by day 21. The antigenic composition of HAB in skin biopsy samples was determined by use of a procedure termed hydrophobic antigen tissue Triton extraction. Immune sera from rabbits, sera from chronically infected mice, and monospecific antiserum to the antigenic variation protein, VlsE, were used to probe parallel two-dimensional immunoblots representing each time point. Individual proteins were identified using either specific antisera or by matching protein spots to mass spectrometry-identified protein spots from in vitro-cultivated Borrelia. There were significant changes in the relative expression of a variety of known and previously unrecognized HAB antigens during the 21-day period. OspC and the outer membrane proteins OspA and OspB were prominent at the earliest time point, day 5, when the antigenic variation protein VlsE was barely detected. OspA and OspB were not detected after day 5. OspC was not detected after day 9. VlsE was the most prominent antigen from day 7 through day 21. BmpA, ErpN, ErpP, LA7, OppA-2, DbpA, and an unidentified 15-kDa protein were also detected from day 7 through day 21. Immunoblot analysis using monospecific anti-VlsE revealed the presence of prominent distinct VlsE lower forms in HAB at days 9, 11, and 14; however, these lower forms were no longer detected at day 21. This marked diminution in VlsE lower forms paralleled the clearance of the spirochete from skin."

Neutrophils were marginalized in blood vessels at the site of infection but could not enter the joint tissue. In the present study, we treated both genetically arthritis-resistant DBA/2J (DBA) and arthritis-susceptible C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice with the neutrophil-depleting monoclonal antibody RB6-8C5 (RB6) to determine the effect on arthritis development. Surprisingly, both DBA and C3H mice treated with RB6 developed arthritis at 1 week postinfection, approximately 1 week earlier than the control-treated C3H mice. The early development of arthritis in the RB6-treated mice was accompanied by an influx into the joints of cells with ring-shaped polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) cell morphology that were negative for the Gr-1 neutrophil maturation marker. RB6 treatment of mice also resulted in increased numbers of B. burgdorferi cells in the joints at 7 days postinfection and earlier expression of the chemokines KC and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 in the joints compared to control-treated animals. Together, these results suggest that recruitment of neutrophils or PMN-like cells into an infected joint is a key requirement for Lyme arthritis development and that altered recruitment of these cells into the joints of arthritis-resistant mice can exacerbate the development of pathology."

A survey was conducted in all the national health examination centers in Alsace using a self-applied questionnaire. The data collected concerned the socio-demographical characteristics, knowledge on the disease, history of tick bites, fear the disease creates, frequency of visits to the forest, prevention habits when visiting the forest and the attitude adopted in the case of a tick bite. Out of the 600 persons included, 99 (16.5 p.cent) had been bitten by ticks once or more over the past year. The existence of Lyme's disease was known to 74 p.cent of the consultants, 63 p.cent claimed they were worried by the disease and 43 p.cent knew that the first manifestation is redness spreading over the skin. Twenty-seven percent wore trousers and long sleeves when visiting the forest and 19 p.cent inspected their body carefully on their return. The persons least well informed were also those who did little to protect themselves against tick bites. They often were under 30 years old, lived in urban settings and had few diplomas. Those who had frequent spare time in forest and those who had a history of tick bites were the best informed and protected themselves better. The fear of the disease was associated with better knowledge and more appropriate behaviour. This study shows that a large percent of the population in Alsace is exposed to tick bites. Tick bite borreliosis is relatively well known, but protection remains insufficient. Better knowledge of the disease is related to better prevention. Information and teaching campaigns for the general public could specifically target the young people, urban dwellers and those with few diplomas. Specific messages of prevention could be delivered to the most exposed at-risk subjects (i.e. those bitten by ticks or having leisure in forest) at the places of their leisure or medical consultations."

		"abstract": "Post-licensure experience with a new intranasal inactivated influenza vaccine in Switzerland recently identified an increased risk for Bell's palsy. We reviewed reports in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) to assess if parenteral inactivated influenza vaccines (influenza vaccines) may also increase the risk for Bell's palsy. Reports of Bell's palsy after influenza vaccines in VAERS from 1/1/1991 to 12/31/2001 were identified by searching the Coding Symbols for Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms (COSTART) for 'paralysis facial' and by text string search in the automated database. The text descriptions on each report were reviewed to verify the diagnosis. The proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was calculated to aid signal detection. We found a total of 197 reports of Bell's palsy after receipt of influenza vaccines. The diagnosis was verified for 154 (78.2%), of which 145 (94.2%) had received influenza vaccines alone. The verified reports were submitted from 35 states; 58% of the reports involved persons living in states where the risk of Lyme disease, which can also cause facial paralysis, was low, minimal or none. The PRRs in all age groups exceeded the criteria for a signal of possible association. The highest PRR was 3.91 in the > or = 65 years age group. Our findings revealed a signal of possible association between influenza vaccines and an increased risk of Bell's palsy. A population-based controlled study is needed to determine whether this association could be causal and to quantify the risk."

Gut samples from the same individual ticks were removed and analyzed at weekly intervals. Multiple analyses were conducted on each gut sample (e.g., total protein concentration, presence of viable B. burgdorferi spirochetes, and concentration of outer surface protein A [OspA]). Female I. scapularis survived for up to 25 d after gut sampling. Seventy-five percent of females oviposited after the sampling procedure, with 14% of ticks laying >1,500 eggs. No significant differences in either fecundity or length of survival were found between B. burgdorferi-infected and uninfected I. scapularis. This technique will enable longitudinal studies on both tick-pathogen interactions and physiological studies that have hitherto not been attempted."

Introduced to the island in 1955, white-tailed deer, Odocoileus virginianus Zimmerman, reached a density of approximately 37/km2 by the mid-1990s. Black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis Say, first noticed in the late 1980s, flourished thereafter. Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus Berkenhout) on Monhegan are highly infected with Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmidt, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner, the agent of Lyme disease. By 1996, 13% of year-round residents had contracted the disease. The community's subsequent decision to eliminate deer from the island provided a unique opportunity to monitor the abundance of vector ticks in response to the complete and permanent removal of the primary hosts of their reproductive stage. With the exception of humans and their dogs and cats, there are no other potential hosts for adult I. scapularis on Monhegan. From November 1996 to March 1999, all deer were removed from the island. Previous annual fall flagging of vegetation from 1990 to 1998 produced 6-17 adult ticks/h, of which 24-41% were infected with the Lyme disease spirochete. During this same period, up to 18 larvae and 4 nymphs were removed per Norway rat live-trapped on the island each July. With the absence of deer in the fall of 1999, both the density of host-seeking adult ticks and infection prevalence rose substantially to 28/h and 75.0%, respectively. By the summer of 2003, however, no sub-adult ticks were found on rats, and that fall, only 0.67 adult ticks/h were flagged. Of the 68 adults collected from 2002 to 2003, 20 (29.4%) were infected. Over this same period, adult tick abundance on a deer-populated, reference island continued to gradually increase."

		"abstract": "The tick Ixodes ricinus has been recorded in most Italian regions especially in thermo-mesophilous woods and shrubby habitats where the relative humidity allow the tick to complete its 3 year developmental cycle, as predicted for the European climatic ranges. This tick acts both as vector and reservoir for a series of wildlife zoonotic pathogens, especially the agents of Lyme diseases, Tick borne encephalitis and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis, which are emerging in most of Europe. To assess the spatial distribution of these pathogens and the infection risk for humans and animals within the territory of the Province of Trento, we carried out a long term study using a combination of eco-epidemiological surveys and mathematical modelling. An extensive tick collection with a GIS based habitat suitability analysis allowed us to identify the areas where tick occurs at various density. To identify the areas with higher infection risk, we estimated the values of R0 for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., TBE virus and Anaplasma phagocytophila under different ecological conditions. We assessed the infection prevalence in the vector and in the wildlife reservoir species that play a central role in the persistence of these infections, ie the small mammals A. flavicollis and C. glareolus. We also considered the double effect of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) which act as reservoir for A. phagocytophila but is an incompetent host for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus, thus reducing the infection prevalence in ticks of these last two pathogens. Infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophila in the vector was assessed by PCR screening 1212 I. ricinus nymphs collected by dragging in six main study areas during 2002. The mean infection prevalence recorded was 1.32% for B. burgdorferi s.l. and 9.84% for A. phagocytophila. Infection prevalence in nymphs with TBE virus, as assessed in a previous study was 0.03%. Infection prevalence in rodents was assessed by screening (with ELISA and PCR) tissues and blood samples collected from 367 rodent individuals trapped extensively during 2002 within 6 main study areas. A. flavicollis (N=238) was found to be infected with all three pathogens investigated, with infection prevalence ranging from 3.3% for TBE virus to 11.7% for A. phagocytophila, and 16.6% with B. burgdorferi s.l. C. glareolus (N=108) showed an infection prevalence of 6.5% with A. phagocytophila and 12.7% with B. burgdorferi s.l., while no individuals were infected with TBE virus. We also screened 98 spleen samples collected from roe deer with PCR, resulting in a mean prevalence of infection with A. phagocytophila of 19.8%. Using a deterministic model we explored the condition for diseases persistence under different rodent and roe deer densities. R0 values resulted largely above 1 for B. burgdorferi s.l. in the vast majority of the areas classified as suitable for I. ricinus occurrence in Trentino, while the condition for TBE persistence appeared to be more restricted by a combination of climatic condition and host densities."

		"abstract": "The match between ticks and pediatricians in Italy is usually a seasonal event related to the spring and summer trips and to the increasing of outdoor activity that sun and warm weather allow, both for children and ticks. So cared parents reach emergencies asking for tick removal but more often after the tick has yet been removed by empirical manoeuvres and after the killing and the destruction of the \"enemy\". We have scheduled, in the years 2002-2003, the 167 children that reached our unit for a tick bite; they where 92 males (mean age four years) and 75 females (mean age five years). Two of them had only a questionable tick bite but one had erythema on the lateral side of the left ankle, fever of obscure origin and weakness with generalised malaise. She was six years old and she lived with a dog on which, in more instances, ticks where found, but she never noticed ticks on her body. The dog had positive levels of anti rickettsial and anti borrelia antibodies but no evidence of conclamate illness. In this girl we found high titers of anti borrelia antibodies that WB testing confirmed to be anti B. burgdoferi. We diagnosed Lyme disease and treated the girl with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/day) for three weeks achieving the complete relief of symptomatology till today. Three children with conclamate tick bite had positive levels of anti Rickettsia conorii antibodies with increasing levels at a twenty days control; two (aged four and five years) of them had a full symptomatology (tache noire, satellite lymphadenopathy, fever, and maculopapular erythema) for Meditarranean spotted fever; the latter (three years old) had an atypical form with the complete absence of maculopapular erythema. The therapy was clarithromycin (15 mg/kg/day) for three weeks. In Campania, in the years 2002/2003 on 167 children with tick bite that reached our unit, we found only four pathological correlable events; so are our ticks not infected? But we don't know how many children where tick bited and if there were other children with Lyme disease or Rickettsial disease because of the lack of a pediatric reference centre for \"tick bite diseases\" and the incomplete and late diffusion of knowledge on these diseases. Other Italian regions and such as Trentino Alto Adige, Veneto, and Friuli Venezia Giulia had a remarkable officially notified number of cases of Lyme disease and in Sicilia, Sardegna and Lazio there were numerous officially notified Rickettsial diseases. So we hope that Campania may be an happy island but we also think that a more effective cooperation between pediatricians and veterinarians and the creation of regional reference centres for tick bite diseases may arise a surveillance net to prevent the diffusion of these world wide emerging diseases and so that parents can achieve an univoque and useful information, the only way to defeat the fear of ignorance."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne zoonotic infections are among the most diffuse vector borne diseases: these large group of infections is caused by different microorganisms: Babesia spp., Borrelia spp., Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia spp., Francisella tularensis, Coxiella burnetii) and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Babesiosis is caused by the protozoa (sporozoa) Babesia microti and it is quite rare in humans in Europe. The ixodids ticks are the competent vectors. A few symptomatic cases have been reported, mainly in splenectomized patients. The laboratory diagnosis is made by the microscopic identification of the parasites within the red blood cells in blood smears. The serologic diagnosis, based mainly upon IFA and WB techniques has only an epidemiological interest. Lyme borreliosis (Lyme disease) has been recognized as the most frequent vector borne disease in mild climate areas. The etiologic agent is a spirochete, belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. afzelii. Several additional species of this geno-complex have been identified but their pathogenic capability for humans still needs to be elucidated. Lyme borreliosis is clinically divided into three different clinical stages: the early disease, the disseminated infection and the persistent infection. Individual stages are caused by the diffusion of the spirochetes to different anatomic districts of the body. The main clinical symptoms are, for each stage: the erythema chronicum migrans in the early infection, the peripheral nerves and joint involvement in disseminated diseases and the acrodermatitis chronica atrophica (ACA) with central nervous system involvement in the late disseminated infection. The microbiological diagnosis is achieved by serologic techniques (IFA, EIA, WB) and by isolation of the spirochetes (in vitro culture and DNA amplification methods). Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is occasionally transmitted to humans by the soft ticks Ornithodorus and is caused by Borrelia spp. Different borreliae are responsible for TBRF in various geographic areas. The laboratory diagnosis is based upon the identification of spirochetes in peripheral blood by microscopic observation of Giemsa stained smears. Rickettsiosis diseases are caused worldwide by the obligate intracellular bacteria belonging to the genus Rickettsia. In the Mediterranean area the most frequently identified rickettsia is R. conorii, that causes the so called Mediterranean spotted fever. The serologic detection of a specific antibody response by IFA techniques is the most prominent tool for the diagnosis. In addition, the PCR method can be applied. Bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia are well known pathogens in veterinary medicine. Since the last decade their zoonotic capability has emerged and E. chafeensis, E. canis and the so called human granulocytic agent (HGE) have been identified in human diseases following a tick bite. The ehrlichiosis is characterized, in human, by a mild fever associated with lymphoadenopathy. The diagnosis is made on the identification of morulae (the intracytoplasmatic inclusion of the growing rickettsiae) in the white cells of peripheral blood. In addition the molecular diagnosis is also possible by PCR. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is the only viral arthropod-borne encephalitis in Europe: it is caused by a flavivirus and it can also be transmitted by the ingestion of goat raw milk. The more relevant epidemiological figure is limited to the Alps, in particular to the Northern side (Austria). Isolated cases have been reported also in Italy. TBE is a benign self-limiting illness that usually recovers without any reliquate. The laboratory diagnosis is obtained by isolating the virus in cell cultures from the CSF or blood of acute phase patients. Serology is anyway the main laboratory tool to perform this diagnosis. Complement fixation and EIA IgM are the most used methods: the latter technique is particularly sensitive in early infection."

Analysis using secondary structure prediction programs suggested that BBK32 is composed of two domains, an N-terminal segment lacking well defined secondary structure and a C-terminal segment composed largely of alpha-helices. Analysis of purified recombinant forms of the two domains by circular dichroism spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and intrinsic viscosity determination were consistent with an N-terminal-extended, unstructured segment and a C-terminal globular domain in BBK32. Solid phase binding experiments suggest that the unstructured N-terminal domain binds fibronectin. Analysis of changes in circular dichroism spectra of the N-terminal segment of BBK32 upon binding of the N-terminal domain of fibronectin revealed an increase in beta-sheet content in the complex. Hence, BBK32, which belongs to a different family of proteins and shows no overall sequence similarity with the fibronectin binding MSCRAMMs (microbial surface components recognizing adhesive matrix molecules) of Gram-positive bacteria, binds fibronectin by a mechanism that is reminiscent of the \"tandem beta-zipper\" previously demonstrated for the fibronectin binding of streptococcal adhesins."

Qualitative community model analysis may provide a meaningful alternative to standard population-based models of vector-borne disease.

Using this procedure, we can hypothesize changes in risk of vector-borne disease from disturbances, such as control measures, habitat alteration, or global warming. We demonstrate the application of this procedure to an oak forest community to predict the risk of Lyme disease. Our predictions of Lyme disease risk in an oak forest community confirm reports of positive associations between deer abundance and risk of disease and are consistent with published observations."

She showed peripheral blood eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia as well as a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. An IgM antibody against Borrelia afzelii was positive. MRI of the skeletal muscles demonstrated enhancing fascia around the biceps brachii muscle, and a biopsy specimen revealed perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells within the hypertrophic fascia.

During a follow-up period of six months the patient revealed no signs of persistent borreliosis. Multilocular erythema migrans is a possible manifestation of borreliosis and is classified as disseminated early infection which is frequently associated with systemic reactions, including malaise, arthritis, carditis, headache and even meningeal signs. Treatment is based on antibiotics, which should preferably be given intravenously in case of systemic signs."

		"abstract": "The aim of this study was to define the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis after a tick bite. A survey was conducted from 1993 to 1995 in the western part of Switzerland in a group of patients who presented for treatment of a recent tick bite. Only patients with negative serological tests (enzyme-linked fluorescent assay screening test, and IgG and IgM immunoblots) at the first consultation and for whom a second blood sample was available 2 months later were included in the study. Of the 376 patients included, 266 had no clinical manifestation (group 1) and 110 had a small local cutaneous reaction (<2 cm) (group 2). The tick was available for 160 patients. Seroconversion was observed in 4.5% of 376 patients, 3.4% in group 1 and 7.2% in group 2. Typical erythema migrans, confirmed by seroconversion, was observed in three of 376 (0.8%) patients, while five of 376 (1.3%) patients developed a skin lesion without seroconversion. No other clinical manifestation of Lyme borreliosis was observed among these 376 patients. Borrelia detection in ticks did not correlate significantly with the risk of Lyme borreliosis. In conclusion, the risk of developing Lyme borreliosis in western Switzerland after a tick bite is low, and therefore, prophylactic antibiotics are not required."

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 1292 patients with neurological diseases was studied by IEF. After a follow-up of 2-36 months, we only included patients with a definite MS or confirmed diagnosis of other neurological diseases (OND). MS was diagnosed in 407 patients and OND in 593 patients. For patients in whom three or more oligoclonal bands (OCB) were detected, IEF results showed a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 92% for the diagnosis of MS. The positive and negative predictive values were 86.5 and 90%, respectively. Inflammatory and infectious disorders of the central nervous system represented the main affections associated with OCB, including human immunodeficiency virus encephalitis, Lyme disease and less frequently Sjogren syndrome. Furthermore, when OCB were observed, 10 or more bands were more frequently found in MS than in OND (P < 0.0001). IEF of the CSF is a reliable method for the diagnosis of MS. The absolute number of bands may help to discriminate between MS and OND."

In the western U.S., tick vectors and mammalian hosts for B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum are distinct from those in the eastern U.S. and considerably more variable. Spatial complexity, local extinctions, and low levels of movement among foci may determine the distribution and prevalence of these agents. High-prevalence A. phagocytophilum patches may be transient, possibly as host individuals become immune. Thus, A. phagocytophilum in California could exist in a metapopulation of interacting patches. Local dynamics are sensitive to host population sizes and minimum tick infestation levels. Determining critical values for these key factors and their interactions will be important for predicting the level and distribution of future infections in the western U.S."

MyD88-deficient mice harbored extremely high levels of B. burgdorferi in tissues when compared with wild-type littermates and greater amounts of spirochetes in tissues than TLR2-deficient mice. These findings suggest that, in addition to TLR2, other MyD88-dependent pathways play a significant role in the host defense to B. burgdorferi. MyD88(-/-) mice maintained the ability to produce Abs directed against B. burgdorferi. Partial clearance of spirochetes was evident in long term infection studies and immune sera from MyD88-deficient mice were able to protect naive mice from infection with B. burgdorferi. Thus, the acquired immune response appeared to be functional in MyD88(-/-) mice, and the inability to control spirochete numbers was due to a failure of cells involved in innate defenses. Although macrophages from MyD88(-/-) mice responded poorly to Borrelia sonicate in vitro, MyD88(-/-) mice still developed an inflammatory arthritis after infection with B. burgdorferi characterized by an influx of neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The findings presented here point to a dichotomy between the recruitment of inflammatory cells to tissue and an inability of these cells to kill localized spirochetes."

Purified fusion protein yields were 1.9, 1.7 and 5.3 mg/l of cell culture for GST-rTp47, GST-rTp17 and GST-rTp15, respectively. The identities of the antigens obtained were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing using ABI Prism 310 and peptide mapping by Finningan LC/MS. These recombinant antigens were evaluated by immuno-slot blot techniques applied to 137 serum samples from patients with a clinical and laboratory diagnosis of syphilis (61 samples), from healthy blood donors (50 samples), individuals with sexually transmitted disease other than syphilis (3 samples), and from individuals with other spirochetal diseases such as Lyme disease (20 samples) and leptospirosis (3 samples). The assay had sensitivity of 95.1% (95% CI, 86.1 to 98.7%) and a specificity of 94.7% (95% CI, 87.0 to 98.7%); a stronger reactivity was observed with fraction rTp17.

Six (12) months after the antibiotic treatment, about 93% (95%) of the patients with acute neuroborreliosis and 20% (66%) of the patients with chronic neuroborreliosis were cured. One year after treatment, four patients with acute neuroborreliosis still suffered from facial palsy and five with chronic neuroborreliosis still had moderate spastic ataxic gait disturbance.

Outer surface proteins (OSPs) from B burgdorferi were used in a rat model of antigen-induced allergic arthritis. Intraarticular challenge with recombinant OspA, OspB, and OspC in nonlipidated (peptide) and lipidated forms was performed in the left knee joint; the contralateral joint received buffer as control. Inflammation was monitored by technetium scintigraphy and histology. Nonlipidated (peptide) OspA, OspB, and OspC did not induce arthritis; the only exception was polymerized OspA, which was tested in preimmunized rats. Lipidated OspA from 2 different strains and lipidated OspC induced severe arthritis, whereas lipidated OspB failed to induce injury. A synthetic analog of the OSP lipid modification, lipopeptide Pam(3)Cys-Ser-Lys(4)-OH, either alone or coupled to bovine serum albumin, also failed to induce injury. Injury did not develop in control groups that were given the appropriate buffers or lipopolysaccharide. This showed that lipidated borrelial OSPs can be potent arthritogens but vary greatly with respect to their injury-inducing potential. The possession of a lipid modification is essential but is not sufficient to render an OSP arthritogenic. This is the first study to demonstrate that individual lipoproteins from B burgdorferi can induce experimental joint injury in vivo. These results may help elucidate the pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis and, above all, underline the importance of bacterial lipoproteins as major virulence factors."

In this patient population no correlation was found between a decline of C(6) antibody titer of any magnitude and treatment or clinical outcome. Antibodies to C(6) persisted in these patients with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome following treatment, albeit at a markedly lower prevalence and titer than in untreated patients with acute disseminated Lyme disease.

		"abstract": "In the literature, there are case reports suggesting that Borrelia burgdorferi infection may induce autoimmune diseases dependent on antinuclear antibodies (ANA). The present study was undertaken in order to verify this possibility in a prospective manner. The study group comprised 78 consecutive patients (51 women and 27 men, median age 41.5 years) referred to our Department for the serologic diagnosis of Borrelia infection. The patients' sera were tested for Borrelia-specific IgM and IgG (Recombinant Antigen Enzyme Immunoassays, Biomedica). Antibodies against Borrelia were detected in 31 (39.7 %) persons. 15 persons (19.2 %) had positive IgM, another 15 (19.2 %)--positive IgG, and 1 person (3.2 %)--both IgM and IgG. Frequent positivity of IgM antibodies suggests that persons in the early phase of infection prevailed in the group. Tests for anti-dsDNA, anti-RNP, anti-Sm antibodies, and a screening test for systemic rheumatic diseases (ANA Rheuma Screen) were carried out using Varelisa Enzyme Immunoassays (Pharmacia and Upjohn). The spectrum of autoimmune diseases covered by these tests included SLE, MCTD, Sjogren's syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. ANA were detected in 15 persons (19.2 %): anti-dsDNA in 7 (9.0 %), anti-RNP in 1 (1.3 %), anti-Sm in 2 (2.6 %), and ANA Rheuma Screen was positive in 6 persons (7.7 %). Statistical analysis of differences in the ANA frequency between Borrelia-positive and -negative groups was carried out using Fisher's exact chi-square test (both without and with gender and age matching). No significant differences were found between the groups. Based on the above results, we conclude that there is no increase in the frequency of antinuclear antibodies in the early phase of Borrelia infection."

The study covered 215 ticks (193 nymphs and 22 adults) and 947 mosquitoes female of the genus Aedes. Spirochetes of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were detected in the arthropods studied with the method of indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Positive readings of the immunological reaction were stated in 17.7 % of the collected nymphs and adult forms of Ixodes ricinus, and in 0.8 % of mosquito females of the genus Aedes. The number of B. burgdorferi observed in a view field (400 x) of microscopic preparations of all infected mosquitoes and about 10 % of the infected ticks, ranged from 1-10. This number in 50 % of the nymphs was from 11-50 spirochetes. View fields of the preparations of the other 50 % of nymphs and adult forms featured more then 50 spirochetes. The observed low values of the prevalence and infection intensity of female mosquitoes Aedes spp. compared to ticks suggest that the former do not pose a serious epidemiological threat in the spreading of Lyme disease."

Forty one (9.1 %) sera of the study group and one serum (2 %) of the control group were positive using indirect fluorescence assay (IFA). The seropositivity tended to be more frequent among males (10.3 %) than females (7.6 %) and among the rural (10.3 %) than urban population (7.5 %); however, differences were of no statistical significance (p = 0.4). No age difference was found between the seropositive and the seronegative individuals (p = 0.77). The only factor increasing the risk of HA seropositivity found was forestry employment (p < 0.05). Additionally, a total of 559 Ixodes ricinus ticks, collected in the same area as sera, were investigated for the presence of A. phagocytophilum by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 41 (8.7 %) of them were found to be positive. The infection level ranged from 2.3-13.7 %, depending on the area studied. Bacteria were significantly less frequently detected in nymphs - 2.1 % (5/235) than in adult ticks - 13.6 % (44/324) and in males--4.2 % (74/165) than in females--23.3 % (37/159) (p < or = 0.05). The obtained results confirm both the occurrence of HA foci in north-eastern Poland with I. ricinus as the principal vector of the A. phagocytophilum infection, and forestry workers as the main group at risk."

In the United States, Lyme disease has occurred most frequently in the northeastern United States. Positive correlations between the number of cases of Lyme disease reported in the northeastern United States during the 1992-2002 period indicate that late spring/early summer precipitation was a significant climate factor affecting the occurrence of Lyme disease. When late spring/early summer precipitation was greater than average, the occurrence of Lyme disease was above average, possibly due to increased tick activity and survival rate during wet conditions. Temperature did not seem to explain the variability in Lyme disease reports for the northeastern United States."

Numbers of ticks submitted were highly correlated with human cases by county (r = 0.998, n = 5 counties) and by town (r = 0.916, n = 37 towns), as were the numbers of positive ticks submitted (r = 0.989 by county, r = 0.787 by town). Human cases were correlated with ticks submitted by town each year, and with positive ticks in all but 2 years. Thus, passive tick surveillance effectively assessed geographical risk of human Lyme disease. In contrast, tick submissions through time were not correlated with human cases from year to year. Dog seropositivity was significantly correlated with human cases by county in both years tested, but by town in only one of two years. Numbers of ticks submitted were correlated with dog seropositivity by county but not by town, apparently because of high variability among towns with small sample sizes. Our results suggest that passive tick surveillance, using ticks submitted by the public for Lyme spirochete testing, can be used to assess the geographical distribution of Lyme disease risk, but cannot reliably predict Lyme incidence from year to year."

Although Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) due to Rickettsia conorii was thought for a long time to be the only tick-borne rickettsial disease prevalent in Europe, five more spotted fever rickettsiae have been described as emerging pathogens in the last decade. Further, cases of infection due to Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of human anaplasmosis (previously known as human granulocytic ehrlichiosis), have been reported throughout Europe. We present here these emerging diseases and discuss other potential threat for the future."

A recent meeting at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology (Imperial College, London) brought together representatives from several European centres of excellence, to discuss research funded by the EU Framework 5 Quality of Life Programme. This research network combines gene and protein expression profiling with different animal models of RA to identify cells, genes and pathways contributing to arthritis initiation, progression and chronicity. The studies discussed highlight the reality that collaboration between different research groups is the basis of groundbreaking research and, it is hoped, eventual new therapies for RA."

The most frequent infectious disease as in the previous years was influenza. 228.055 cases were reported (596.5/100,000). Number of foodborne infections and intoxications remains high--26.734 cases (69.0/100,000). 77% of them were caused by Salmonella. In this high number of foodborne infections in 4,492 (16.8%) etiologic factor was not found. In this number Campylobacter infections, rarely tested in Poland may be found. Especially alarming is number of cases of diarrhea among children 0-2. Age adjusted incidence of 2.464/100,000 is the highest occurrence among infectious diseases in Poland. There was noted decrease of incidence of newly diagnosed cases of viral hepatitis B (5.3/100,000) which dropped to the level of the incidence of viral hepatitis C (5.17/100,000). Hepatitis A remains at the low level (0.9/100,000). Level of newly diagnosed cases of AIDS (113 cases, 0.3/100,000) remains relatively stable for last few years. The major problem is decreasing reporting of possible risk factors. Infectious diseases caused 0.74% of deaths. Mortality from infectious diseases was 6.9/100,000 and was significantly higher among men (8.9) then among women. (5.1). In the age groups 35-64 it was 3-4 times higher. In urban settings mortality from infectious diseases was higher (7.2/100,000) then in the country (6.6). In particular districts (voivodeships) mortality indices remained in the range of 4.3 (opolskie) to 11.4 (ślaskie). As in previous years, the highest number of deaths was caused by tuberculosis and its late sequels (35.4%). Attention should be given to the increased number of deaths due to sepsis (33.6%, without neonatal sepsis)."

We undertook to study the inheritance of five microsatellite loci in the European Lyme disease vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus. Only two loci appeared fully Mendelian while the three others displayed non-Mendelian patterns that highly frequent null alleles could not fully explain. At one locus, IR27, some phenomenon seems to hinder the PCR amplification of one allele, depending on its origin (maternal imprinting) and/or its size (short allele dominance). DNA methylation, which appeared to be a possible explanation of this amplification bias, was rejected by a specific test comparing the amplification efficiency that did not differ between unmethylated and experimentally methylated DNA. The role of allele size in heterozygous individuals was then revealed from the data available on field collected ticks and consistent with the results of a theoretical approach. These observations highlight the need for prudence while inferring reproductive systems (selfing rates), parentage or even allelic frequencies from microsatellite markers, in particular for parasitic organisms for which molecular approaches often represent the only way for population biology inferences."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis in humans is an inflammatory disease affecting multiple organ systems, including the nervous system, cardiovascular system, joints and muscles. The causative agent, the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, is transmitted to the host by a tick bite. The pathogenesis of the disease in its early stages is associated largely with the presence of viable bacteria at the site of inflammation, whereas in the later stages of disease, autoimmune features seem to contribute significantly. In addition, it has been suggested that chronic persistence of B. burgdorferi in affected tissues is of pathogenic relevance. Long-term exposure of the host immune system to spirochaetes and/or borrelial compounds may induce chronic autoimmune disease. The study of bacterium-host interactions has revealed a variety of proinflammatory and also immunomodulatory-immunosuppressive features caused by the pathogen. Therapeutic strategies using antibiotics are generally successful, but chronic disease may require immunosuppressive treatment. Effective and safe vaccines using recombinant outer surface protein A have been developed, but have not been propagated because of fears that autoimmunity might be induced. Nevertheless, new insights into the modes of transmission of B. burgdorferi to the warm-blooded host have been generated by studying the action of these vaccines."

In order to investigate the presence of the specific agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, in the early stages of the disease, DNA from skin biopsies, urine and peripheral blood of 30 patients with clinically documented erythema migrans and without apparent systemic involvement was analysed by polymerase chain reaction. Borrelia DNA in both blood and skin biopsies was detected in 23 patients, while in 9 patients it was discovered in urine and skin biopsies.

This fact is due to many different factors including climate changes. However, across Europe many other human pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and parasites are found in ticks. This article gives an overview of tick-borne human pathogenic viruses present in Europe as well as those considered nonpathogenic. It also deals with the various species of vector-competent ticks. Among these ticks, viruses from 6 families encompassing 8 genera and 35 species are found,whereby the families Flaviviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Reoviridae with the genera flavivirus, nairovirus, and orbivirus are the most prevalent. Because of their special importance Omsk hemorrhagic fever, louping-ill disease, tick-borne encephalitis, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever are discussed in detail. Although West Nile virus is mainly transmitted to man by mosquitoes, it is discussed in detail, because West Nile fever has become a good example for a new and rapidly spreading vector-borne disease in the USA and for a recurrent one in Europe. Secondly, besides the mosquito-bird cycle an interesting tick--bird cycle is emerging. The overview clearly demonstrates that in Europe (particularly in Germany) tick-borne viruses, with the exception of TBE, constitute an extremely ignored research subject. This lack of attention is in contrast to their importance and results in a lack of necessary scientific data."

Tick-borne zoonotic babesiae are parasites whose veterinary importance has been known for the last 100 years but whose relevance for human medicine only became evident in 1957. The fact that multiple and mixed infections caused by ticks are possible has been known for years. Taking into account such a high prevalence of the infectious agents in ticks, such multiple infections were to be expected. During the last few years it has become evident that double and multiple infections of humans caused by tick bites occur far more frequently than has been known so far. As a result, in cases of unclear anamnesis,new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches should be taken. In general one can say that considerable additional scientific research is necessary to effectively reduce the incidence of tick-borne diseases."

Extensive in vitro studies indicate that ospB shares a common promoter with ospA and thus these two lipoprotein genes are coordinately transcribed. We show here that B. burgdorferi expresses ospB at much higher levels than ospA during experimental murine infection. The ratio of ospA and ospB mRNA transcripts was 3.5:1 in tick-adapted spirochetes while B. burgdorferi matched every ospA mRNA with up to 70 ospB transcripts during murine infection. This was consistent with the analysis of antibody responses to the two lipoproteins, which showed a more frequent OspB response than OspA during chronic murine infection."

The major sources of DNA for PCR amplification and sequencing were samples of the B. burgdorferi tick vector Ixodes scapularis, collected at a field site in an endemic region of the north-eastern United States, and the B. afzelii vector Ixodes ricinus, collected at a similar site in southern Sweden. The sequences were compared with those of reference strains and skin biopsy isolates, as well as database sequences. For B. burgdorferi, 10-13 alleles for each of the 4 loci, and a total of 9 distinct clonal lineages with linkage of all 4 loci, were found. For B. afzelii, 2 loci, ospC and IGS, were examined, and 11 IGS genotypes, 12 ospC alleles, and a total of 9 linkage groups were identified. The genetic variants of B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii among samples from the field sites accounted for the greater part of the genetic diversity previously reported from larger areas of the north-eastern United States and central and northern Europe. Although ospC alleles of both species had higher nucleotide diversity than other loci, the ospC locus showed evidence of intragenic recombination and was unsuitable for phylogenetic inference. In contrast, there was no detectable recombination at the IGS locus of B. burgdorferi. Moreover, beyond the signature nucleotides that specified 10 IGS genotypes, there were additional nucleotide polymorphisms that defined a total of 24 subtypes. Maximum-likelihood and parsimony cladograms of B. burgdorferi aligned IGS sequences revealed the subtype sequences to be terminal branches of clades, and the existence of at least three monophyletic lineages within B. burgdorferi. It is concluded that B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii have greater genetic diversity than had previously been estimated, and that the IGS locus alone is sufficient for strain typing and phylogenetic studies."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi is a motile spirochete with a flat-wave morphology. The periplasmic flagella, which are situated between the outer membrane sheath and cell cylinder, are essential for both the cell's wavy shape and motility. Here we focus on the structure and regulation of its periplasmic flagella. Previous studies have suggested that the periplasmic flagella consist of a polymer of the major filament protein FlaB and a minor protein, FlaA. We used immunoprecipitation methodology to present further evidence that FlaA is indeed a flagellar protein. In addition, in contrast to FlaA of the spirochete Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, B. burgdorferi FlaA did not impact the overall helical shape of the periplasmic flagella. We have previously shown that B. burgdorferi lacks the sigma factor-dependent cascade control of motility gene transcription found in other bacteria. To begin to understand motility gene regulation in B. burgdorferi, we examined the effects of an insertion mutation in flaB on the amounts of proteins encoded by motility genes. Of several motility gene-encoded proteins examined, only the amount of FlaA was decreased in the flaB mutant; it was 13% compared to the wild-type amount. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR analysis indicated that this inhibition was not the result of a decrease in flaA mRNA. In addition, protein stability analysis suggested that FlaA was turned over in the flaB mutant. Our results indicate that the lack of FlaB negatively influences the amount of FlaA found in the cell and that this effect is at the level of either translational control or protein turnover."

B. burgdorferi lipoproteins activate innate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), but TLR2-deficient mice are not resistant to B. burgdorferi-induced disease, suggesting the involvement of other TLRs or non-TLR mechanisms in the induction of acute inflammation. For this study, we used mice that were deficient in the intracellular adapter molecule myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88), which is required for all TLR-induced inflammatory responses, to determine whether the interruption of this pathway would alter B. burgdorferi-induced disease. Infected MyD88(-/-) mice developed carditis and arthritis, similar to the disease in wild-type (WT) mice analyzed at its peak (days 14 and 28) and during regression (day 45). MyD88(-/-) macrophages produced tumor necrosis factor alpha only when spirochetes were opsonized, suggesting a role for B. burgdorferi-specific antibody in disease expression. MyD88(-/-) mice produced stronger pathogen-specific Th2-dependent immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) responses than did WT mice, and their IgM titers remained significantly elevated through 90 days of infection. Despite specific antibodies, the pathogen burden was 250-fold higher in MyD88(-/-) mice than in WT mice 45 days after infection; by 90 days of infection, the pathogen burden had diminished substantially in MyD88(-/-) mice, but it was still elevated compared to that in WT mice. The elevated pathogen burden may be explained in part by the finding that MyD88(-/-) peritoneal macrophages could ingest spirochetes but degraded them more slowly than WT macrophages. Our results show that MyD88-dependent signaling pathways are not required for B. burgdorferi-induced inflammation but are necessary for the efficient control of the pathogen burden by phagocytes."

		"abstract": "The genome of the type strain (B31) of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is composed of 12 linear and 9 circular plasmids and a linear chromosome. Plasmid content can vary among strains, but one 26-kb circular plasmid (cp26) is always present. The ubiquitous nature of cp26 suggests that it provides functions required for bacterial viability. We tested this hypothesis by attempting to selectively displace cp26 with an incompatible but replication-proficient vector, pBSV26. While pBSV26 transformants contained this incompatible vector, the vector coexisted with cp26, which is consistent with the hypothesis that cp26 carries essential genes. Several cp26 genes with ascribed or predicted functions may be essential. These include the BBB29 gene, which has sequence homology to a gene encoding a glucose-specific phosphotransferase system component, and the resT gene, which encodes a telomere resolvase involved in resolution of the replicated telomeres of the linear chromosome and plasmids. The BBB29 gene was successfully inactivated by allelic exchange, but attempted inactivation of resT resulted in merodiploid transformants, suggesting that resT is required for B. burgdorferi growth. To determine if resT is the only cp26 gene essential for growth, we introduced resT into B. burgdorferi on pBSV26. This did not result in displacement of cp26, suggesting that additional cp26 genes encode vital functions. We concluded that B. burgdorferi plasmid cp26 encodes functions critical for survival and thus shares some features with the chromosome."

The aim of the study was to compare the immunoblot pattern of Lyme borreliosis patients and control sera from endemic and non-endemic regions and to identify the most suitable interpretation criteria for our immunoblot test. Serum samples of 24 Estonian patients with Lyme disease, 12 sera from patients with tick-borne encephalitis, 40 Estonian control sera, and sera from 50 Laplanders from North Sweden where people usually never come into contact with ticks were tested for IgG antibodies to Borrelia. Sonicated lysate of Borrelia afzelii (strain ACA1) was used in immunoblot as source of antigens. In our test system the following interpretation criteria gave the specificity of 96% for Estonian population: > or = 1 band from p58, p21, p17 and p14 plus > or = 2 bands from p83/100, p39, p34, p30 and p25; or > or = 4 bands from p83/100, p39, p34, p30 and p25. The comparison of Estonian controls with Laplanders showed that subclinical infections with Borrelia are rather common in Estonia. Also the rate of other infections, giving rise to cross-reactive antibodies, may be more frequent in Estonians. The frequent reactions with Borrelia antigens in a healthy population complicate the serodiagnosis of Lyme disease."

More particularly, seasonal patterns of rodent abundance and infestation rate with I. ricinus ticks as well as the prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. and the two species B. garinii and B. afzelii were determined. The studies were carried out in woodlands at Urwitałt near Mikołajki on the Mazury Lakes in 2001. A total of 196 rodents were trapped and 1349 I. ricinus ticks were collected. There was an increase of rodents in the autumn, with a maximum density of C. glareolus in October and in of A. flavicollis in September. The infestation rate of the investigated animals was above 87% and was dependent on the developmental stage of ticks and host species. Only two stages of I. ricinus were found on trapped rodents: larvae 80% and 84.5%, and nymphs 7.5% and 15.5% for C. glareolus and for A. flavicollis, respectively. The average level of infestation with ticks on rodents appears to be seasonally dependent, and decreases from spring to autumn. Both methods of B. burgdorferi s.l. detection, PCR and IFA, showed that larvae collected from both species of infested rodents were infected by these spirochetes. An increase in the infection rates with B. burgdorferi s.l. was observed from spring to autumn from 12.5% to 15.6% for larval ticks collected from C. glareolus, and from 5.6% to 8.8% for ticks collected from A. flavicollis. The infection rates of larvae examined by PCR were 5% in the spring and 8% in the autumn for ticks collected from C. glareolus, and 10% and 5% for ticks collected from A. flavicollis. A total number of 329 ticks were analysed for the detection of genospecies (184 for B. garinii and 145 for B. afzelii). In larvae collected from C. glareolus, B. garinii were found in 3% and B. afzelii in 1.1% of assessed ticks. Conversely, in larvae collected from A. flavicollis the percentage of infected ticks was 1.5% for B. garinii and 1.7% for B. afzelii. The examined ear biopsies were Borrelia positive in 2.5% and 4.3% of the 44 bank voles and 80 yellow-necked mice, respectively. Both species of rodents, highly abounded in the Mazury Lakes district od North-Eastern Poland, may represent significant, seasonally dependent, zoonotic reservoirs of B. burgdorferi s.l."

		"abstract": "Complement activation plays an important role in the elimination of invading microorganisms. Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato the etiological agent of Lyme borreliosis, can resist complement-mediated killing. The mechanism of complement resistance of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto apparently depends on the expression of several outer surface proteins described as CRASPs (complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins). These borrelial surface proteins are able to bind components of the complement regulatory system, factor H and/or factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), two crucial fluid-phase negative regulators of the alternative pathway of complement. It was previously demonstrated that one CRASP is encoded by a member of the erp gene family. The purpose of the study was to use a set of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and polyclonal antisera to characterize the relatedness of factor H-binding CRASP and Erp proteins among several B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii strains. Based on the observed cross-reactivities between B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains LW2 and PKa-1, it is concluded that BbCRASP-3 is similar to ErpP, BbCRASP-4 is structurally related to ErpC, and BbCRASP-5 is similar to ErpA. The BaCRASP-2 and BaCRASP-4 proteins of B. afzelii strain EB1 reacted with both anti-ErpA and anti-ErpP antibodies whereas BaCRASP-5 of B. afzelii strain FEM1-D15 exclusively reacted with BbCRASP-3/ErpP specific antibodies. Together, these data indicate that most of the factor H-binding CRASPs are members of the Erp protein family, which represents a polymorphic class of proteins with similar or identical immunological reactivities."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans and other warm blooded animals through the bites of infected Ixodes species ticks. Our studies indicate that these spirochetes utilize a quorum sensing mechanism to control protein expression patterns that involves the chemical signal autoinducer-2 (AI-2). Through this mechanism, a population of Lyme disease spirochetes may synchronize production of proteins needed for infection processes. AI-2 is produced by the B. burgdorferi LuxS protein, which we have demonstrated to be a functional enzyme. It has also been previously reported that luxS message is upregulated in feeding nymphal ixodid ticks. Among the B. burgdorferi proteins regulated through AI-2 are the complement inhibitory factor H binding Erp lipoproteins. We now report Erp protein expression is also increased during transmission of B. burgdorferi from nymphal ticks to mammalian hosts. Essentially no B. burgdorferi within unfed nymphal ticks expressed Erps, while almost all transmitted bacteria were Erp positive. These studies suggest that B. burgdorferi within feeding nymphal ticks produce AI-2 to coordinate expression of mammalian infection associated proteins, such as the factor H binding Erp lipoproteins. Binding of mammalian host factor H by Erps may then help promote bacterial dissemination through host tissues."

		"abstract": "In Portugal, Ixodes ricinus ticks have been shown to contain DNA of several spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, with major differences in the genetic diversity between ecozones. Some isolates have been obtained since 1999, confirming the circulation of pathogenic strains in these ticks. Ixodes ricinus is considered to be a widespread species, however, in Portugal it is found only in a few habitats. Here we present preliminary results from a nationwide survey of questing I. ricinus (n = 4,001) and other Ixodidae (n = 1,534) in Portugal, initiated in 2001. The sampling points (so far 41) were selected using a Geographic Information System, according to the type of vegetation, accessibility and prevalence of human cases. The spatial and temporal of tick abundance and the infection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in ticks were determined in selected areas. Ticks were examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato by culturing (719 out of 4,001 I. ricinus), and direct PCR amplification of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer region (1,870 out of 5,535) followed by RFLP analysis, the reverse line blot assay and nucleotide sequencing of PCR amplicons. The most abundant tick genus was Rhipicephalus (53%), followed by Dermacentor (34%), I. ricinus and Hyalomma (7%, each). The Mafra and Grândola sites, where a more intensive study was carried out, were excellent habitats for I. ricinus. However, a clear difference of the prevalence of Borrelia infection and the genetic diversity of circulating spirochetes was observed in these two sites. Genotyping of all I. ricinus isolates revealed 5 B. garinii, 8 B. lusitaniae and 1 B. valaisiana strains, which were obtained for the first time in these regions along with a considerable percentage of tick-derived PCR amplicons. Two hard-tick species other than I. ricinus in Grândola were also B. lusitaniae positive, thus seeming to take part in the transmission cycle of Borrelia. The seasonal dynamics of I. ricinus in Mafra was bimodal, more pronounced in nymphs than in adults. The present findings indicate that B. burgdorferi sensu lato agents are differentially maintained in nature in local tick populations in different geographic areas across Portugal and that the risk of acquiring Lyme borreliosis in certain areas of Portugal is higher than previously assumed."

Any disease developing as a result of tick bite should be regarded as a potentially mixed infection. Clinically, tick-borne mixed infections proceed more severely than the corresponding diseases caused by a single agent. The residual course of the disease may sometimes be accounted for by the persistence of two or even several pathogens. This implies the necessity of a comprehensive approach to the study, diagnosis, treatment, management and prophylaxis of infections belonging to this group."

		"abstract": "During the period of 1993-2002 an increase and the remarkable changes in the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis (LB) as well as annual activities of vector species were noticed. The highest increase of TBE morbidity in Latvia has been observed in 1994 and 1995, and less expressed also in 1998 which was followed by a significant decrease during subsequent years. Whereas the highest peak of LB morbidity has been noticed in 1998 with only a minor decrease during subsequent years. Two epidemiologically significant Ixodes tick species are common in Latvia. Ixodes ricinus L. spread in the western and central part of Latvia; but rarely and in small numbers also in the eastern part. Ixodes persulcatus P. Sch. seems to dominate only in the eastern part of the country. The changes of seasonal and annual activities of I. ricinus were observed in two types of monitoring sites--sylvatic and peridomestic, located in the central part of Latvia. Observations of I. persulcatus were made in the eastern districts. Comparing geographically the Tick-borne diseases (TBD) incidence data for three tick distribution regions (I. ricinus dominated, I. persulcatus dominated and mixed regions), it was observed that the trend of annual changes in LB incidence during the last decade is almost of the same kind for all regions. Whereas TBE incidence extremes in 1994 and 1995 were observed almost only in I. ricinus dominated region. The annual field-collected adult tick infection rate with TBE virus (TBEV) from 1993 to 2002 for I. ricinus adults varied between 1.7% and 26.6% and for I. persulcatus--between 0% and 37.3%. The infection level in ticks removed from humans was much higher and from 1998 to 2002 surpassed 30%. TBEV investigations of removed adults and nymphs in 2002 discovered a high TBEV prevalence also in I. ricinus nymphs (43%). Typing of TBE virus isolated from ticks and patient serum samples in collaboration with German and Swedish virologists revealed that all three TBEV subtypes were co-circulating in Latvia. The mean annual tick infection rate with Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. analysed by means of a nested polymerase chain reaction of OspA gene fragment during the period of 1999-2001 was 18%-38% for I. ricinus adults and 25%-51% for I. persulcatus adults. Typing of Borrelia-positive DNA samples indicated that B. afzelii was dominant in Borrelia-positive I. ricinus (64.9%) and I. persulcatus (81.2%) followed by B. garinii (I. ricinus: 24.3%; in I. persulcatus: 14.5%). Investigations of Ehrlichia phagocytophila genogroup (by nested PCR targeted the 16S rRNA gene) revealed the presence of Ehrlichia sp. in I. ricinus from the central part of Latvia. Obtained data on TBD vectors and the epidemiological situation during the last decade indicates the complex impact of different factors influencing TBE and LB morbidity in Latvia."

		"abstract": "Even though tick-borne disease systems are highly susceptible to climatic influences, climate change to date is not necessarily the cause of the marked increased incidence of a variety of tick-borne diseases in many parts of Europe over the past two decades. To test for causality, rather than coincidence, we need to examine whether the right sorts of climate change have occurred at the right time and in the right places to account for the observed heterogeneous temporal and spatial patterns of tick-borne disease 'emergence'. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) incidence, for example, showed a 3-fold step increase from 1983 to 1986 in Sweden, doubled in 1993 in the Czech Republic, increased even more dramatically in the same year in Lithuania and Poland, but declined markedly in 1997 in Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia. Within each country, TBE incidence has changed to different degrees in different regions. Because other tick-borne diseases, notably Lyme borreliosis, has commonly 'emerged' in parallel with TBE, we should first examine climate variables predicted to have a general effect on tick abundance, which has indeed increased in the past decade. These include temperature and moisture stress, which have seasonally differential impacts. Monthly mean records for 1960-2000 from the UK Climate Research Unit's interpolated global climate surface reveal that mean spring, spring-autumn and winter temperatures have all increased gradually over the past 40 years, but apparently most sharply in the late 1980s, when moisture stress also increased. These climate data do not reveal any obvious differences between sites where TBE did or did not 'emerge', and in Sweden increases in TBE pre-dated the onset of warmer springs and winters. If recorded climate changes cannot yet satisfactorily explain the temporal and spatial patterns of tick-borne disease change in Europe, the impact of biotic factors, such as increases in deer abundance and changing habitat structure, and of socio-political changes following the end of communist rule, demand more detailed quantitative analyses."

The presence of Borrelia DNA was detected by the PCR method after feeding and egg laying in 16 engorged females (80.0%), as well as in 36.5 +/- 7.2% samples containing 20 eggs each and in 21.4 +/- 4.2% samples containing 10 eggs each. The respective rates of individual egg infection were 0.4-8.0% and 0.5-23.0%. PCR analysis of 370 eggs (one egg per sample) and 781 unfed larvae hatched from the same egg masses (1, 10, 20, 40, and 50 larvae per sample) failed to reveal the presence of Borrelia DNA. Negative results were also obtained in experiments on inoculating the BSK II medium with the egg and larval materials. Microscopic analysis of 1,683 smear preparations of eggs and 1,416 preparations of unfed daughter larvae revealed spirochete-like cells in 7 (0.4 +/- 0.3%) and 13 (0.9 +/- 0.5%) preparations, respectively; typical Borrelia cells were found in seven preparations of larvae (0.5 +/- 0.4%). Only 1 out of 16 infected females transmitted Borrelia vertically, through the eggs to the larval progeny. The infection rate in this progeny was about 7%, and the prevalence of Borrelia in individual larvae was 0.4-0.8 cells per 100 microscopic fields. These data do not allow the conclusion that transovarial transmission of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the I. persulcatus tick is an established fact. However, they show that, even if such transmission is possible, its probability is very low."

Previous reports have demonstrated the usefulness of the C(6) peptide as an antigen for the serodiagnosis of human and canine Lyme disease. Results indicated that assays based on the C(6) peptide were nonreactive to sera from vaccinated nonexposed animals. The purpose of the present study was to confirm these results in a controlled trial by testing sera from experimentally vaccinated dogs known to be uninfected. Nine specific-pathogen-free beagles were assigned to one of three vaccine groups, each containing three dogs. Each group received one of three commercial Lyme vaccines: RECOMBITEK Lyme (Merial), LymeVax (Fort Dodge Animal Health), and Galaxy Lyme (Schering-Plough Animal Health). Each animal was administered a total of five doses of vaccine over a period of 39 weeks. Serum samples were collected prior to vaccination and then on a weekly basis from weeks 3 to 18 and from weeks 33 to 43. Selected samples were tested by the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the Western blot (WB) assay using whole-cell B. burgdorferi antigen extracts, and the results were compared to those obtained with two immunoenzyme-based procedures formatted by using the C(6) peptide. Serum specimens from all animals were reactive to the IFA and WB assay at week 5 and became highly reactive following the administration of multiple doses of vaccine. All serum specimens were uniformly nonreactive in the C(6) peptide immunoenzyme procedures at all time points throughout the study."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples were obtained, during the course of disease, from patients with chronic or nonchronic neuroborreliosis (NB) and from control subjects without NB. Blood samples were obtained from patients with Lyme skin manifestations and from healthy blood donors. Early increased secretion of Borrelia-specific IFN- gamma (P<.05) and subsequent up-regulation of IL-4 (P<.05) were detected in the CSF cells of patients with nonchronic NB. In contrast, persistent Borrelia-specific IFN- gamma responses were observed in the CSF cells of patients with chronic NB (P<.05). In patients with erythema migrans, increased IFN- gamma (P<.001) was observed in blood samples obtained early during the course of disease, whereas increased IL-4 (P<.05) was observed after clearance. On the contrary, patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans had Borrelia-specific IFN- gamma (P<.001), but not IL-4, detected in blood samples. The present data suggest that an initial IFN- gamma response, followed by up-regulation of IL-4, is associated with nonchronic manifestations, whereas a persistent IFN- gamma response may lead to chronic Lyme borreliosis."

No alternative cause for orbital myositis was found, and treatment with antibiotics resulted in a complete recovery.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne illness in the United States. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by the deer tick. Deer ticks have a four-stage life cycle (egg, larva, nymph, and adult), and nymphal ticks transmit B. burgdorferi to humans more frequently than adult ticks. Transmission of this spirochete typically requires a minimum of 24 to 48 hours of tick attachment. Early stages of Lyme disease are characterized by a hallmark rash, erythema migrans. The overall risk of acquiring Lyme disease is low in a person who has a deer tick bite. If erythema migrans develops at the site of the bite, treatment may include doxycycline in persons who are at least eight years of age. Administration of amoxicillin is appropriate for pregnant women or children younger than eight years. For those who are allergic to these medications, cefuroxime axetil may be used."

In this paper, a novel tick salivary gland cDNA with sequence homology to tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) and coding for a protein called Penthalaris has been characterized from the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis. Penthalaris is structurally unique and distinct from TFPI or TFPI-like molecules described so far, including Ixolaris, NAPc2, TFPI-1 and TFPI-2. Penthalaris is a 308-amino-acid protein (35 kDa, pI 8.58) with 12 cysteine bridges and 5 tandem Kunitz domains. Recombinant Penthalaris was expressed in insect cells and shown to inhibit factor VIIa (FVIIa)/tissue factor(TF)-induced factor X (FX) activation with an IC50 of approximately 100 pM. Penthalaris tightly binds both zymogen FX and enzyme FXa (exosite), but not FVIIa, as demonstrated by column gel-filtration chromatography. At high concentrations, Penthalaris attenuates FVIIa/TF-induced chromogenic substrate (S2288) hydrolysis and FIX activation. In the presence of DEGR-FX or DEGR-FXa, but not des-Gla-DEGR-FXa as scaf-folds, tight and stoichiometric inhibition of FVIIa/TF was achieved. In addition, Penthalaris blocks cell surface-mediated FXa generation by monomer (de-encrypted), but not dimer (encrypted) TF in HL-60 cells. Penthalaris may act in concert with Ixolaris and other salivary anti-hemostatics in order to help ticks to successfully feed on blood. Penthalaris is a novel anticoagulant and a tool to study FVIIa/TF-initiated biologic processes."

Retrospective questionnaire study. All Dutch general practitioner's (GP) practices. In April 2002, all GPs in the Netherlands were asked to complete a short questionnaire on the number of cases of tick bites and erythema migrans seen in 2001 and the size of their practice. Associations with possible risk factors were determined at the municipal level. Results were compared with the results of a similar study done in 1995. The response of the GPs was 64.5% (4730/7330). Together, all GPs reported seeing approximately 61,000 patients in 2001 with tick bites and 12,000 patients with erythema migrans. The incidence of erythema migrans was estimated at 73 per 100,000 inhabitants. There were obvious risk areas. At the municipal level, tick bites and erythema migrans were positively associated with the area covered by forest, sandy soil, the number of roe deer and tourism. There was a negative association with the degree of urbanisation. Increases in tourism in areas with many ticks, new forests in urban regions and an increased number of horses were positively associated with the increase in tick bites and erythema migrans since 1994. The number of patients with tick bites and erythema migrans seen by GPs in the Netherlands had doubled between 1994 and 2001. This increase may be attributed partly to changes in ecological risk factors and human behaviour. The number of cases of Lyme borreliosis may be reduced by giving prophylactic information annually about ticks and ways to remove them, plus additional education of patients about the recognition of erythema migrans."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative bacterial agent of Lyme borreliosis, a tick-transmitted infectious disease. The Dutch Institute for Health Care Improvement (CBO) has now issued a guideline on 'Lyme borreliosis'. Lyme borreliosis is classified as 'early', 'early disseminated', 'late' or as 'post-infectious complaints and symptoms'. Erythema migrans is the most common manifestation of early Lyme borreliosis. Frequent neurological manifestations of 'early disseminated Lyme borreliosis' include meningoradiculitis, meningitis and peripheral facial palsy, but Lyme carditis and arthritis also occur. Late Lyme borreliosis is characterised by skin abnormalities (acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans), chronic neuroborreliosis or chronic arthritis. Confirmation serology with respect to Borrelia is the most commonly used laboratory technique, but in early Lyme borreliosis the immune response may be absent. In addition, the mere presence of antibodies in the serum is no proof of an active infection with Borrelia and serology may yield false-positive reactions. Doxycycline and ceftriaxone are the most commonly used antibiotics in the various stages of Lyme borreliosis. Lyme borreliosis may be prevented by avoiding high-risk areas, keeping the skin covered as much as possible, and inspection of the skin after possible exposure to remove ticks within 24 hours. Laboratory tests after a tick bite are not recommended, nor is prophylactic treatment with antibiotics."

A literature study prompted by three children with PFP showed that a positive test for Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid in combination with pleocytosis in the cerebrospinal fluid makes a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis extremely probable. At least half of the children with PFP as a result of Lyme borreliosis show other signs or symptoms suggesting this disease. No data are available on the prevalence of Lyme borreliosis among children with PFP in the Netherlands; in adults, however, the prevalence is very low. Therefore, assuming a similar low prevalence in children with PFP, the predictive value of serological testing in children may be limited, in which case serological screening is not useful. Moreover, treatment with antibiotics does not seem to improve the prognosis of PFP significantly. Based on these data, serological testing and lumbar puncture is justified only in children with PFP associated with other signs or symptoms of Lyme borreliosis, such as bilaterality of the PFP, signs of meningeal irritation, a recent history of erythema migrans, arthritis or a recent tick bite."

The pathways by which B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, induces the production of MMP-1 and MMP-3 have not been elucidated. We examined the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways in MMP induction by B. burgdorferi. Infection with B. burgdorferi results in rapid phosphorylation of p38 and JNK within 15 to 30 min. Inhibition of JNK and p38 MAPK significantly reduced B. burgdorferi-induced MMP-1 and MMP-3 expression. Inhibition of ERK1/2 completely inhibited the expression of MMP-3 in human chondrocytes following B. burgdorferi infection but had little effect on the expression of MMP-1. B. burgdorferi infection also induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT-3 and STAT-6 in primary human chondrocytes. Expression of MMP-1 and MMP-3 was significantly inhibited by inhibition of JAK3 activity. Induction of MMP-1 and -3 following MAPK and JAK/STAT activation was cycloheximide sensitive, suggesting synthesis of intermediary proteins is required. Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) significantly reduced MMP-1 but not MMP-3 expression from B. burgdorferi-infected cells; inhibition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) had no effect. Treatment of B. burgdorferi-infected cells with JAK and MAPK inhibitors significantly inhibited TNF-alpha induction, consistent with at least a partial role for TNF-alpha in B. burgdorferi-induced MMP-1 expression in chondrocytes."

Central to the ability of substance P to modulate immune cell function is the interaction of substance P with the substance P neurokinin-1 receptor expressed by a variety of immune cells, including microglia. CNS involvement during Lyme disease can occur when Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, gains access to the CNS. In the present study, we demonstrate that substance P augments B. burgdorferi-induced expression of mRNA encoding COX-2 and subsequent secretion of PGE(2) by cultured, murine microglia. Furthermore, this effect is associated with the ability of substance P to enhance B. burgdorferi-induced NF-kappa B activation, as demonstrated by increased nuclear localization of the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-kappa B in these cells. Interestingly, we demonstrate that substance P augments B. burgdorferi-induced expression of mRNA encoding two PGE(2) receptors, E-prostanoid receptor subtypes 2 and 4, as well as each receptor protein. In addition, these effects are mediated via interactions between substance P and its high affinity receptor, as evidenced by the absence of augmented PGE(2) synthesis in the presence of a specific neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist or in cells genetically deficient in the expression of these receptors. Taken together, the present demonstration that substance P can exacerbate B. burgdorferi-induced inflammatory responses in microglia in vitro may indicate a role for this neuropeptide in the development of CNS inflammation observed during human neuroborreliosis."

It was found that these isolates clustered with each other on a phylogenetic tree based on flagellin gene and 16S rDNA sequences, but were relatively divergent from the European B. valaisiana and strain Am501. These findings suggest that these isolates found in East Asia should be classified as a new genomospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato."

		"abstract": "Many Borrelia burgdorferi Erp outer surface proteins have been demonstrated to bind the host complement regulator factor H, which likely contributes to the ability of these organisms to evade the host innate immune system. B. burgdorferi controls Erp protein synthesis throughout the bacterial infectious cycle, producing the proteins during mammalian infections but repressing their synthesis during tick infections. Defining the mechanism by which B. burgdorferi regulates the expression of these virulence determinants will provide important insight into the biological and pathogenic properties of the Lyme disease spirochete. The present study demonstrates that two highly conserved DNA sequences located 5' of erp operons specifically bind bacterial proteins. Analyses with B. burgdorferi of transcriptional fusions between erp promoter/operator DNAs and the gene for green fluorescent protein indicated that the expression of these operons is regulated at the level of transcriptional initiation. These analyses also indicated significant differences in the promoter strengths of various erp operons, which likely accounts for reported variations in expression levels of different Erp proteins. Mutagenesis of promoter-gfp fusions demonstrated that at least one of the proteins which bind erp operator DNA functions as a repressor of transcription."

The Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes infection by migration through tissues, adhesion to host cells, and evasion of immune clearance. Both innate and adaptive immune responses, especially macrophage- and antibody-mediated killing, are required for optimal control of the infection and spirochetal eradication. Ecological conditions favorable to the disease, and the challenge of prevention, predict that Lyme disease will be a continuing public health concern."

The patient was transferred from Psychiatric Ward of Hospital in Parczew to the Psychiatric Clinical Hospital of Medical University in Lublin due to difficulties in settlement of diagnosis and to lack of the treatment effects. The anamnesis results showed that patient had triple febrile episodes after a trip to Romania; the last one included extreme excitement with suicidal attempt, nihilistic and catastrophic delusions. A co-traveler colleague was diagnosed with borreliosis. In our clinical ward many diagnostic procedures were conducted, obtaining significant increase of Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies, due to which suitable treatment was initiated and minimum improvement of psychical state was obtained. The patient was tested many times by internist, neurologist, and specialist in infectious diseases. In the CT and EEG test no pathological state was revealed in CNS, only the results of the test in the direction of tick bone encephalitis (TBE) showed TBE. During a 3-month period a schizophreniphorm syndrome was observed: he refused consumption of meals, behaved aggressively, had auditory hallucinations, expressed many delusions, was periodically in disturbed consciousness, turned himself in many famous characters (e.g. Wlad Palownik, Pope, Koziolek Matolek, Boguslaw Linda). After four months of hospitalization we reached full remission of physical and mental state and the patients was discharged from hospital."

The prevalences of Borrelia in Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus were 22.6 and 27.9%, respectively. Molecular typing of B. burgdorferi from infected ticks was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR-amplified fragments of the 16S-23S (rrs-rrlA) rRNA intergenic spacer by using species-specific primers and subsequent sequencing. The dominant Borrelia species in both Ixodes species was B. afzelii. In addition, different restriction patterns of B. garinii and B. afzelii were also identified. This study demonstrates that the 16S-23S rRNA PCR-RFLP typing method is simple, sensitive, and fast and that it allows one to differentiate among B. burgdorferi species and subspecies with various degrees of pathogenic potential directly in ticks. These features are important in monitoring Lyme disease."

In spring 2002, six different human behaviors were evaluated as potential risk factors for acquiring I. pacificus nymphs in a deciduous woodland in Mendocino County, California. Also, the prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and the causative agents of human granulocytic (Anaplasma phagocytophilum [Foggie] Dumler, Barbet, Bekker, Dasch, Palmer, Ray, Rikihisa, and Rurangirwa) and monocytic ehrlichioses (Ehrlichia chaffeensis Anderson, Dawson, Jones, and Wilson) was determined in nymphs that had been collected from subjects or by dragging leaf litter. Activities involving a considerable degree of contact with wood resulted in greater acquisition of nymphs than those involving exposure solely to leaf litter. Time-adjusted tick-acquisition rates demonstrated that sitting on logs was the riskiest behavior, followed, in descending rank, by gathering wood, sitting against trees, walking, stirring and sitting on leaf litter, and just sitting on leaf litter. The number of ticks acquired appeared to be unrelated to the type of footwear worn (hiking boots, hiking sandals, or running shoes). Overall, 3.4% (n = 234) of the nymphs were infected with A. phagocytophilum, 3.9% (n = 181) with B. burgdorferi s.l., and none (n = 234) with E. chaffeensis. Of 13 nymphs infected with either A. phagocytophilum or B. burgdorferi s.l., 2 (15.4%) were coinfected with both bacteria, as were 1.3% of 158 nymphs obtained from leaf litter, the first report of coinfection in this life stage of I. pacificus. Four unattached, infected nymphs were removed from subjects, including two acquired while sitting on logs that contained A. phagocytophilum, another with the same bacterium obtained while walking, and one acquired while gathering wood that was infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. Despite the use of extreme personal preventive measures by both subjects, two attached, uninfected nymphs were removed from one of them > or = 1-2 d postexposure. The public health implications of these findings are discussed."

Moreover, all isolates of B. burgdorferi from this area had complementary genetic structure, and the second primer set amplicons confirmed the first primer set amplification products.

It is now known that Lyme arthritis is caused by a tick-borne spirochete that disseminates to joints, where it induces marked pro-inflammatory responses. In most patients, the arthritis resolves with antibiotic treatment. However, in the United States, about 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis develop persistent synovitis, which lasts for months or even several years after the apparent eradication of the spirochete from the joint with antibiotic therapy. The elucidation of Lyme arthritis, from acute infection to chronic synovitis, might help in our understanding not only of this entity, but also of other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis."

		"abstract": "Identification and characterization of genes that contribute to infection with Borrelia burgdorferi and, of those, genes that are targets of host responses is important for understanding the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. The complement-independent bactericidal monoclonal antibody (MAb) CB2 recognizes a carboxy-terminal, hydrophilic epitope of the outer surface protein B (OspB). CB2 kills B. burgdorferi by an unknown bactericidal mechanism. Upon binding of CB2 to OspB, differentially expressed gene products may be responsible for, or associated with, the death of the organism. A time course of the response of B. burgdorferi to CB2 was completed to analyze the differential gene expression in the bacteria over a period of visual morphological changes. Bacteria were treated with a sublethal concentration in which spirochetes were visibly distressed by the antibody but not lysed. Preliminary whole-genome DNA arrays at various time points within 1 h of incubation of B. burgdorferi with the antibody showed that most significant changes occurred at 25 min. Circular plasmid 32 (cp32)-encoded genes were active in this period of time, including the blyA homologs, phage holin system genes. DNA array data show that three blyA homologs were upregulated significantly, >/==\" BORDER=\"0\">2 standard deviations from the mean of the log ratios, and a P value of </=0.01. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis verified blyA and blyB upregulation over an 18- to 35-min time course. The hypothesis to test is whether the killing mechanism of CB2 is through uncontrolled expression of the blyA and blyB phage holin system."

To reveal features of Lyme borreliosis in Bulgaria, clinical data and epidemiological characteristics of 1257 patients reported between 1999 and 2002 were analysed. The most affected age group was 5-9 years, followed by 45-49 years, 50-54 years, and 10-14 years. Most of the patients (68%) lived in a rural area or were attacked by ticks during activities in a rural area. Lyme borreliosis cases occurred throughout the year with two peaks--one in June and second smaller one in September. The most common clinical manifestation was erythema migrans (EM), diagnosed in 868 (69.1%) of the patients. Rashes had a median diameter of 11 cm and were predominantly located on lower extremities. Forty-four per cent of the rashes consisted of homogenous erythema and 56% had central clearing. Multiple EM was detected in 4.3% of the EM cases. Neuroborreliosis was the second most common presentation of Lyme borreliosis, diagnosed in 19% of the patients. Lyme arthritis was found in 8% of the patients. Heart and ocular manifestations were recorded in 1.1% and 0.9% of the patients, respectively. Borrelial lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were very rare (0.3%). Twenty-seven patients (2.1%) had multiple organ involvement. The results of the study show that the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in Bulgaria are similar to those in the majority European countries but possess some distinguishing characteristics."

To discuss and carry out appropriate tests of 3 easily confused hypotheses: (a). the behavior motivation hypothesis (perceptions of personal risk cause people to take protective action), (b). the risk reappraisal hypothesis (when people take actions thought to be effective, they lower their risk perceptions), and (c). the accuracy hypothesis (risk perceptions accurately reflect risk behavior). Longitudinal study with an initial interview just after the Lyme disease vaccine was made publicly available and a follow-up interview 18 months later. Random sample of adult homeowners (N = 745) in 3 northeastern U.S. counties with high Lyme disease incidence. Lyme disease vaccination behavior and risk perception were assessed. All 3 hypotheses were supported. Participants with higher initial risk perceptions were much more likely than those with lower risk perceptions to get vaccinated against Lyme disease (OR = 5.81, 95% CI 2.63-12.82, p <.001). Being vaccinated led to a reduction in risk perceptions, chi2(1, N = 745) = 30.90, p <.001, and people vaccinated correctly believed that their risk of future infection was lower than that of people not vaccinated (OR =.44, 95% CI.21-.91, p <.05). The behavior motivation hypothesis was supported in this longitudinal study, but the opposite conclusion (i.e., that higher risk led to less protective behavior) would have been drawn from an incorrect test based only on cross-sectional data. Health researchers should take care in formulating and testing risk-perception-behavior hypotheses."

Despite numerous studies, the epidemiology of the different bacterial species responsible for this disease remains unclear. Recent evidence for a sex-biased genetic structure of its European vector leads us to analyse the consequences of this pattern on Borrelia transmission. Here we show that male and female ticks are not equivalently infected by Borrelia burgdorferi, that Borrelia afzelii affects tick migration capabilities, especially for the most vagile sex (i.e., male) and that Lyme borreliosis agents are consequently vectorised in a much more complex way than usually thought. Such results change the epidemiological perception of Lyme borreliosis and suggest new co-evolutionary pathways between the ticks and the borrelia."

In 1996, the prevalence 6.8% was observed, during 1997 and 1998, it increased to 8.4% and 12.3%, respectively. The lowest prevalence was observed in 1999 (3.6%), and in 2000 it increased to 4.0%. The mean rate of infection was 6.5%, and the proportions of infected ticks were 12.2% in 263 male ticks, 8.3% in 289 female ticks, 6.0% in 1621 nymphs, and 1.3% in 225 larvae. From the total of 156 highly infected ticks (>100 spirochetes per sample) transferred into BSK-H medium for isolation attempts, 13 isolates were obtained. PCR-RFLP and electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) were used for the identification and characterization of Borrelia strains. Ten tick isolates were identified as Borrelia afzelii, and the other three isolates were found to be Borrelia garinii. The results indicate the epidemiological importance of B. afzelii and B. garinii in central Europe, and emphasize the role of I. ricinus in the ecology of B. burgdorferi and in the epidemiology and epizootiology of Lyme disease."

In the present study, the density of questing Ixodes ricinus ticks and their infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) was examined in 11 areas located on the Swiss Plateau and in an alpine valley. From 1999 to 2001, free-living I. ricinus ticks were collected on a monthly basis by flagging vegetation in these areas. Each tick was examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi sl using direct fluorescent antibody assay, and for isolation of the bacteria. Borreliae were characterized by PCR followed by RFLP. Density of questing ticks varied greatly between studied areas. Borreliae were observed in ticks collected in all investigated sites. However, the prevalence of infection differed significantly among areas. Infection prevalence varied from 9% to 40% in nymphs and from 22% to 47% in adults. Adult ticks were significantly more infected (129/366, 35%) than nymphs (109/552, 20%). There was no correlation between nymphal density and infection prevalence as well as between adult density and infection prevalence, but there was a correlation between density of ticks and density of infected ticks. During the spring peak of questing tick density, a range of 2-30.3 infected ticks per 100 m(2) was observed. B. burgdorferi sl isolates (n = 129) were obtained from ticks collected in 10/11 areas. Five Borrelia species were identified: B. garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae, and six mixed infections were also obtained. Borrelia species were heterogeneously distributed in the different areas."

The 5-year median density of infected nymphs was significantly higher at CHR than at HREC (0.51 vs. 0.09 per 100 m(2) and site-specific yearly densities exceeding one infected nymph per 100 m2 were 10-fold more likely to occur at CHR than at HREC. The importance of long-term data in acarologic risk assessment was demonstrated by significantly higher median yearly densities of infected nymphs at CHR from 1997 to 1999, whereas both areas had similar densities during 2000-2001. Overall, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in North America, B. burgdorferi Johnson et al. sensu stricto (s.s.) accounted for 76% of 46 genetically characterized B. burgdorferi s.l. infections from I. pacificus nymphs. Tremendous variability in acarologic risk was recorded within both areas: yearly densities of infected nymphs varied 11-97-fold between sites at CHR and 8-30-fold at HREC. Part of this variation could be explained by environmental traits, most notably deer usage. However, correlations between environmental factors and density of infected nymphs (for CHR and HREC combined) did not necessarily apply when these areas were considered separately. Thus, a Lyme borreliosis ecology model developed in one of these areas needs testing in the other area."

The onset typically occurs in childhood or young adult years. The aetiology of the condition is unknown. A case of progressive hemifacial atrophy occurring in a 30-year-old woman is reported, in which the aetiology is thought to be Lyme disease, a borrelial infection first recognized in 1975 that has since become the most commonly reported vector-borne disease in the world. No sure link is established between these two disease states, but their coincident occurrence in this patient is noted.

		"abstract": "To evaluate factors motivating high-risk individuals to implement Lyme disease-prevention behaviors. Patients presenting to the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center in New York State completed a voluntary, anonymous questionnaire. Of the 219 persons completing the questionnaire, participants who reported having had Lyme disease in the past were significantly more likely to use preventive behaviors than those without a history of Lyme disease (p = .01). Additionally, persons who reported having a family member or close friend with Lyme disease were more likely to use preventive behaviors than those without such a relationship (p = .02). Increasing age was associated with increased use of preventive behaviors only for participants without a history of Lyme disease (p = .04). These findings provide information that may be important in developing community prevention programs for Lyme disease. Younger persons without a history of Lyme disease should be targeted for programs that will educate them about Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "More than a decade after a study on the transmission cycle of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in the Siebengebirge, a nature reserve near Bonn, Germany, questing nymphal and adult Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected again in three selected areas of the same low mountain range and examined for infection with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Between May and October 2001, a total of 1,754 ticks were collected by blanket dragging; 374 ticks were analyzed for B. burgdorferi sensu lato by both an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and at least two different PCR tests, whereas 171 ticks were analyzed by PCR only. By combining all assays, an average of 14% of the ticks tested positive for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, 5.5, 15.8, and 21.8% in the three collection areas. Of the nymphs and adults examined, 12.9 and 21.1%, respectively, were found to be spirochete infected. A lower total infection prevalence was obtained by IFA (14.4%) than by a nested PCR approach (16.5%), but both were higher than that obtained by a simple PCR approach (11.9%). Compared with data collected over a decade ago, the mean infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in the ticks was significantly higher for all three biotopes, whereas a similar pattern of habitat-specific infection prevalence was observed. Genotyping of B. burgdorferi sensu lato revealed high relative prevalences of B. valaisiana (identified in 43.1% of infected ticks) and B. garinii (32.3%), whereas B. afzelii (12.3%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (1.5%) were relatively rare. We conclude that B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection has increased in this region over the last 15 years due to presently unknown changes in ecological conditions, perhaps related to climate change or wildlife management."

STARI develops following the bite of a lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum) and is thought to be caused by infection with an \"uncultivable\" spirochete tentatively named Borrelia lonestari. In this study, wild lone star ticks collected from an area where B. lonestari is endemic were cocultured in an established embryonic tick cell line (ISE6). The cultures were examined by dark-field microscopy for evidence of infection, and spirochete identity and morphology were evaluated by flagellin B and 16S rRNA gene sequence, by reaction to Borrelia-wide and B. burgdorferi-specific monoclonal antibodies, and by electron microscopy. Live spirochetes were first visualized in primary culture of A. americanum ticks by dark-field microscopy 14 days after the cell culture was inoculated. The sequences of the flagellin B and 16S rRNA genes of cultured spirochetes were consistent with previously reported sequences of B. lonestari. The cultured spirochetes reacted with a Borrelia-wide flagellin antibody, but did not react with an OspA antibody specific to B. burgdorferi, by indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Electron microscopy demonstrated organisms that were free and associated with ISE6 cells, with characteristic Borrelia sp. morphology. This study describes the first successful isolation of B. lonestari in culture, providing a much needed source of organisms for the development of diagnostic assays and forming a basis for future studies investigating the role of the organism as a human disease agent."

Our study focuses on validation of Protein A/G dependent ELISA in game animals like deer and mouflons as well as in hunting dogs. Binding ability of Protein A/G-conjugate to antibodies was the highest in dogs followed by fallow deer and mouflons. Three different whole cell Borrelia antigens were used to evaluate antigen dependent variation. In new Protein A/G-ELISA the highest sensitivities (90.50%, deer; 85.37%, mouflon & 94.29%, dog) were obtained by B. garinii antigen, with no statistically significant variation (chi(2), P>0.05) among all other antigens used. Average seroprevalences observed in deer, mouflons and dogs were 44.90%, 29.41% and 30.43%, respectively. Marked influence of age on seroprevalence was noticed. Protein A/G-ELISA proved to be sensitive and promising diagnostic tool in serodiagnosis of Lyme disease in game ungulates and it can be used effectively for serosurvey in different wild mammals."

		"abstract": "The aetiological agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi cycles between its tick vector and mammalian hosts, implying that it can sense different environments and consequently change the expression of genes encoding several surface-associated proteins. The genome of the type strain B. burgdorferi B31 has revealed 175 different gene families. The p13 gene, situated on the chromosome, encodes a channel-forming protein that belongs to the gene family 48 consisting of eight additional paralogous genes. The heterogeneity of the P13 protein from different Lyme disease Borrelia strains was investigated. The predicted surface-exposed domains are the most heterogeneous regions and contain probable epitopes of P13. The membrane-spanning architecture of P13 was determined and a model for the location of this protein in the outer membrane is presented. The transcription of the paralogues of gene family 48 during in vitro culturing and in a mouse infection model was also analysed. The bba01 gene is the only p13 paralogue present in all three Lyme-disease-causing genospecies; it is stable during cultivation in vitro and the BBA01 protein was expressed in all Borrelia strains investigated. Conversely, paralogues bbi31, bbq06 and bbh41 were only detected in B. burgdorferi and the corresponding plasmids harbouring bbi31 and bbh41 were lost during in vitro passage. Finally, p13 and bbi31 are the only members of gene family 48 that are transcribed in mice, suggesting their importance during mammalian infection."

All TLR2(-/-) mice infected with a B. burgdorferi RST1 isolate developed severe arthritis. The numbers of spirochetes in heart, joint and ear biopsy specimens were significantly higher in TLR2(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice similarly infected as determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a systemic infection caused by the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted by tick bites and maintained in a delicately balanced ecological cycle. Recent increases in the population densities of tick hosts, the abundance of ticks and the proximity of man to natural tick habitats have led to an escalating worldwide incidence of Lyme borreliosis, and nonspecific clinical manifestations have yielded significant misunderstanding of the disease. After entry, B. burgdorferi activates local inflammation, yet evades host defences and facilitates dissemination by potentially masquerading with host components such as plasmin and complement. The extent of tissue injury is determined by the aggressiveness of host inflammation and immunological reactions, as well as by genetic attributes of the spirochaete. The clinical presentation can be highly varied, including early manifestations that are limited to erythema migrans and ranging to disseminated infection with arthritis, carditis, cranial nerve palsy, peripheral neuropathy, meningitis, or other manifestations. Diagnostic tests have improved, but are unhelpful during certain stages of infection. Therapy varies depending on the degree of involvement, and recovery is usually rapid and complete. Post-treatment clinical manifestations in the absence of evidence for active infection are still poorly understood. The understanding of how B. burgdorferi survives in the environment and interacts with human and mammalian hosts has improved. However, further advances in prevention and therapy depend on continued investigation of the ecological risks and improved understanding of the pathobiology of this obligate bacterial parasite."

Outer surface (lipo)protein A (OspA) of Bb has been the most intensively studied of all borrelial molecular constituents, and hence, much has been speculated about the potential role(s) of OspA in the life cycle of Bb. However, the precise function of OspA (along with that of its close relative and operonic partner, outer surface [lipo]protein B [OspB]) heretofore has not been directly determined, due primarily to the inability to generate an OspA/B-deficient mutant from a virulent strain of Bb. In this study, we created an OspA/B-deficient mutant of an infectious human isolate of Bb (strain 297) and found that OspA/B function was not required for either Bb infection of mice or accompanying tissue pathology. However, OspA/B function was essential for Bb colonization of and survival within tick midguts, events crucial for sustaining Bb in its natural enzootic life cycle."

Here we examine whether OspB also has a specific function in ticks. OspB specifically binds to a protein or protein complex within the tick gut. We also assessed whether selected nonborreliacidal OspB antibodies or F(ab)(2) fragments interfere with B. burgdorferi-tick attachment in vivo. We examined engorged ticks that fed on B. burgdorferi N40-infected scid mice that had been treated with OspB F(ab)(2) fragments. Control F(ab)(2) fragments did not interfere with B. burgdorferi colonization of the tick gut, whereas OspB F(ab)(2) fragments significantly inhibited the attachment of spirochetes to the tick gut. These studies show that nonbactericidal OspB antibodies interfere with B. burgdorferi colonization of I. scapularis, highlighting a specific role for OspB in spirochete- arthropod interactions and suggesting new antibody-mediated strategies for interfering with B. burgdorferi transmission."

To test the possibility that dissolved oxygen modulates gene expression in B. burgdorferi, spirochetes were exposed to differential levels of dissolved oxygen, and distinct alterations were observed at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Specifically NapA, a Dps/Dpr homologue involved in the oxidative stress response in other bacteria, was reduced when B. burgdorferi was grown under oxygen-limiting conditions. In contrast, several immunoreactive proteins were altered when tested with infection-derived sera from different hosts. Specifically, OspC, DbpA, and VlsE were synthesized at greater levels when cells were grown in limiting oxygen, whereas VraA was reduced. The levels of oxygen in the medium did not affect OspA production. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from infectious isolates of strains B31 and cN40 indicated that the expression of ospC, dbpA, and vlsE increased while napA expression decreased under dissolved-oxygen-limiting conditions, whereas flaB was not affected. The reverse transcription-PCR results corroborated the immunoblot analyses and indicated that the increase in OspC, DbpA, and VlsE was due to regulation at the transcriptional level of the genes encoding these antigens. These results indicate that dissolved oxygen modulates gene expression in B. burgdorferi and imply that the redox environment may be an additional regulatory cue that spirochetes exploit to adapt to the disparate niches that they occupy in nature."

		"abstract": "Some diseases are characterized by prevalence in the affected tissues of type 1 T lymphocytes, which secrete gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and other proinflammatory cytokines. For example, type 1 T cells predominate in the lesions of patients with Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. We used an in vitro model of the blood vessel wall to test the premise that the vascular endothelium actively recruits circulating type 1 T cells to such lesions. When T lymphocytes isolated from human peripheral blood were examined, the populations that traversed monolayers of resting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) or HUVEC stimulated by interleukin-1beta or B. burgdorferi were markedly enriched for T cells that produced IFN-gamma compared to the initially added population of T cells. No enrichment was seen for cells that produced interleukin-4, a marker for type 2 T lymphocytes. Very late antigen-4 and CD11/CD18 integrins mediated passage of the T cells across both resting and stimulated HUVEC, and the endothelium-derived chemokine CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein 1) was responsible for the enhanced migration of T cells across stimulated HUVEC. These results suggest that the vascular endothelium may contribute to the selective accumulation of type 1 T cells in certain pathological lesions, including those of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Environmentally responsive synthesis of surface proteins represents a hallmark of the infectious cycle of the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi. Here we created and analyzed a B. burgdorferi mutant lacking outer-surface protein C (OspC), an abundant Osp that spirochetes normally synthesize in the tick vector during the blood meal and down-regulate after transmission to the mammal. We demonstrate that B. burgdorferi strictly requires OspC to infect mice but not to localize or migrate appropriately in the tick. The induction of a spirochetal virulence factor preceding the time and host in which it is required demonstrates a developmental sequence for transmission of this arthropod-borne pathogen."

With the clinically defined groups as the gold standard, i.e. without knowledge of antibody status in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, the diagnostic performance of the kits was compared and important differences in diagnostic usefulness were found. The kits from Abbot and DAKO, that often predict clinically relevant Borrelia infection and do not detect antibodies in sera from patients without strong suspicion of Borrelia infection, were considered the most useful in the population studied. This kind of validation study is an important part of good laboratory practice and should be performed by laboratories serving patient populations with varying endemicity of Borrelia."

To provide a context for this review, we define the three types and provide general and arthritis-specific examples of prevention strategies. Next, we highlight recently published longitudinal cohort and intervention studies that focus on arthritis prevention in the following topic areas: cognitive and behavioral strategies, obesity, exercise, and occupational injury prevention. Few studies examined primary prevention strategies. In one study, an educational intervention significantly changed tick-related knowledge and behaviors among a population at risk of Lyme disease. Another population-based study used a mailed, stage-based educational program to successfully increase physical activity levels; this intervention may have practical application as a primary or tertiary prevention strategy for arthritis. Tertiary prevention research received much attention: Recent studies extend the benefits of exercise and cognitive-behavioral interventions to persons with different rheumatic conditions (eg, neck pain, low back pain, systemic lupus erythematosus, fibromyalgia). Longitudinal cohort studies improve our understanding of the relationships between computer use and carpal tunnel syndrome among office workers, birth weight and hand osteoarthritis, and baseline balance and functional declines among older adults with knee pain. Prevention of arthritis and its complications is an active focus of investigation. Primary prevention research remains a challenge because of the prolonged time frame for disease expression. Scientific evidence continues to provide support for tertiary prevention strategies among people with documented rheumatic disease."

		"abstract": "To describe outcomes of treated Lyme arthritis in an endemic area of western Switzerland, where some of the first cases of Lyme disease outside the United States were reported. We retrospectively studied 24 patients (15 males and nine females, mean age 38.7 years) managed by rheumatologists between 1994 and 1999 for Borrelia burgdorferi arthritis manifesting as monoarthritis (n = 20), oligoarthritis (n = 3), or polyarthritis (n = 1). The knee was affected in 20 (85%) patients. Nine patients reported a history of tick bite and four of erythema chronicum migrans. All the patients but one had a high titer of antibodies to B. burgdorferi by ELISA and all but two had a positive immunoblot test (22 positive for all three types of B. burgdorferi found in Switzerland and one positive only for B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). Joint fluid PCR for B. burgdorferi was done in nine patients and was positive in six. All 24 patients received antibiotic therapy, orally (n = 10) or parenterally (n = 14). A second course of antibiotic therapy was used in four patients with persistent arthritis. A rapid response was noted in 13 patients. Intraarticular glucocorticoid therapy or a synoviorthesis was required in nine patients. After a mean follow-up of 40 months (range, 6-84 months), none of the patients had chronic arthritis but two reported persistent muscle or joint pain. Recurrent or chronic arthritis, which has been reported in treated patients in the United States, did not occur in our series. This may be ascribable to differences in B. burgdorferi subtypes, as in the United States only B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is found."

		"abstract": "Phospholipids are an important component of bacterial membranes. Borrelia burgdorferi differs from many other bacteria in that it contains only two major membrane phospholipids: phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). B. burgdorferi appears to lack enzymes required for synthesis of PC through the well-described methylation pathway. However, B. burgdorferi does contain a gene (BB0249) with significant identity to a recently described phosphatidylcholine synthase gene (pcs) of Sinorhizobium meliloti. B. burgdorferi also contains a gene (BB0721) with significant identity to the gene (pgs) encoding phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase, an enzyme in the synthetic pathway of PG. Activity of BB0249 was confirmed by cloning the gene into Escherichia coli, which does not produce PC. Transformation with a plasmid carrying BB0249 resulted in production of PC by E. coli, but only in the presence of exogenously supplied choline, as would be predicted for a Pcs. Because loss of Pgs activity is lethal to E. coli, activity of BB0721 was confirmed by the ability of BB0721 to complement an E. coli Pgs(-) mutant. A plasmid containing BB0721 was transformed into a Pgs(-) mutant of E. coli containing a copy of the native gene on a temperature-regulated plasmid. The temperature-regulated plasmid was exchanged for a plasmid containing BB0721 and it was shown that BB0721 was able to replace the lost Pgs function and restore bacterial growth. This study has established the existence and function of two critical enzymes in the synthesis of PC and PG in B. burgdorferi. Understanding of the biosynthetic pathways of PC and PG in B. burgdorferi is the first step in delineating the role of these phospholipids in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

The present study examined the hypothesis that the absence or presence of this antigen may play a role in the mode of B cell death induced by doxycycline. B cells, obtained from one HLA-DR7- (AL7N) and one HLA-DR7+ (MM7P) normal volunteers, were immortalized using Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). Doxycycline resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability which was not different between the two cell lines. DNA from the MM7P showed a strong internucleosomal fragmentation pattern consistent with apoptosis, while the AL7N showed a weaker pattern, when treated with doxycycline, 20 ug/ml, for 16 hours, a result confirmed with the TUNEL assay. In the MM7P, the level of inducible p53 peaked at 8 hours while no changes were observed in the AL7N. A much higher level of HLA class II and HLA-DR was observed in the AL7N cell line which was not affected by doxycycline. These results support the conclusion that doxycycline induces p53-dependent apoptosis in MM7P. Although doxycycline induces death in AL7N, the mode and mechanism require further study."

Aside from anecdotal and indirect evidence, little empirical evidence exists regarding what the U.S. public knows, says, or does about preventing LD. To examine knowledge, perceptions, and practices regarding prevention of tick bites and LD. In 1998, a random-digit-dial frame was used to collect a cross-sectional sample (n =1500) from the 48 coterminous states plus the District of Columbia, and an over-sample (n =250) from six states with the highest incidence of LD. Forty percent of respondents reported doing something to avoid being bitten by ticks. Less than half (41%) used insect repellent. Ninety-two percent of those who had heard about LD stated their likelihood of ever getting the disease was </=50 on a 100-point scale (mean=29; standard deviation, 23.5). Being somewhat to very concerned about being bitten by ticks was strongly associated with taking preventive measures (odds ratio, 8.34; 95% confidence interval, 6.29-11.06). Having seen ticks, being concerned about being bitten, perceiving insect repellent to be effective, having heard about LD, and knowing someone who had LD are the factors most predictive of specific tick-bite preventive behaviors (p <0.001). However, greater efforts are needed in promoting the effectiveness and safety of DEET-containing insect repellents."

Imaging plays a key role in early diagnosis of these diseases, which may be severe and potentially life threatening. Infection may be acquired by the hematogenous route, by infection from contiguous structures or from direct inoculation. Of available imaging techniques, CT and MRI offer the clinically most valuable methods of evaluating all the structures potentially involved in infection. Although many signs are non-specific, indication is given of where appearances raise strong suspicion of infection. The extent of the inflammatory process is well evaluated by imaging, particularly in terms of severity and morbidity of clinical sequelae, which may be severe. Early investigation is mandatory and as MRI presently has the key role in investigation, it should be employed at an early stage of clinical suspicion."

Coincidentally, patients with chronic, treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis develop an immune response against OspA, whereas those with acute Lyme disease usually do not. Treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis occurs in a subset of Lyme arthritis patients and is linked to HLA.DRB1*0401 (DR4) and related alleles. Recent work from our laboratory identified T cell crossreactivity between epitopes of OspA and lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1alpha(L) chain (LFA-1alpha(L)) in these patients. We generated a form of rOspA, FTK-OspA, in which the LFA-1alpha(L)/rOspA crossreactive T cell epitope was mutated to reduce the possible risk of autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals. FTK-OspA did not stimulate human or mouse DR4-restricted, WT-OspA-specific T cells, whereas it did stimulate antibody responses specific for WT-OspA that were similar to mice vaccinated WT-OspA. We show here that the protective efficacy of FTK-OspA is indistinguishable from that of WT-OspA in vaccination trials, as both C3H/HeJ and BALB/c FTK-OspA-vaccinated mice were protected from Bb infection. These data demonstrate that this rOspA-derived vaccine lacking the predicted cross-reactive T cell epitope, but retaining the capacity to elicit antibodies against infection, is effective in generating protective immunity."

The patient had no recent manifestation of Lyme borreliosis, but 15 years earlier had had an expanding erythematous lesion after a tick bite. The current infection resulted in massive joint swelling, elevated body temperature, dissemination of the graft, and transplant failure. Results of routine bacteriologic studies were negative. A diagnosis of Lyme arthritis was first considered following the detection of Borrelia-specific serum antibodies. Additional evidence was provided when borrelial DNA sequences were detected in the synovial fluid through polymerase chain reaction. The diagnosis was confirmed by culture of Borrelia burgdorferi from the synovial fluid. The possibility of a dormant borrelial infection should be considered in patients who undergo repair of cartilage defects with autologous chondrocyte transplantation. We recommend that synovial fluid and joint tissue be screened for the presence of viable Borrelia before transplantation of an autologous graft."

		"abstract": "Outer surface protein C (OspC) is a differentially expressed major surface lipoprotein of Borrelia burgdorferi. ospC is swiftly upregulated when spirochetes leave the Ixodes scapularis tick gut, migrate to the salivary gland, and exit the arthropod vector. Here we show that OspC strongly binds to the tick salivary gland, suggesting a role for OspC in spirochete adherence to this tissue. In vivo studies using a murine model of Lyme borreliosis showed that while OspC F(ab)(2) fragments did not influence either the viability of spirochetes or ospC gene expression, they did interfere with B. burgdorferi invasion of tick salivary glands. We then generated ospC knockout spirochetes in an infectious clone of B. burgdorferi and examined them within the vector. OspC-deficient or wild-type spirochetes persisted equally within the gut of unfed ticks and multiplied during the tick engorgement; however, unlike wild-type B. burgdorferi, the mutants were unable to invade salivary glands. Salivary gland colonization of OspC-deficient spirochetes was completely restored when this mutant was complemented in trans with a plasmid harboring the wild-type ospC gene. These studies conclusively demonstrate the importance of OspC in the invasion of tick salivary glands by B. burgdorferi, a critical step in the transmission of spirochetes from the arthropod vector to the mammalian host."

		"abstract": "An ideal vaccine delivery system would elicit persistent protection following a single administration, preferably by a noninvasive route, and be safe even in the face of immunosuppression, either inherited or acquired, of the recipient. We have exploited the unique life cycle of the autonomous parvoviruses to develop a nonproliferating vaccine platform that appears to both induce priming and continually boost a protective immune response following a single inoculation. A crippled parvovirus vector was constructed, based on a chimera between minute virus of mice (MVM) and LuIII, which expresses Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA) instead of its coat protein. The vector was packaged into an MVM lymphotropic capsid and inoculated into naive C3H/HeNcr mice. Vaccination with a single vector dose, either intravenously or intranasally, elicited high-titer anti-OspA-specific antibody that provided protection from live spirochete challenge and was sustained over the lifetime of the animal. Both humoral and cell-mediated Th(1) immunity was induced, as shown by anti-OspA immunoglobulin G2a antibody and preferential gamma interferon production by OspA-specific CD4(+) T cells."

		"abstract": "Development of a high level of sustained borreliacidal antibody is paramount for maintaining protection against infection with Borrelia burgdorferi. We show that production of borreliacidal antibody can be enhanced by preventing the effects of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma). When lymph node cells capable of producing borreliacidal antibody were cultured with anti-murine IFN-gamma, an eightfold increase in borreliacidal antibody production was obtained. However, anti-IFN-gamma treatment of these cells also enhanced their ability to adaptively induce arthritis. When anti-IFN-gamma-treated lymph node cells producing borreliacidal antibody were infused into C3H/HeJ mice and the mice were then challenged with B. burgdorferi, the mice developed severe destructive Lyme arthritis. Additional studies are needed to delineate the immune response responsible for the induction of arthritis and production of borreliacidal antibody. These studies are needed to ensure an effective and safe vaccine against infection with B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic disease caused by infection with various genospecies of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The organs most often affected are the skin, joints, the heart, and the central and peripheral nervous systems. Multiple neurological complications can occur, including aseptic meningitis, encephalopathy, facial nerve palsy, radiculitis, myelitis, and peripheral neuropathy. To investigate spinal cord involvement in the nonhuman primate (NHP) model of Lyme borreliosis, we inoculated 25 adult Macaca mulatta with B. burgdorferi sensu strictu strains N40 by needle (N=9) or by tick (N=4) or 297 by needle (N=2), or with B. burgdorferi genospecies garinii strains Pbi (N=4), 793 (N=2), or Pli (N=4) by needle. Immunosuppression either transiently (TISP) or permanently (IS) was used to facilitate establishment of infection. Tissues and fluids were collected at necropsy 7-24 weeks later. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used to study inflammation, and immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis to measure inflammation and localize spirochetes. The spirochetal load and C1q expression were measured by TaqMan RT-PCR. The results showed meningoradiculitis developed in only one of the 25 NHP's examined, TISP NHP 321 inoculated with B. garinii strain Pbi. Inflammation was localized to nerve roots, dorsal root ganglia, and leptomeninges but rarely to the spinal cord parenchyma itself. T cells and plasma cells were the predominant inflammatory cells. Significantly increased amounts of IgG, IgM, and C1q were found in inflamed spinal cord. Taqman RT-PCR found spirochetes in the spinal cord only in IS-NHP's, mostly in nerve roots and ganglia rather than in the cord parenchyma. C1q mRNA expression was significantly increased in inflamed spinal cord. This is the first comprehensive study of spinal cord involvement in Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate a potential role of different passerine birds species in Mazurian Lake region (northeast Poland) in the spread of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the spirochaete that causes Lyme disease. A total number of 1254 birds (representing 42 species) were captured during the 3-year study period. Blood samples were collected from birds and analyzed with a nested polymerase chain reaction technique in order to detect fragments of the pathogen DNA. Positive results were obtained in 4.2% of all blood samples. Specifically, B. burgdorferi s.l. were detected in tree pipit (Anthus Erivialis; 21.1% of 19 birds), dunnock (Prunella modularis; 15.8% of 19 birds), chaffinch (Fringilla coelebs; 12.7% of 166 birds), song thrush (Turdus philometos; 9.3% of 54 birds), nuthatch (Sitta euopea; 7.7% of 26 birds), hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothroustes; 6.7% of 15 birds), robin (Erithacus rebecula; 5.1% of 256 birds), blackbird (Turdus merula; 4.2% of 71 birds) and wren (Troglodytes troglodytes; 3.7% of 27 birds). Additionally, the incidence of the infection was analyzed in relation to the habitat in which the birds resided (mixed coniferous forest or alder swamp forest), months of the study (from April to October), age and sex, but the differences were not statistically significant."

		"abstract": "The etiologic agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, is capable of circumventing the immune defense of a variety of potential vertebrate hosts. Previous work has shown that interaction of host-derived complement regulators, factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1), with up to five complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) expressed by resistant B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates conferred complement resistance. In addition expression of CRASP-1 is directly correlated with complement resistance of Borrelia species. This work describes the functional characterization of BbCRASP-1 as the dominant factor H and FHL-1-binding protein of B. burgdorferi. The corresponding gene, zs7.a68, is located on the linear plasmid lp54 and is different from factor H-binding Erp proteins that are encoded by genes localized on circular plasmids (cp32). Deletion mutants of BbCRASP-1 were generated, and a high affinity binding site for factor H and FHL-1 was mapped to the C terminus of BbCRASP-1. Similarly, the predominant binding site of factor H and FHL-1 was localized to the short consensus repeat 7. Factor H and FHL-1 maintain their cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation when bound to BbCRASP-1, and factor H is up to 6-fold more efficient in mediating C3b conversion than FHL-1. In conclusion, BbCRASP-1 (i). binds the host complement regulators factor H and FHL-1 with high affinity, (ii). is the key molecule of the complement resistance of spirochetes, and (iii). is distinct from the Erp protein family. Thus, BbCRASP-1 most likely contributes to persistence of B. burgdorferi and to pathogenesis of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Specific pathogen-free dogs were experimentally infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto using nymphal or adult female Ixodes scapularis ticks artificially infected with spirochetes by capillary feeding. The ticks were capillary fed B. burgdorferi isolate 610, previously isolated from a dog with Lyme disease and grown in BSK medium. This isolate induced clinical signs in the dogs similar to those for dogs infested with ticks naturally infected with B. burgdorferi. Adult ticks were more efficient than nymphs in transmitting spirochetes to the dogs. One of five dogs infested with nymphal ticks capillary fed B. burgdorferi was skin biopsy culture and serologically positive, and demonstrated lameness. In contrast, all five dogs infested with adult female ticks that had been capillary fed with B. burgdorferi were culture and serologically positive, with one dog developing lameness. The immunoblot profiles of dogs challenged with female ticks infected by capillary feeding (8 weeks post challenge) were similar to immunoblots (4 weeks post challenge) from dogs challenged with naturally infected females collected in the field. These studies demonstrated that B. burgdorferi cultured in BSK medium can be capillary fed to either nymphal or adult female ticks under laboratory controlled conditions for the purpose of transmitting the spirochete to dogs during the tick's blood meal. This tick infection system would be useful for a controlled and defined challenge of vaccinated and non-vaccinated dogs for proper evaluation of vaccine efficacy, which is difficult to achieve using field-collected ticks. Furthermore, this system may also be useful for investigation of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, evaluation of the pathogenicity of new isolates of B. burgdorferi, or evaluation of antibiotic therapy."
