		"abstract": "In Sweden, the geographical distribution of Lyme borreliosis corresponds to that of its vector Ixodes ricinus. Both tick activity and the length of the vegetation period are determined by daily mean temperatures ≥5°C. We analysed the correspondence between the distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden, the start date, end date, and length of the vegetation period, and the distributions of tick habitat-associated plant species. The geographical distribution of I. ricinus in Sweden corresponds to a vegetation period averaging approximately 170 days, an early start (before May 1st) of spring, and to the distribution of black alder (Alnus glutinosa). Based on scenario models for these parameters, changes in the range and abundance of I. ricinus were projected for the periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070, and 2071-2100. We conclude that climate change during this century will probably increase the geographic range of I. ricinus as vegetation communities and mammals associated with high tick densities will increase their geographic ranges due to a markedly prolonged vegetation period. By the end of this century, the ranges of I. ricinus and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato may, in suitable habitats, encompass most of Sweden, Norway, and Finland as far as 70°N, except the mountainous regions. This will lead to an increased Lyme borreliosis risk in northern Scandinavia."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe and North America. In the hyperendemic Lyme disease regions of the eastern United States, nymphal Ixodes scapularis are the principal ticks transmitting the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). Approximately 25% of questing nymphs in endemic regions are infected with spirochetes. High throughput-sensitive and specific methods for testing nymphal I. scapularis for infection with B. burgdorferi are clearly needed. In the current study, we evaluated whether low-density microarrays could be adapted for the rapid and accurate detection and characterization of spirochetes in nymphal I. scapularis. Three different microarray platforms were developed and tested for the detection of spirochetes in ticks. They could both detect and differentiate different Borrelia genospecies, in one case detecting as few as a single copy of Borrelia DNA."

C3 knockout mice (C3-/-) and syngeneic C57Bl/6 wild-type (WT) mice were challenged with 5 different Borrelia species. After 2 weeks, quantitative PCR (qPCR), culture, histopathology, and immunofluorescence were performed on heart, joint, brain, bladder, and skin.

In joints of C3-/-, but not WT mice challenged with B. burgdorferi, spirochaetes were detected by qPCR. No other significant differences between C3-/- and WT mice were seen. Histopathology demonstrated concordance between borrelia load and inflammation score. Only after B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii infection, spirochaetes were detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. B. burgdorferi was cultured from heart, joint, bladder, and skin from all mice within 2 weeks. B. afzelii and B. bavariensis grew only from heart tissue from both C3-/- and WT mice after 2-6 weeks. The infectivity and pathogenicity of complement-resistant Borrelia strains is unchanged in complement-deficient mice. Complement-susceptible strains do not become infectious in the absence of C3."

Both tick species are considered enzootic vectors for spirochetal bacteria of the genus Borrelia and specifically for B. burgdorferi s.s., the pathogen most often attributed as the cause of Lyme disease in the USA. Laboratory testing of individual I. affinis and I. scapularis ticks for the presence of Borrelia DNA was accomplished by PCR, targeting 2 regions of the 16S-23S intergenic spacer. In I. affinis, Borrelia DNA was detected in 63.2% of 155 individual ticks. B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. bissettii were identified by DNA sequencing in 33.5% and 27.9% I. affinis, respectively. Statistical differences were found for sex distribution of Borrelia DNA between I. affinis females (76.8%) and I. affinis males (55.6%) where B. burgdorferi s.s. was more prevalent in females (44.6%) than in males (27.3%). In I. scapularis, 298 individually tested ticks yielded no Borrelia PCR-positive results. This study found a higher incidence of Borrelia spp. in I. affinis collected in coastal North Carolina as compared to previous reports for this tick species in other Southern states, highlighting the potential importance of I. affinis in the maintenance of the enzootic transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi s.l. in North Carolina. The lack of Borrelia DNA in I. scapularis highlights the need for additional studies to better define the transmission cycle for B. burgdorferi s.s. in the southeastern USA and specifically in the state of North Carolina."

Since they can carry infected ticks over long distances, they are also important covectors for Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes. To assess the role of different bird species in transmission and dispersal of Borrelia OspA types, we examined 191 Ixodes ricinus ticks from 99 birds, captured on a German conservation island in the Baltic Sea in spring 2007. Surprisingly, more than one third of the 27 positive samples were identified as B. afzelii. The cause for this unusually high prevalence remains unknown, indicating the need of further studies on bird-feeding ticks that should include a higher sample size."

		"abstract": "This work consists in a study of the links between alcohol, a psychoactive substance and different related epileptic manifestations in order to clarify predominant factors both on conceptual, clinical and therapeutic levels. If alcohol is a frequent risk factor for seizures, its scientific evidence is less clear and ad hoc literature is rich in controversies and not firmly supported by systematic surveys. Alcohol has variable roles in the physiopathological determinism of seizures, the nosographical status of which needs to be clarified: alcohol withdrawal seizures, alcoholic epilepsy, and sometimes symptomatic epilepsy caused by coincidental disorders. A synthesis of relevant literature describing the links between alcohol and epilepsy is illustrated by a clinical case: a patient admitted in our psychiatric ward for chronic alcoholism had had two seizures questioning their nosographical status. An infectious process with protean neurological manifestations, neuroborreliosis, was diagnosed. Three distinct clinical pictures illustrate the links between alcohol and epilepsy: the first, convulsive inebriation corresponds to a seizure during severe acute alcohol intoxication. The second deals with alcohol withdrawal seizures following a partial or complete sudden withdrawal of alcohol; these are the clinical features the most documented in the literature representing, with delirium tremens, the main complication of alcohol withdrawal. The third clinical picture, alcoholic epilepsy, is characterized by repetitive seizures in patients presenting alcohol abuse without former history of epilepsy or other potentially epileptic disorder, and without relationship to alcohol withdrawal or acute alcohol intoxication. Acute and chronic effects of alcohol on central nervous system have been depicted, while a unified classification of alcohol related seizures has been recently established by Bartolomei. This classification based on the Ballenger hypothesis of kindling (1978) could explain withdrawal and hazardous seizures as clinical expressions of the same epileptogenic process over different stages. Although theoretically criticized, such a model offers a conceptual interest while able to unify the varied understanding of convulsive crises related to alcohol, and a practical one, whilst being a basis for a therapeutic approach. Our clinical case illustrates the delay in the diagnosis established after two iterative generalized seizures, 72 hours after the beginning of a programmed weaning of a patient presenting alcohol dependency. If the withdrawal seizure hypothesis was underlined, some data led to symptomatic epilepsy. Firstly atypia, the well-supervised preventive treatment of convulsion did not avoid seizures. Secondly, the EEG showed focal anomalies strongly linked in the literature with a cerebral disorder, which was confirmed by MRI; thirdly, cognitive alterations, which are not usual in alcohol dependency, were observed clinically and confirmed by neuropsychological tests. Finally a neuroborreliosis was diagnosed, while the main neuropsychiatric complications of Lyme disease were described. In accordance with the recommendations made by some authors, it appeared legitimate to consider neuroborreliosis as a potential differential diagnosis of every atypical psychiatric disorder, the interest of such an identification laying in the existence of a specific treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multi-systemic disease caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The specific response is influenced by phenotypic characteristics of Borrelia, different antigen structure, their different geographic distribution, and the patient's capability to react to the infection. The immune response to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato develops relatively late, whereas in some patients it never develops. The immune response in the early phase of Lyme borreliosis is very similar to the one of healthy population. Clinical manifestation, detailed anamnesis and epidemiological data are crucial for making the diagnosis. The majority of patients in the late phase of Lyme borreliosis have IgG antibody response, which could be followed by IgM also throughout this period of time. The number of serologically positive findings increases with the duration of the infection. Specific borrelial antigens can be detected by a Western blot test. In patients with neuroborreliosis, antibodies could be synthesized only intrathecally. IgG and IgM antibody response can persist for many years after the treatment. There is no positive serological test, which could be the indicator of the disease activity on its own; even if it demonstrates high antibody titre. If there are no clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis, the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis should be primarily based on clinical findings, and serological results should be used only to confirm but not to make the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Specific antibodies from the IgM class can be proved in about 50% of patients, 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of primary infection, but an early administration of the antibiotics can postpone or inhibit that response. When interpreting the serological test results with high level of sensitivity and specificity used for making diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, it is necessary to take into consideration the seroprevalence in a certain region. In the population with a low prevalence of the disease, the tests will have a low positive predicative value, i.e. the probability of indicating the real disease will be lower. According to the recommendations given by the Centre for Disease Control in North America, all extreme and positive results of EA and IFA are to be confirmed by a Western blot test. The main problem in making diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is underestimation and overrating of the diagnosis. Not a single positive serologic test is the indicator of the disease activity on its own, regardless of the antibodies titre level, when clear clinical signs are scarce."

Medicine and health are the main topics of discussion on numerous forums and portals. Authors of the following article took the trouble to investigate Polish forums concerning Lyme disease. A typical Googlesearch of the Polish Internet reveals 77 forums with boreliosis threads. The largest (ca. 700 threads) and mostly quoted (26/77, which states for 34% all forums contained references to it) of all the forums is entitled 'borelioza' and it is hosted by Gazeta.pl (http:// forum.gazeta.pl/forum/71,1.html?f = 26140). It was founded and it is still run by the Boreliosis Patients Association. The Association disseminates ideas of ILADS, which presents boreliosis as a chronic, serious disease and also supports diagnostic and treating recommendations, contradictory to the standards of renowned medical authorities. People searching the Internet for the information on boreliosis are very likely to come across the webpages referring to the forum of the Association. As a result they might encounter faulty recommendations of ILADS. Members of the Association induce one another with hypochondriac fantasies of a disease, sometimes exceeding the limits of a delusion. The Association promotes faulty convictions about the internal \"enemy\"--boreliosis, incompetent and unfeeling doctors protecting it, and propose to unite in common defence. Such actions are a perfect encouragement for all somatization prone patients to undertake activities destructive to their health. It also leads to irrational social behaviour, which can be described as an induced hypochondria. The Internet has become a source of many unreliable information on boreliosis, which may potentially impose a serious threat to patients' health. While counselling the patients who affiliate their chronic symptoms with boreliosis, do not forget the possibility of induced anxiety disorder, hypochondria, or a propagated distrust to the doctors and pay more attention to the patients."

The relationship of the pajahuello tick (Ornithodoros coriaceus) to each of these bacterial zoonotic agents has not been reported. The primary bridging vector of both bacterial zoonotic agents to humans is the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). Because of the spatial and temporal overlap of D. occidentalis and O. coriaceus populations with those of I. pacificus in natural foci of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in northwestern California, we conducted field and laboratory studies to determine if the Pacific Coast tick or the pajahuello tick potentially may serve as secondary vectors of either bacterium. Our findings reconfirmed that wild-caught D. occidentalis ticks are infected infrequently with B. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum, but some adult ticks from dense woodlands or chaparral were found to contain 2 important veterinary pathogens for the first time (Anaplasma bovis, A. ovis). The high prevalence of A. bovis infection (4.3%, n=185 ticks) within chaparral-derived ticks suggests that D. occidentalis could be an efficient vector of this rickettsia. Experimental attempts to transmit borreliae or Anaplasma spp. that may have been present in >100 wild-caught D. occidentalis adults to naïve rabbits were unsuccessful. Anaplasma spp. were not detected in O. coriaceus, but one (4.3%) of 23 nymphs was infected with B. bissettii. This finding and an antecedent report of a B. burgdorferi-like spirochete from the same tick species demonstrate that O. coriaceus sometimes acquires and transstadially passes Lyme disease group spirochetes. I. pacificus nymphs inhabiting a woodland nidus of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum had a 5-fold higher prevalence of borreliae than adult ticks from the same generational cohort. In contrast to the results of preceding studies carried out at the same site, none of the nymphal or adult ticks was PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum. This suggests that the distribution of this rickettsia is highly focal or variable from year-to-year within this particular woodland."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme Borreliosis, an infectious multisystemic disease transmitted to humans by the Ixodes ticks bite. A possible association of Borrelia burgdorferi with localized scleroderma has been postulated. However, published data do not provide unequivocal results. Previous serologic analysis of patients with localized scleroderma in South American countries (including Venezuela), have been reported as yielding some reactivity. The present study looked for evidence of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in venezuelan patients with localized scleroderma, using the polymerase chain reaction to analyze 21 skin samples of patients with this skin condition. The results were negative in all the samples studied. Our data do not support an association of Borrelia burgdorferi infection and the sclerotic lesions of localized scleroderma; but do not rule out the possibility of a relationship between localized scleroderma and an unknown geno-specie of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, a different Borrelia specie or a different spirochetal organism, as the etiological agents of the skin lesions in this area."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick borne zoonotic infection, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. bacteria. For the transmission of the disease, the presence of ticks is a prerequisite. Lyme borreliosis mostly occurs in people and dogs, but it may occur in other animals. Ticks which carry B. burgdorferi s.l. in Serbia are of the Ixodes ricinus specis. In Serbia, Lyme disease was detected for the first time in the late '80-es. In dogs, clinical symptoms may occur even months after a tick bite, and include weakness, lymphadenopathy, fever, lameness, arthritis, etc. In our survey, we have observed tick and dog populations in the province of Vojvodina (northern part of Serbia). I. ricinus ticks were collected and examined for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in several chosen locations. In addition, blood samples were collected from house dogs and pets from the same locations, and analyzed for the presence of antibodies specific for B. burgdorferi s.l. The results showed a mean infection of ticks of 22.12%, and a mean seroprevalence of Lyme disease in dogs of 25.81%. We conclude that in Vojvodina there is an actual risk of Lyme borreliosis for other animals and humans, because of the persistence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in both tick and dog populations."

		"abstract": "The countries of the Balkan Peninsula have become the region with frequent outbreaks of the emerging and re-emerging diseases during the last decade of the 20th and the first decade of the 21st century. The majority of outbreaks were wildlife zoonotic, and vector-borne diseases, such as brucellosis, leptospirosis, listeriosis, tularemia, Q-fever, Lyme disease, anthrax, rabies, viral hemorrhagic fevers, sandfly fever, tick-borne encephalitis and leishmainiasis. Epidemiological factors determined by ecology of causative agents are often the most useful diagnostic clues. The recognition of evolving problems of emerging and re-emerging diseases emphasizes the need for the development of better laboratory diagnostic methods for the surveillance and tracking of the diseases, and for continued research of factors contributing to the transmission of the organisms. The continuous occurrence of previously unidentified infections requires prospective national strategies for timely recognition of the syndromes, causative agent identification, establishment of criteria and methods for the diagnosis, optimization of the treatment regime, and determination of successful approaches to prevention and control. Wildlife diseases surveillance in the most of the Balkan countries has been coordinated by the WHO since 1992. Although new technology and communication have extremely improved in the last decade, there is a need for optimal communication lines among the Balkan countries, better exploitation of communication technologies like the Internet and other media in the field of emerging diseases."

BYS is a new Brazilian tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato microorganisms that resembles features of Lyme disease (LD), except for its epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial particularities. From 60 patients' records with positive serology to B. burgdorferi done by ELISA and Western-blotting methods, 19 cases were diagnosed as having BYS, according to criteria adopted at LIM-17 HCFMUSP, the Brazilian Reference Laboratory for the research of BYS. The other 41 remaining patients displayed miscellaneous infections or auto-immune processes. The beginning of symptoms in BYS group varied from one day to six years, from the onset of the disease. Four of 19 patients were included in acute disease stage, and 15 in latent. General unspecific symptoms were identified in almost all cases, with high frequencies of fever (78.9%) and lymphadenomegaly (36.8%). Six patients had skin lesions (31.5%); six arthralgia or arthritis (31.5%) and eight neurological symptoms (42%). Interestingly, two patients showed antibodies directed to B. burgdorferi exclusively in cerebrospinal fluid. Since BYS is a new emergent Brazilian zoonosis and its diagnosis is sometimes complex, all the new knowledge about BYS must be scattered to Brazilian Medical specialists, aiming to teach them how to diagnose this amazing tick-borne disease and to avoid its progression to chronic irreversible sequels."

Flagging and trapping methods were used to collect ticks in forest area and culture medium was used to isolate the pathogen. Nested-PCR was used to detect the germ-carrying rate of ticks. More than 2200 ticks from six representative provinces were collected and 1000 ticks were used to isolate the pathogen. 13 Lyme disease spirochetes from ixodes persulcatus in Changbai, Jilin province and 9 Lyme disease spirochetes from ixodes granulatus in Daozhen, Guizhou province were identified. There were 1255 ticks used for PCR testing. Specific fragments of the Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks were found from the six representative provinces in China. The carrier rate was higher in Jilin (Changbai 27.08%, Tonghua 20.41%), Qinghai (Huzhu 25.06%, Huangnan 21.11%) and Guizhou (Daozhen 25.63%), than in Shanxi (Yuanqu 4.72%, Jiaocheng 3.64%). Result from the sequence analysis showed that the genotype belong to Borrelia garinii in Jilin, Qinghai, Gansu, Shanxi provinces but Borrelia valaisiana in Guizhou and Hunan provinces. Our data showed that there existed Lyme disease spirochetes in all the six representative provinces in China, but the carriying rates of ticks were different. Borrelia garinii was found in Shanxi province, and Borrelia valaisiana in Hunan province."

		"abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi dramatically upregulates outer surface protein C (OspC) in response to fresh bloodmeal during transmission from the tick vector to a mammal, and abundantly produces the antigen during early infection. As OspC is an effective immune target, to evade the immune system B. burgdorferi downregulates the antigen once the anti-OspC humoral response has developed, suggesting an important role for OspC during early infection. In this study, a borrelial mutant producing an OspC antigen with a 5-amino-acid deletion was generated. The deletion didn't significantly increase the 50% infectious dose or reduce the tissue bacterial burden during infection of the murine host, indicating that the truncated OspC can effectively protect B. burgdorferi against innate elimination. However, the deletion greatly impaired the ability of B. burgdorferi to disseminate to remote tissues after inoculation into mice. The study indicates that OspC plays an important role in dissemination of B. burgdorferi during mammalian infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease affecting humans, dogs, horses and other species. It is caused by infection with spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group which are transmitted to the mammalian host by infected ticks (Ixodes). Exposure to B. burgdorferi is commonly diagnosed by serological testing. The gold standard for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi is a two-step procedure of an ELISA followed by confirmatory Western blotting (WB). Here, we developed and validated a new bead-based multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in canine serum which combined the testing by ELISA and WB in a single quantitative test. B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA), OspC and OspF were expressed in E. coli. The recombinant proteins were coupled to fluorescent beads providing the matrix of the assay. Two sets of canine sera were used for validation of the multiplex assay. First, sera from 79 dogs with known ELISA and WB results were used to establish the conditions of the assay. These samples were selected to provide similar numbers of pre-tested sera ranging from negative to high positive results and included sera from vaccinated and/or naturally infected dogs. A high correlation was observed for detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the single and multiplex assays (n=79). Spearman's rank correlations were 0.93, 0.88 and 0.96 for OspA, OspC and OspF, respectively. Second, a total of 188 canine serum samples that were not tested previously were used for further multiplex assay validation. All samples were also blindly analyzed for antibodies to B. burgdorferi antigens by WB. The WB results provided a 'relative gold standard' for each antigen and were used to perform a receiver operating curve analysis. The areas under the curves were 0.93 for OspA, 0.82 for OspC, and 0.89 for OspF. Multiplex assay interpretation ranges for antibodies to all three B. burgdorferi antigens in canine serum were established by likelihood analysis. The diagnostic sensitivities of the individual OspA, OspC and OspF bead-based assays were 83%, 62% and 82%, respectively, and the diagnostic specificities were 90%, 89% and 86%, respectively. The new multiplex assay provides a sensitive and fully quantitative platform for the simultaneous evaluation of antibodies to B. burgdorferi OspA, OspC and OspF antigens and distinguishes between antibodies that originated from vaccination or natural exposure to B. burgdorferi."

The two cases illustrate the necessity of careful biochemical screening for neuroinflammatory/neuroinfectious conditions before an AD diagnosis is made and before clinical AD patients are included in trials of therapy that could impact the immune system.

This paper outlines the challenges overcome in the healthcare response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the development of sensitive laboratory tests for the AIDS virus, and the promotion of long-term combination antimicrobial regimens to effectively treat HIV disease. We suggest that similar challenges need to be overcome before the chronic form of Lyme disease can be successfully treated. Currently, diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease is hindered by the lack of a uniform case definition that adequately reflects the clinical presentation of the disease, poor laboratory test sensitivity, and high treatment failure rates using short-term monotherapy. Consequently the optimal treatment for patients with persistent symptoms of Lyme disease remains undefined. Although antibiotic monotherapy has been successful in treating early Lyme disease, the use of combination antibiotic therapy modelled on HIV treatment appears to be more effective for patients with persistent symptoms of tick-borne infection. Resolution of the controversy surrounding Lyme disease should lead to improved diagnosis and treatment modelled on the approach to HIV disease."

The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi has two plasmid-borne putative R-M genes, bbe02 and bbq67, whose presence limits transformation by shuttle vector DNA from Escherichia coli. We show that both the bbe02 and bbq67 loci in recipient B. burgdorferi limit transformation with shuttle vector DNA from E. coli, irrespective of its dam, dcm, or hsd methylation status. However, plasmid DNA purified from B. burgdorferi transformed naïve B. burgdorferi much more efficiently than plasmid DNA from E. coli, particularly when the bbe02 and bbq67 genotypes of the B. burgdorferi DNA source matched those of the recipient. We detected adenine methylation of plasmid DNA prepared from B. burgdorferi that carried bbe02 and bbq67. These results indicate that the bbe02 and bbq67 loci of B. burgdorferi encode distinct R-M enzymes that methylate endogenous DNA and cleave foreign DNA lacking the same sequence-specific modification. Our findings have basic implications for horizontal gene transfer among B. burgdorferi strains with distinct plasmid contents. Further characterization and identification of the nucleotide sequences recognized by BBE02 and BBQ67 will facilitate efficient genetic manipulation of this pathogenic spirochete."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis or \"neurological Lyme disease\" was evidenced in 2 of 23 patients submitted to strict criteria for case selection of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employing a two-tier test to detect antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi at a single institution. One patient had symptomatic polyradiculoneuritis, dysautonomia, and serological evidence of early infection; and another had symptomatic small fiber sensory neuropathy, distal polyneuropathy, dysautonomia, and serological evidence of late infection. In the remaining patients symptoms initially ascribed to Lyme disease were probably unrelated to B. burgdorferi infection. Our findings suggest early susceptibility and protracted involvement of the nervous system most likely due to the immunological effects of B. burgdorferi infection, although the exact mechanisms remain uncertain."

IFN-γ and IL-17 have been suggested to play an important role in the host defense against Borrelia, and in the immunopathology of Lyme disease. The caspase-1-dependent cytokine IL-1β has been linked to the generation of IL-17-producing T cells, whereas caspase-1-mediated IL-18 is crucial for IFN-γ production. In this study, we show by using knockout mice the role of inflammasome-activated caspase-1 in the regulation of cytokine responses by B. burgdorferi. Caspase-1-deficient cells showed significantly less IFN-γ and IL-17 production after Borrelia stimulation. A lack of IL-1β was responsible for the defective IL-17 production, whereas IL-18 was crucial for the IFN-γ production. Caspase-1-dependent IL-33 played no role in the Borrelia-induced production of IL-1β, IFN-γ or IL-17. In conclusion, we describe for the first time the role of the inflammasome-dependent caspase-1 activation of cytokines in the regulation of IL-17 production induced by Borrelia spp. As IL-17 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic Lyme disease, these data suggest that caspase-1 targeting may represent a new immunomodulatory strategy for the treatment of complications of late stage Lyme disease."

We present a 55-year-old male with aplastic anaemia which developed after 45 days of the therapy with 200 mg ticlopidine to prevent coronary thrombosis. The treatment with ticlopidine was withdrawn and broad spectrum antibiotics as well as transfusion of packed red cells, platelets and G-CSF were administered. Two weeks after the onset of the disease, the number of white blood cells dropped to 0.5 x 10(9)/l, along with drop of both haemoglobin concentration and the number of platelets. At that time, weakness of facial muscles due to bilateral facial nerve paralysis with Bell's phenomenon and after that weakness of muscles of both legs and signs of polyradiculoneuritis were developed. Western blot analysis of blood and liquor showed a high concentration of IgG and IgM antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. The treatment with cephtriaxone resulted in normalization of body temperature and gradual recovery of neurological findings. Blood picture became normal two months after the onset of the disease. The treatment with ticlopidine may result in different haematological complications such as agranulocytosis/ granulocytopaenia, thrombotic trombocytopenic purpura and rarely aplastic anaemia. Due to these complications blood pictures in patients on this therapy should be closely followed up and in case of complications, the treatment with ticlopidine has to be stopped and introduce the therapeutic procedures depending on the sort of the complications and clinical presentation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. Current diagnostic tests mostly use borrelial lysates or select antigens to detect serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi. These immunoassays are not entirely effective, especially for detection of early infection. We have recently characterized an in vivo-induced antigen, BBK07, as a serodiagnostic marker for LD. We now report that in a line blot assay, recombinant BBK07 protein-based detection is 90% sensitive and nearly 100% specific against B. burgdorferi infection in humans. Using an overlapping peptide library of 23 peptides encompassing full-length BBK07, we identified the immunodominant epitopes of BBK07 during human infection. We show that a select combination of amino-terminal peptides significantly enhanced BBK07-based diagnostic accuracy compared to that with the full-length protein. Although in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies BBK07 peptides had overall lower sensitivity than established serodiagnostic peptides, such as the VlsE peptide C6 and OspC peptide pepC10, for the detection of early human LD, a subset of serum samples that failed to recognize either VlsE or OspC peptides were preferentially reactive to BBK07 peptides. These results highlight the fact that BBK07 peptides could be useful to complement the efficacy of VlsE and OspC peptide-based serodiagnostic assays. Finally, using a panel of canine sera, we show that BBK07 peptide is also effective for LD diagnosis in infected dogs. Together, our data show that peptides from the B. burgdorferi surface protein BBK07 are highly specific and sensitive serodiagnostic markers, and we suggest their future use in LD diagnostic assays."

We studied the genetic diversity of LB spirochetes in north-coastal California residents. Spirochete DNA was detected in 23.7% (27/114) of the study subjects using a PCR protocol optimized for increased sensitivity in human sera. Californians were most commonly infected with B. burgdorferi ospC genotype A, a globally widespread spirochete associated with high virulence in LB patients. Sequence analysis of rrf-rrl and p66 loci in 11% (3/27) of the PCR-positive study subjects revealed evidence of infection with an organism closely related to B. bissettii. This spirochete, heretofore associated with LB only in Europe, is widely distributed among ticks and wildlife in North America. Further molecular testing of sera from residents in areas where LB is endemic is warranted to enhance our understanding of the geographic distribution and frequency of occurrence of B. bissettii-like infections."

History, physical examination and serologic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease. The patient refused antibiotic therapy during the first 2 years of her illness. During the next 2 years, she consulted a rheumatologist, but declined antibiotic therapy. She continued to have recurrent episodes of arthritis, following which she was successfully treated with doxycycline, given initially for 2 weeks, with a second, 4-week cycle administered 2 months later. This case illustrates the natural history of untreated Lyme disease, which is rarely observed in most patients since diagnosis almost always leads to successful antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, this case also demonstrates that infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can persist for years in untreated patients; however, antibiotic therapy is still likely to be effective, despite long-term infection."

		"abstract": "The genome of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, encodes a homolog (the bb0184 gene product) of the carbon storage regulator A protein (CsrA(Bb)); recent studies reported that CsrA(Bb) is involved in the regulation of several infectivity factors of B. burgdorferi. However, the mechanism involved remains unknown. In this report, a csrA(Bb) mutant was constructed and complemented in an infectious B31A3 strain. Subsequent animal studies showed that the mutant failed to establish an infection in mice, highlighting that CsrA(Bb) is required for the infectivity of B. burgdorferi. Western blot analyses revealed that the virulence-associated factors OspC, DbpB, and DbpA were attenuated in the csrA(Bb) mutant. The Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway (σ(54)-σ(S) sigma factor cascade) is a central regulon that governs the expression of ospC, dbpB, and dbpA. Further analyses found that the level of RpoS was significantly decreased in the mutant, while the level of Rrp2 remained unchanged. A recent study reported that the overexpression of BB0589, a phosphate acetyl-transferase (Pta) that converts acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), led to the inhibition of RpoS and OspC expression, suggesting that acetyl-phosphate is an activator of Rrp2. Along with this report, we found that CsrA(Bb) binds to the leader sequence of the bb0589 transcript and that the intracellular level of acetyl-CoA in the csrA(Bb) mutant was significantly increased compared to that of the wild type, suggesting that more acetyl-phosphate was being converted to acetyl-CoA in the mutant. Collectively, these results suggest that CsrA(Bb) may influence the infectivity of B. burgdorferi via regulation of acetate metabolism and subsequent activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway."

		"abstract": "The genome of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is comprised of a large linear chromosome and numerous smaller linear and circular plasmids. B. burgdorferi exhibits substantial genomic variation, and previous studies revealed genotype-specific variation at the right chromosomal telomere. A correlation has also been established between genotype and invasiveness. The correlation between chromosome length and genotype and between genotype and invasiveness suggested that a gene(s) at the right chromosome telomere may be required for virulence. Of particular interest was bb0844, an RpoS-regulated gene at the right telomere, the expression of which is induced when the spirochete undergoes adaptation to the mammalian host. The structure of the right chromosomal telomere was examined in 53 B. burgdorferi clinical isolates of various genotypes. Four distinct patterns were observed for bb0844: (i) chromosomal localization, (ii) plasmid localization, (iii) presence on both chromosome and plasmid, and (iv) complete absence. These patterns correlated with the B. burgdorferi genotype. On the basis of available sequence data, we propose a mechanism for the genomic rearrangements that accounts for the variability in bb0844 genomic localization. To further explore the role of BB0844 in the spirochete life cycle, a bb0844 deletion mutant was constructed by allelic exchange, and the viability of wild-type and bb0844 deletion mutants was examined in an experimental mouse-tick infection model. The bb0844 mutant was fully infectious in C3H/HeJ mice by either needle inoculation or tick transmission with B. burgdorferi-infected Ixodes scapularis larvae. Naïve larval ticks acquired both wild-type and mutant spirochetes with equal efficiency from B. burgdorferi-infected mice. The results demonstrate that BB0844 is not required for spirochete viability, pathogenicity, or maintenance in the tick vector or the mammalian host. At present, a defined role for BB0844 in B. burgdorferi cannot be ascertained."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is the most widespread tick-borne infection in the northern hemisphere that results in a multistage disorder with concomitant pathology, including arthritis. During late-stage experimental infection in mice, B. burgdorferi evades the adaptive immune response despite the presence of borrelia-specific bactericidal antibodies. In this study we asked whether B. burgdorferi could invade fibroblasts or endothelial cells as a mechanism to model the avoidance from humorally based clearance. A variation of the gentamicin protection assay, coupled with the detection of borrelial transcripts following gentamicin treatment, indicated that a portion of B. burgdorferi cells were protected in the short term from antibiotic killing due to their ability to invade cultured mammalian cells. Long-term coculture of B. burgdorferi with primary human fibroblasts provided additional support for intracellular protection. Furthermore, decreased invasion of B. burgdorferi in murine fibroblasts that do not synthesize the β(1) integrin subunit was observed, indicating that β(1)-containing integrins are required for optimal borrelial invasion. However, β(1)-dependent invasion did not require either the α(5)β(1) integrin or the borrelial fibronectin-binding protein BBK32. The internalization of B. burgdorferi was inhibited by cytochalasin D and PP2, suggesting that B. burgdorferi invasion required the reorganization of actin filaments and Src family kinases (SFK), respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that B. burgdorferi can invade and retain viability in nonphagocytic cells in a process that may, in part, help to explain the phenotype observed in untreated experimental infection."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease in North America, is an invasive pathogen that causes persistent multiorgan manifestations in humans and other mammals. Genetic studies of this bacterium are complicated by the presence of multiple plasmid replicons, many of which are readily lost during in vitro culture. The analysis of B. burgdorferi plasmid content by plasmid-specific PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis or other existing techniques is informative, but these techniques are cumbersome and challenging to perform in a high-throughput manner. In this study, a PCR-based Luminex assay was developed for determination of the plasmid content of the strain B. burgdorferi B31. This multiplex, high-throughput method allows simultaneous detection of the plasmid contents of many B. burgdorferi strains in a 96-well format. The procedure was used to evaluate the occurrence of plasmid loss in 44 low-passage B. burgdorferi B31 clones and in a library of over 4,000 signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) transposon mutant clones. This analysis indicated that only 40% of the clones contained all plasmids, with (in order of decreasing frequency) lp5, lp56, lp28-1, lp25, cp9, lp28-4, lp28-2, and lp21 being the most commonly missing plasmids. These results further emphasize the need for careful plasmid analysis in Lyme disease Borrelia studies. Adaptations of this approach may also be useful in the evaluation of plasmid content and chromosomal gene variations in additional Lyme disease Borrelia strains and other organisms with variable genomes and in the correlation of these genetic differences with pathogenesis and other biological properties."

In the current study, we investigated the prevalence of Bb in ticks that had bitten humans and the risk of developing LB from Bb-infected ticks. Health questionnaires, blood samples, and ticks were collected from 394 tick-bitten study subjects in the County of Östergötland, Sweden, at the time of the tick bite. Questionnaires and blood samples were also collected 3 months later. Ticks were screened for Bb DNA with PCR, while sera were analyzed for antibodies against Bb using two ELISA assays. Seroconversion, i.e., an at least two-fold increase in anti-Bb antibodies after 3 months, was confirmed using a Strip-Immunoassay. Seventy-five of 397 ticks collected from the study subjects were determined to be Bb-positive. Sixty-four of the tick-bitten subjects had been bitten by Bb-infected ticks. Four of them showed seroconversion and were therefore considered to have an active Bb infection. None of these four subjects had sought health care due to symptoms, but one reported symptoms. Our data suggest that the risk of developing LB after being bitten by a Bb-infected tick is low, and asymptomatic Bb infections appear to be more frequent than symptomatic infections."

SAM is also essential for synthesis of polyamines, N-acylhomoserine lactone (autoinducer-1), and production of vitamins and other biomolecules formed by SAM radical reactions. MTA, SAH and 5'-deoxyadenosine (5'dADO) are product inhibitors of these reactions, and are substrates of MTA/SAH nucleosidase, underscoring its importance in a wide array of metabolic reactions. Inhibition of this enzyme by certain substrate analogues also limits synthesis of autoinducers and hence causes reduction in biofilm formation and may attenuate virulence. Interestingly, the inhibitors of MTA/SAH nucleosidase are very effective against the Lyme disease causing spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which uniquely expresses three homologous functional enzymes. These results indicate that inhibition of this enzyme can affect growth of different bacteria by affecting different mechanisms. Therefore, new inhibitors are currently being explored for development of potential novel broad-spectrum antimicrobials."

		"abstract": "Currently there is much controversy whether to treat idiopathic facial palsy with corticosteroids with sparse data on the natural course of the disease in children. We performed a prospective study on all children <15 years of age who were admitted to our unit for facial palsy between 1st July 1998 to 30th June 2008. All patients received a standardized work-up and follow-up. Therapy consisted of symptomatic treatment either with (in case of neuroborreliosis) or without a 14 day course of intravenous antibiotics. 106 patients were included in our study. The calculated incidence for facial palsy was 21.1/100000/year for children <15 years. The incidence for neuroborreliosis (NB) in this age group was calculated to be 4.9/100000/year. The overall rate of complete recovery was 97.6% with significantly faster recovery in younger children and in patients with NB as compared to idiopathic facial palsy. Both patients with incomplete recovery were at least 14 years old and presented late in the course of the disease. Based on the rate of 97.6% spontaneous complete recovery we believe that the routine use of corticosteroids in children with facial palsy is not justified, unless there is new data from controlled trials in children."

Here we report a case of an erythema resembling the erythema migrans manifestation of Lyme disease, but with atypical symptoms like persistent pruritus. The patient had no history of a recent tick-bite but displayed a positive serology for an advanced stage of Lyme borreliosis, which stood in contrast to the clinical manifestation of erythema migrans as a symptom of early Lyme disease. Three skin swabs and soil samples, collected in the area where the patient possibly acquired the infection, were examined by bacterial and fungal culture methods. Microorganisms were identified by using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The patient and soil isolates were compared by employing RAPD analysis. The serum samples of the patient were examined by immunoblotting. Arthrobacter mysorens, a soil bacterium, was isolated from the collected skin and soil samples. The identity of both isolates was determined by molecular fingerprinting methods. A. mysorens was proven to be causative for the erythema by direct isolation from the affected skin and a positive serology, thus explaining the atypical appearance of the erythema compared to erythema migrans caused by Borrelia infection. Infections with A. mysorens might be underreported and microbiological diagnostic techniques should be applied in cases of patients with unclear erythemas, resembling erythema migrans, without a history of tick bites."

		"abstract": "Ticks are vectors of a wide variety of pathogens causing severe diseases in humans and domestic animals. Intestinal digestion of the host blood is an essential process of tick physiology and also a limiting factor for pathogen transmission since the tick gut represents the primary site for pathogen infection and proliferation. Using the model tick Ixodes ricinus, the European Lyme disease vector, we have previously demonstrated by genetic and biochemical analyses that host blood is degraded in the tick gut by a network of acidic peptidases of the aspartic and cysteine classes. This study reveals the digestive machinery of the I. ricinus during the course of blood-feeding on the host. The dynamic profiling of concentrations, activities and mRNA expressions of the major digestive enzymes demonstrates that the de novo synthesis of peptidases triggers the dramatic increase of the hemoglobinolytic activity along the feeding period. Overall hemoglobinolysis, as well as the activity of digestive peptidases are negligible at the early stage of feeding, but increase dramatically towards the end of the slow feeding period, reaching maxima in fully fed ticks. This finding contradicts the established opinion that blood digestion is reduced at the end of engorgement. Furthermore, we show that the digestive proteolysis is localized intracellularly throughout the whole duration of feeding. Results suggest that the egressing proteolytic system in the early stage of feeding and digestion is a potential target for efficient impairment, most likely by blocking its components via antibodies present in the host blood. Therefore, digestive enzymes are promising candidates for development of novel 'anti-tick' vaccines capable of tick control and even transmission of tick-borne pathogens."

Here we report on patients with other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in whom borreliae were isolated from their blood. This is a retrospective review of the medical files of patients diagnosed with borrelial lymphocytoma, Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the UMC Ljubljana, Slovenia, for whom a borrelia blood culture was ordered. The clinical features of patients whose blood culture tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were reviewed, and the association between the proportion of patients with a positive blood culture and various clinical manifestations was examined. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was isolated from the blood of 1/53 (1.9%) patients with borrelial lymphocytoma, 6/176 (3.4%) patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, 1/13 (7.7%) patients with Lyme arthritis, and 3/200 (1.5%) patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The time interval from the onset of symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis and the blood culture ranged from 1 day to >2 years (median 3.5 weeks). At the time of the blood culture, erythema migrans was present in 4/11 (36.4%) borrelia blood culture-positive patients, i.e. in the patient with borrelial lymphocytoma, the patient with Lyme arthritis and the 2/6 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis. Only two of these 11 (18.2%) patients had fever at the time of the blood culture. In European patients with Lyme borreliosis, borreliae can be cultured from the blood not only early in the course of the disease but also occasionally later during disease progression."

Serum samples and skin biopsy specimens were collected from 95 patients: 85 with suspected Lyme disease and 10 controls. Infection with Borrelia burgdorferi was verified by Western immunoblot analysis and isolation of the Borrelia spirochetes from skin biopsy specimens. The genetic identities of these isolated spirochetes were determined by analyzing the gene sequences amplified by polymerase chain reaction assay based on the 5S (rrf)-23S (rrl) intergenic spacer amplicon gene of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Serological evidence of B. burgdorferi infection was confirmed by elevated IgG and IgM antibodies against the major protein antigens of B. burgdorferi. Borrelia spirochetes were isolated from the skin biopsies of two patients. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these detected spirochetes were genetically affiliated to the genospecies Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and Borrelia afzelii, with a high sequence homology within the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (98.7-100%) and B. afzelii (100%), respectively. This study provides convincing evidence of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii isolated and identified for the first time in Taiwan, and highlights the significance of genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes among patients in Taiwan."

		"abstract": "Tick saliva has potent immunomodulatory properties. In arthropod-borne diseases, this effect is largely used by microorganisms to increase their pathogenicity and to evade host immune responses. We show that in Lyme borreliosis, tick salivary gland extract and a tick saliva protein, Salp15, inhibit in vitro keratinocyte inflammation induced by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto or by the major outer surface lipoprotein of Borrelia, OspC. Chemokines (interleukin-8 [IL-8] and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1]) and several antimicrobial peptides (defensins, cathelicidin, psoriasin, and RNase 7) were downregulated. Interestingly, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) transiently inhibited bacterial motility but did not kill the organisms when tested in vitro. We conclude that tick saliva affects the chemotactic properties of chemokines and AMPs on immune cells and has an antialarmin effect on human primary keratinocytes. Alarmins are mediators that mobilize and activate antigen-presenting cells. Inhibition of cutaneous innate immunity and of the migration of immune cells to the site of the tick bite ensures a favorable environment for Borrelia. The bacterium can then multiply locally and, subsequently, disseminate to the target organs, including joints, heart, and the central nervous system."

To address these issues we developed a general strategy termed shotgun glycomics. We focus on glycosphingolipids (GSLs), a class of glycoconjugates that is challenging to study, recognized by toxins, antibodies and GBPs. We derivatized GSLs extracted from cells with a heterobifunctional fluorescent tag suitable for covalent immobilization. We separated fluorescent GSLs by multidimensional chromatography, quantified them and coupled them to glass slides to create GSL shotgun microarrays. Then we interrogated the microarrays with cholera toxin, antibodies and sera from individuals with Lyme disease to identify biologically relevant GSLs that we subsequently characterized by mass spectrometry. Shotgun glycomics incorporating GSLs and potentially glycoprotein-derived glycans is an approach for accessing the complex glycomes of animal cells and is a strategy for focusing structural analyses on functionally important glycans."

She was referred to cardiology for consideration of permanent pacemaker implantation. Given her facial nerve palsy and AV block, a diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was suspected. Within 48 hours of initiation of ceftriaxone, she reverted to sinus rhythm, albeit with a marked first-degree AV block. Subsequent serology confirmed the diagnosis. Reversible causes of complete AV block should always be considered and appropriate therapy may avoid the need for permanent pacemaker insertion."

		"abstract": "Ticks are distributed worldwide and affect human and animal health by transmitting diverse infectious agents. Effective vaccines against most tick-borne pathogens are not currently available. In this study, we characterized a tick histamine release factor (tHRF) from Ixodes scapularis and addressed the vaccine potential of this antigen in the context of tick engorgement and B. burgdorferi transmission. Results from western blotting and quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR showed that tHRF is secreted in tick saliva, and upregulated in Borrelia burgdorferi-infected ticks. Further, the expression of tHRF was coincident with the rapid feeding phase of the tick, suggesting a role for tHRF in tick engorgement and concomitantly, for efficient B. burgdorferi transmission. Silencing tHRF by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly impaired tick feeding and decreased B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Interfering with tHRF by actively immunizing mice with recombinant tHRF, or passively transferring tHRF antiserum, also markedly reduced the efficiency of tick feeding and B. burgdorferi burden in mice. Recombinant tHRF was able to bind to host basophils and stimulate histamine release. Therefore, we speculate that tHRF might function in vivo to modulate vascular permeability and increase blood flow to the tick bite-site, facilitating tick engorgement. These findings suggest that blocking tHRF might offer a viable strategy to complement ongoing efforts to develop vaccines to block tick feeding and transmission of tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "The identification of the Tick Borne Relapsing Fever (TBRF) agent in Israel and the Palestinian Authority relies on the morphology and the association of Borrelia persica with its vector Ornithodoros tholozani. Molecular based data on B. persica are very scarce as the organism is still non-cultivable. In this study, we were able to sequence three complete 16S rRNA genes, 12 partial flaB genes, 18 partial glpQ genes, 16 rrs-ileT intergenic spacers (IGS) from nine ticks and ten human blood samples originating from the West Bank and Israel. In one sample we sequenced 7231 contiguous base pairs that covered completely the region from the 5'end of the 16S rRNA gene to the 5'end of the 23S rRNA gene comprising the whole 16S rRNA (rrs), and the following genes: Ala tRNA (alaT), Ile tRNA (ileT), adenylosuccinate lyase (purB), adenylosuccinate synthetase (purA), methylpurine-DNA glycosylase (mag), hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hpt), an hydrolase (HAD superfamily) and a 135 bp 5' fragment of the 23S rRNA (rrlA) genes. Phylogenic sequence analysis defined all the Borrelia isolates from O. tholozani and from human TBRF cases in Israel and the West Bank as B. persica that clustered between the African and the New World TBRF species. Gene organization of the intergenic spacer between the 16S rRNA and the 23S rRNA was similar to that of other TBRF Borrelia species and different from the Lyme disease Borrelia species. Variants of B. persica were found among the different genes of the different isolates even in the same sampling area."

		"abstract": "Current unprecedented declines in biodiversity reduce the ability of ecological communities to provide many fundamental ecosystem services. Here we evaluate evidence that reduced biodiversity affects the transmission of infectious diseases of humans, other animals and plants. In principle, loss of biodiversity could either increase or decrease disease transmission. However, mounting evidence indicates that biodiversity loss frequently increases disease transmission. In contrast, areas of naturally high biodiversity may serve as a source pool for new pathogens. Overall, despite many remaining questions, current evidence indicates that preserving intact ecosystems and their endemic biodiversity should generally reduce the prevalence of infectious diseases."

A 51 year old woman previously diagnosed with HIV presented with an atypical and severe LNB. Diagnosis was made evident by several microbiological techniques. Biochemical and microbiological recovery during treatment was rapid, however after treatment the patient suffered from severe and persistent sequelae. A clinician should consider LNB when being confronted with an HIV patient with focal encephalitis, without any history of Lyme disease or tick bites, in an endemic area.

True infection or immunologic status of samples was assessed by use of results of necropsy, an antigen assay for D immitis, and immunofluorescence assay or western blot analysis for antibodies against B burgdorferi, E canis, and A phagocytophilum. Sensitivity and specificity of the in-clinic ELISA for detection of heartworm antigen (99.2% and 100%, respectively), antibodies against B burgdorferi (98.8% and 100%, respectively), and antibodies against E canis (96.2% and 100%, respectively) were similar to results for a similar commercial ELISA. In samples obtained from dogs in the northeast and upper Midwest of the United States, sensitivity and specificity of the in-clinic ELISA for antibodies against Anaplasma spp were 99.1% and 100%, respectively, compared with results for an immunofluorescence assay. Samples from 2 dogs experimentally infected with the NY18 strain of A phagocytophilum were tested by use of the in-clinic ELISA, and antibodies against A phagocytophilum were detected by 8 days after inoculation. Antibodies against Anaplasma platys in experimentally infected dogs cross-reacted with the A phagocytophilum analyte. Coinfections were identified in several of the canine serum samples. The commercially available in-clinic ELISA could be used by veterinarians to screen dogs for heartworm infection and for exposure to tick-borne pathogens."

		"abstract": "Western blotting (WB; immunoblotting) is a widely used tool for the serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis (LB), but so far, no generally accepted criteria for its performance and interpretation have been established in China. The present study was designed to determine the criteria for standardized Western blot for the predominant species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in China, in which WB was produced with strain PD₉₁ as the representative strain attributed to predominant genospecies Borrelia garinii of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Approximately 13 bands between 14 and 100 kD were differentiated for strain PD₉₁ by using Gel-Pro analysis software. In a study with 631 serum samples (taken from 127 patients with Lyme borreliosis and 504 controls), all observed bands were documented. To establish criteria for a positive WB result for strain PD₉₁, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used. The following interpretation criteria were recommended: for IgG, at least one band of P83/100, P58, P39, P30, OspC, P17, P66, and OspA; for IgM, at least one band of P83/100, P58, OspA, P30, OspC, P17 or P41. In addition, syphilis, leptospirosis and other related diseases should be excluded when the positive band is P41 in IgM. For IgG criteria, the sensitivity is 73.2%, the specificity is 99.4% and Youden index is 0.726; for IgM criteria, the sensitivity is 50.6%, the specificity is 93.1% and Youden index is 0.437. Standardization of WB assays is necessary for comparison of results from different laboratories. Moreover, the criteria of other genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato should be determined in the future to complete the criteria of WB for the diagnosis of the Lyme disease in China."

		"abstract": "Several infectious agents may cause arthritis or arthropathy. For example, infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, may in the late phase manifest as arthropathy. Infections with Campylobacter, Salmonella, or Yersinia may result in a postinfectious reactive arthritis. Acute infection with parvovirus B19 (B19V) may likewise initiate transient or chronic arthropathy. All these conditions may be clinically indistinguishable from rheumatoid arthritis. Here, we present evidence that acute B19V infection may elicit IgM antibodies that are polyspecific or cross-reactive with a variety of bacterial antigens. Their presence may lead to misdiagnosis and improper clinical management, exemplified here by two case descriptions. Further, among 33 subjects with proven recent B19V infection we found IgM enzyme immunoassay (EIA) positivity for Borrelia only; for Borrelia and Salmonella; for Borrelia and Campylobacter; and for Borrelia, Campylobacter, and Salmonella in 26 (78.7%), 1 (3%), 2 (6%), and 1 (3%), respectively; however, when examined by Borrelia LineBlot, all samples were negative. These antibodies persisted over 3 months in 4/13 (38%) patients tested. Likewise, in a retrospective comparison of the results of a diagnostic laboratory, 9/11 (82%) patients with confirmed acute B19V infection showed IgM antibody to Borrelia. However, none of 12 patients with confirmed borreliosis showed any serological evidence of acute B19V infection. Our study demonstrates that recent B19V infection can be misinterpreted as secondary borreliosis or enteropathogen-induced reactive arthritis. To obtain the correct diagnosis, we emphasize caution in interpretation of polyreactive IgM and exclusion of recent B19V infection in patients examined for infectious arthritis or arthropathy."

		"abstract": "In a countrywide investigation of the ecological factors that contribute to Lyme borreliosis risk, a longitudinal study on population dynamics of the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus and their infections with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) was undertaken at 24 sites in The Netherlands from July 2006 to December 2007. Study sites were mature forests, dune vegetations, or new forests on land reclaimed from the sea. Ticks were sampled monthly and nymphal ticks were investigated for the presence of Borrelia spp. I. ricinus was the only tick species found. Ticks were found in all sites, but with significant spatial and temporal variations in density between sites. Peak densities were found in July and August, with lowest tick numbers collected in December and January. In some sites, questing activities of I. ricinus nymphs and adults were observed in the winter months. Mean monthly Borrelia infections in nymphs varied from 0% to 29.0% (range: 0%-60%), and several sites had significantly higher mean nymphal Borrelia infections than others. Four genospecies of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. were found, with B. afzelii being dominant at most sites. Borrelia infection rates in nymphal ticks collected in July, September, and November 2006 were significantly higher (23.7%, p<0.01) than those in the corresponding months of 2007 (9.9%). The diversity in Borrelia genospecies between sites was significantly different (p<0.001). Habitat structure (tree cover) was an effective discriminant parameter in the determination of Borrelia infection risk, as measured by the proportion of nymphal ticks infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. Thickness of the litter layer and moss cover were positively related to nymphal and adult tick densities. The study shows that Borrelia-infected ticks are present in many forest and dune areas in The Netherlands and suggests that in such biotopes, which are used for a wide variety of recreational activities, the infection risk is high."

The peptides presented by HLA-DR molecules in synovia have not previously been defined. Using tandem mass spectrometry, rigorous database searches, and manual spectral interpretation, we identified 1,427 HLA-DR-presented peptides (220-464 per patient) from the synovia of four patients, two diagnosed with RA and two diagnosed with LA. The peptides were derived from 166 source proteins, including a wide range of intracellular and plasma proteins. A few epitopes were found only in RA or LA patients. However, two patients with different diseases who had the same HLA allele had the largest number of epitopes in common. In one RA patient, peptides were identified as originating from source proteins that have been reported to undergo citrullination under other circumstances, yet neither this post-translational modification nor anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies were detected. Instead, peptides with the post-translational modification of S-cysteinylation were identified. We conclude that a wide range of proteins enter the HLA-DR pathway of antigen-presenting cells in the patients' synovial tissue, and their HLA-DR genotype, not the disease type, appears to be the primary determinant of their HLA-DR-peptide repertoire. New insights into the naturally presented HLA-DR epitope repertoire in target tissues may allow the identification of pathogenic T cell epitopes, and this could lead to innovative therapeutic interventions."

		"abstract": "The article outlines examples of a viral (varicella-zoster virus, VZV), a bacterial (Lyme borreliosis) and a parasitic (scabies) infection in pregnancy with their risk for the mother and/or child as well as their management. VZV infections cause various clinical scenarios depending on the maternal immune status and the time of infection. Herpes zoster usually poses no risk to the pregnant woman and there is no need for antiviral therapy. VZV infection of a seronegative mother, however, may lead to severe varicella in the pregnant woman and to congenital malformations (congenital varicella syndrome) in case of early infection or neonatal varicella in case of perinatal infection. Prompt therapy with acyclovir or administration of VZV immunoglobulin for prophylaxis is mandatory in those patients. In case of Lyme borreliosis of the mother, adequate antibiotic therapy with amoxicillin prevents harm to the fetus. Doxycycline is contraindicated during pregnancy. Scabies represents an important differential diagnosis of pruritic dermatoses in pregnancy and should be treated with permethrin 5% cream."

		"abstract": "Carbon storage regulator A (CsrA) is an RNA binding protein that has been characterized in many bacterial species to play a central regulatory role by modulating several metabolic processes. We recently showed that a homolog of CsrA in Borrelia burgdorferi (CsrA(Bb), BB0184) was upregulated in response to propagation of B. burgdorferi under mammalian host-specific conditions. In order to further delineate the role of CsrA(Bb), we generated a deletion mutant designated ES10 in a linear plasmid 25-negative isolate of B. burgdorferi strain B31 (ML23). The deletion mutant was screened by PCR and Southern blot hybridization, and a lack of synthesis of CsrA(Bb) in ES10 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of ES10 propagated at pH 6.8/37°C revealed a significant reduction in the levels of OspC, DbpA, BBK32, and BBA64 compared to those for the parental wild-type strain propagated under these conditions, while there were no significant changes in the levels of either OspA or P66. Moreover, the levels of two regulatory proteins, RpoS and BosR, were also found to be lower in ES10 than in the control strain. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis of total RNA extracted from the parental strain and csrA(Bb) mutant revealed significant differences in gene expression consistent with the changes at the protein level. Neither the csrA(Bb) mutant nor the trans-complemented strain was capable of infection following intradermal needle inoculation in C3H/HeN mice at either 10³ or 10⁵ spirochetes per mouse. The further characterization of molecular basis of regulation mediated by CsrA(Bb) will provide significant insights into the pathophysiology of B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "A 12-year-old Thoroughbred was examined because of signs of depression, neck stiffness, and poor performance. Physical examination revealed that the horse was dull, appeared depressed, was reluctant to raise its neck and head above a horizontal plane, and had a temperature of 38.5°C (101.3°F). No radiographic or scintigraphic abnormalities of the neck were found; however, high plasma fibrinogen concentration and relative lymphopenia were identified and the horse was seropositive for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi. Analysis of CSF revealed neutrophilic inflammation, and results of a PCR assay of CSF for B burgdorferi DNA were positive. Immunologic testing revealed severe B-cell lymphopenia and a low serum IgM concentration consistent with common variable immunodeficiency. The horse responded well to do×ycycline treatment (10 mg/kg [4.5 mg/lb], PO, q 12 h for 60 days) and returned to normal exercise. However, 60 days after treatment was discontinued, the horse again developed a stiff neck and rapidly progressive neurologic deficits, including severe ataxia and vestibular deficits. The horse's condition deteriorated rapidly despite IV oxytetracycline treatment, and the horse was euthanatized. Postmortem examination revealed leptomeningitis, lymphohistiocytic leptomeningeal vasculitis, cranial neuritis, and peripheral radiculoneuritis with Wallerian degeneration; findings were consistent with a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. Nervous system infection with B burgdorferi should be considered in horses with evidence of meningitis and high or equivocal serum anti-B burgdorferi antibody titers. Evaluation of immune function is recommended in adult horses evaluated because of primary bacterial meningitis."

		"abstract": "We examined global changes in protein expression in the B31 strain of Borrelia burgdorferi, in response to two environmental cues (pH and temperature) chosen for their reported similarity to those encountered at different stages of the organism's life cycle. Multidimensional nano-liquid chromatographic separations coupled with tandem mass spectrometry were used to examine the array of proteins (i.e., the proteome) of B. burgdorferi for different pH and temperature culture conditions. Changes in pH and temperature elicited in vitro adaptations of this spirochete known to cause Lyme disease and led to alterations in protein expression that are associated with increased microbial pathogenesis. We identified 1,031 proteins that represent 59% of the annotated genome of B. burgdorferi and elucidated a core proteome of 414 proteins that were present in all environmental conditions investigated. Observed changes in protein abundances indicated varied replicon usage, as well as proteome functional distributions between the in vitro cell culture conditions. Surprisingly, the pH and temperature conditions that mimicked B. burgdorferi residing in the gut of a fed tick showed a marked reduction in protein diversity. Additionally, the results provide us with leading candidates for exploring how B. burgdorferi adapts to and is able to survive in a wide variety of environmental conditions and lay a foundation for planned in situ studies of B. burgdorferi isolated from the tick midgut and infected animals."

The group consisted of 19 patients with Lyme arthritis (mean age 47 years) and the control group consisted of 16 healthy individuals (mean age 38 years). Diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed by epidemiological anamnesis, clinical manifestation of arthritis and serological examinations. Lipid peroxidation was estimated by the measurement of aldehydes (MDA and 4-HNE, determined by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]) and prostaglandin derivatives (8 - isoPGF(2a), determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry [LC/MS]). MDA and 4-HNE levels were increased about 2-4-fold in the plasma, while in the urine, the increases were about 2-fold. More significant increases were noted for the 8 - isoPGF(2a) total plasma level, which was enhanced over 4-fold, and for the urine 8 - isoPGF(2a) level, which was increased over 8-fold. The 8 - isoPGF(2a) total plasma level consists of free and esterified form. During infection, the ratio of free to esterified form is significantly smaller compared to healthy people. The ratio of free to esterified form of 8 - isoPGF(2a) may be a useful indicator of Lyme arthritis. Moreover, the complementarities of three lipid peroxidation product levels may be helpful in the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Erythema migrans (EM) is an annular, erythematous, expanding rash that is characteristic of early Lyme disease. In the southern United States, however, many cases of EM seem to have an etiology different from that of Lyme disease. This little-understood condition is called Southern tick-associated rash illness. With the goal of obtaining biological specimens and clinical histories from 12 to 20 STARI patients for use in etiologic research, microbiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention contacted the North Carolina Network Consortium, a statewide consortium of practice-based research networks. This article describes the methods by which the North Carolina Network Consortium successfully identified and enrolled Southern tick-associated rash illness patients into a primary care-based research protocol. A total of 23 patients were enrolled, with 100% attainment of the desired specimens. After an initial lack of success, the revised protocol identified and trained physicians practicing in endemic areas for the illness, used a coordinator with 24-hour availability, recruited participants using newspaper notices and medical providers, and provided regular reminders and progress updates. A practice-based research network can help basic scientists identify patients and collect specimens for clinically relevant research."

Birds are considered important in the global dispersal of ticks and tick-borne pathogens through their migration. The present study is the first description of B. burgdorferi prevalence and genotypes in Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on birds during spring and autumn migration in Norway. 6538 migratory birds were captured and examined for ticks at Lista Bird Observatory during the spring and the autumn migration in 2008. 822 immature I. ricinus ticks were collected from 215 infested birds. Ticks were investigated for infection with B. burgdorferi s.l. by real-time PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene, and B. burgdorferi s.l. were thereafter genotyped by melting curve analysis after real-time PCR amplification of the hbb gene, or by direct sequencing of the PCR amplicon generated from the rrs (16S)-rrl (23S) intergenetic spacer. B. burgdorferi s.l. were detected in 4.4% of the ticks. The most prevalent B. burgdorferi genospecies identified were B. garinii (77.8%), followed by B.valaisiana (11.1%), B. afzelii (8.3%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (2.8%). Infection rate in ticks and genospecies composition were similar in spring and autumn migration, however, the prevalence of ticks on birds was higher during spring migration. The study supports the notion that birds are important in the dispersal of ticks, and that they may be partly responsible for the heterogeneous distribution of B. burgdorferi s.l. in Europe."

		"abstract": "A recent zoonotic and infectious disease field surveillance study in Honduras resulted in the discovery of Toxoplasma, Trypanosoma, Leishmania, Rickettsia, and Lyme disease with statistically high prevalence rates in a group of feral cats. All five diseases--Toxoplasmosis, Trypanosomiasis, Leishmaniasis, Rickettsiosis, and Lyme disease--were confirmed in this group of cats having close contact to local civilians and U.S. personnel. These diseases are infectious to other animals and are known to infect humans as well. In the austere Central and South American sites that Special Operations Forces (SOF) medics are deployed, the living conditions and close quarters are prime environments for the potential spread of infectious and zoonotic disease. This study?s findings, as with previous veterinary disease surveillance studies, emphasize the critical need for continual and aggressive surveillance for zoonotic and infectious disease present within animals in specific areas of operation (AO). The importance to SOF is that a variety of animals may be sentinels, hosts, or direct transmitters of disease to civilians and service members. These studies are value-added tools to the U.S. military, specifically to a deploying or already deployed unit. The SOF medic must ensure that this value-added asset is utilized and that the findings are applied to assure Operational Detachment-Alpha (SFOD-A) health and, on a bigger scale, U.S. military force health protection and local civilian health."

OspA:mRFP1 fusions could be detected by epifluorescence microscopy both in the periplasm and on the bacterial surface. To build on these findings and to complement the prior targeted mutagenesis approach, we set out to develop a screen to probe a random mutagenesis expression library for mutants expressing differentially localized lipoproteins. A Glu-Asp codon pair in the inner membrane-localized OspA20:mRFP1 fusion was chosen for mutagenesis since the two negative charges were previously shown to define the phenotype. A library of random mutants in the two codons was generated and expressed in B. burgdorferi. In situ surface proteolysis combined with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) was then used to screen for viable spirochetes expressing alternative subsurface OspA:mRFP1 fusions. Analysis of 93 clones randomly picked from a sorted cell population identified a total of 43 distinct mutants. Protein localization assays indicated a significant enrichment in the selected subsurface phenotype. Interestingly, a majority of the subsurface mutant proteins localized to the outer membrane, indicating their impairment in \"flipping\" through the outer membrane to the spirochetal surface. OspA20:mRFP1 remained the protein most restricted to the inner membrane. Together, these results validate this FACS-based screen for lipoprotein localization and suggest a rather specific inner membrane retention mechanism involving membrane anchor-proximal negative charge patches in this model B. burgdorferi lipoprotein system."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) transmit the causative agent of Lyme disease in the Northeastern United States. Current research focuses on elucidating biochemical pathways that may be disrupted to prevent pathogen transmission, thereby preventing disease. Genome screening reported transcripts coding for two putative sulfotransferases in whole tick extracts of the nymphal and larval stages. Sulfotransferases are known to sulfonate phenolic and alcoholic receptor agonists such as 17β-estradiol, thereby inactivating the receptor ligands. We used bioinformatic approaches to predict substrates for Ixosc Sult 1 and Ixosc Sult 2 and tested the predictions with biochemical assays. Homology models of 3D protein structure were prepared, and visualization of the electrostatic surface of the ligand binding cavities showed regions of negative electrostatic charge. Molecular docking identified potential substrates including dopamine, R-octopamine and S-octopamine, which docked into Ixosc Sult 1 with favorable binding affinity and correct conformation for sulfonation. Dopamine, but not R- or S-octopamine, also docked into Ixosc Sult 2 in catalytic binding mode. The predictions were confirmed using cytosolic fractions of whole tick extracts. Dopamine was a good substrate (K(m) = 0.1-0.4 μM) for the native Ixodes scapularis sulfotransferases from larval and nymphal stages regardless of their fed/unfed status. Octopamine sulfonation was detected only after feeding when gene expression data suggests that Ixosc Sult 1 is present. Because dopamine is known to stimulate salivation in ticks through receptor stimulation, these results imply that the function(s) of Ixosc Sult 1 or 2 may include inactivation of the salivation signal via sulfonation of dopamine and/or octopamine."

Medical records of dogs seropositive for A. phagocytophilum were reviewed retrospectively. Peripheral blood smears were also reviewed retrospectively for granulocytic Anaplasma morulae. Lethargy (81%), inappetence (58%), and lameness (50%) were the most common clinical signs, followed by fever (46%). Thrombocytopenia was the most common laboratory abnormality, and IMHA was diagnosed in three dogs. Dogs that were thrombocytopenic and had antibodies to both A. phagocytophilum and B. burgdorferi had a median platelet count of 51,000/μL (range 20,000 to 171,000/μL), which was significantly lower than the count in dogs with antibodies only to A. phagocytophilum (P=0.04). Some dogs had an apparent relapse of clinical signs after an appropriate course of doxycycline. Testing for A. phagocytophilum by polymerase chain reaction, serum antibody assays, and/or blood smear evaluation should be considered in dogs with IMHA, cough, or epistaxis and that reside in A. phagocytophilum-endemic areas. If moderate to severe thrombocytopenia is present, testing for concurrent B. burgdorferi infection may be warranted."

A survey was performed in order to characterize test utilization and clinical features of patients investigated for serum antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. During one calendar year a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners who had ordered LB serology from patients in three Danish counties (population 1.5 million inhabitants). Testing was done with a commercial ELISA assay with purified flagella antigen from a Danish strain of B. afzelii. A total of 4,664 patients were tested. The IgM and IgG seropositivity rates were 9.2% and 3.3%, respectively. Questionnaires from 2,643 (57%) patients were available for analysis. Erythema migrans (EM) was suspected in 38% of patients, Lyme arthritis/disseminated disease in 23% and early neuroborreliosis in 13%. Age 0-15 years and suspected EM were significant predictors of IgM seropositivity, whereas suspected acrodermatitis was a predictor of IgG seropositivity. LB was suspected in 646 patients with arthritis, but only 2.3% were IgG seropositive. This is comparable to the level of seropositivity in the background population indicating that Lyme arthritis is a rare entity in Denmark, and the low pretest probability should alert general practitioners to the possibility of false positive LB serology. Significant predictors for treating the patient were a reported tick bite and suspected EM. A detailed description of the utilization of serology for Lyme borreliosis with rates of seropositivity according to clinical symptoms is presented. Low rates of seropositivity in certain patient groups indicate a low pretest probability and there is a notable risk of false positive results. 38% of all patients tested were suspected of EM, although this is not a recommended indication due to a low sensitivity of serological testing."

		"abstract": "A sensitive and analytically specific nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) is valuable in confirming the diagnosis of early Lyme disease at the stage of spirochetemia. Venous blood drawn from patients with clinical presentations of Lyme disease was tested for the standard 2-tier screen and Western Blot serology assay for Lyme disease, and also by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B. burgdorferi sensu lato 16S ribosomal DNA. The PCR amplicon was sequenced for B. burgdorferi genomic DNA validation. A total of 130 patients visiting emergency room (ER) or Walk-in clinic (WALKIN), and 333 patients referred through the private physicians' offices were studied. While 5.4% of the ER/WALKIN patients showed DNA evidence of spirochetemia, none (0%) of the patients referred from private physicians' offices were DNA-positive. In contrast, while 8.4% of the patients referred from private physicians' offices were positive for the 2-tier Lyme serology assay, only 1.5% of the ER/WALKIN patients were positive for this antibody test. The 2-tier serology assay missed 85.7% of the cases of early Lyme disease with spirochetemia. The latter diagnosis was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Nested PCR followed by automated DNA sequencing is a valuable supplement to the standard 2-tier antibody assay in the diagnosis of early Lyme disease with spirochetemia. The best time to test for Lyme spirochetemia is when the patients living in the Lyme disease endemic areas develop unexplained symptoms or clinical manifestations that are consistent with Lyme disease early in the course of their illness."

		"abstract": "Hydrogel biomarker capturing microparticles were evaluated as a biomaterial to amplify the sensitivity of urine testing for infectious disease proteins. Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of Lyme disease reduces complications including arthritis and cardiac involvement. While a urine test is highly desirable for Lyme disease screening, this has been difficult to accomplish because the antigen is present at extremely low concentrations, below the detection limit of clinical immunoassays. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm)-acrylic acid (AAc) microparticles were covalently functionalized with amine containing dyes via amidation of carboxylic groups present in the microparticles. The dyes act as affinity baits towards protein analytes in solution. NIPAm/AAc microparticles functionalized with acid black 48 (AB48) mixed with human urine, achieved close to one hundred percent capture and 100 percent extraction yield of the target antigen. In urine, microparticles sequestered and concentrated Lyme disease antigens 100 fold, compared to the absence of microparticles, achieving an immunoassay detection sensitivity of 700 pg/mL in 10 mL urine. Antigen present in a single infected tick could be readily detected following microparticle sequestration. Hydrogel microparticles functionalized with high affinity baits can dramatically increase the sensitivity of urinary antigen tests for infectious diseases such as Lyme disease. These findings justify controlled clinical studies evaluating the sensitivity and precision of Lyme antigen testing in urine."

		"abstract": "Landscape attributes influence spatial variations in disease risk or incidence. We present a review of the key findings from eight case studies that we conducted in Europe and West Africa on the impact of land changes on emerging or re-emerging vector-borne diseases and/or zoonoses. The case studies concern West Nile virus transmission in Senegal, tick-borne encephalitis incidence in Latvia, sandfly abundance in the French Pyrenees, Rift Valley Fever in the Ferlo (Senegal), West Nile Fever and the risk of malaria re-emergence in the Camargue, and rodent-borne Puumala hantavirus and Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. We identified general principles governing landscape epidemiology in these diverse disease systems and geographic regions. We formulated ten propositions that are related to landscape attributes, spatial patterns and habitat connectivity, pathways of pathogen transmission between vectors and hosts, scale issues, land use and ownership, and human behaviour associated with transmission cycles. A static view of the \"pathogenecity\" of landscapes overlays maps of the spatial distribution of vectors and their habitats, animal hosts carrying specific pathogens and their habitat, and susceptible human hosts and their land use. A more dynamic view emphasizing the spatial and temporal interactions between these agents at multiple scales is more appropriate. We also highlight the complementarity of the modelling approaches used in our case studies. Integrated analyses at the landscape scale allows a better understanding of interactions between changes in ecosystems and climate, land use and human behaviour, and the ecology of vectors and animal hosts of infectious agents."

		"abstract": "Nicotinamidases are metabolic enzymes that hydrolyze nicotinamide to nicotinic acid. These enzymes are widely distributed across biology, with examples found encoded in the genomes of Mycobacteria, Archaea, Eubacteria, Protozoa, yeast, and invertebrates, but there are none found in mammals. Although recent structural work has improved our understanding of these enzymes, their catalytic mechanism is still not well understood. Recent data show that nicotinamidases are required for the growth and virulence of several pathogenic microbes. The enzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Caenorhabditis elegans regulate life span in their respective organisms, consistent with proposed roles in the regulation of NAD(+) metabolism and organismal aging. In this work, the steady state kinetic parameters of nicotinamidase enzymes from C. elegans, Sa. cerevisiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogen responsible for human pneumonia), Borrelia burgdorferi (the pathogen that causes Lyme disease), and Plasmodium falciparum (responsible for most human malaria) are reported. Nicotinamidases are generally efficient catalysts with steady state k(cat) values typically exceeding 1 s(-1). The K(m) values for nicotinamide are low and in the range of 2 -110 μM. Nicotinaldehyde was determined to be a potent competitive inhibitor of these enzymes, binding in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range for all nicotinamidases tested. A variety of nicotinaldehyde derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors in kinetic assays. Inhibitions are consistent with reaction of the universally conserved catalytic Cys on each enzyme with the aldehyde carbonyl carbon to form a thiohemiacetal complex that is stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole. The S. pneumoniae nicotinamidase can catalyze exchange of (18)O into the carboxy oxygens of nicotinic acid with H(2)(18)O. The collected data, along with kinetic analysis of several mutants, allowed us to propose a catalytic mechanism that explains nicotinamidase and nicotinic acid (18)O exchange chemistry for the S. pneumoniae enzyme involving key catalytic residues, a catalytic transition metal ion, and the intermediacy of a thioester intermediate."

In this study, we enrolled within 1 year 122 patients with suspected chronic LNB. One hundred and fourteen patients had previously tested positive for BB. All patients had previously received antibiotic treatment. Each patient received a clinical examination and measurement of BB-specific antibodies. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis was made according to the national guidelines of the German Society of Neurology. Nine patients had acute borreliosis. One of the nine met the criteria of acute LNB. Of the remaining 113 patients, 85 patients underwent a lumbar puncture. Ten seronegative subjects without lumbar puncture were also considered. In 61.8% of these 95 patients the quality of life, of sleep, mood, and anxiety were assessed. Of 95 patients, 25.3% had symptoms without a somatic cause or evidence of borreliosis, 38.9% had a well-defined illness unrelated to BB infection, and 29.5% suffered from symptoms without a detectable somatic cause, displaying antibodies against BB. Six patients were grouped as post-LNB syndrome. Most common symptoms in all categories were arthralgia, myalgia, dysaesthesia, depressive mood and chronic fatigue. Patients with persistent symptoms with elevated serum antibodies against BB but without signs of cerebrospinal fluid inflammation require further diagnostic examinations to exclude ongoing infection and to avoid co-infections and other treatable conditions (e.g. autoimmune diseases). One patient with acute LNB, who was treated with ceftriaxone for 3 weeks suffered from LNB with new headaches and persistent symptoms 6 months later. These data should encourage further studies with new experimental parameters."

		"abstract": "Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include the tick-transmitted causative agents of Lyme disease and relapsing fever. They possess unusual genomes composed mainly of linear replicons terminated by closed DNA hairpins. Hairpin telomeres are formed from inverted repeat replicated telomere junctions (rTels) by the telomere resolvase ResT. ResT uses a reaction mechanism similar to that of the type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine recombinases. ResT can catalyze three distinct reactions: telomere resolution, telomere fusion, and Holliday junction (HJ) formation. HJ formation is known to occur only in the context of a synapsed pair of rTels. To test whether telomere resolution was synapsis-dependent, we performed experiments with rTel substrates immobilized on streptavidin-coated beads. We report that telomere resolution by ResT is synapsis-independent, indicating that alternative complexes are formed for telomere resolution and HJ formation. We also present evidence that dual hairpin telomere formation precedes product release. This mechanism of telomere resolution prevents the appearance of broken telomeres. We compare and contrast this mechanism with that proposed for TelK, the telomere resolvase of ϕKO2."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, is unusual as it contains free cholesterol and cholesterol glycolipids. It is also susceptible to complement-independent bactericidal antibodies, such as CB2, a monoclonal IgG1 against outer surface protein B (OspB). We find that the bactericidal action of CB2 requires the presence of cholesterol glycolipids and cholesterol. Ultrastructural, biochemical, and biophysical analysis revealed that the bacterial cholesterol glycolipids exist as lipid raft-like microdomains in the outer membrane of cultured and mouse-derived B. burgdorferi and in model membranes from B. burgdorferi lipids. The order and size of the microdomains are temperature sensitive and correlate with the bactericidal activity of CB2. This study demonstrates the existence of cholesterol-containing lipid raft-like microdomains in a prokaryote, and we suggest that the temperature dependence of B. burgdorferi lipid raft organization may have significant implications in the transmission cycle of the spirochetes which are exposed to a range of temperatures."

This study focuses on the effects of an invasive plant pathogen on a vertebrate community and Ixodes pacificus, the vector of the Lyme disease pathogen (Borrelia burgdorferi) in California. Phytophthora ramorum, the causative agent of sudden oak death, is a non-native pathogen killing trees in California and Oregon. We conducted a multi-year study using a gradient of SOD-caused disturbance to assess the impact on the dusky-footed woodrat (Neotoma fuscipes) and the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), two reservoir hosts of B. burgdorferi, as well as the impact on the Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) and the western fence lizard (Sceloporus occidentalis), both of which are important hosts for I. pacificus but are not pathogen reservoirs. Abundances of P. maniculatus and S. occidentalis were positively correlated with greater SOD disturbance, whereas N. fuscipes abundance was negatively correlated. We did not find a change in space use by O. hemionus. Our data show that SOD has a positive impact on the density of nymphal ticks, which is expected to increase the risk of human exposure to Lyme disease all else being equal. A positive correlation between SOD disturbance and the density of nymphal ticks was expected given increased abundances of two important hosts: deer mice and western fence lizards. However, further research is needed to integrate the direct effects of SOD on ticks, for example via altered abiotic conditions with host-mediated indirect effects."

		"abstract": "Platelet aggregation and acute inflammation are key processes in vertebrate defense to a skin injury. Recent studies uncovered the mediation of 2 serine proteases, cathepsin G and chymase, in both mechanisms. Working with a mouse model of acute inflammation, we revealed that an exogenous salivary protein of Ixodes ricinus, the vector of Lyme disease pathogens in Europe, extensively inhibits edema formation and influx of neutrophils in the inflamed tissue. We named this tick salivary gland secreted effector as I ricinus serpin-2 (IRS-2), and we show that it primarily inhibits cathepsin G and chymase, while in higher molar excess, it affects thrombin activity as well. The inhibitory specificity was explained using the crystal structure, determined at a resolution of 1.8 Å. Moreover, we disclosed the ability of IRS-2 to inhibit cathepsin G-induced and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. For the first time, an ectoparasite protein is shown to exhibit such pharmacological effects and target specificity. The stringent specificity and biological activities of IRS-2 combined with the knowledge of its structure can be the basis for the development of future pharmaceutical applications."

The first complete genome sequence of B. burgdorferi strain 31, available for more than a decade, has assisted research on the pathogenesis of Lyme disease. Because a single genome sequence is not sufficient to understand the relationship between genotypic and geographic variation and disease phenotype, we determined the whole-genome sequences of 13 additional B. burgdorferi isolates that span the range of natural variation. These sequences should allow improved understanding of pathogenesis and provide a foundation for novel detection, diagnosis, and prevention strategies."

LB is the most frequent vector-borne disease in humans in the Northern Hemisphere. In animals, clinically apparent disease is found primarily in dogs. Severe polyarthritis, fever and lameness in dogs are reported from the main endemic areas of North America: the New England States, and eastern parts of the United States; several cases of LB are also seen in California and the Midwest. Because of the difficulties in finding sufficient indicative clinical signs, additional information (detailed case history, laboratory testing for antibodies) is especially important to make the clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. This article reviews the etiology, diagnosis, therapy, and prevention of LB."

In this study, B. burgdorferi-infected ticks were fed on mice while confined to a certain area of the skin by a capsule. During and after feeding, tick feces were collected and placed in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelley (BSK)-II media for cultivation and in sterile water for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Although none of the tested samples were culture positive for B. burgdorferi, all but one of the fecal DNA samples from infected ticks were PCR positive. These results indicated that B. burgdorferi were shed from feeding ticks during defecation and suggest that the spirochetes did not remain viable once exposed to the outside environment. This finding has important ramifications for investigators interpreting B. burgdorferi-specific PCR results when conducting tick transmission experiments."

However, several clinical, serological, and epidemiological studies have failed to confirm a causal association between B. burgdorferi infection and a pregnancy adverse outcome. Moreover, there have been no reported cases of transmission of Borrelia via breast milk. However, the therapeutic approach to pregnant women with Lyme disease should be antibiotic treatment, according to the clinical manifestation and the timing of the tick bite. An effective vaccine is not yet available and the prevention of Lyme borreliosis depends on public and physician education, and appropriate antibiotic therapy during pregnancy."

To understand the mechanisms of immune regulation employed by the host to control this inflammatory response, we focused our studies on adrenomedullin, a peptide produced in response to bacterial stimuli that exhibits antimicrobial activity and regulates inflammatory responses by modulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. Specifically, we investigated the effect of B. burgdorferi on the expression of adrenomedullin as well as the ability of adrenomedullin to dampen host inflammatory responses to the spirochete. The concentration of adrenomedullin in the synovial fluid of untreated Lyme arthritis patients was elevated compared with that in control osteoarthritis patient samples. In addition, coculture with B. burgdorferi significantly increased the expression of adrenomedullin in RAW264.7 macrophages through MyD88-, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)-, and p38-dependent signaling cascades. Furthermore, the addition of exogenous adrenomedullin to B. burgdorferi-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages resulted in a significant decrease in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines. Taken together, these results suggest that B. burgdorferi increases the production of adrenomedullin, which in turn negatively regulates the B. burgdorferi-stimulated inflammatory response."

One of the few antigens against which mammals develop protective immunity is the highly polymorphic OspC protein, encoded by the ospC gene on the cp26 plasmid. Intragenic recombination among ospC genes is known, but the extent to which recombination extended beyond the ospC locus itself is undefined. We accessed and supplemented collections of DNA sequences of ospC and other loci from ticks in three U.S. regions (the Northeast, the Midwest, and northern California); a total of 839 ospC sequences were analyzed. Three overlapping but distinct populations of B. burgdorferi corresponded to the geographic regions. In addition, we sequenced 99 ospC flanking sequences from different lineages and compared the complete cp26 sequences of 11 strains as well as the cp26 bbb02 loci of 56 samples. Besides recombinations with traces limited to the ospC gene itself, there was evidence of lateral gene transfers that involved (i) part of the ospC gene and one of the two flanks or (ii) the entire ospC gene and different lengths of both flanks. Lateral gene transfers resulted in different linkages between the ospC gene and loci of the chromosome or other plasmids. By acquisition of the complete part or a large part of a novel ospC gene, an otherwise adapted strain would assume a new serotypic identity, thereby being comparatively fitter in an area with a high prevalence of immunity to existing OspC types."

Adaptors and co-receptors that mediate this process, as well as the mechanisms by which these adaptors and co-receptors function, are still being discovered. Using shRNA, blocking antibodies, and fluorescent microscopy, we show that U937 macrophage responses to the TLR2/1 ligand, Pam(3)CSK(4), are dependent upon an integrin, α(3)β(1). The mechanism for integrin α(3)β(1) involvement in TLR2/1 signaling is through its role in endocytosis of lipopeptides. Using inhibitors of endosomal acidification/maturation and physical tethering of the ligand, we show that the endocytosis of Pam(3)CSK(4) is necessary for the complete TLR2/1-mediated pro-inflammatory cytokine response. We also show that TLR2/1 signaling from the endosome results in the induction of different inflammatory mediators than TLR2/1 signaling from the plasma membrane. Here we identify integrin α(3)β(1) as a novel regulator for the recognition of bacterial lipopeptides. We demonstrate that induction of a specific subset of cytokines is dependent upon integrin α(3)β(1)-mediated endocytosis of the ligand. In addition, we address an ongoing controversy regarding endosomal recognition of bacterial lipopeptides by demonstrating that TLR2/1 signals from within endosomal compartments as well as the plasma membrane, and that downstream responses may differ depending upon receptor localization. We propose that the regulation of endosomal TLR2/1 signaling by integrin α(3)β(1) serves as a mechanism for modulating inflammatory responses."

Few studies have explicitly examined sex-based differences in the clinical presentation of or serologic response to early Lyme disease. It is unknown whether the sex-based variability observed in other infectious diseases is relevant to this clinical setting. This study retrospectively examined clinical and serologic differences by sex among a community case series of patients with a current or past episode of confirmed early Lyme disease. This was a retrospective, consecutive case series of adult patients in Maryland enrolled from August 2002 to August 2007 meeting criteria for a current or past episode of confirmed early Lyme disease. Clinical variables and patients' self-report surrounding illness onset were abstracted through chart review. All serologic tests drawn within 3 months of illness onset were interpreted using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. In a total of 125 patients, there were no significant differences in clinical presentation by sex. The initial self-misdiagnosis rates for men and women were 10% and 18%, respectively (P = NS). Among the 62 patients with a serologic test as part of their clinical evaluation, 50% of men had a positive, 2-tier result compared with 32% of women (P = NS). Among the 41 patients with a positive ELISA, median ELISA values (3.4 vs 2.0; P = 0.03) and median number of immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands (4 vs 2; P = 0.03) were significantly higher among men. In this small, retrospective sample, we found evidence for sex-based differences in the magnitude of ELISA and IgG serologic response to early Lyme disease. Such differences could have implications for appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and disease classification. Larger, prospective studies are needed to replicate the results found in this study and to examine their relationship to sex-based immunologic variability."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, dramatically alters its transcriptome and proteome as it cycles between the arthropod vector and mammalian host. During this enzootic cycle, a novel regulatory network, the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway (also known as the σ(54)-σ(S) sigma factor cascade), plays a central role in modulating the differential expression of more than 10% of all B. burgdorferi genes, including the major virulence genes ospA and ospC. However, the mechanism(s) by which the upstream activator and response regulator Rrp2 is activated remains unclear. Here, we show that none of the histidine kinases present in the B. burgdorferi genome are required for the activation of Rrp2. Instead, we present biochemical and genetic evidence that supports the hypothesis that activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway occurs via the small, high-energy, phosphoryl-donor acetyl phosphate (acetyl∼P), the intermediate of the Ack-Pta (acetate kinase-phosphate acetyltransferase) pathway that converts acetate to acetyl-CoA. Supplementation of the growth medium with acetate induced activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, the overexpression of Pta virtually abolished acetate-induced activation of this pathway, suggesting that acetate works through acetyl∼P. Overexpression of Pta also greatly inhibited temperature and cell density-induced activation of RpoS and OspC, suggesting that these environmental cues affect the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway by influencing acetyl∼P. Finally, overexpression of Pta partially reduced infectivity of B. burgdorferi in mice. Taken together, these findings suggest that acetyl∼P is one of the key activating molecule for the activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway and support the emerging concept that acetyl∼P can serve as a global signal in bacterial pathogenesis."

Through engagement with a variety of public and veterinary health agencies and practitioners (e.g., clinicians and veterinarians), wildlife groups (deer society, zoos, animal refuge centers, and academics), and amateur entomologists, >4000 ticks from 900 separate records across Great Britain have been submitted, representing 14 tick species (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes hexagonus, Ixodes acuminatus, Ixodes arboricola, Ixodes canisuga, Ixodes frontalis, Ixodes lividus, Ixodes trianguliceps, Ixodes ventalloi, Carios vespertilionis, Dermacentor reticulatus, Haemaphysalis punctata, Hyalomma marginatum, and Amblyomma species). The majority of ticks submitted were I. ricinus (81%), followed by I. hexagonus (10%) and I. frontalis (2.5%). Predominant host groups include companion animals (411 records), humans (198 records), wild birds (111 records), and large wild mammals (88 records), with records also from small/medium wild mammals, livestock, the environment and domestic/aviary birds. The scheme has elucidated the detection of two nonnative tick species, the expansion of previously geographically restricted D. reticulatus and produced ground data on the spread of I. ricinus in southwest England. It has also provided a forum for submission of ticks from the concerned public and particularly those infected with Lyme borreliosis, thus raising awareness among public health agencies of the increased peri-urban tick problem in Britain. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to run a cost-effective nationwide surveillance program to successfully monitor endemic tick species, identify subtle changes in their distribution, and detect the arrival and presence of exotic species."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease and when involves the nervous system it is termed neuroborreliosis. The symptomatology of peripheral neuroborreliosis is rich and varied. The early symptoms are asymmetric polyradiculopathies and paralysis of the cranial nerves (most commonly facial nerve). Thereafter, there are multifocal mononeuropathies and sensory-motorpolyneuropathies. Difficulties in making a correct diagnosis can result from the long time lag between tick bite and the occurrence of neurological symptoms. In the treatment the most important role play antibiotics. We report the cases of three patients with symptoms of damage to various structures of the peripheral nervous system in the course of Borrelia burgdorferi infection. In all cases, clinical improvement was obtained after treatment with antibiotics, which further confirms the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. About neuroborreliosis as a cause of peripheral neuropathy we should always think in the case of vague symptoms of peripheral nervous system lesions in patients with potential exposure to tick bites. Peripheral neuropathies may occur a long interval from the tick bite and are not always preceded by other forms of the disease."

		"abstract": "The tick bite transmitted Lyme disease is one of the most common antropozoonosis, about 10 000 new infections are reported in Hungary each year. The progress and clinical presentation can vary, and carditis can occur in later stages. A serologically verified Lyme disease caused third degree atrioventricular block in young male presenting with presyncope. Based on the tick-bites mentioned a few weeks prior to hospital admission, Lyme carditis was considered with the administration of antibiotics and monitor observation. Typical skin lesions were not recognized and laboratory findings showed no pathology. An electrophysiological study recorded a predominant supra-His atrioventricular block. Total regression of conduction could be detected later and the serological tests established an underlying Lyme disease. Currently no definite treatment recommendation is available for the potentially reversible Lyme carditis. The tick bite seemed to be the key on our way to diagnosis; however, serological tests proved the disease to be older than one year. A detailed medical history and serological tests are essential in identifying the cause and pacemaker implantation can be avoided."

A qualitative assessment of morphology and motility of B. garinii was conducted. All media were prepared aseptically and used in test tubes or Petri dishes. For each medium, the initial spirochete concentration was standardized to 10(3) spirochets/mL. The following culture media were suitable to grow B. garinii: Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly, brain heart infusion and PMR. Growth was minimal at six weeks post-inoculation and maximum spirochete density was observed between 9-12 weeks. Often, the cultures developed cysts of different sizes, isolated or in groups, with a spiraled portion of variable sizes, mainly in unfavorable culture media. Brazilian Lyme disease-like illness, also known as Baggio-Yoshinari syndrome (BYS), is a new and interesting emerging tick-borne disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes, only during its cystic forms. It has been assumed that the peculiar clinical and laboratory features of BYS are consequential to the absence of a human sucker Ixodes ricinus complex tick at risk areas in Brazil, supporting the concept that the borrelia phenotypic expression pattern is modified as it is transmitted through the host."

		"abstract": "Joint fluid in patients with Lyme arthritis often contains high levels of CCL4 and CCL2, which are chemoattractants for monocytes and some T cells, and CXCL9 and CXCL10, which are chemoattractants for CD4+ and CD8+ T effector cells. These chemokines are produced primarily by cells of monocyte lineage in TH1-type immune responses. Our goal was to begin to learn how infection with Borrelia burgdorferi leads to the secretion of these chemokines, using patient cell samples. We hypothesized that B. burgdorferi stimulates chemokine secretion from monocytes/macrophages in multiple ways, thereby linking innate and adaptive immune responses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 24 Lyme arthritis patients were stimulated with B. burgdorferi, interferon (IFN)-γ, or both, and the levels of CCL4, CCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL10 were measured in culture supernatants. CD14+ monocytes/macrophages from PBMC and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (SFMC) were stimulated in the same way, using available samples. CXCR3, the receptor for CXCL9 and CXCL10, and CCR5, the receptor for CCL4, were assessed on T cells from PBMC and SFMC. In patients with Lyme arthritis, B. burgdorferi but not IFN-γ induced PBMC to secrete CCL4 and CCL2, and B. burgdorferi and IFN-γ each stimulated the production of CXCL9 and CXCL10. However, with the CD14+ cell fraction, B. burgdorferi alone stimulated the secretion of CCL4; B. burgdorferi and IFN-γ together induced CCL2 secretion, and IFN-γ alone stimulated the secretion of CXCL9 and CXCL10. The percentage of T cells expressing CXCR3 or CCR5 was significantly greater in SFMC than PBMC, confirming that TH1 effector cells were recruited to inflamed joints. However, when stimulated with B. burgdorferi or IFN-γ, SFMC and PBMC responded similarly. B. burgdorferi stimulates PBMC or CD14+ monocytes/macrophages directly to secrete CCL4, but spirochetal stimulation of other intermediate cells, which are present in PBMC, is required to induce CD14+ cells to secrete CCL2, CXCL9 and CXCL10. We conclude that B. burgdorferi stimulates monocytes/macrophages directly and indirectly to guide innate and adaptive immune responses in patients with Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Deletion of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 prevents the recruitment of neutrophils into tissues and subsequent development of experimental Lyme arthritis. Following footpad inoculation of Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, expression of the CXCR2 ligand KC (CXCL1) is highly upregulated in the joints of arthritis-susceptible mice and is likely to play an important role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected C3H KC(-/-) mice with B. burgdorferi and followed the development of arthritis and carditis. Ankle swelling was significantly attenuated during the peak of arthritis in the KC(-/-) mice. Arthritis severity scores were significantly lower in the KC(-/-) mice on days 11 and 21 postinfection, with fewer neutrophils present in the inflammatory lesions. Cardiac lesions were also significantly decreased in KC(-/-) mice at day 21 postinfection. There were, however, no differences between C3H wild-type and KC(-/-) mice in spirochete clearance from tissues. Two other CXCR2 ligands, LIX (CXCL5) and MIP-2 (CXCL2), were not increased to compensate for the loss of KC, and the production of several innate cytokines was unaltered. These results demonstrate that KC plays a critical nonredundant role in the development of experimental Lyme arthritis and carditis via CXCR2-mediated recruitment of neutrophils into the site of infection."

We have identified and characterized an atypical Hfq required for gene regulation and infectivity in the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Sequence analyses of the putative B. burgdorferi Hfq protein revealed only a modest level of similarity with the Hfq from Escherichia coli, although a few key residues are retained and the predicted tertiary structure is similar. Several lines of evidence suggest that the B. burgdorferi bb0268 gene encodes a functional Hfq homologue. First, the hfq(Bb) gene (bb0268) restores the efficient translation of an rpoS::lacZ fusion in an E. coli hfq null mutant. Second, the Hfq from B. burgdorferi binds to the small RNA DsrA(Bb) and the rpoS mRNA. Third, a B. burgdorferi hfq null mutant was generated and has a pleiotropic phenotype that includes increased cell length and decreased growth rate, as found in hfq mutants in other bacteria. The hfq(Bb) mutant phenotype is complemented in trans with the hfq gene from either B. burgdorferi or, surprisingly, E. coli. This is the first example of a heterologous bacterial gene complementing a B. burgdorferi mutant. The alternative sigma factor RpoS and the outer membrane lipoprotein OspC, which are induced by increased temperature and required for mammalian infection, are not upregulated in the hfq mutant. Consequently, the hfq mutant is not infectious by needle inoculation in the murine model. These data suggest that Hfq plays a key role in the regulation of pathogenicity factors in B. burgdorferi and we hypothesize that the spirochete has a complex Hfq-dependent sRNA network."

Pathogens and immune challenges can induce changes in host phenotype in ways that indirectly impact important community interactions, including those that affect host-pathogen interactions. 2. To explore host behavioural response to immune challenge, we exposed wild white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) to an immunogen from an endemic, zoonotic pathogen, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. White-footed mice are a major reservoir host of Lyme disease (LD) spirochetes in northeastern USA and an abundant member of forest communities. The activity patterns, foraging behaviour, and space use of white-footed mice have implications for population growth rates of community members upon which mice incidentally prey (i.e. gypsy moths and native thrushes), as well as potentially determining host-vector encounter rates and human risk of LD. 3. Immunochallenge led to specific humoral (antibody) and cellular (i.e. elevated neutrophils and eosinophils) immune responses, supporting use of the immunogen as a surrogate for pathogenic infection. 4. Immunochallenged mice had reduced wheel-running activity early in the night when measured in the lab. However, mouse activity, as measured by track plates in natural field experiments, did not differ between mice exposed to the immunogen and unexposed mice. 5. Foraging behaviour of wild mice in the field - assessed with giving-up densities of seed at artificial feeding stations - was affected by exposure to the immunogen. Whereas immunochallenge did not influence whether foraging mice gained information on patch quality while foraging, it led to reductions in predator avoidance during foraging, suggesting that the proportion of space used by foraging mice may be greater as a result of immunochallenge. This increased space use is predicted to increase encounter rates with patchily distributed LD vectors (ticks) and with incidental prey items. 6. Thus, immunochallenge in white-footed mice, and potentially pathogenic infection, have the potential to indirectly impact community interactions, including those important for pathogen transmission."

First four methods were combined in one assay in multiprime format. Efficacy of the assay was assessed by testing of blood samples from patients with tickborreliosis (166 patients), tick-born encephalitis (22 patients) and mixed infection tick-borne encephalitis + borreliosis (21 patients) from Sverdlovsk region. It was shown that using PCR-based assay for testing the blood samples obtained during admission, it was possible to determine the etiology of disease in 39% of patients, whereas on the basis of serological data diagnosis, as a rule, is made not earlier than on 2nd week of therapy. False-positive results of PCR diagnostics were not observed. Infections caused by Anaplasma or Erlichia were not observed. It was shown that > 50% of cases of tick borreliosis without erythema were caused by B. miyamotoi, whereas B. burgdorferi sensu lato predominated as a causative agent of erythemic form of borreliosis. Proposed complex of methods is useful for rapid diagnostics of tick-borne infections including previously unknown infection caused by B. miyamotoi."

Study of complex of proinflammatory cytokines (IFNalpha, IL-1beta, IFNgamma, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8) during course of the disease was performed by solid-phase ELISA using domestic diagnostic kits (Scientific Manufacturing Organization \"Proteinovyi Contur\", \"Cytokine\" Ltd., Saint Petersburg). Levels of TNFalpha was determined by ELISA using commercial kits \"Boehringer Manheim\" (Austria). Performed comparative clinico-laboratory analysis demonstrated increased levels of LL-2, IL-4, and IL-8 in patients during acute phase of tick-borne borreliosis that could point to host's response on bacterial infection. It should be noted that in patients with arthritis levels of LL-4 and IL-2 remained high during recovery phase that probably determined by possible persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi. Further research of cytokines during Lyme borreliosis could have important diagnostic and prognostic value."

		"abstract": "The importance of established and emerging tick-borne pathogens in Central and Northern Europe is steadily increasing. In 2007, we collected Ixodes ricinus ticks feeding on birds (n = 211) and rodents (n = 273), as well as host-seeking stages (n = 196), in a habitat in central Germany. In order to find out more about their natural transmission cycles, the ticks were tested for the presence of Lyme disease borreliae, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, Francisella tularensis, and babesiae. Altogether, 20.1% of the 680 ticks examined carried at least one pathogen. Bird-feeding ticks were more frequently infected with Borrelia spp. (15.2%) and A. phagocytophilum (3.2%) than rodent-feeding ticks (2.6%; 1.1%) or questing ticks (5.1%; 0%). Babesia spp. showed higher prevalence rates in ticks parasitizing birds (13.2%) and host-seeking ticks (10.7%), whereas ticks from small mammals were less frequently infected (6.6%). SFG rickettsiae and F. tularensis were also found in ticks collected off birds (2.1%; 1.2%), rodents (1.8%; 1.5%), and vegetation (4.1%; 1.6%). Various combinations of coinfections occurred in 10.9% of all positive ticks, indicating interaction of transmission cycles. Our results suggest that birds not only are important reservoirs for several pathogens but also act as vehicles for infected ticks and might therefore play a key role in the dispersal of tick-borne diseases."

Here we examine the impact of host migration on the spread of a tick-borne zoonotic disease, using Lyme Borreliosis (LB) spirochaetal species in Europe. We demonstrate that the migration of the LB species is dependent on and limited by the migration of their respective hosts. We note that populations of Borrelia spp. associated with birds (Borrelia garinii and B. valaisiana) show limited geographic structuring between countries compared with those associated with small mammals (Borrelia afzelii), and we argue that this can be explained by higher rates of migration in avian hosts. We also show the presence of B. afzelii strains in England and, through the use of the multi-locus sequence analysis scheme, reveal that the strains are highly structured. This pattern in English sites is very different from that observed at the continental sites, and we propose that these may be recent introductions."

However, the niche of the persisting spirochetes remained unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the tissues of B. burgdorferi-infected and ceftriaxone-treated mice by culture and PCR to reveal the foci of persisting spirochetes. C3H/HeN mice were infected via intradermal needle injection with B. burgdorferi s.s. N40. The mice were treated as follows: (i) short (5 days) and (ii) long (18 days) course of ceftriaxone at 2 weeks of infection and killed after either 10 or 30 weeks, or (iii) the mice received ceftriaxone for 5 days at 18 weeks of infection and were killed 21 weeks after the treatment. All samples of ceftriaxone-treated mice were culture negative, whereas all untreated controls were culture positive. Importantly, B. burgdorferi DNA was detected in the joints of 30-100% of the treated mice. In conclusion, these results combined with earlier results suggest that the joint or a tissue adjacent to the joint is the niche of persisting B. burgdorferi in ceftriaxone-treated mice."

One hundred and forty-five forestry rangers and 282 blood donors were examined by two-tiered serological tests for B. burgdorferi and TBE virus. Information on occupation, residence, tick bites, outdoor leisure activities and other risk factors was obtained. The prevalence of IgG/IgM antibodies to B. burgdorferi showed no statistical difference between the two groups, but there was a higher occurrence of IgM antibodies. There were significant differences between indoor and outdoor, urban and rural workplaces among the 145 exposed workers (χ² test: p < 0.001), and a higher risk for outdoor rural than urban tasks was detected among the ten Western blot-tested forestry rangers positive to B. burgdorferi (χ² test: p < 0.1). No seropositivity was observed for the TBE virus. Forestry rangers from the Lazio region did not have a higher risk of Borrelia infection than the blood donors, though an increase in the risk for outdoor tasks in a rural environment was observed."

Patients were recruited from standardized discharge summaries collected in the hospital database. All adult patients, hospitalized in public hospitals of the Indre-et-Loire administrative district, over a period of 8 years (1999-2006), who satisfied the European diagnostic criteria of Lyme borreliosis, were included. Encoding of Lyme borreliosis had a poor positive predictive value (65%). Forty-seven adult patients presented with the 50 following clinical forms: erythema migrans (n=5), neuroborreliosis (n=32), knee single-joint arthritis (n=4), acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (n=3), carditis (n=2), ocular borreliosis (n=2), miscellaneous (n=2). Three patients had a combination of two different clinical forms. Meningoradiculitis was the most frequent neurologic manifestation. When a cranial nerve was involved, it was constantly the facial nerve, and mainly bilaterally. Few patients in our study had erythema migrans: these patients are usually treated in a general medicine setting. Although the incidence in the Centre region was lower than in some other regions of France and Europe, the clinical spectrum of the disseminated forms was similar. This cohort illustrates the diversity of clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in hospitalized patients, particularly at disseminated and late stages as well as the complexity of its diagnosis and its epidemiological surveillance."

The seroprevalence in young Swedish children is unknown and the relation to clinical data has not been previously studied. To determine the seroprevalence of Borrelia IgG antibodies in serum of young Swedish children and to relate it to gender, geographical location, reported tick bites, symptoms and previous treatment for LB. 2000 healthy 5-year-old children (n=2000) were randomly selected from among participants of a larger prospective population-based study, the ABIS (All Babies in Southeast Sweden) study. Serum samples were collected and a Borrelia specific ELISA test (Dako) were performed for IgG antibody detection. Clinical data were collected from questionnaires completed by the parents. The seroprevalence of Borrelia IgG antibodies was 3.2% (64/2000). Previous tick bite had been noted in 66% of these seropositive children but the majority (94%) had not previously been treated for LB. In addition, another 55 children reported a history of LB but were negative to Borrelia IgG antibodies in serum. Many of these seronegative children had received treatment for erythema migrans (n=24), which is a clinical diagnosis. Whether children were correctly treated or overtreated for LB is however unknown. No differences in gender, geographical location or reported tick bites were found when comparing Borrelia-seropositive children (n=64) and seronegative children with previous LB (n=55). This population-based study demonstrates a Borrelia IgG antibody seroprevalence of 3.2% in young Swedish children. Very few of these seropositive children report previous symptoms or treatment for LB. Thus the findings suggest that exposure to the Borrelia spirochaete (with subsequent antibody response in serum) does occur in young children, mostly without giving rise to clinical LB. Future studies on cell-mediated immune responses are needed to investigate explanatory immunological mechanisms."

		"abstract": "Consumed for centuries, lactic acid bacteria are excellent candidates for the development of safe mucosal delivery vehicles for prophylactic and therapeutic molecules. We have recently reported that the immune response to an effective OspA-expressing L. plantarum vaccine for Lyme disease is modulated by the lipid modification of the antigen. In this study, we investigated if this technology can be applied to developing vaccines for other diseases by focusing on the Class A select agent, Yersinia pestis. We used a number of biochemistry and immunology techniques to determine the localization of the immunogen in our delivery vehicle and to evaluate the mucosal as well as the systemic immune response to the immunogen. We found that only LcrV cloned downstream of the signal sequence of B. burgdorferi OspA ((ss)LcrV), but not wildtype LcrV (LcrV), is localized to the desired peptidoglycan layer of the delivery vehicle. In addition, only mice that received L. plantarum expressing (ss)LcrV produced significant titers of IgG antibody as well as IgA in distant mucosal sites such as lungs and vagina. Furthermore, only L. plantarum expressing (ss)LcrV induced significant amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFα, IL-12, IFNγ and IL-6 as well as anti-inflammatory IL-10 in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived dendritic cells, suggesting that the mechanism by which LcrV-expressing L. plantarum stimulates the immune response involves polarization to Th1 mediated immunity with some involvement of Th2. The study reported here proves that this system is a platform technology to develop oral vaccines for multiple diseases."

There were reticular varices, corona flebectatia paraplantaris medialis and minimal pitting oedema. Serology tested positive in both patients for Borrelia and they both recalled tick bites. A third patient, a 73-year-old woman, was referred because of erythema and maculae located at her lower legs and positive Borrelia serology. Pathologic examination was typical for acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, a late skin manifestation of Lyme borreliosis.

		"abstract": "The pathogen of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, produces a putative surface protein termed \"surface-located membrane protein 1\" (Lmp1). Lmp1 has been shown previously to assist the microbe in evasion of host-acquired immune defenses and in the establishment of persistent infection of mammals. Here, we show that Lmp1 is an integral membrane protein with surface-exposed N-terminal, middle, and C-terminal regions. During murine infection, antibodies recognizing these three protein regions were produced. Separate immunization of mice with each of the discrete regions exerted differential effects on spirochete survival during infection. Notably, antibodies against the C-terminal region primarily interfered with B. burgdorferi persistence in the joints, while antibodies specific to the N-terminal region predominantly affected pathogen levels in the heart, including the development of carditis. Genetic reconstitution of lmp1 deletion mutants with the lmp1 N-terminal region significantly enhanced its ability to resist the bactericidal effects of immune sera and also was observed to increase pathogen survival in vivo. Taken together, the combined data suggest that the N-terminal region of Lmp1 plays a distinct role in spirochete survival and other parts of the protein are related to specific functions corresponding to pathogen persistence and tropism during infection that is displayed in an organ-specific manner. The findings reported here underscore the fact that surface-exposed regions of Lmp1 could potentially serve as vaccine targets or antigenic regions that could alter the course of natural Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia burgdorferi surface lipoprotein OspC is a critical virulence factor, but its precise role in the establishment of B. burgdorferi infection remains unclear. To determine whether OspC affects the host response at the site of inoculation of the bacterium, the recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils and the production of cytokines were examined at the site of infection by wild-type, ospC mutant, and complemented mutant B. burgdorferi strains. Of the 21 cytokines tested, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), keratinocyte-derived chemokine (KC, CXCL1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were found at increased levels at the site of inoculation of B. burgdorferi, and the levels varied with the production of OspC at one or more time points over the 1-week course of infection. The kinetics of expression and the dependence on OspC production by B. burgdorferi varied among the cytokines. The production of KC and MCP-1, and the appearance of monocytic infiltrates, correlated with the presence of the bacteria rather than with OspC specifically. In contrast, VEGF production was not correlated simply to the presence of the bacteria and is influenced by the presence of OspC. In in vitro assays, OspC and B. burgdorferi expressing OspC stimulated the growth of endothelial cells more than did the controls. These data suggest the possibility of a novel role for OspC in the life of B. burgdorferi at the interface of its mammalian and tick hosts."

High-pressure sprays of IC2, bifenthrin, and water were applied during the peak nymphal (July) and adult (October) seasons of the vector tick. No ticks could be dragged on the IC2 grids within 2 wk of the July spray, and few adult ticks were found in October or the following April. Similarly, no adult ticks could be dragged 1.5 wk after the October IC2 spray, and few the following April. No ticks were found on the bifenthrin grids after either spray through the following April, whereas substantial numbers of ticks remained throughout on the grids sprayed with water. Thus, IC2 appears to be an effective, minimum-risk acaricide to control the vector tick of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a disease characterized by symmetrical polyarthritis of the large and small joints, and in the majority of patients, there is a presence of the rheumatoid factor and erosions in the X-ray of the joints. More recently, the presence of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) in this disease has been described, with diagnostic and prognostic value. Nevertheless, these antibodies have also been described in infectious diseases. The aim of the present study was to make a systematic review of the presence of antibodies against citrullinated peptides in infectious diseases. Search was conducted in the MEDLINE (1966 to 2010), Cochrane, SCielo, and LILACS databases, using the terms: \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and infectious diseases\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and virus\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and mycobacteria\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and tuberculosis\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and leprosy\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and leishmaniasis\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and HIV\"; \"anti-CCP and HTLV\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and Chagas disease\"; \"anti-CCP, anti-MCV, and Lyme disease\", and the corresponding terms in Portuguese. Twenty-five publications were found, which dealt with anti-CCP and infection, and only one on anti-MCV and infection. Of these, 23 were cross-sectional and three cohort studies. Anti-CCP antibodies were found in various frequencies, reaching 37% in tuberculosis. In the other infections, it was a rare finding. In only one publication, anti-MCV was found in only one patient with hepatitis. Since infectious diseases are capable of running their course with osteoarticular symptoms, sometimes difficult to differentiate from RA, additional studies are necessary to define the performance of the test for the detection of anti-CCP antibodies in populations in which the frequency of such infections is high."

In 1992, first cases similar to LD were described in Brazil, when brothers, after a tick bite episode developed symptoms , as erythema migrans, general flu-like symptoms and arthritis. Careful analysis of Brazilian LD-like illness casuistry showed that epidemiological, clinical and laboratorial features in the country were very different from those exhibited by North American and Eurasian LD patients. Human blood-suckers Ixodes ricinus complex ticks were absent at risk areas; the disease is recurrent in the country; Borrelia burgdorferi was never isolated in Brazil and specific serologic tests have shown little positivity with inconsistent results. Furthermore, peripheral blood analysis of patients on electron microscopy exhibited structures resembling Mycoplasma spp, Chlamydia spp and spirochete-like microorganisms. In fact, they were assumed to be latent forms of spirochetes (L form or cell wall deficient bacteria) adapted to survive at inhospitable conditions in vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. For these reasons, the Brazilian zoonosis was named Baggio-Yoshinari Syndrome (BYS) and defined as: \"Exotic and emerging Brazilian infectious disease, transmitted by ticks not belonging to the Ixodes ricinus complex, caused by latent spirochetes with atypical morphology, which originates LD-like symptoms, except for occurrence of relapsing episodes and auto-immune disorders\"."

		"abstract": "The flaviviruses causing tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) persist at low but consistent levels in tick populations, despite short infectious periods in their mammalian hosts and transmission periods constrained by distinctly seasonal tick life cycles. In addition to systemic and vertical transmission, cofeeding transmission has been proposed as an important route for the persistence of TBE-causing viruses. Because cofeeding transmission requires ticks to feed simultaneously, the timing of tick activity may be critical to pathogen persistence. Existing models of tick-borne diseases do not incorporate all transmission routes and tick seasonality. Our aim is to evaluate the influence of seasonality on the relative importance of different transmission routes by using a comprehensive mathematical model. We developed a stage-structured population model that includes tick seasonality and evaluated the relative importance of the transmission routes for pathogens with short infectious periods, in particular Powassan virus (POWV) and the related \"deer tick virus,\" emergent encephalitis-causing flaviviruses in North America. We used the next generation matrix method to calculate the basic reproductive ratio and performed elasticity analyses. We confirmed that cofeeding transmission is critically important for such pathogens to persist in seasonal tick populations over the reasonable range of parameter values. At higher but still plausible rates of vertical transmission, our model suggests that vertical transmission can strongly enhance pathogen prevalence when it operates in combination with cofeeding transmission. Our results demonstrate that the consistent prevalence of POWV observed in tick populations could be maintained by a combination of low vertical, intermediate cofeeding and high systemic transmission rates. When vertical transmission is weak, nymphal ticks support integral parts of the transmission cycle that are critical for maintaining the pathogen. We also extended the model to pathogens that cause chronic infections in hosts and found that cofeeding transmission could contribute to elevating prevalence even in these systems. Therefore, the common assumption that cofeeding transmission is not relevant in models of chronic host infection, such as Lyme disease, could lead to underestimating pathogen prevalence."

Acaricides are pharmacologic agents that kill ticks. The emergence of acaricide-resistant ticks calls for alternative control strategies for ticks and tick-borne diseases. Many animals develop resistance to ticks after repeated infestations, but the nature of this acquired anti-tick immunity remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks in mice and found that antibodies were required, as was IgFc receptor expression on basophils but not on mast cells. The infiltration of basophils at tick-feeding sites occurred during the second, but not the first, tick infestation. To assess the requirement for basophil infiltration to acquired tick resistance, mice expressing the human diphtheria toxin receptor under the control of the mast cell protease 8 (Mcpt8) promoter were generated. Diphtheria toxin administration to these mice selectively ablated basophils. Diphtheria toxin-mediated basophil depletion before the second tick infestation resulted in loss of acquired tick resistance. These data provide the first clear evidence, to our knowledge, that basophils play an essential and nonredundant role in antibody-mediated acquired immunity against ticks, which may suggest new strategies for controlling tick-borne diseases."

Much of this information has been gained by studying the course of infection of naïve or vaccinated mice with Borrelia burgdorferi. However, the Borrelia-vaccination and -infection model has not been described using the organismal parameters commonly used in the widely accepted Borrelia-infection model. This is the first comparison between the Borrelia-infection and the Borrelia-vaccination and -infection models of arthritis. Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected C3H/HeN mice develop acute inflammation comparable to that of nonvaccinated, Borrelia-infected C3H/HeN mice. The duration and severity of arthritis in Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected mice was slightly increased compared with Borrelia-infected mice. Significantly, Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected C3H/HeN mice produce interleukin-17 (IL-17), while Borrelia-infected mice that had not been previously vaccinated do not. Neutralization of IL-17 in Borrelia-vaccinated and -infected C3H/HeN mice decreased the severity of arthritis, although not to the degree we observed previously in C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, these findings show that the Borrelia-vaccination and -infection model of Lyme arthritis incorporates elements of adaptive immunity that likely have relevance to human disease, but may not be observed in Borrelia-infected C3H/HeN mice."

To asses Borrelia burgdorferi influence on the susceptibility of T lymphocytes to apoptosis, we have measured expression of the Fas death receptor on these cells after incubation with live B. burgdorferi. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 23 LD patients (18 with Lyme arthritis, 5 with neuroborreliosis) and 13 healthy controls (C) were incubated for 48 hours with and without live B. burgdorferi spirochetes: B. afzelii, B. garinii or B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. After incubation, Fas expression on CD3+ cells was measured cytometrically with FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody. Median fraction of Fas-expressing T lymphocytes increased under incubation with B. burgdorferi, with more cells expressing Fas after incubation with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto than with B. garinii. There was a tendency for a higher expression of Fas on T lymphocytes from LD patients then from controls, both in unstimulated and B. burgdorferi-stimulated cultures, but it did not reach a level of statistical significance. B. burgdorferi seems to increase Fas expression on CD3+ T lymphocytes, which may render these cells more susceptible to apoptosis. This effect is stronger for B. burgdorferi s.s. than for B. garinii genospecies."

This has resulted in the unprecedented intrusion of government and the legal systems into the practice of medicine and scientific research. Because there is no clinical evidence that this condition is due to a persistent infection, advocating extended antibiotic therapy is not justified and has been shown to be harmful and of no benefit."

An 18-year-old African American woman with severe active hidradenitis suppurativa of the axillae and groin presented with a 2-week history of bilateral blurry vision. On examination, best-corrected visual acuity was counting fingers in the right eye and 20/70 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse vascularization of the corneal stroma with surrounding infiltrates bilaterally. In the left eye, corneal thinning and an epithelial defect were present in an area of infiltrate. Our clinical impression at that time was bilateral interstitial keratitis with secondary bacterial keratitis in the left eye. Topical therapy, prednisolone acetate 1% in the right eye, and ofloxacin in the left eye, was instituted. A systemic workup, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, Lyme titer, cytoplasmatic staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, rapid plasma reagin, basic metabolic panel, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and a chest x-ray was negative. Topical steroids were used in the left eye after resolution of the bacterial keratitis. The interstitial keratitis responded to topical steroids and remained in remission after steroid taper. However, bilateral interstitial keratitis recurred coincident with a severe flare of hidradenitis suppurativa within 1 month of discontinuing the topical steroids. A course of subcutaneous adalimumab injections (40 mg/mL every 2 weeks) for hidradenitis suppurativa was implemented. Both her dermatological and ocular conditions responded to this therapy and have remained in remission through 7 months of follow-up. Hidradenitis suppurativa is a rare cause of bilateral interstitial keratitis. Patients may experience simultaneous exacerbations of both dermatological and ocular manifestations. Systemic treatment with adalimumab can improve both dermatological and ocular conditions."

Both patients had positive serum and cerebrospinal fluid serology, a positive intrathecal anti-Borrelia antibody index, and a good outcome on ceftriaxone. Specific diagnosis of Lyme ON is important since improvement of visual acuity is possible with specific antibiotherapy, even after many months."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is reported across Canada, but pinpointing the source of infection has been problematic. In this three-year, bird-tick-pathogen study (2004-2006), 366 ticks representing 12 species were collected from 151 songbirds (31 passerine species/subspecies) at 16 locations Canada-wide. Of the 167 ticks/pools tested, 19 (11.4%) were infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.). Sequencing of the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer gene revealed four Borrelia genotypes: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) and three novel genotypes (BC genotype 1, BC genotype 2, BC genotype 3). All four genotypes were detected in spirochete-infected Ixodes auritulus (females, nymphs, larvae) suggesting this tick species is a vector for B. burgdorferi s.l. We provide first-time records for: ticks in the Yukon (north of 60 degrees latitude), northernmost collection of Amblyomma americanum in North America, and Amblyomma imitator in Canada. First reports of bird-derived ticks infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. include: live culture of spirochetes from Ixodes pacificus (nymph) plus detection in I. auritulus nymphs, Ixodes scapularis in New Brunswick, and an I. scapularis larva in Canada. We provide the first account of B. burgdorferi s. l. in an Ixodes muris tick collected from a songbird anywhere. Congruent with previous data for the American Robin, we suggest that the Common Yellowthroat, Golden-crowned Sparrow, Song Sparrow, and Swainson's Thrush are reservoir-competent hosts. Song Sparrows, the predominant hosts, were parasitized by I. auritulus harboring all four Borrelia genotypes. Our results show that songbirds import B. burgdorferi s.l.-infected ticks into Canada. Bird-feeding I. scapularis subadults were infected with Lyme spirochetes during both spring and fall migration in eastern Canada. Because songbirds disperse millions of infected ticks across Canada, people and domestic animals contract Lyme disease outside of the known and expected range."

There was an overall recovery of spirochetes from the midguts of Culicidae and Simuliidae of 23.5% and 11.4%, respectively. Spirochetes were not detected in Tabanidae. Seven spirochetal strains have been successfully recovered from mosquitoes and black flies: BR149 (Culex pipiens), BR151 (Cx. pipiens), BR173 (Cx. pipiens), BR177 (Cx. pipiens), BR193 (Aedes cinereus), BR208 (Cx. pipiens), and BR231 (Simulium noelleri). The strains have been adapted to laboratory conditions (BSK-H Complete medium). Their preliminary determination based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing has shown that they differ from the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato as well as other members of the Order Spirochaetales indicating novel bacterial species in the Family Spirochaetaceae."

Firstly they play an important role in feeding a tick and modifying a host's immune response. Secondly, the increasing expression of the salp 10 and salp 10 genes begins at early tick feeding stages. Thirdly, the activity of these genes increases with the beginning of feeding by tens and hundreds times and keeps at this level until the third tick feeding stage is over."

Examination revealed that the patient had a facial diplegia of the peripheral type. A peripheral blood smear demonstrated the presence of the asexual trophozoite stage of Plasmodium vivax with ring-form trophozoites, which led to a diagnosis of malaria. A serum work-up revealed increased IgG titers of antibodies to myelin-associated glycoprotein and ganglioside GD1b. The patient was administered antimalarial treatment, 1 week after which he showed signs of recovery. To our knowledge, this is the first case of facial diplegia after malaria infection, providing evidence that the mechanism underlying the condition is related to immune-mediated disease. Facial diplegia can manifest after P. vivax infection."

		"abstract": "Population genetics can help us better understand species microevolution and population biology, but inferences made from the genetic polymorphisms of field-collected organisms critically rely on sampling design. The population structure of the tick Ixodes ricinus L. (Acari, Ixodidae), a commonly encountered ectoparasite and the principal vector of human Lyme disease in Europe, has been the focus of some study, but many ecological aspects of this species remain poorly understood. Here, we apply a Bayesian clustering approach to observed and simulated data to examine within-population structure in I. ricinus, and to re-analyse patterns of sex-biased dispersal based on this substructure. We found between 18 and 27 distinct clusters within each of the 12 subsamples examined with a significant drop of heterozygote deficits. Parallel analyses on a comparable species, the seabird tick Ixodes uriae, indicated that these clusters can reflect important ecological features of the species (i.e., local host-associations). Analyses that considered the within-population clustering pattern of I. ricinus showed reversed patterns of sex-biased dispersal as compared to raw data (i.e., female-biased instead of male-biased dispersal). Simulated data supported the hypothesis that these scale-dependant patterns could be due to a combination of sex-specific dispersal and mortality. These different results raise new questions on the dispersal and host use strategies of I. ricinus and the potential importance of these ecological features for disease transmission. Furthermore, this work underlines the importance of taking into account patterns of genetic substructure when investigating sex-biased dispersal in natural populations."

		"abstract": "Vector organisms are implicated in the transmission of close to a third of all infectious diseases. In many cases, multiple vectors (species or populations) can participate in transmission but may contribute differently to disease ecology and evolution. The presence of cryptic vector populations can be particularly problematic as differences in infection can be difficult to evaluate and may lead to erroneous evolutionary and epidemiological inferences. Here, we combine site-occupancy modeling and molecular assays to evaluate patterns of infection in the marine cycle of Lyme borreliosis, involving colonial seabirds, the tick Ixodes uriae, and bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. complex. In this cycle, the tick vector consists of multiple, cryptic (phenotypically undistinguishable but genetically distinct) host races that are frequently found in sympatry. Our results show that bacterial detection varies strongly among tick races leading to vector-specific biases if raw counts are used to calculate Borrelia prevalence. These differences are largely explained by differences in infection intensity among tick races. After accounting for detection probabilities, we found that overall prevalence in this system is higher than previously suspected and that certain vector-host combinations likely contribute more than others to the local dynamics and large-scale dispersal of Borrelia spirochetes. These results highlight the importance of evaluating vector population structure and accounting for detection probability when trying to understand the evolutionary ecology of vector-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "A seroepidemiology survey of nine zoonoses was carried out in 2007 on 90 healthy adult volunteers in Viljujsk, a northern city in the Republic of Sakha (Eastern Siberia). The seroprevalence of Lyme borreliosis was 3.3% by immunofluorescence. None of the subjects displayed a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/Western blot result for alveolar or cystic echinococcosis. The seroprevalence of toxocariasis by Western blot was 4.4%, and 8.9% of the subjects had anti-Toxoplasma IgG. By enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the seroprevalence of trichinellosis was 4.4%. Three subjects were simultaneously positive for tick-borne encephalitis and West Nile infection, so no clear diagnostic conclusion could be reached for these flavivirus diseases. Interestingly, Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever had an 11.1% seroprevalence rate, indicating that Viljujsk is the most northern focus of this infection. Additionally, this finding suggests a potential involvement of Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever agent, or of another member of the Bunyaviridae family, in the genesis of the so-called Viljujsk encephalomyelitis."

		"abstract": "The metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid (Abeta) is widely studied in Alzheimer's disease, where Abeta deposition and plaque development are essential components of the pathogenesis. However, the physiological role of amyloid in the adult nervous system remains largely unknown. We have previously found altered cerebral amyloid metabolism in other neuroinflammatory conditions. To further elucidate this, we investigated amyloid metabolism in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB). The first part of the study was a cross-sectional cohort study in 61 patients with acute facial palsy (19 with LNB and 42 with idiopathic facial paresis, Bell's palsy) and 22 healthy controls. CSF was analysed for the beta-amyloid peptides Abeta38, Abeta40 and Abeta42, and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) isoforms alpha-sAPP and beta-sAPP. CSF total-tau (T-tau), phosphorylated tau (P-tau) and neurofilament protein (NFL) were measured to monitor neural cell damage. The second part of the study was a prospective cohort-study in 26 LNB patients undergoing consecutive lumbar punctures before and after antibiotic treatment to study time-dependent dynamics of the biomarkers. In the cross-sectional study, LNB patients had lower levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau, and higher levels of CSF NFL than healthy controls and patients with Bell's palsy. In the prospective study, LNB patients had low levels of CSF alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau at baseline, which all increased towards normal at follow-up. Amyloid metabolism is altered in LNB. CSF levels of alpha-sAPP, beta-sAPP and P-tau are decreased in acute infection and increase after treatment. In combination with earlier findings in multiple sclerosis, cerebral SLE and HIV with cerebral engagement, this points to an influence of neuroinflammation on amyloid metabolism."

		"abstract": "The epidemiology of vector-borne zoonotic diseases is determined by encounter rates between vectors and hosts. Alterations to the behavior of reservoir hosts caused by the infectious agent have the potential to dramatically alter disease transmission and human risk. We examined the effect of Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, on one of its most important reservoir hosts, the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. We mimic natural infections in mice using the vector (Black-legged ticks, Ixodes scapularis) and examine the immunological and behavioral responses of mouse hosts. Despite producing antibodies against B. burgdorferi, infected mice did not have elevated white blood cells compared with uninfected mice. In addition, infected and uninfected mice did not differ in their wheel-running activity. Our results suggest that infection with the spirochete B. burgdorferi has little impact on the field activity of white-footed mice. Lyme disease transmission appears to be uncomplicated by pathogen-altered behavior of this reservoir host."

Although lyme disease is known to induce typical clinical findings that are observed in various collagen vascular diseases, to our knowledge, we believe that our case is the first presentation of acute lyme disease associated with amyopathic dermatomyositis, which was then followed by severe and fatal interstitial pulmonary fibrosis only two months later. We present a case of a 64-year-old African-American man with multiple medical problems who was diagnosed with acute lyme infection after presenting with the pathognomonic rash and confirmatory serology. In spite of appropriate antimicrobial therapy for lyme infection, he developed unexpected amyopathic dermatomyositis and then interstitial lung disease. This case illustrates a potential for lyme disease to produce clinical syndromes that may be indistinguishable from primary connective tissue diseases. An atypical and sequential presentation (dermatomyositis and interstitial lung disease) of a common disease (lyme infection) is discussed. This case illustrates that in patients who are diagnosed with lyme infection who subsequently develop atypical muscular, respiratory or other systemic complaints, the possibility of severe rheumatological and pulmonary complications should be considered."

To better define how CRASP-1 contributes to infection, we aimed to identify novel CRASP-1-binding host proteins. Here, we identified a number of novel human CRASP-1-binding proteins, including bone morphogenic protein 2, collagen I, collagen III, collagen IV, fibronectin, laminin, and plasminogen. The plasminogen-binding regions were located in 2 separate regions of CRASP-1. Our results demonstrated that plasminogen-bound CRASP-1 can be converted to plasmin by the urokinase-type plasminogen activator and that proteolytically active plasmin cleaves the synthetic chromogenic substrate S-2251 and the natural substrate fibrinogen. In conclusion, CRASP-1 is a multifunctional protein of B. burgdorferi that binds to several human extracellular matrix proteins and plasminogen. These interactions may contribute to adhesion, bacterial colonization, and organ tropism and may allow dissemination of B. burgdorferi in the host."

The purpose of this study was to describe the important characteristics of Lyme neuroborreliosis caused by Borrelia burgdorferi-like species in Taiwanese patients. Patients with acute neurological symptoms without a clear explanation during September 2005 to December 2008 were enrolled. All patients received extensive auxiliary investigations, including clinical evaluation by neurological examination, electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies, serological screening tests of serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by indirect immunofluorescent assay, and Western immunoblot analysis conducted for seroreactivities in serum and CSF of Borrelia burgdorferi-specific IgM and IgG antibodies. Eleven patients who presented with acute central nervous system (CNS) syndrome fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for neuroborreliosis. In the CSF studies, lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevation of total protein and normal glucose was noted in 9 patients. The clinical syndromes were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological studies. Ten of 11 patients were found to have brain stem or spinal cord lesions on neuroimaging studies, and 8 patients had concomitant peripheral nervous system involvement with electrophysiological evidence of multiple root lesions with an acute or subacute course. Lyme neuroborreliosis presenting as acute CNS syndrome with peripheral nervous system involvement simultaneously in the disease course, especially acute myelopolyradiculitis, in Taiwan is different from Lyme neuroborreliosis seen in Europe and North America. The treatment outcome is variable and based on the severity of initial neurological deficits, early diagnosis, and early management."

Field data are not yet available although the disease is known to be present in neighbouring areas. During a field study lasting twelve months, ticks were collected from the vegetation, from wild cervids and also from humans who reported a tick bite at the local hospital. All ticks were identified and Ixodes ricinus specimens were tested using three different polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (sl). To identify the genospecies of B. burgdorferi sl, a fragment of the 5S-23S ribosomal rRNA intergenic spacer of the positive samples was amplified and then sequenced. Sequencing of the 5S-23S intergenic spacer led to the identification of two different genospecies, namely: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. lusitaniae, both of which are involved in cases of human infection. Findings on the host-tick relationships and on the genospecies involved in the cycle of borreliosis confirm the suitable conditions for Lyme disease in the study area. The results concur with previous findings reported in the Mediterranean region."

Here we show that sialostatin L2 - but not sialostatin L - facilitates the growth of B. burgdorferi in murine skin. To examine the structural basis underlying these differential effects of the two sialostatins, we have determined the crystal structures of both sialostatin L and L2. This is the first structural analysis of cystatins from an invertebrate source. Sialostatin L2 crystallizes as a monomer with an 'unusual' conformation of the N-terminus, while sialostatin L crystallizes as a domain-swapped dimer with an N-terminal conformation similar to other cystatins. Deletion of the 'unusual' N-terminal five residues of sialostatin L2 results in marked changes in its selectivity, suggesting that this region is a particularly important determinant of the biochemical activity of sialostatin L2. Collectively, our results reveal the structure of two tick salivary components that facilitate vector blood feeding and that one of them also supports pathogen transmission to the vertebrate host."

		"abstract": "A 2-year study was conducted in a mountainous area of northeast Italy to evaluate the occurrence and distribution of ticks, as well as to assess the prevalence of the spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. All ticks collected were Ixodes ricinus L. (Parasitiformes: Ixodidae). In general, most nymphs and adult ticks were collected from April to July. Tick density was highly variable among sites; however, two areas with different infestation levels were recognized. Prevalences of B. burgdorferi s.l. in nymphal stages were rather variable between sites; overall the prevalence of infected nymphs in the whole area was slightly higher than 20%. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. in nymphs does not seem to be correlated with nymph density. The correlation between the incidence of Lyme borreliosis (reported human cases/1000 inhabitants/year) and Borrelia prevalence in nymphs was not significant, although a significant correlation was found between borreliosis incidence and nymph density."

		"abstract": "In the far-western United States, the nymphal stage of the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus, has been implicated as the primary vector to humans of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereinafter referred to as B. burgdorferi), the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis in North America. In the present study, we sought to determine if infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi in I. pacificus nymphs and the density of infected nymphs differ between dense-woodland types within Mendocino County, California, and to develop and evaluate a spatially-explicit model for density of infected nymphs in dense woodlands within this high-incidence area for Lyme borreliosis. In total, 4.9% (264) of 5431 I. pacificus nymphs tested for the presence of B. burgdorferi were infected. Among the 78 sampling sites, infection prevalence ranged from 0 to 22% and density of infected nymphs from 0 to 2.04 per 100 m(2). Infection prevalence was highest in woodlands dominated by hardwoods (6.2%) and lowest for redwood (1.9%) and coastal pine (0%). Density of infected nymphs also was higher in hardwood-dominated woodlands than in conifer-dominated ones that included redwood or pine. Our spatial risk model, which yielded an overall accuracy of 85%, indicated that warmer areas with less variation between maximum and minimum monthly water vapor in the air were more likely to include woodlands with elevated acarological risk of exposure to infected nymphs. We found that 37% of dense woodlands in the county were predicted to pose an elevated risk of exposure to infected nymphs, and that 94% of the dense-woodland areas that were predicted to harbor elevated densities of infected nymphs were located on privately-owned land."

		"abstract": "Flawed clinical practice guidelines may compromise patient care. Commercial conflicts of interest on panels that write treatment guidelines are particularly problematic, because panelists may have conflicting agendas that influence guideline recommendations. Historically, there has been no legal remedy for conflicts of interest on guidelines panels. However, in May 2008, the Attorney General of Connecticut concluded a ground-breaking antitrust investigation into the development of Lyme disease treatment guidelines by one of the largest medical societies in the United States, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA). Although the investigation found significant flaws in the IDSA guidelines development process, the subsequent review of the guidelines mandated by the settlement was compromised by a lack of impartiality at various stages of the IDSA review process. This article will examine the interplay between the recent calls for guidelines reform, the ethical canons of medicine, and due process considerations under antitrust laws as they apply to the formulation of the IDSA Lyme disease treatment guidelines. The article will also discuss pitfalls in the implementation of the IDSA antitrust settlement that should be avoided in the future."

The clinical presentation varies depending on the stage of the illness: early disease includes erthyma migrans, early disseminated disease includes multiple erythema migrans, meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, and carditis; late disease is primarily arthritis. The symptoms and signs of infection resolve in most patients after treatment with appropriate antimicrobials for 2 to 4 weeks. Serologic testing should be used judiciously as it often results in misdiagnosis when performed on blood from patients with a low prior probability of disease and those with only nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue or arthralgia without objective signs of infection."

Four National Institutes of Health (NIH) trials validated the existence and severity of CLD. Despite the evidence, there are physicians who continue to deny the existence and severity of CLD, which can hinder efforts to find a solution. Recognizing CLD could facilitate efforts to avoid diagnostic delays of two years and durations of illness of 4.7 to 9 years described in the NIH trials. The risk to society of emerging antibiotic-resistant organisms should be weighed against the societal risks associated with failing to treat an emerging population saddled with CLD. The mixed long-term outcome in children could also be examined. Once we accept the evidence that CLD exists, the medical community should be able to find solutions. Medical professionals should be encouraged to examine whether: (1) innovative treatments for early LD might prevent CLD, (2) early diagnosis of CLD might result in better treatment outcomes, and (3) more effective treatment regimens can be developed for CLD patients who have had prolonged illness and an associated poor quality of life."

However, the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, in the tick vector is nearly identical in the 2 regions. The disparity in human Lyme disease incidence may result from a disparity in the human invasiveness of the bacteria in the Northeast and Midwest caused by fundamentally different evolutionary histories. B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest are geographically isolated, enabling evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness. However, we found that B. burgdorferi populations in the Northeast and Midwest shared a recent common ancestor, which suggests that substantial evolutionary divergence in human invasiveness has not occurred. We propose that differences in either animal ecology or human behavior are the root cause of the differences in human incidence between the 2 regions."

The aim of this study was to examine Treg cell numbers and function in patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. CD4+ T cell subsets were enumerated in the peripheral blood (PB) and synovial fluid (SF) of 12 patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis and 6 patients with antibiotic-responsive arthritis. Treg cell function was examined using Borrelia-specific and nonspecific Treg cell proliferation assays. In both patient groups, interferon-gamma-positive Th1 cells in SF were abundant and enriched (approximately 50% of CD4+ T cells). In patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis, the median percentages of FoxP3-positive Treg cells were significantly higher in SF than in PB (12% versus 6%; P = 0.03) or in SF from patients with antibiotic-responsive arthritis (12% versus 5%; P = 0.04). Moreover, in the antibiotic-refractory group, a higher percentage of Treg cells in SF correlated with a shorter duration until resolution of arthritis (r = -0.74, P = 0.006). In contrast, patients with fewer Treg cells had suboptimal responses to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and a longer duration of arthritis after antibiotic treatment, and they often required synovectomies for arthritis resolution. In each group, Treg cells in SF dampened Borrelia burgdorferi-specific proliferative responses, and in 2 patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis, Treg cells were functional in nonspecific suppression assays. Treg cells were functional in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis, and in some patients, higher numbers of these cells in SF appeared to participate in arthritis resolution. However, as in the murine model, patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis and lower numbers of Treg cells seemed unable to achieve resolution of synovial inflammation."

The IDSA agreed to convene an independent panel to conduct a one-time review of the guidelines. The Review Panel members, vetted by an ombudsman for potential conflicts of interest, reviewed the entirety of the 2006 guidelines, with particular attention to the recommendations devoted to post-Lyme disease syndromes. After multiple meetings, a public hearing, and extensive review of research and other information, the Review Panel concluded that the recommendations contained in the 2006 guidelines were medically and scientifically justified on the basis of all of the available evidence and that no changes to the guidelines were necessary."

We found that search traffic for the string \"Lyme disease\" reflected increased likelihood of exposure during spring and summer months; conversely, the string \"cough\" had higher relative traffic during winter months. The cities and states with the highest amount of search traffic for \"Lyme disease\" overlapped considerably with those where Lyme is known to be endemic.

The aim of this work was to determine the risk of LD in relation to the way of removing ticks and duration of tick attachment. In the period from 2000 to 2007 a prospective study was conducted including persons with tick bite referred to the Institute of Epidemiology, Military Medical Academy, and followed for the occurrence of early Lyme disease up to six months after a tick bite. Epidemiological questionnaire was used to collect relevant information about the place and time of tick bites, the way of a removing tick, duration of tick attachment, remnants of a tick left in the skin (parts of the mouth device) and the signs of clinical manifestations of LD. Duration of tick attachment was determined on the basis of size of engorged tick and epidemiological data. Removed ticks were determined by the key of Pomerancev. Professional removing of attached tick was considered to be removing of tick with mechanical means by healthcare personnel. Fisher's exact test, Chi squares test and calculation of the relative risk (RR) were used for data analysis. Of 3 126 patients with tick bite, clinical manifestations of LD were demonstrated in 19 (0.61%). In the group of subjects (n = 829) in which a tick was not removed professionally there were 17 (2.05%) cases with LD, while in the group of respondents (n = 2 297) in who a tick was removed professionally there were 2 (0.09%) cases with LD after tick bite (RR, 23.55; p < 0.0001). The disease was most frequent in the group of respondents with incompletely and unprofessionally removed ticks (2.46%). In the groups of patients with unprofessionally but completely removed ticks LD occurred in 0.89%, while in the group of subjects with a tick removed by an expert, but incompletely in 0.78% cases. The disease occurred rarely in the group with a tick removed completely and professionally (0.05%). There was no case of LD in the group of patients with a tick removed within 24 hours. The longer time of exposure after 24 hours, the higher absolute risk of disease was reported. In prevention of Lyme disease it is important to urgent remove a tick, to use a correct procedure of removing and to remove the whole tick without any remnants."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by various species of Borrelia, is transmitted by Ixodes ticks in North America and Europe. Studies have shown the genotype of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) or the species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) affects the ability of the bacteria to cause local or disseminated infection in humans. We used a multilocus PCR electrospray mass spectrometry assay to determine the species and genotype Borrelia from ticks collected in New York, Connecticut, Indiana, Southern Germany, and California and characterized isolates from parts of the United States and Europe. These analyses identified 53 distinct genotypes of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with higher resolution than ospC typing. Genotypes of other members of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex were also identified and genotyped including B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. lusitaniae, B. spielmanii, and B. valaisiana. While each site in North America had genotypes unique to that location, we found genotypes shared between individual regions and two genotypes found across the United States. Significant B. burgdorferi s.s. genotypic diversity was observed between North America and Europe: only 6.6% of US genotypes (3 of 45) were found in Europe and 27% of the European genotypes (3 of 11) were observed in the US. Interestingly, 39% of adult Ixodes scapularis ticks from North America were infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi s.s. and 22.2% of Ixodes ricinus ticks from Germany were infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi s.l. The presence of multiple Borrelia genotypes in ticks increases the probability that a person will be infected with more than one genotype of B. burgdorferi, potentially increasing the risks of disseminated Lyme disease. Our study indicates that the genotypic diversity of Borrelia in ticks in both North America and Europe is higher then previously reported and can have potential clinical consequences."

Hunter-killed deer were checked for ticks in designated check-stations in the opening firearm hunting season between 2005 and 2007. Hunting locations for approximately 3,600 deer were used in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA) to examine the influence of forest and water features in the surrounding area on the occurrence of the tick and bacteria. In total, 82 of the 92 (89%) Indiana counties were sampled from 2005 to 2007. The proportion of tick-infested deer was 13.6, 15.8, and 25.5% in these years, respectively. There was a significant nonlinear response for I. scapularis to forest cover in 1 yr that indicated a greater probability of this tick presence at intermediate levels of forest area. Infested does were harvested in significantly more forested areas than bucks. No significant correlation was found neither between levels of forest area and B. burgdorferi nor between water bodies and both organisms."

		"abstract": "Invariant NKT (iNKT) cells regulate early immune responses to infections, in part because of their rapid release of IFN-gamma and IL-4. iNKT cells are proposed to reduce the severity of Lyme disease following Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Unlike conventional T cells, iNKT cells express an invariant alphabeta TCR that recognizes lipids bound to the MHC class I-like molecule, CD1d. Furthermore, these cells are positively selected following TCR interactions with glycolipid/CD1d complexes expressed on CD4+CD8+ thymocytes. Whereas conventional T cell development can proceed with as few as 4/10 CD3 immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), little is known about the ITAM requirements for iNKT cell selection and expansion. We analyzed iNKT cell development in CD3 zeta transgenic lines with various tyrosine-to-phenylalanine substitutions (YF) that eliminated the functions of the first (YF1,2), third (YF5,6), or all three (YF1-6) CD3 zeta ITAMs. iNKT cell numbers were significantly reduced in the thymus, spleen, and liver of all YF mice compared with wild type mice. The reduced numbers of iNKT cells resulted from significant reductions in the expression of the early growth response 2 and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger transcription factors. In the mice with few to no iNKT cells, there was no difference in the severity of Lyme arthritis compared with wild type controls, following infections with the spirochete B. burgdorferi. These findings indicate that a full complement of functional CD3 zeta ITAMs is required for effective iNKT cell development."

In the study area, Ixodes ricinus were abundant and were found infected by B. lusitaniae and B. afzelii. Lizards (Podarcis spp.) and mice (Apodemus spp.), respectively, are the reservoir hosts of these two Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genospecies and compete for immature ticks. B. lusitaniae R(0) estimation is in agreement with field observations, indicating the maintenance and diffusion of this genospecies in the study area, where lizards are abundant and highly infested by I. ricinus immature stages. In fact, B. lusitaniae shows a focal distribution in areas where the tick vector and the vertebrate reservoir coexist. Mouse population dynamics and their relatively low suitability as hosts for nymphs seem to determine, on the other hand, a less efficient transmission of B. afzelii, whose R(0) differs between scenarios in the study area. Considering host population dynamics, the proposed model suggests that, given a certain combination of the two host population sizes, both spirochete genospecies can coexist in our study area. Additional incompetent hosts for B. burgdorferi s.l. have a negative effect on B. afzelii maintenance, whose R(0) results > 1 only with high mouse population densities and/or low lizards abundance, but they do not seem to influence B. lusitaniae transmission cycle on Le Cerbaie. Secondly, our model confirms the importance of nymphs' infestation, of host population density and diversity, and spirochetes host association for the maintenance of the transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi s.l."

In this case-control study we investigated the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the debated presence of Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus I (HTLV-I) sequences, by polymerase chain reaction on nucleic acid extracts from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin biopsies. Moreover, by a multivariate approach we analyzed in the same case-control study also the contribution of two previously examined pathogens: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Significant differences in the frequency of infectious agents in cases and controls were detected for Bb, HTLV-I and EBV. In MF patients we found the concurrent presence of two or three of these pathogen sequences in 21 out of 83 cases, but only in 1 out of 83 healthy controls. Our results suggest that the persistence of multiple infectious agents may cause a long-term antigenic stimulation contributing to the malignant transformation of T lymphocytes, especially when associated with HTLV-I like sequences. However, these infectious agents do not seem to have effects on disease progression."

The patient's electrocardiogram on admission revealed newly diagnosed bradycardia due to atrioventricular heart block. The ventricular heart rate was 35/min. The patient was admitted to the ICU.

This evaluation demonstrated that practitioners often use Lyme serology in a \"trial and error\" way, without any reasonable ground. According to our calculation the positive predictive value of the best Lyme antibody tests if applied in this way is <9.1%. Our study suggests that the present practice of applying Lyme serological tests may result in more harm than benefit."

First lyme cases have been reported after 1990's in Turkey and the spirochete was isolated from the tick vectors. In this case series three human Lyme cases confirmed with not only serological tests but also growth in Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly medium were presented for the first time in Turkey. Two of these three cases were residents in Istanbul while the third one has acquired the infection in USA (imported case). First case was a previously healthy 46 years old male, admitted to the state hospital with the complaints of diarrheae, chills, nausea, vomiting, cough, sputum production and widespread myalgias. The patient was a chronic alcohol consumer with a history of frequent visits to the forest areas. The laboratory test results revealed hepatonephritis-like clinical picture and pulmonary involvement. Leptospira IgM and Borrelia IgM antibodies were detected in the serum by ELISA and both of the agents were isolated in the blood cultures of the patient. This case was then diagnosed as Lyme disease with leptospirosis co-infection. The second case was a 32 years old female who suffered from Bell's palsy for the last 15 days. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed a nodular lesion at globus pallidus. Since the patient had a history of tick-bite, further testing was done for Lyme disease. Borrelia IgM and IgG antibodies were found negative, however, Borrelia was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid sample. The third patient was a 68 years old female who had recently travelled to USA and exposed to a tick-bite in a recreational area. She suffered from nausea, vomiting, myalgia and cutaneous lesions compatible with erythema chronicum migrans. Samples taken from the skin lesions revealed growth of Borrelia. As far as the current literature is concerned, these were the first three culture proven cases of Borrelia in Turkey. These three cases supported the presence of Lyme disease in Turkey and indicated that the disease could present itself in various clinical pictures."

If recovery or defective healing has not taken place within 6-12 months, it is mandatory to exclude malignant disease. Severity of the paresis and electromyography are to date the best prognostic markers for defective healing. Steroid application is the only evidence-based therapy to date with recovery rates >90%. The spontaneous recovery rate is about 80%. There is a lack of well defined diagnostic procedures to detect those patients who will recover spontaneously. On the other hand, patients with severe complete paresis might profit from additional antiviral drugs. There is an urgent need for further clinical trials in patients with severe IFP."

Although BB0419 was shown to be a diguanylate cyclase, the extent to which bb0419 or any of the putative cyclic-di-GMP metabolizing genes impact B. burgdorferi motility and pathogenesis has not yet been reported. Here we identify and characterize a phosphodiesterase (BB0363). BB0363 specifically hydrolyzed cyclic-di-GMP with a K(m) of 0.054 microM, confirming it is a functional cyclic-di-GMP phosphodiesterase. A targeted mutation in bb0363 was constructed using a newly developed promoterless antibiotic cassette that does not affect downstream gene expression. The mutant cells exhibited an altered swimming pattern, indicating a function for cyclic-di-GMP in regulating B. burgdorferi motility. Furthermore, the bb0363 mutant cells were not infectious in mice, demonstrating an important role for cyclic-di-GMP in B. burgdorferi infection. The mutant cells were able to survive within Ixodes scapularis ticks after a blood meal from naïve mice; however, ticks infected with the mutant cells were not able to infect naïve mice. Both motility and infection phenotypes were restored upon genetic complementation. These results reveal an important connection between cyclic-di-GMP, B. burgdorferi motility and Lyme disease pathogenesis. A mechanism by which cyclic-di-GMP influences motility and infection is proposed."

In the present study, we confirmed the role played by TLR2 in the recognition of Borrelia bacteria but also demonstrated a crucial role for the intracellular peptidoglycan receptor NOD2 for sensing the spirochete. Cells from individuals who were homozygous for the loss-of-function mutation 3020insC in the NOD2 gene were defective with respect to cytokine release after stimulation with Borrelia species, and this was confirmed in peritoneal macrophages from mice lacking RICK, the adaptor molecule used by NOD2. In contrast, NOD1 played no major role in the recognition of Borrelia spirochetes. This raises the intriguing possibility that recognition of Borrelia spirochetes is exerted by TLR2 in combination with NOD2 and that both receptors are necessary for an effective induction of cytokines by Borrelia species. The interplay between TLR2 and NOD2 might not only be necessary for the induction of a proper immune response but may also contribute to inflammatory-induced pathology."

		"abstract": "The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), despite well defined clinical criteria is not always simple. On many occasions it is difficult to differentiate MS from various non-MS idiopathic demyelinating disorders, specific and infectious inflammatory diseases or non-inflammatory demyelinating diseases. Clinicians should be aware of various clinical and MRI \"red flags\" that may point to the other diagnosis and demand further diagnostic evaluation. It is generally accepted that atypical clinical symptoms or atypical neuroimaging signs determine necessity for broad differential diagnostic work up. Of the infectious diseases that are most commonly mistaken for MS the clinician should take into account Whipple's disease, Lyme disease, Syphilis, HIV/AIDS, Brucellosis, HHV-6 infection, Hepatitis C, Mycoplasma and Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, among others. Cat scratch disease caused by Bartonella hensellae, Mediterranean spotted fever caused by Riketssia connore and Leptospirosis caused by different Leptospira serovars rarely cause focal neurological deficit and demyelinating MRI changes similar to MS. When atypical clinical and neuroimaging presentations are present, serology on rare infectious diseases that may mimic MS may be warranted. This review will focus on the infectious diseases mimicking MS with presentation of rare illustrative cases."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic disease which affects several organs such as skin, nervous system, joints and the heart. The presented study focused on patients with persisting symptoms of the disease, which could be in correlation with Lyme disease but antiborrelial antibodies were not confirmed by screening tests. 32 patients with anamnestic data and suspected clinical signs of lyme borreliosis were tested for the presence of antiborrelia antibodies by using ELISA and westernblot analysis and the state of cellular and humoral immunity. All patients had specific antiborrelial antibodies confirmed by using the westernblot in spite of negative ELISA. Immunological investigations revealed a deficiency of cellular immunity in all patients and in a part of them (15.6%) a deficiency of humoral immunity was also found. The presence of different types of autoantibodies was detected in 17 (53.1%) patients. In patients with persisting difficulties that could be associated with Lyme disease, it is necessary to use the westernblot test which could prove the presence of specific antibodies. It is probably due to the very low production of specific antibodies caused also by the status of immune deficiency detected in all our patients (Tab. 1, Ref. 11)."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen, dramatically alters its protein profile when it is transmitted between ticks and mammals. Several differentially expressed proteins have been shown to be critical for the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of the surface lipoprotein-encoding gene bba07 is induced by an elevated temperature and a reduced pH during in vitro cultivation, as well as during nymphal tick feeding. Expression of bba07 is regulated by the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway, a central regulatory network that is activated during nymphal feeding. By generating a bba07 mutant of an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi, we demonstrated that although BBA07-deficient spirochetes were capable of infecting mice via needle inoculation and surviving in ticks, they were defective in infection of mammals via tick transmission. Complementation of the bba07 mutant with a wild-type copy of bba07 partially restored the transmission defect of the bba07 mutant. Based on these findings, we concluded that the surface lipoprotein BBA07 is produced during tick feeding and facilitates optimal transmission of B. burgdorferi from the tick vector to a mammalian host."

A DNA region 5' of the start of erp transcription, Operator 2, was previously shown to be essential for regulation of expression. We now report identification and characterization of a novel erp Operator 2-binding protein, which we named BpaB. erp operons are located on episomal cp32 prophages, and a single bacterium may contain as many as 10 different cp32s. Each cp32 family member encodes a unique BpaB protein, yet the three tested cp32-encoded BpaB alleles all bound to the same DNA sequence. A 20-bp region of erp Operator 2 was determined to be essential for BpaB binding, and initial protein binding to that site was required for binding of additional BpaB molecules. A 36-residue region near the BpaB carboxy terminus was found to be essential for high-affinity DNA-binding. BpaB competed for binding to erp Operator 2 with a second B. burgdorferi DNA-binding protein, EbfC. Thus, cellular levels of free BpaB and EbfC could potentially control erp transcription levels."

		"abstract": "Northward expansion of the tick Ixodes scapularis is driving Lyme disease (LD) emergence in Canada. Information on mechanisms involved is needed to enhance surveillance and identify where LD risk is emerging. We used passive and active surveillance and phylogeographic analysis of Borrelia burgdorferi to investigate LD risk emergence in Quebec. In active surveillance, we collected ticks from the environment and from captured rodents. B. burgdorferi transmission was detected by serological analysis of rodents and by polymerase chain reaction assays of ticks. Spatiotemporal trends in passive surveillance data assisted interpretation of active surveillance. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of B. burgdorferi in ticks identified likely source locations of B. burgdorferi. In active surveillance, we found I. scapularis at 55% of sites, and we were more likely to find them at sites with a warmer climate. B. burgdorferi was identified at 13 I. scapularis-positive sites, but infection prevalence in ticks and animal hosts was low. Low infection prevalence in ticks submitted in passive surveillance after 2004-from the tick-positive regions identified in active surveillance-coincided with an exponential increase in tick submissions during this time. MLST analysis suggested recent introduction of B. burgdorferi from the northeastern United States. These data are consistent with I. scapularis ticks dispersed from the United States by migratory birds, founding populations where the climate is warmest, and then establishment of B. burgdorferi from the United States several years after I. scapularis have established. These observations provide vital information for public health to minimize the impact of LD in Canada."

		"abstract": "The practices of health care in late modernity are informed by competing visions of the ideal human and the nature of care. Western societies typically characterise the ideal human as independent and self-reliant. The resultant welfare systems provide temporary havens away from the everyday, competitive spaces of capitalist societies, termed here the enclave model. Social scientists problematise this model on several grounds: the construction of pathologised and medicalised body forms; the neglect of caring practices that are gendered, invisible and primarily private; the de-politicisation of caring practices. Policy calls reject reference to care and its associations with dependency, make visible and value informal care work or invoke a caring citizenship as a policy goal not just a means. Into this field of contested notions of care enters a well-documented rise in access to, and consultation through, the internet in everyday lives for a vast range of issues. Health care encountered online reflects a similar range in form as that encountered offline and much that is innovative, whilst clearly of benefit, does nothing to challenge the existing dominance of the enclave model of social care. However, certain groups of sites create spaces through which participants can both express and extract caring relationships that are otherwise unforthcoming. The paper argues that these sites afford the potential to develop an alternative model of caring, to reframe questions of how to care about distant others and to demonstrate the centrality of caring relations to human life."

It has been perceived as difficult to diagnose and treat, but much is now known about its clinical presentations, which largely fall into well defined categories in both adults and children. This review features recent publications on clinical diagnosis and management. The reported incidence of Lyme borreliosis has increased markedly in many countries. Many recent publications have focused on clinical and laboratory aspects of paediatric and adult neuroborreliosis, and there is now strong evidence for the efficacy of oral doxycycline for most presentations of neuroborreliosis. Serological tests have improved significantly. Several studies have confirmed that patients treated for early Lyme borreliosis have good overall long-term outcomes. Studies of patients with persistent symptoms following treatment have not shown evidence for active infection or for sustained benefit from prolonged antibiotic treatment. Greater efforts are needed to provide education for prevention and early diagnosis to avoid late complications. Further improvements in diagnostic tests would be welcomed. More research is required to assess the causes and management of post-Lyme symptoms."

		"abstract": "We recently discovered a critical role for type I interferon (IFN) in the development of murine Lyme arthritis. Borrelia burgdorferi-mediated induction of IFN-responsive genes by bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) was dependent upon a functional type I IFN receptor but independent of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), TLR4, TLR9, and the adapter molecule MyD88. We now demonstrate that induction of the IFN transcriptional profile in B. burgdorferi-stimulated BMDMs occurs independently of the adapter TRIF and of the cytoplasmic sensor NOD2. In contrast, B. burgdorferi-induced transcription of these genes was dependent upon a rapid STAT1 feedback amplification pathway. IFN profile gene transcription was IRF3 dependent but did not utilize B. burgdorferi-derived DNA or DNase-sensitive ligands. Instead, IFN-responsive gene expression could be induced by B. burgdorferi-derived RNA. Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent IFN profile gene transcription was also induced by sonicated bacteria, by the lipoprotein OspA, and by factors released into the BSKII medium during culture of B. burgdorferi. The IFN-stimulatory activity of B. burgdorferi culture supernatants was not destroyed by nuclease treatment. Nuclease digestion also had no effect on IFN profile induction mediated by sonicated B. burgdorferi. Thus, B. burgdorferi-derived RNA, OspA, and non-nucleic acid ligands present in both sonicated bacteria and B. burgdorferi culture medium contribute to type I IFN-responsive gene induction. These findings suggest that B. burgdorferi invasion of joint tissue and the resultant type I IFN induction associated with Lyme arthritis development may involve multiple triggering ligands."

The purpose of this study was to refine the statistical interpretation of IgM and IgG by combining the diagnostic evidence provided by the two immunoglobulins and exploiting the whole range of the quantitative variation in test values. ELISA assays based on purified flagella antigen were performed on sera from 815 healthy Danish blood donors as negative controls and 117 consecutive patients with confirmed neuroborreliosis (NB). A logistic regression model combining the standardized units of the IgM and IgG ELISA assays was constructed and the resulting disease risks graphically evaluated by receiver operating characteristic and 'predictiveness' curves. The combined model improves the discrimination between NB patients and blood donors. Hence, it is possible to report a predicted risk of disease graded for each individual patient, as is theoretically preferable. The predictiveness curve, when adapted to the local pretest probability of LB, allows high-risk and low-risk thresholds to be defined instead of cut-offs based on the laboratory characteristics only, and it allows the extent of under- and over-treatment to be assessed. It is shown that an example patient with low ELISA results in IgM and IgG, considered negative by the conventional cut-off, has a relatively high risk of belonging to the truly diseased population and a low risk of being false positive. Using a 20% high-risk threshold for advising the clinician to consider treatment, the sensitivity of the assay is increased from 76% to 85%, while the specificity is maintained at around 95%."

		"abstract": "During cycling between the tick vector and a mammal, the Lyme disease spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi must coordinate expression of outer-surface proteins (Osps) A and B to quickly respond to environmental changes. The pathogen abundantly produces OspA/B in the tick, but represses their expression during mammalian infection. This paper reports a regulatory structure, consisting of two sequences flanking the ospAB promoter, that is required for enhancing ospA expression in B. burgdorferi grown in vitro, but repressing its expression during murine infection. Deletion or replacement of either the upstream or downstream sequence of the ospAB promoter caused a significant decrease in ospA expression in vitro, but a dramatic increase during murine infection. Fusion of either sequence with the flaB reporter promoter led to increased expression of an ospA reporter gene in vitro, but a decrease in the murine host. Furthermore, simultaneous fusion of both sequences with the reporter promoter showed a synergistic effect in enhancing expression of the ospA reporter in vitro, but repressing its expression during murine infection. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the regulatory structure functions oppositely in the two different environments and potentially provides B. burgdorferi with a molecular mechanism to quickly adapt to the distinct environments during its enzootic life cycle."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne microbes necessarily co-occur with their hosts and vectors, but the degree to which they share common evolutionary or biogeographic histories remains unexplored. We examine the congruity of the evolutionary and biogeographic histories of the bacterium and vector of the Lyme disease system, the most prevalent vector-borne disease in North America. In the eastern and midwestern US, Ixodes scapularis ticks are the primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. Our phylogeographic and demographic analyses of the 16S mitochondrial rDNA suggest that northern I. scapularis populations originated from very few migrants from the southeastern US that expanded rapidly in the Northeast and subsequently in the Midwest after the recession of the Pleistocene ice sheets. Despite this historical gene flow, current tick migration is restricted even between proximal sites within regions. In contrast, B. burgdorferi suffers no barriers to gene flow within the northeastern and midwestern regions but shows clear interregional migration barriers. Despite the intimate association of B. burgdorferi and I. scapularis, the population structure, evolutionary history, and historical biogeography of the pathogen are all contrary to its arthropod vector. In the case of Lyme disease, movements of infected vertebrate hosts may play a larger role in the contemporary expansion and homogenization of the pathogen than the movement of tick vectors whose populations continue to bear the historical signature of climate-induced range shifts."

		"abstract": "There is currently a need for improved serological tests for the diagnosis and monitoring of Lyme disease, an infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi. In the present study, we evaluated luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPSs) for use for profiling of the antibody responses to a panel of B. burgdorferi proteins for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Initially, serum samples from a cohort of patients and controls (n = 46) were used for training and were profiled by the use of 15 different B. burgdorferi antigen constructs. For the patient sera, the antibody responses to several B. burgdorferi antigens, including VlsE, flagellin (FlaB), BmpA, DbpA, and DbpB, indicated that the antigens had high levels of immunoreactivity. However, the best diagnostic performance was achieved with a synthetic protein, designated VOVO, consisting of a repeated antigenic peptide sequence, VlsE-OspC-VlsE-OspC, Analysis of an independent set of serum samples (n = 139) used for validation showed that the VOVO LIPS test had 98% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 93% to 100%; P < 0.0001) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 94% to 100%; P < 0.0001). Similarly, the C6 peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) also had 98% sensitivity (95% CI, 93% to 100%; P < 0.0001) and 98% specificity (95% CI, 90% to 100%; P < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the rates of detection of Lyme disease by the LIPS test and the C6 ELISA were not statistically different. However, the VOVO LIPS test displayed a wide dynamic range of antibody detection spanning over 10,000-fold without the need for serum dilution. These results suggest that screening by the LIPS test with VOVO and other B. burgdorferi antigens offers an efficient quantitative approach for evaluation of the antibody responses in patients with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The clinical value of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing Lyme disease remains uncertain, owing to a meta-analysis lacking sufficient power to demonstrate efficacy and a more recent trial showing effectiveness but lacking precision. Our objective was to update our prior meta-analysis on antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of Lyme disease, to obtain a more precise estimate of treatment effect. Clinical trials were identified by searching MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and trial registries, and by an assessment of the bibliographies of retrieved articles and reviews. Trials were selected if their patients were randomly allocated to a treatment or placebo group within 72 h following an Ixodes tick bite and had no clinical evidence of Lyme disease at enrollment. Details of the trial design, patient characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted from each article. Study quality was assessed using the Jadad scale. Four placebo-controlled clinical trials were included for review. Among 1082 randomized subjects, the risk of Lyme disease in the placebo group was 2.2% [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2%-3.9%] compared with 0.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-1.0%) in the antibiotic-treated group. Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduced the odds of developing Lyme disease compared with placebo (pooled odds ratio=0.084; 95% CI, 0.0020-0.57; P=0.0037). The available evidence to date supports the use of antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of Lyme disease in endemic areas following an Ixodes tick bite. Pooled data from four placebo-controlled trials suggests that one case of Lyme disease is prevented for about every 50 patients who are treated with antibiotics."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne zoonotic diseases are often maintained in complex transmission cycles involving multiple vertebrate hosts and their arthropod vectors. In the state of California, U.S.A., the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, is transmitted between vertebrate hosts by the western black-legged tick, Ixodes pacificus. Several mammalian species serve as reservoir hosts of the spirochete, but levels of tick infestation, reservoir competence, and Borrelia-infection prevalence vary widely among such hosts. Here, we model the host (lizards, Peromyscus mice, Californian meadow voles, dusky-footed wood rats, and western gray squirrels), vector, and pathogen community of oak woodlands in northwestern California to determine the relative importance of different tick hosts. Observed infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi in host-seeking I. pacificus nymphs was 1.8-5.3%, and our host-community model estimated an infection prevalence of 1.6-2.2%. The western gray squirrel (Sciurus griseus) was the only source of infected nymphs. Lizards, which are refractory to Borrelia infection, are important in feeding subadult ticks but reduce disease risk (nymphal infection prevalence). Species identity is therefore critical in understanding and determining the local disease ecology."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi colonization of the joints induces an inflammatory response, which in some individuals progresses to chronic arthritis. In this review, we discuss novel pathways that are implicated in disease development by modulating host defenses to B. burgdorferi infection. The use of transgenic mice and gene expression analyses has revealed novel pathways involved in pathogenesis of Lyme disease. It is now clear that B. burgdorferi exploits an array of salivary gland proteins of the tick to evade immune responses in the mammalian host. The spirochete also modulates its surface protein profile upon infection and induces anti-inflammatory cytokines, favoring survival of the pathogen. The host defense involves toll-like receptors (TLRs), such as TLR2 and others, in B. burgdorferi recognition. To further dissect the genetic predisposition to treatment-refractory Lyme arthritis, HLA-DR transgenic mice have been used. The cause and pathogenesis of Lyme arthritis are complex. Elucidating the mechanisms that govern this chronic inflammatory response will provide direct insights into other infectious arthritides and the development of novel therapeutic approaches against B. burgdorferi infection."

Mantoux test, Treponema pallidum hemagglutination test, serum angiotensin converting enzyme, and ELISA for toxoplasmosis and rickettsial infections were negative. ELISA for Lyme disease was positive for IgM antibodies. This was confirmed by Western blot test. Ocular inflammation resolved with a course of doxycyline and oral steroids.

Antibodies against profile of gangliosides composed of GM1, GM2, GM3, GD1a,GD1b,GT1b, GQ1b were evaluated in serum patients with early disseminated (neuroborreliosis) Lyme disease (n = 16), patients with long lasting serologic response against Borrelia burgdorferi (n = 32) and in healthy subjects (n = 16). Immunoblot test for IgG was used. Antibodies were detected in all evaluated groups. In group of neuroborreliosis (lymphocytic meningitis with cranial nerve invoIvement) there was no essential difference with control group. It was stated in group of forestry workers with serological features of infection B. burgdorferi lasting for years. Results of the study do not support the thesis of participation of IgG autoantibodies against gangliosides in pathogenesis early disseminated Lyme borreliosis in form of lymphocytic meningitis with cranial nerves paresis. Antibodies against endogenous glicosfingolipides in Lyme borreliosis probably can lead to affecting nervous system (demielinisation and polineuropathy) but probably require long-term immunization, what is suggested by results of examined group of patients with the multi-annual serological features of infection."

We sought to characterize the outcomes of a large cohort of children with Lyme arthritis treated using the approach recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Medical records of patients with Lyme arthritis seen by rheumatologists at a tertiary care children's hospital from 1997 to 2007 were reviewed. Patients were classified with antibiotic responsive or refractory arthritis based on absence or presence of persisting joint involvement 3 months after antibiotic initiation. Treatment regimens and outcomes in patients with refractory arthritis were analyzed. Of 99 children with Lyme arthritis, 76 had arthritis that responded fully to antibiotics, while 23 developed refractory arthritis. Most patients with refractory arthritis were successfully treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (6 patients), intraarticular steroid injections (4), or disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) (2). Five were lost to followup. Six patients with refractory arthritis were initially treated elsewhere and received additional antibiotic therapy, with no apparent benefit. Three subsequently required DMARD, while 3 had gradual resolution of arthritis without further therapy. Antibiotic responsiveness could not be predicted from our clinical or laboratory data. Lyme arthritis in children has an excellent prognosis. More than 75% of referred cases resolved with antibiotic therapy. Of patients with antibiotic refractory arthritis, none in whom followup data were available developed chronic arthritis, joint deformities, or recurrence of infection, supporting current treatment guidelines."

		"abstract": "Extracellular ATP and adenosine are important regulators of immune responses; however, contribution of purinergic signaling to host defense during persistent microbial infections remains obscure. Lyme borreliosis is a common arthropod-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In this study, we investigated whether lymphoid purinergic signaling contributes to the mechanisms by which borreliae species evade the immune system and trigger joint inflammation. Intracutaneous inoculation of Borrelia garinii to C3H/He mice induced symptomatic infection manifested in elevated levels of borrelia-specific IgG Abs, persistent spirochete dissemination into the tissues and joint swelling, as well as approximately 2- to 2.5-fold enlargement of draining lymph nodes with hyperplasia of B cell follicle area and L-selectin shedding from activated T lymphocytes. Purine catabolism was also activated in lymph nodes but not spleen and blood of infected C3H/He mice within the first 4 postinfection weeks, particularly manifested in transient upregulations of adenosine triphosphatase/ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 on CD4(+)CD8(+) T lymphocytes and adenosine deaminase activity on B220(+) B lymphocytes. Compared with borrelia-susceptible C3H/He strain, lymphocytes from C57BL/6 mice displayed markedly enhanced adenosine-generating capability due to approximately three times higher ratio of ecto-5'-nucleotidase to adenosine deaminase. Borrelia-infected C57BL/6 mice efficiently eradicated the inoculated spirochetes at more chronic stage without any signs of arthritis. Strikingly, deletion of key adenosine-generating enzyme, ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73, was accompanied by significantly enhanced joint swelling in borrelia-infected CD73-deficient C57BL/6 mice. Collectively, these data suggest that insufficient basal adenosine level and/or pathogen-induced disordered lymphoid purine homeostasis may serve as important prerequisite for promotion of inflammatory responses and further host's commitment to persistence of bacterial infection and arthritis development."

		"abstract": "In spite of the global medical and veterinary importance of Ixodid ticks, relatively little is known about their genome organization. To address this, we developed the first fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based chromosome markers in the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis. Shotgun genomic DNA (gDNA) sequences were used to identify three major tandem repeat families which were localized to specific heterochromatic regions of I. scapularis chromosomes prepared from the mitotic cell line ISE18. Together, these repeats were estimated to contribute approximately 159 Mb (8%) of the 2.1 Gb (haploid) I. scapularis genome. The relative arrangement of each tandem repeat family and the nucleolar organizing regions was determined by rehybridization to individual chromosome spreads, which was useful to distinguish different chromosomes in the ISE18 karyotype. Long stretches (>20 kb) of tandem repeat-containing gDNA were resistant to digestion by the methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme HpaII and localized to the presumed peri-centromeric regions of the chromosomes. A telomeric probe based on the arthropod-conserved (TTAGG)(n) tandemly repetitive motif was localized to the termini of each I. scapularis chromosome. Localization of these markers produced the first link between DNA sequences and major structural features of I. scapularis chromosomes and thereby provided the framework for a FISH-based physical map."

The primers were those well known to be specific for signature sequence amplification of the B burgdorferi sensu lato 16S ribosomal RNA gene. The positive 293-base-pair nested PCR amplicon was subjected to routine direct automated Sanger sequencing. A 50-base sequence excised randomly from the sequencing electrophoretogram between the 2 nested PCR primer binding sites was sufficient for the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis to validate the B burgdorferi sensu lato 16S rDNA without a reasonable doubt. Nested PCR increased the sensitivity of DNA detection by 100- to 1,000-fold. DNA sequence validation based on BLAST algorithms using the GenBank database practically eliminates any possibility of false-positive results due to molecular misidentification. This technology may be a valuable supplement to the current serologic tests for Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, has a complex genome consisting of a linear chromosome and up to 21 linear and circular plasmids. These plasmids encode numerous proteins critical to the spirochete's infectious cycle and many hypothetical proteins whose functions and requirements are unknown. The conserved linear plasmid lp54 encodes several proteins important for survival in the mouse-tick infectious cycle, but the majority of the proteins are of unknown function and lack homologs outside the borreliae. In this study we adapted the Cre-lox recombination system to create large deletions in the B. burgdorferi genome. Using Cre-lox, we systematically investigated the contribution of 14 adjacent genes on the left arm of lp54 to the overall infectivity of B. burgdorferi. The deletion of the region of lp54 encompassing bba07 to bba14 had no significant effect on the infectious cycle of B. burgdorferi. The deletion of bba01 to bba07 resulted in a slight growth defect but did not significantly affect the ability of B. burgdorferi to complete the infectious cycle. This study demonstrated the utility of the Cre-lox system to efficiently explore gene requirements in B. burgdorferi and surprisingly revealed that a large number of the highly conserved proteins encoded on lp54 are not required to complete the infectious cycle."

		"abstract": "Community structure is heterogeneous at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and this variation has been shown to influence the risk of zoonotic diseases such as West Nile Virus and Lyme disease. Theoretical models and most empirical evidence suggest that the greatest influence of host diversity occurs when transmission is frequency-dependent (i.e., the rate of contact is constant). These theoretical models are generally based on ordinary differential equations and become intractable when considering more than a few species. This makes it particularly difficult to predict how we might expect the transmission of infectious diseases to change as community structure changes in space or in time. Here we develop a model in which we construct a network of interactions between hosts and vectors to quantify the change in risk under different scenarios of community disassembly. Decreased vector biodiversity always reduced mean risk, while a change in host community structure led to increased or decreased mean risk depending on the manner in which community disassembly altered mean competence of the \"new\" community. These trends in mean risk can be generalized across a multitude of natural systems because they do not depend on the distribution of host quality, though simulation suggests that variation around the mean can be very high. The primary value of model is that it can be used to establish upper and lower bounds on the expected change in disease risk with decreasing biodiversity."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease risk is increasing in the United States due in part to the spread of blacklegged ticks Ixodes scapularis, the principal vector of the spirochetal pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. A 5-year study was undertaken to investigate hypothesized coinvasion of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi in Lower Michigan. We tracked the spatial and temporal dynamics of the tick and spirochete using mammal, bird, and vegetation drag sampling at eight field sites along coastal and inland transects originating in a zone of recent I. scapularis establishment. We document northward invasion of these ticks along Michigan's west coast during the study period; this pattern was most evident in ticks removed from rodents. B. burgdorferi infection prevalences in I. scapularis sampled from vegetation in the invasion zone were 9.3% and 36.6% in nymphs and adults, respectively, with the majority of infection (95.1%) found at the most endemic site. There was no evidence of I. scapularis invasion along the inland transect; however, low-prevalence B. burgdorferi infection was detected in other tick species and in wildlife at inland sites, and at northern coastal sites in years before the arrival of I. scapularis. These infections suggest that cryptic B. burgdorferi transmission by other vector-competent tick species is occurring in the absence of I. scapularis. Other Borrelia spirochetes, including those that group with B. miyamotoi and B. andersonii, were present at a low prevalence within invading ticks and local wildlife. Reports of Lyme disease have increased significantly in the invasion zone in recent years. This rapid blacklegged tick invasion--measurable within 5 years--in combination with cryptic pathogen maintenance suggests a complex ecology of Lyme disease emergence in which wildlife sentinels can provide an early warning of disease emergence."

Immobilized Kupffer cells with highly ramified extended processes into multiple sinusoids could effectively capture blood-borne, disseminating Borrelia burgdorferi, creating a highly efficient surveillance and filtering system. After ingesting B. burgdorferi, Kupffer cells induced chemokine receptor CXCR3-dependent clustering of iNKT cells. Kupffer cells and iNKT cells formed stable contacts via the antigen-presenting molecule CD1d, which led to iNKT cell activation. An absence of iNKT cells caused B. burgdorferi to leave the blood and enter the joints more effectively. B. burgdorferi that escaped Kupffer cells entered the liver parenchyma and survived despite Ito cell responses. Kupffer cell-iNKT cell interactions induced a key intravascular immune response that diminished the dissemination of B. burgdorferi."

The goal of our study was to evaluate the safety of extended intravenous antibiotic therapy in patients referred for treatment of neurologic Lyme disease. We enrolled 200 consecutive patients with significant neurologic symptoms and positive testing for Borrelia burgdorferi. Patients were treated with intravenous antibiotics using various intravascular devices (IVDs). Standard IVD care was administered to all patients, and monitoring for medication reactions and IVD complications was performed on a weekly basis. The mean length of intravenous antibiotic treatment was 118 days (range, 7-750 days) representing 23,654 IVD-days. Seven patients (3.5%) experienced allergic reactions to the antibiotic medication, and two patients (1.0%) had gallbladder toxicity. IVD complications occurred in 15 patients (7.5%) representing an incidence of 0.63 per 1,000 IVD-days. The IVD problems occurred an average of 81 days after initiation of treatment (range, 7-240 days). There were six suspected line infections for an incidence of 0.25 per 1,000 IVD-days. Only one of the IVD infections was confirmed, and no resistant organisms were cultured from any patient. None of the IVD complications were fatal. Prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy is associated with low morbidity and no IVD-related mortality in patients referred for treatment of neurologic Lyme disease. With proper IVD care, the risk of extended antibiotic therapy in these patients appears to be low."

		"abstract": "Some Lyme disease patients report debilitating chronic symptoms of pain, fatigue, and cognitive deficits despite recommended courses of antibiotic treatment. The mechanisms responsible for these symptoms, collectively referred to as post-Lyme disease syndrome (PLS) or chronic Lyme disease, remain unclear. We investigated the presence of immune system abnormalities in PLS by assessing the levels of antibodies to neural proteins in patients and controls. Serum samples from PLS patients, post-Lyme disease healthy individuals, patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and normal healthy individuals were analyzed for anti-neural antibodies by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. Anti-neural antibody reactivity was found to be significantly higher in the PLS group than in the post-Lyme healthy (p<0.01) and normal healthy (p<0.01) groups. The observed heightened antibody reactivity in PLS patients could not be attributed solely to the presence of cross-reactive anti-borrelia antibodies, as the borrelial seronegative patients also exhibited elevated anti-neural antibody levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of PLS serum antibody activity demonstrated binding to cells in the central and peripheral nervous systems. The results provide evidence for the existence of a differential immune system response in PLS, offering new clues about the etiopathogenesis of the disease that may prove useful in devising more effective treatment strategies."

The 11 dogs in the first group were vaccinated with a commercial borrelia vaccine and subsequently developed detectable antibody titers. The 12 dogs in the second group were walked on two consecutive days in an area where ticks were endemic. On day 5 after exposure, engorged ticks were removed from the 12 dogs and were analyzed for Borrelia DNA by a real-time PCR assay. Blood samples were taken before exposure/vaccination and at defined time points thereafter. Antibody responses were evaluated using an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and Western blotting. Seven dogs from which Borrelia-positive ticks were removed seroconverted and developed individual immune responses. Blood and urine samples taken from the tick-exposed group at weeks 1 and 3 for real-time PCR analysis and culture were always negative for bacterial DNA. In conclusion, despite serological evidence of infection/immunization, no clinical signs of disease were observed. The antibody patterns in a single Western blot did not permit differentiation between the different antigen sources (vaccine versus natural infection). However, repeated Western blot analyses may be useful for the confirmation of infection or vaccination status, since the time courses of the levels of specific antibodies seem to be different."

		"abstract": "Growing interest in ecology has recently focused on the hypothesis that community diversity can mediate infection levels and disease ('dilution effect'). In turn, biodiversity loss--a widespread consequence of environmental change--can indirectly promote increases in disease, including those of medical and veterinary importance. While this work has focused primarily on correlational studies involving vector-borne microparasite diseases (e.g. Lyme disease, West Nile virus), we argue that parasites with complex life cycles (e.g. helminths, protists, myxosporeans and many fungi) offer an excellent additional model in which to experimentally address mechanistic questions underlying the dilution effect. Here, we unite recent ecological research on the dilution effect in microparasites with decades of parasitological research on the decoy effect in macroparasites to explore key questions surrounding the relationship between community structure and disease. We find consistent evidence that community diversity significantly alters parasite transmission and pathology under laboratory as well as natural conditions. Empirical examples and simple transmission models highlight the diversity of mechanisms through which such changes occur, typically involving predators, parasite decoys, low competency hosts or other parasites. However, the degree of transmission reduction varies among diluting species, parasite stage, and across spatial scales, challenging efforts to make quantitative, taxon-specific predictions about disease. Taken together, this synthesis highlights the broad link between community structure and disease while underscoring the importance of mitigating ongoing changes in biological communities owing to species introductions and extirpations."

		"abstract": "The genus Borrelia is the cause of the two human diseases: Lyme disease (LD) and relapsing fever (RF). Both LD and RF Borrelia species are obligate parasites and are dependent on nutrients provided by their hosts. The first step of nutrient uptake across the outer membrane of these Gram-negative bacteria is accomplished by water-filled channels, so-called porins. The knowledge of the porin composition in the outer membranes of the different pathogenic Borrelia species is limited. Only one porin has been described in relapsing fever spirochetes to date, whereas four porins are known to be present in Lyme disease agents. From these, the Borrelia burgdorferi outer membrane channel P66 is known to act as an adhesin and was well studied as a porin. To investigate if P66 porins are expressed and similarly capable of pore formation in other Borrelia causing Lyme disease or relapsing fever three LD species (B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, B. garinii) and three RF species (B. duttonii, B. recurrentis and B. hermsii) were investigated for outer membrane proteins homologous to P66. A search in current published RF genomes, comprising the ones of B. duttonii, B. recurrentis and B. hermsii, indicated that they all contained P66 homologues. The P66 homologues of the six Borrelia species were purified to homogeneity and their pore-forming abilities as well as the biophysical properties of the pores were analyzed using the black lipid bilayer assay."

These new probes allowed us investigate the diversity of Borrelia in 915 I. ricinus collected on the south-facing slope of Chaumont (Switzerland). Among the 159 infected ticks, 7 Borrelia species were identified, and B. spielmanii and relapsing fever-like (RFL) spirochaetes were identified in this area for the first time. B. valaisiana and B. spielmanii were significantly less present in male than in female or nymphal ticks. Mixed infection with RFL spirochaetes and Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes were detected in 4 ticks. In addition, the set of probes could identify the recently described species, B. bavariensis."

In most motile bacteria, only one fliG homologue is present in the genome. However, several spirochete species have two putative fliG genes (referred to as fliG1 and fliG2) and their roles in flagella assembly and motility remain unknown. In this report, the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi was used as a genetic model to investigate the roles of these two fliG homologues. It was found that fliG2 encodes a typical motor switch complex protein that is required for the flagellation and motility of B. burgdorferi. In contrast, the function of fliG1 is quite unique. Disruption of fliG1 did not affect flagellation and the mutant was still motile but failed to translate in highly viscous media. GFP-fusion and motion tracking analyses revealed that FliG1 asymmetrically locates at one end of cells and the loss of fliG1 somehow impacted one bundle of flagella rotation. In addition, animal studies demonstrated that the fliG1- mutant was quickly cleared after inoculation into the murine host, which highlights the importance of the ability to swim in highly viscous media in the infectivity of B. burgdorferi and probably other pathogenic spirochetes."

We employed a landscape epidemiology approach using geographic information systems mapping and ecological niche modeling (Genetic Algorithm for Rule-set Prediction) to identify geographical areas of disease transmission risk. Forecasted optimal ecological niche areas for B. burgdorferi are focused along the coast of Vancouver Island, the southwestern coast of the BC mainland, and in valley systems of interior BC roughly along and below the N51 degree line of latitude. These findings have been used to increase public and physician awareness of Lyme disease risk, and prioritize future field sampling for ticks in BC."

A selective assessment of the microbial transcriptome, limited to gene-encoding putative membrane proteins, reveals that bba52 transcription in vivo is strictly confined to the vector-specific portion of the microbial life cycle, with the highest levels of expression noted in feeding ticks and with swift down-regulation noted in mice. bba52 deletion did not affect murine disease as assessed by the genesis of arthritis and carditis or long-term persistence of pathogens in mice or ticks. However, bba52 deficiency did impair microbial transitions between hosts and vector, defects that could be fully rescued when bba52 expression was genetically restored to the original genomic locus. These studies establish that BBA52 facilitates vector-host transitions by the pathogen and therefore is a potential antigenic target for interference with transmission of B. burgdorferi from ticks to mammalian hosts."

Additionally, we wanted to compare the findings of two methods for the detection of intrathecally synthesized borrelial antibodies: the IDEIA Lyme neuroborreliosis test using flagellar antigen and an approach based on the Liaison indirect chemiluminescence immunoassay using the OspC and VlsE antigens. Borrelial IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by at least one of these methods in the sera of 22/34 (64.7%) and 28/34 (82.4%) patients with clinically evident Lyme neuroborreliosis, respectively, and in the cerebrospinal fluid of 22/34 (64.7%) and 20/34 (58.8%) of these patients, respectively. Intrathecal synthesis of borrelial IgM and/or IgG was found in 19/34 (55.9%) patients: IgM in 17/34 (50%) patients and IgG in 15/34 (44.1%) patients. The relatively low proportion of intrathecal synthesis of borrelial antibodies and the high ratio of IgM positivity could be explained by the short duration of neurological disease as evidenced by reported symptoms (median, 10 days). Assessment of the humoral immune response in the sera and CSF of patients with early Lyme neuroborreliosis confirmed previous findings on the relationship between the duration of illness and the proportion of patients with detectable responses."

		"abstract": "Child and adolescent catatonia has been poorly investigated. Moreover, diagnosis criteria only exist for adult psychiatry, and there are no therapeutic guidelines. The aim of this paper is to describe the case of a 14-year-old girl presenting an overlap between psychogenic and neuroleptic induced catatonia, acute treatment and ten year's follow-up. A 14-year-old Caucasian French girl, Elsa, was admitted in February 1998 to a University adolescent mental health center with an acute psychotic disorder. She showed agitation, impulsivity (sudden engagement in inappropriate behaviour), paranoid delusions, visual and auditory hallucinations, diurnal and nocturnal urinary incontinence, lack of self-care, inadequate food intake because of fear of poisoning, and vomiting after meals leading to rapid weight loss of 5 kg. Clinical examination, laboratory tests, EEG and RMI were normal. Toxicological tests were negative. Her IQ, assessed six months before admission, was in the dull average range (70-75). Elsa was treated with loxapine 150 mg per day for one week without improvement and this was then replaced by haloperidol 30 mg per day. One week after the start of haloperidol her agitation, impulsivity, and hallucinatory symptoms decreased. Twenty four days after loxapine introduction and 17 days after the haloperidol, her condition deteriorated rapidly over less than 48 hours. She exhibited immobility, minimal response to stimuli, staring and catalepsy with waxy flexibility. The diagnosis of catatonia was established. Examination revealed tremulous extremities, tachychardia (110 pm) and apyrexia. Creatine phosphokinase levels were 106 UI/l (normal range 0-250). Human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis, listeria and Lyme serology were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Haloperidol was stopped and intravenous clonazepam 5mg/kg was begun. It was not possible to obtain signed consent from the two parents for Electroconvulsive therapy. The patient was transferred to a pediatric intensive care unit. The treatment was standard parenteral nutrition, nursing, intravenous clonazepam 0.05 mg/kg, with regular attendance by a child psychiatrist. Elsa stayed three weeks in this condition. She then began to notice the child psychiatrist, and a few days later she was able to carry out simple requests. Elsa was transferred to an adolescent psychiatric unit. As soon as she could eat by herself again, carbamazepine 400mg per day was begun. Her agitation reduced at a carbamazepine level of 7 mg/l. One month later her condition was stable. However, language difficulties persisted for a further six months. One year after the episode she scored 66 on a repeat IQ test and her RMI was normal. She exhibited no significant residual symptoms except some cognitive impairment. She integrated into a special education facility. These attempts to stop the carbamazepine were followed by depressed mood, aggressiveness and impulsivity; carbamazepine was finally stopped successfully after seven years. Ten years later, Elsa is the mother of two young children and is able to take care of them. She has never had a relapse of her psychotic disorder or catatonic state. The etiopathogenic diagnosis is problematic. Some indices in the familial history may suggest a traumatic event. But one to the total residual amnesia it was never confirmed, and traumatic catatonia are extremely rare. Normal CPK levels, with autonomic disturbance limited to tachycardia and the lack of resolution after discontinuance of medication, argues against a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). But CPK levels are non specific, and NMS without pyrexia has been described. The occurrence of the catatonic syndrome 21 days after the first dose of a neuroleptic could be diagnostic. This case involved a non organic catatonic psychosis followed by neuroleptic induced catatonia. Catatonia is described as a risk factor for the development of NMS and some consider NMS to be a variant of malignant catatonia. The interest of this report is (1) it reinforces the need to be cautious before prescribing neuroleptics in adolescents presenting with symptoms of catatonia; (2) the complete recovery from catatonia after treatment with intensive care and more than three weeks of intravenous clonazepam without the use of ECT and (3) the effectiveness of carbamazepine over a long period of follow-up. Although trials on carbamazepine in catatonia are published, there are no data available for the control of residual symptoms or the long term prognosis, especially in child and adolescent psychiatry."

		"abstract": "In a previous immunoproteome analysis of Borrelia hermsii, candidate antigens that bound IgM antibodies from mice and patients infected with relapsing fever spirochetes were identified. One candidate that was identified is a hypothetical protein with a molecular mass of 57 kDa that we have designated Borrelia immunogenic protein A (BipA). This protein was further investigated as a potential diagnostic antigen for B. hermsii given that it is absent from the Borrelia burgdorferi genome. The bipA locus was amplified and sequenced from 39 isolates of B. hermsii that had been acquired from western North America. bipA was also expressed as a recombinant fusion protein. Serum samples from mice and patients infected with B. hermsii or B. burgdorferi were used to confirm the immunogenicity of the recombinant protein in patients infected with relapsing fever spirochetes. Lastly, in silico and experimental analysis indicated that BipA is a surface-exposed lipoprotein in B. hermsii. These findings enhance the capabilities of diagnosing infection with relapsing fever spirochetes."

		"abstract": "Borrelia is the causative agent of Lyme disease, a widespread disease with important health consequences. Immune-mediated mechanisms are believed to play a major role in both host defense and in late complications of Lyme disease. Recognition of Borrelia and the initial activation of the innate immune system are important for host defense, as well as modulation of adaptive responses. Several classes of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) have been suggested to be involved in the recognition of Borrelia: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). TLR2 has been found to be the most important receptor of the TLRs. The intracellular receptor NOD2, a member of the NLRs, might also play an important role in recognition. Mannose receptor is also involved in Borrelia recognition, but little is known about other CLRs such as dectin-1. After PRRs have recognized Borrelia, a signaling cascade is induced that leads to transcription of NF-kappaB, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Understanding these pathways provides not only a better insight into the pathogenesis, but also provides potential, novel, therapeutic targets during active disease or post-infection complications."

		"abstract": "B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl) is the etiological agent of Lyme borreliosis in humans. Spirochetes have adapted themselves to the human immune system in many distinct ways. One important immune escape mechanism for evading complement activation is the binding of complement regulators Factor H (CFH) or Factor H-like protein1 (FHL-1) to Complement Regulator-Acquiring Surface Proteins (CRASPs). We demonstrate that B. garinii OspA serotype 4 (ST4) PBi resist complement-mediated killing by binding of FHL-1. To identify the primary ligands of FHL-1 four CspA orthologs from B. garinii ST4 PBi were cloned and tested for binding to human CFH and FHL-1. Orthologs BGA66 and BGA71 were found to be able to bind both complement regulators but with different intensities. In addition, all CspA orthologs were tested for binding to mammalian and avian CFH. Distinct orthologs were able to bind to CFH of different animal origins. B. garinii ST4 PBi is able to evade complement killing and it can bind FHL-1 to membrane expressed proteins. Recombinant proteins BGA66 can bind FHL-1 and human CFH, while BGA71 can bind only FHL-1. All recombinant CspA orthologs from B. garinii ST4 PBi can bind CFH from different animal origins. This partly explains the wide variety of animals that can be infected by B. garinii."

The medical files of 405 women with endometriosis and 200 without endometriosis were studied retrospectively. We report 3 cases with endometriosis and Lyme disease. Of 405 patients with endometriosis treated in our study over a 6-year period, 3(0.8%) had Lyme disease. All cases presented with typical erythema migraines, fever and fatigue. The serological findings were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi, for 3 cases. Two out of 3 women underwent IVF-ET procedures and one of them conceived in the first cycle without complication during pregnancy or after childbirth recorded. We concluded that women with endometriosis are more likely to have chronic fatigue syndrome, systemic lupus erythematous, Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune inflammatory and endocrine diseases. A review of the literature confirms the uniqueness of the co-existence of Lyme disease in women with endometriosis in these cases."

The etiologic agents of LD are spirochetes of the group Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, which possess a lipid content of 25-30% of the dry weight. The major glycolipid cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal), present in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii, is a specific and highly prevalent antigen frequently recognized by antibodies in late-stage LD. Here we report a convenient route for the chemical synthesis of ACGal by employing a combination of chemical synthesis steps with enzymatic transformations. This synthesized molecule was compared with bacterial extracts by immunoblots with patient sera, confirming the preserved antigenicity. Next, a glycolipid library derived from the native molecules with variations in the fatty acyl moiety and derivatives in which the cholesterol has been replaced was designed and synthesized. The chemical structures were confirmed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. The native and synthetic glycolipids were utilized in immunoblots to determine the epitope recognized by antibodies in patient sera. By this method we could demonstrate that galactose, cholesterol, and a fatty acid with a minimal chain length of four carbon atoms comprises the essential structure for recognition by antibodies. Finally, this finding allowed the synthesis of a functionalized ACGal with an omega-mercapto group at the fatty acid and a facile protection and deprotection strategy. This antigenic hapten can be conjugated to a carrier protein to effect immunization against Lyme disease."

A European, prospective clinical trial in which doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil were compared in the treatment of adult patients with erythema migrans included a control group to address this question. Evaluations of patients were conducted at baseline, 14 days, and 2, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Control subjects were evaluated at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Subjective symptoms that newly developed or intensified since the onset of erythema migrans or the date of enrollment for controls were referred to as \"new or increased symptoms.\" Doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil had comparable efficacy. At both 6 and 12 months, the frequency of new or increased symptoms in patients with erythema migrans did not exceed the frequency of such symptoms in a control group of individuals of similar gender and age without a clinical history of Lyme disease. At 12 months after enrollment, only 5 (2.2%) of 230 evaluable patients reported new or increased symptoms, and in none of the patients were these symptoms of sufficient severity to be functionally disabling. No significant differences were identified between doxycycline and cefuroxime axetil in the treatment of European patients with erythema migrans. The frequency of nonspecific symptoms in patients did not exceed that of a control group at > or =6 months after enrollment. We advocate inclusion of appropriate non-Lyme disease control groups in future studies in which nonspecific subjective symptoms are assessed after antibiotic therapy."

		"abstract": "The bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is a limited-genome organism that must obtain many of its biochemical building blocks, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), from its tick or vertebrate host. GlcNAc can be imported into the cell as a monomer or dimer (chitobiose), and the annotation for several B. burgdorferi genes suggests that this organism may be able to degrade and utilize chitin, a polymer of GlcNAc. We investigated the ability of B. burgdorferi to utilize chitin in the absence of free GlcNAc, and we attempted to identify genes involved in the process. We also examined the role of RpoS, one of two alternative sigma factors present in B. burgdorferi, in the regulation of chitin utilization. Using fluorescent chitinase substrates, we demonstrated an inherent chitinase activity in rabbit serum, a component of the B. burgdorferi growth medium (BSK-II). After inactivating this activity by boiling, we showed that wild-type cells can utilize chitotriose, chitohexose or coarse chitin flakes in the presence of boiled serum and in the absence of free GlcNAc. Further, we replaced the serum component of BSK-II with a lipid extract and still observed growth on chitin substrates without free GlcNAc. In an attempt to knockout B. burgdorferi chitinase activity, we generated mutations in two genes (bb0002 and bb0620) predicted to encode enzymes that could potentially cleave the beta-(1,4)-glycosidic linkages found in chitin. While these mutations had no effect on the ability to utilize chitin, a mutation in the gene encoding the chitobiose transporter (bbb04, chbC) did block utilization of chitin substrates by B. burgdorferi. Finally, we provide evidence that chitin utilization in an rpoS mutant is delayed compared to wild-type cells, indicating that RpoS may be involved in the regulation of chitin degradation by this organism. The data collected in this study demonstrate that B. burgdorferi can utilize chitin as a source of GlcNAc in the absence of free GlcNAc, and suggest that chitin is cleaved into dimers before being imported across the cytoplasmic membrane via the chitobiose transporter. In addition, our data suggest that the enzyme(s) involved in chitin degradation are at least partially regulated by the alternative sigma factor RpoS."

Rodents were either collected dead as road-kills or live-trapped in four state parks from 13 counties. Thirty-seven western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus), nine nonnative eastern gray squirrels (S. carolinensis) and an eastern fox squirrel (S. niger), four Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii), and two northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology for evidence of coinfection. Of the 14 individual S. griseus that were PCR-positive for B. burgdorferi, two (14%) also were PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum and 11 (79%) had serologic evidence of A. phagocytophilum exposure. Two of the four Douglas squirrels were PCR positive for B. burgdorferi and seropositive to A. phagocytophilum. Evidence of coinfection with these zoonotic pathogens in western gray squirrels suggests that both bacteria may be maintained in a similar transmission cycle involving this sciurid and the western black-legged tick Ixodes pacificus, the primary bridging vector to humans in the far-western US."

Although mouse and human iNKT cells respond to different antigens based on subtle differences in their fatty acids, the mechanism by which fatty acid structure determines antigenic potency is not well understood. Here we show that the mouse and human CD1d present glycolipids having different fatty acids, based in part upon a difference at a single amino acid position that is involved in positioning the sugar epitope. CD1d also can bind nonantigenic lipids, however, but unexpectedly, mouse CD1d orients the two aliphatic chains of a nonantigenic lipid rotated 180 degrees, causing a dramatic repositioning of the exposed sugar. Therefore, our data reveal the biochemical basis for the high degree of antigenic specificity of iNKT cells for certain fatty acids, and they suggest how microbes could alter fatty acid biosynthesis as an immune evasion mechanism."

Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of the Lyme disease agent in the eastern and central U.S. RNAi is a mechanism by which gene-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers degradation of homologous mRNA transcripts. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for effectively suppressing gene expression in the egg and nymphal stages of I. scapularis by electroporation. The genes encoding the putative Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), cytoplasmic Cystatin, Syntaxin-5, beta-Actin and Calreticulin were targeted by delivering the dsRNA encoding the specific gene coding regions in the unfed nymphs. Silencing was measured using real time qRT-PCR. Electroporation as a mode of dsRNA delivery appears to be substantially efficient and less traumatic to the tick than dsRNA microinjection in the unfed nymphs. Using Cy3-labeled dsRNA to monitor the movement, electroporated dsRNA entered the nymphs and spread to salivary glands and other tissues. The significant disruption of beta-actin and cytoplasmic Cystatin transcripts in tick eggs demonstrate the applicability of this technique. The PLA2, cytoplasmic Cystatin, Syntaxin-5, beta-Actin and Calreticulin genes were also significantly silenced, suggesting that this method has the potential to introduce dsRNA in eggs and unfed nymphs. Our study demonstrates that electroporation can be used as a simple dsRNA delivery tool in assessing the functional role of tick genes in the vector-host interactions. This technique represents a novel approach for specific gene suppression in immature stages of ticks."

Ticks are important vectors of disease worldwide, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Lyme disease, and Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever. This paper will review the major ticks of medical importance and the diseases they transmit, including important emerging pathogens. Rocky Mountain spotted fever continues to be the most lethal tick-borne illness in the United States and is emerging as an important disease in South America. Other important emerging diseases include human anaplasmosis, southern tick associated rash illness, human monocytic ehrlichiosis, and a variety of rickettsial fevers including those caused by Rickettsia parkeri and Rickettsia amblyommii. Most tick-borne illnesses respond readily to doxycycline therapy. In the case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, therapy should be started when the disease is suspected and should never be delayed for confirmatory tests. Accurate identification of tick vectors can help establish a diagnosis and can help guide preventive measures to reduce the burden of disease."

We report the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with early localized and early disseminated Lyme disease based on the duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed. A retrospective cohort study and follow-up survey of patients diagnosed as having early localized and early disseminated Lyme disease from 1 January 2000 through 31 December 2004 was conducted in a Lyme disease-hyperendemic area. Six hundred seven patients met the study inclusion criteria. Most patients (93%) were treated with doxycycline for treatment durations of 10 days, 11-15 days, or 16 days in 17%, 33%, and 47% of doxycycline-treated patients, respectively. Treatment failure criteria, defined before performing the study, were met in only 6 patients (1%). Although these 6 patients met a priori treatment failure criteria, 4 of these patients' clinical details suggested reinfection, 1 was treated with an inappropriate antibiotic, and 1 developed facial palsy early in therapy. Reinfection developed in 4% of patients. The 2-year treatment failure-free survival rates of patients treated with antibiotics for 10 days, 11-15 days, or 16 days were 99.0%, 98.9%, and 99.2%, respectively. Patients treated with antibiotics for 16 days had lower 36-item Short-Form Health Survey social functioning scores on the follow-up survey. No other differences were found in follow-up clinical status or 36-item Short-Form Health Survey scores by duration of antibiotic treatment. Patients treated for 10 days with antibiotic therapy for early Lyme disease have long-term outcomes similar to those of patients treated with longer courses. Treatment failure after appropriately targeted short-course therapy, if it occurs, is exceedingly rare."

		"abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents the third most common cause of heart failure and the most frequent cause of heart transplantation. Infectious, mostly viral, and autoimmune mechanisms, together with genetic abnormalities, have been reported as three major causes of DCM. We hypothesized that Lyme disease (LD), caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), might be an important cause of new-onset unexplained DCM in patients living in a highly endemic area for LD such as the Czech Republic. We performed endomyocardial biopsy (EMB) in 39 consecutive patients presenting with symptomatic unexplained left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction lasting no more than 12 months. In eight subjects (21%), Bb was detected in the EMB sample by polymerase chain reaction or by electron microscopy. None of these patients exhibited any form of atrioventricular block or other extracardiac manifestation of Bb infection. Serological testing identified IgG antibodies against Bb in only two cases and IgM antibodies in none. All affected patients were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 weeks. At 6 months follow-up, LV morphology and function as well as functional status of these patients significantly improved. In conclusion, Bb infection may represent an important cause of new-onset unexplained DCM in patients living in endemic regions such as the Czech Republic. Because the antibiotic treatment appears to be markedly effective and serological examination does not provide a tool for diagnosing the disease, EMB focused on the detection of Bb should be performed in all patients from endemic areas with new-onset unexplained DCM not responding to conventional therapy."

A 32-year-old male Hispanic from Chile presented with brief episodes of loss of consciousness and awareness of irregular heart beat, and denied any history of tick bite. The patient was found to have a heart rate of 40 beats per minute and fluctuating variable atrioventricular blocks. A transvenous pacemaker was placed with good capture. The diagnosis was made with serological testing and gallium scanning. Treatment with antibiotics and continuous cardiac monitoring resulted in remarkable symptomatic improvement of the patient. Absence of history or evidence of tick bite must not rule out the possibility of Lyme carditis in a patient with a transient heart block. Prompt recognition of this reversible cause of heart block is essential for avoiding implantation of an unnecessary, permanent pacemaker."

Transmission of B. burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis virus in an infected organism differs, because of different location in tick, the differences in dissemination of the virus and bacteria (own motility) as well as mechanisms supporting bacterial infection. The mechanisms governing the transmission of these pathogens in nature have epidemiological importance and are essential in understanding the pathogenesis of diseases. The increase in the incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in recent years, is a marker of tick borne diseases. In the 90s, the number of cases among humans in many European countries remains at a higher level compared to the eighties. Similar observations consider to Lyme borreliosis. Natural environmental changes, mainly related to climate, as well as regional and local changes in distribution of the small rodents species, wild animals, anthropogenic factors (reforestation, drainage of swamps, increasing the reservoir of animals), and social change (increased human activities in forests, vaccinations) may have a significant impact on rates of tick-borne diseases."

Until now there still is no satisfactionary explanation for the neurobiological basis of conversion. The explanations offered by psychology are also rather general, based on the tradition of psychoanalysis. Aside from how deeply one understands its mechanisms, when suspecting a psychogenic origin of the symptoms observed, one should be especially careful. It is far too easy falling in the trap, that hysteria sets for us, suggesting to be the patient's one and only disease that should be dealt with. To show the difficulties and dangers when making a diagnosis of functional disorders, both from the physician's and psychologist's point of view. Presenting cases of 6 patients, whose behaviour and symptom presentation suggested a psychogenic background of the disorders, and only few of the psychological tests' results differentiated between the organic and the psychogenic group. In the presented group there were 3 children diagnosed with conversion disorder, and 3 diagnosed with neurological diseases. The psychological test results only partly differentiated between both groups, not allowing any interpretation to be based on quantitative results only. 1. Even though medicine has made such a huge step forward, conversion disorders can still cause serious diagnostic difficulties. 2. Leaving our knowledge about human mind aside, we are continously eager to base our judgement on the most vivid elements, that present to us most clearly. 3. That line of thinking puts us in jeopardy of missing the obvious: that a histerical person can also suffer from another condition of a very organic origin."

		"abstract": "Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease. Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers. The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or \"fuzz balls\" in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out. This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease."

The signs of nervous system lesion are recorded in both acute (subacute) and chronic course of the disease. The comparatively low notification rate of TBB in the Ulyanovsk Region, particularly involving the nervous system, in the absence of the gold marker of this disease--erythema migrans (it was absent in both cases) did not allow clinicians to make a correct diagnosis at the early stages of patient examination. The currently available methods, in this case, Western blot, are of great importance in diagnosing the disease. By taking into account delayed antibody generation within the first weeks of the disease, it is necessary to continue examination by the methods available in the practical health arsenal (ELISA) and in the later periods, with the epidemiological history and clinical picture of encephalitis being borne in mind."

Line blot analyses using recombinant RevA from two diverse Lyme disease spirochetes of RevA and serum samples from culture-confirmed human Lyme disease patients from the United States (n = 46, mainly with early Lyme disease) and Germany (>500, with early and late manifestations of Lyme disease) were performed. The results indicated that a sizable proportion of patients produced antibodies that recognized recombinant RevA. Overall, RevA-based serological studies were less sensitive and less specific than other assay types, such as the VlsE-based C6 peptide assay. However, sera from patients in the initial stages of Lyme disease contained antibodies against RevA, demonstrating that this protein is expressed early in human infection. Thus, RevA may be a useful target for preventative or curative therapies."

		"abstract": "The Borrelia burgdorferi Rrp1 protein is a diguanylate cyclase that controls a regulon consisting of approximately 10% of the total genome. Because Rrp1 lacks a DNA-binding domain, its regulatory capability is most likely mediated through the production of bis-(3'-5')-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP). C-di-GMP binds to and activates the regulatory activity of proteins that harbor a PilZ domain. The occurrence of a PilZ domain within a protein is not in and of itself sufficient to convey c-di-GMP binding, as other structural aspects of the protein are important in the interaction. In this study, we have assessed the expression and c-di-GMP binding ability of the sole PilZ domain-containing protein of B. burgdorferi B31, PlzA. PlzA was determined to be upregulated by tick feeding and to be expressed during mammalian infection. The gene is highly conserved and present in all Borrelia species. Analyses of recombinant PlzA demonstrated its ability to bind c-di-GMP and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this interaction is highly specific and dependent on Arg residues contained within the PilZ domain. In summary, this study is the first to identify a c-di-GMP effector molecule in a spirochete and provides additional evidence for the existence of a complete c-di-GMP regulatory network in the Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi."

To survive in the human host borreliae need to evade the immune system. It is already well known that B. burgdorferi ss. and B. afzelii bind the complement (C) alternative pathway inhibitor factor H from serum using OspE and CRASP-1/Bba68 proteins to escape C attack. In the presence of natural antibodies and in chronic infections, when specific antibodies develop, borreliae have to protect themselves from antibody-induced classical pathway C attack. In this study we demonstrate binding of the classical pathway inhibitor, C4b-binding protein (C4bp), to three genospecies of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Binding was strongest to B. garinii, which has been found to be the weakest factor H binder. The bacteria bound both purified (125)I-labeled C4bp and C4bp from serum. Unlabeled C4bp competed for binding with (125)I-C4bp, whereas BSA had no effect. Binding was salt-sensitive and inhibited by C4b and partially by heparin. C4bp maintained its cofactor activity for factor I in cleaving C4b when bound to the bacterial surface. Ligand blotting analysis of whole cell lysates and fractionated outer cell membranes of the bacteria suggested one major receptor of approximately 43 kDa (P43) for C4bp in B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Binding of C4bp may thus allow Lyme disease borreliae to escape activation of the classical C pathway and allow chronic infections in humans even in the presence of specific antibodies."

		"abstract": "The dynamics of Borrelia burgdorferi infections within its natural hosts are poorly understood. We necropsied four wild-caught western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) that were acquired during a previous study that evaluated the reservoir competence of this rodent for the Lyme disease spirochete. One animal was infected experimentally, whereas the others were infected in the wild before capture. To investigate dissemination of B. burgdorferi and concurrent histopathologic lesions in different tissues, blood specimens, synovial and cerebrospinal fluid, ear-punch biopsies, and diverse tissue samples from skin and various organs were taken and examined by culture, polymerase chain reaction, and histology. Borrelia-positive cultures were obtained from three of the squirrels, that is, from skin biopsies (7 of 20 samples), ear-punch biopsies (2 of 8), and one (1 of 5) lymph node. Sequencing of amplicons confirmed B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) infection in 9 of 10 culture-positive samples and in DNA extracted from all 10 positive cultures. The experimentally infected squirrel yielded most of the positive samples. In contrast, bodily fluids, all other organ specimens from these animals, and all samples from one naturally infected squirrel were negative for Borrelia for both assays. None of the necropsied squirrels exhibited specific clinical signs associated with B. burgdorferi. Similarly, necropsy and histological examination of tissues indicated the presence of underlying infectious processes, none of which could be ascribed conclusively to B. burgdorferi infection. Based on these results, obtained from a small number of animals investigated at a single time point, we suggest that B. burgdorferi s.s. infection in S. griseus may result in rather localized dissemination of spirochetes, and that mild or nonclinical disease might be more common after several months of infection duration. Since spirochetes could be detected in squirrels 7-21 months postinfection, we conclude that S. griseus can infect Ixodes pacificus ticks with B. burgdorferi s.s. trans-seasonally."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is vector-borne zoonosis. The causative agent of Lyme borreliosis is a spirochete of Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) sensu lato complex, which is transmitted by ticks of the Ixodes ricinus complex. The aim of our paper is to estimate the prevalence of I. ricinus ticks, the level of their infectivity by Bb, and the prevalence of certain genospecies of Bb sensu lato in ixodide ticks inhabiting Belgrade. An estimate of the tick population density was expressed by the value of flag/hour. For isolation and cultivation of Borrelia, selective Barbour-Stonner-Kelly II media was used. Typization of Borrelia was made by applying the species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In statistical analysis, Chi(2) test was used. Values of flag/hour have varied in relation to year observed and type of habitat: The lowest values were recorded in the city parks (17.9). The values were higher in parks-woods (19.7 and 33.4, respectively). The highest values were detected in localities similar to wooded areas (48.0). The estimated average infestation of ticks with Bb was 21.9%, excluding statistically significant differences by years of investigation. We found the dominance of Borrelia afzelii (75%). Bb sensu stricto (22.2%) as well as Borrelia garinii (2.8%) was much less present. Statistically significant difference was established in the prevalence of the above-mentioned genospecies in relation to the examined localities. We have established the prevalence of all three genospecies in the city of Belgrade. Bb sensu lato was found, with the dominance of B. afzelii."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, carried by Ixodes ticks, is one of the most significant human pathogens, causing Lyme disease. As there is no standardized PCR method for detection and identification of spirochaete DNA, we carried out a comparative analysis using a set of complementary primers for three regions in the genomic DNA of these bacteria (genes fla and rrs and the non-coding rrs-rrlA region). DNA extracted from 579 Ixodes ricinus ticks was subjected to nested PCR. DNA of the examined spirochaetes was detected in 43 (7.4 %) lysates when the fla gene was used as a molecular marker, in 7 (1.2 %) lysates when using primers complementary to the rrs gene, and in 12 (2.1 %) lysates using primers complementary to the non-coding rrs-rrlA sequence. RFLP analysis based on the fla gene helped identify species from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex (B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii, Borrelia valaisiana), detect co-infections, and also identify Borrelia miyamotoi. Therefore, the fla gene is the most sensitive and specific molecular marker for the detection and identification of Borrelia spirochaetes in I. ricinus."

We hypothesized that low levels of C3 are associated with the coincident occurrence of B. burgdorferi infection and glomerulonephritis in Bernese Mountain dogs. The aims of this study were to evaluate the serum concentration of C3 in Bernese Mountain dogs with and without antibodies against B. burgdorferi and to compare this concentration with that of healthy control dogs. Eighty-three clinically healthy Bernese Mountain dogs and 46 control dogs were included. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were determined using an ELISA with a whole cell sonicate as antigen. Results were confirmed using Western blot. C3 was measured using a single radial immunodiffusion test. Results were reported as the percentage concentration of C3 compared with that in pooled preserved canine serum (100% C3 concentration). Median C3 concentration was 128.5% in Bernese Mountain dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi, 133.5% in B. burgdorferi-negative Bernese Mountain dogs, 87.8% in positive control dogs, and 102.2% in negative control dogs. Within Bernese Mountain and control groups, C3 was lower in dogs with antibodies against B. burgdorferi compared with those without. Percentage concentration of C3 was higher in healthy Bernese Mountain dogs compared with control dogs. Low C3 concentration is not an explanation for the high prevalence of B. burgdorferi infections and glomerular disease in Bernese Mountain dogs."

		"abstract": "The effectiveness of a new first-in-class antibiotic, tigecycline (glycylcycline), was evaluated during the early dissemination (1 week), early immune (3 weeks), or late persistent (4 months) phases of Borrelia burgdorferi infection in C3H mice. Mice were treated with high or low doses of tigecycline, saline (negative-effect controls), or a previously published regimen of ceftriaxone (positive-effect controls). Infection status was assessed at 3 months after treatment by culture, quantitative ospA real-time PCR, and subcutaneous transplantation of joint and heart tissue into SCID mice. Tissues from all saline-treated mice were culture and ospA PCR positive, tissues from all antibiotic-treated mice were culture negative, and some of the tissues from most of the mice treated with antibiotics were ospA PCR positive, although the DNA marker load was markedly decreased compared to that in saline-treated mice. Antibiotic treatment during the early stage of infection appeared to be more effective than treatment that began during later stages of infection. The viability of noncultivable spirochetes in antibiotic-treated mice (demonstrable by PCR) was confirmed by transplantation of tissue allografts from treated mice into SCID mice, with dissemination of spirochetal DNA to multiple recipient tissues, and by xenodiagnosis, including acquisition by ticks, transmission by ticks to SCID mice, and survival through molting into nymphs and then into adults. Furthermore, PCR-positive heart base tissue from antibiotic-treated mice revealed RNA transcription of several B. burgdorferi genes. These results extended previous studies with ceftriaxone, indicating that antibiotic treatment is unable to clear persisting spirochetes, which remain viable and infectious, but are nondividing or slowly dividing."

		"abstract": "Host susceptibility to infection is controlled in large measure by the genetic makeup of the host. Spirochetes of the genus Borrelia include nearly 40 species of vector-borne spirochetes that are capable of infecting a wide range of mammalian hosts, causing Lyme disease and relapsing fever. Relapsing fever is associated with high-level bacteremia, as well as hematologic manifestations, such as thrombocytopenia (i.e., low platelet numbers) and anemia. To facilitate studies of genetic control of susceptibility to Borrelia hermsii infection, we performed a systematic analysis of the course of infection using immunocompetent and immunocompromised inbred strains of mice. Our analysis revealed that sensitivity to B. hermsii infections is genetically controlled. In addition, whereas the role of adaptive immunity to relapsing fever-causing spirochetes is well documented, we found that innate immunity contributes significantly to the reduction of bacterial burden. Similar to human infection, the progression of the disease in mice was associated with thrombocytopenia and anemia. Histological and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of infected tissues indicated that red blood cells (RBCs) were removed by tissue-resident macrophages, a process that could lead to anemia. Spirochetes in the spleen and liver were often visualized associated with RBCs, lending support to the hypothesis that direct interaction of B. hermsii spirochetes with RBCs leads to clearance of bacteria from the bloodstream by tissue phagocytes."

Our aim was to confirm the diagnostic role of CXCL13 and to evaluate its relevance as a therapy response and disease activity marker in NB. CXCL13 was measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of patients with NB (n=28), systemic borreliosis (SB, n=9), Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS, n=11), Bell's palsy (BP, n=19), other cranial nerve palsies (CNP, n=5), cephalgia (C, n=20), bacterial CNS infections (B-CNS-I, n=16) and viral CNS infections (V-CNS-I, n=18). For follow-up studies, serial sample pairs were evaluated from 25 patients with NB (n=56), 11 with B-CNS-I (n=25) and 14 with V-CNS-I (n=36). CSF-CXCL13 was significantly elevated in NB compared with other neurological diseases (p<0.001). Using receiver operating characteristic analysis, 337 ng/g was determined as a cut-off with a sensitivity of 96.4% and a specificity of 96.9%. Of all the parameters investigated, CSF CXCL13 showed the fastest response to antibiotic therapy, decreasing significantly (p=0.008) within 1 week. In untreated patients, CSF CXCL13 was elevated in patients with a short duration of disease. Borrelia burgdorferi antibody index showed no significant (p=0.356) change over follow-up. The study confirms the relevance of CXCL13 as a diagnostic biomarker of NB and suggests that CSF CXCL13 in NB is linked to duration of disease and could be a marker of disease activity and response to antibiotic therapy."

We studied whether elements of the 2 approaches could be combined to produce a second-tier IgG blot that performs well throughout the infection. Separate serum sets from LD patients and control subjects were tested independently at 2 medical centers using whole-cell enzyme immunoassays and IgM and IgG immunoblots, with recombinant VlsE added to the IgG blots. The results from both centers were combined, and a new second-tier IgG algorithm was developed. With standard 2-tiered IgM and IgG testing, 31% of patients with active erythema migrans (stage 1), 63% of those with acute neuroborreliosis or carditis (stage 2), and 100% of those with arthritis or late neurologic involvement (stage 3) had positive results. Using new IgG criteria, in which only the VlsE band was scored as a second-tier test among patients with early LD (stage 1 or 2) and 5 of 11 IgG bands were required in those with stage 3 LD, 34% of patients with stage 1, 96% of those with stage 2, and 100% of those with stage 3 infection had positive responses. Both new and standard testing achieved 100% specificity. Compared with standard IgM and IgG testing, the new IgG algorithm (with VlsE band) eliminates the need for IgM testing; it provides comparable or better sensitivity, and it maintains high specificity."

Mean time interval between onset of disease and admission to hospital showed significant differences between Bb (7.6 days) and enterovirus infection (2.8 days; P < 0.01) or unknown causes (2.0 days; P < 0.01). Time interval between onset of disease and hospital admission and CSF characteristics can contribute to distinguishing the etiology of aseptic meningitis with or without PFNP. As expected, the most common etiology for aseptic meningitis with PFNP was Bb infection whereas enterovirus infection was the predominant cause for aseptic meningitis alone."

		"abstract": "Only two spirochetal infections are known to cause nervous system infection and damage: neurosyphilis and neuroborreliosis (nervous system Lyme disease). Diagnosis of both generally relies on indirect tools, primarily assessment of the host immune response to the organism. Reliance on these indirect measures poses some challenges, particularly as they are imperfect measures of treatment response. Despite this, both infections are known to be readily curable with straightforward antimicrobial regimens. The challenge is that, untreated, both infections can cause progressive nervous system damage. Although this can be microbiologically cured, the threat of permanent resultant neurologic damage, often severe in neurosyphilis and usually less so in neuroborreliosis, leads to considerable concern and emphasizes the need for prevention or early and accurate diagnosis and treatment."

		"abstract": "Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is a nervous system infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb). To present evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Data were analysed according to levels of evidence as suggested by EFNS. The following three criteria should be fulfilled for definite LNB, and two of them for possible LNB: (i) neurological symptoms; (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; (iii) Bb-specific antibodies produced intrathecally. PCR and CSF culture may be corroborative if symptom duration is <6 weeks, when Bb antibodies may be absent. PCR is otherwise not recommended. There is also not enough evidence to recommend the following tests for diagnostic purposes: microscope-based assays, chemokine CXCL13, antigen detection, immune complexes, lymphocyte transformation test, cyst formation, lymphocyte markers. Adult patients with definite or possible acute LNB (symptom duration <6 months) should be offered a single 14-day course of antibiotic treatment. Oral doxycycline (200 mg daily) and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 g daily) are equally effective in patients with symptoms confined to the peripheral nervous system, including meningitis (level A). Patients with CNS manifestations should be treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) for 14 days and late LNB (symptom duration >6 months) for 3 weeks (good practice points). Children should be treated as adults, except that doxycycline is contraindicated under 8 years of age (nine in some countries). If symptoms persist for more than 6 months after standard treatment, the condition is often termed post-Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). Antibiotic therapy has no impact on PLDS (level A)."

We performed a review of the data from 95 women with Lyme borreliosis during pregnancy, evaluated at the Center for Tick-borne Diseases, Budapest over the past 22 years. Treatment was administered parenterally to 66 (69.5%) women and orally to 19 (20%). Infection remained untreated in 10 (10.5%) pregnancies. Adverse outcomes were seen in 8/66 (12.1%) parentally treated women, 6/19 (31.6%) orally treated women, and 6/10 (60%) untreated women. In comparison to patients treated with antibiotics, untreated women had a significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome (odds ratio (OR) 7.61, p=0.004). While mothers treated orally had an increased chance (OR 3.35) of having an adverse outcome compared to those treated parenterally, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.052). Erythema migrans did not resolve by the end of the first antibiotic course in 17 patients. Adverse pregnancy outcome was more frequent among these 'slow responder' mothers (OR 2.69), but this was not statistically significant (p=0.1425) . Loss of the pregnancy (n=7) and cavernous hemangioma (n=4) were the most prevalent adverse outcomes in our series. The other complications were heterogeneous. Our results indicate that an untreated maternal Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. infection may be associated with an adverse outcome, although bacterial invasion of the fetus cannot be proven. It appears that a specific syndrome representing 'congenital Lyme borreliosis' is unlikely."

The average fold change of the 5 genes over normal expression, as determined by qPCR, was significantly elevated in skin biopsies from patients with CIDP in comparison to CMT1 or diabetic neuropathy, and similar to that seen in Lyme disease.

P66 is expressed by B. burgdorferi in the mammal, in laboratory media, and as the bacteria are acquired or transmitted by the tick, but is not expressed by the bacterium in unfed ticks. Attempts to reveal factors influencing expression revealed that P66 was expressed in all in vitro conditions investigated. Candidate regulators identified in a search of the B. burgdorferi genome for homologs to other bacterial transcription factors were cloned and introduced into E. coli carrying a p66 promoter-signal sequence-phoA (alkaline phosphatase, or AP) fusion. Three candidate transcription factors-two that decreased AP activity (Hbb and BB0527), and one that increased AP activity (BBA23)-were identified. BBA23 and BB0527 did not bind to the p66 promoter at physiologically relevant concentrations. In contrast, several promoter fragments, including p66, were bound by Hbb (BB0232), with slightly different affinities. Consistent with results from other laboratories, Hbb appears to recognize multiple DNA sequences. Changes in the expression of p66 and bb0232 in the tick at various points with respect to feeding on mice, along with the results of the reporter experiment in the surrogate host E. coli, are consistent with Hbb/BB0232 being involved in regulating p66 expression."

		"abstract": "Leptospira interrogans is the etiological agent of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease that affects populations worldwide. We have identified in proteomic studies a protein that is encoded by the gene LIC10314 and expressed in virulent strain of L. interrogans serovar Pomona. This protein was predicted to be surface exposed by PSORT program and contains a p83/100 domain identified by BLAST analysis that is conserved in protein antigens of several strains of Borrelia and Treponema spp. The proteins containing this domain have been claimed antigen candidates for serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. Thus, we have cloned the LIC10314 and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli BL21-SI strain by using the expression vector pAE. The recombinant protein tagged with N-terminal hexahistidine was purified by metal-charged chromatography and characterized by circular dichroism spectroscopy. This protein is conserved among several species of pathogenic Leptospira and absent in the saprophytic strain L. biflexa. We confirm by liquid-phase immunofluorescence assays with living organisms that this protein is most likely a new surface leptospiral protein. The ability of the protein to mediate attachment to ECM components was evaluated by binding assays. The leptospiral protein encoded by LIC10314, named Lsa63 (Leptospiral surface adhesin of 63kDa), binds strongly to laminin and collagen IV in a dose-dependent and saturable fashion. In addition, Lsa63 is probably expressed during infection since it was recognized by antibodies of serum samples of confirmed-leptospirosis patients in convalescent phase of the disease. Altogether, the data suggests that this novel identified surface protein may be involved in leptospiral pathogenesis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, adapts to unique host environments as a consequence of its complex life cycle that spans both arthropod and mammalian species. In this regard, B. burgdorferi must adapt to various environmental signals, pHs, temperatures, and O(2) and CO(2) levels to establish infectious foci. We hypothesize that the BosR protein functions as a global regulator that is required for both borrelial oxidative homeostasis and pathogenesis. To assess the role of BosR in B. burgdorferi, we constructed an IPTG (isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside)-regulated bosR strain. The selective decrease of bosR resulted in a change in growth when cells were cultured either anaerobically or microaerobically; however, a distinct growth defect was observed for anaerobically grown B. burgdorferi relative to the growth attenuation observed for microaerobically grown B. burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi cells in which BosR levels were reduced were more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and produced lower levels of NapA (Dps) and SodA, proteins involved in the oxidative stress response. In addition, the levels of OspC and DbpA were also induced coincident with increased BosR levels, suggesting that BosR interfaces with the RpoS regulatory cascade, which is known to modulate virulence gene expression in B. burgdorferi. Taken together, these results indicate that BosR is involved in the resistance of B. burgdorferi to oxidative stressors and affects the expression of genes, either directly or indirectly, whose products are important in borrelial pathogenesis."

Up to three distinct complement regulator-acquiring surface proteins (CRASPs) may be expressed by serum-resistant B. spielmanii, each exhibiting an affinity for CFH and/or CFHL1. Here, we describe the functional characterization of the 15-kDa CRASPs of B. spielmanii, members of the polymorphic Erp (OspE/F-related) protein family, that bind two distinct host complement regulators, CFH and factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1), but not CFHL1. CFH bound to the B. spielmanii CRASPs maintained cofactor activity for factor I-mediated C3b inactivation. Three naturally occurring alleles of this protein bound CFH and CFHR1 while a fourth natural allele could not. Comparative sequence analysis of these protein alleles identified a single amino acid, histidine-79, as playing a significant role in CFH/CFHR1 binding, with substitution by an arginine completely abrogating ligand binding. The mutation of His-79 to Arg did not inhibit binding of plasminogen, another known ligand of this group of borrelial outer-surface proteins."

Clinical and diagnostic features were obtained by retrospective chart review; follow-up information and outcome were obtained prospectively. The spectrum of conditions responsible for cerebral vasculitis included seven patients with Behçet syndrome and one case each of giant cell arteritis, Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome, respectively. Vasculitis secondary to systemic diseases included two patients with systemic lupus erythematodes, one with sarcoidosis and one with ANA-positive systemic vasculitis. Two patients suffered from infectious angiitis caused by borreliosis and syphilis. The mean age at onset of cerebral symptoms was 41.38 years. The most frequent clinical symptoms were headache, gait disturbances and unilateral numbness. None of the patients with Behçet syndrome experienced any ischemic event, which was a significant difference compared with the other patients (P = 0.011). Gadolinium-enhancing lesions were significantly more frequent in Behçet syndrome compared to the other types of vasculitis (P = 0.041). There was no significant difference between vasculitis patients with or without Behçet syndrome regarding outcome parameters. The differential diagnosis of conditions responsible for cerebral vasculitis includes a wide spectrum of diseases. Clinical features and the course of cerebral vasculitis are highly variable. The enigma of cerebral vasculitis will only be solved by implementing large, prospective, multicenter databases."

In this paper we explore the contribution of Ixodes scapularis ticks to the pathogenicity of Borrelia burgdorferi in mice. Previously we demonstrated that an isolate of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (designated N40), passaged 75 times in vitro (N40-75), was infectious but was no longer able to cause arthritis and carditis in C3H mice. We now show that N40-75 spirochetes can readily colonize I. scapularis and multiply during tick engorgement. Remarkably, tick-transmitted N40-75 spirochetes cause disease in mice. N40-75 spirochetes isolated from these animals also retained their pathogenicity when subsequently administered to mice via syringe inoculation. Array analysis revealed that several genes associated with virulence, including bba25, bba65, bba66, bbj09, and bbk32, had higher expression levels in the tick-passaged N40-75 spirochete. These data suggest that transmission of a high-passage attenuated isolate of B. burgdorferi by the arthropod vector results in the generation of spirochetes that have enhanced pathogenesis in mice."

Several of these differentially expressed lipoproteins have been shown to play important roles in the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi. The BBA05 protein is a previously identified putative lipoprotein (P55 or S1 antigen) that elicits antibody responses in mammals. Recent microarray analyses indicate that the BBA05 gene is differentially expressed by many environmental factors, including temperature. However, the role of the BBA05 protein in the life cycle of B. burgdorferi has not been elucidated. Here we show that expression of the BBA05 gene was exclusively induced in feeding nymphal ticks during the spirochetal transmission from ticks to mammals. Upon generating a BBA05 mutant in an infectious strain of B. burgdorferi, we showed that the BBA05 mutant remained capable of establishing infection in mice, being acquired by ticks, persisting through tick molting, and reinfecting new mammalian hosts. These results indicate that, despite being a highly conserved and regulated antigen, the BBA05 protein has a nonessential role in the transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi, at least in the animal model."

		"abstract": "Analysis of natural selection is key to understanding many core biological processes, including the emergence of competition, cooperation, and complexity, and has important applications in the targeted development of vaccines. Selection is hard to observe directly but can be inferred from molecular sequence variation. For protein-coding nucleotide sequences, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (omega) distinguishes neutrally evolving sequences (omega = 1) from those subjected to purifying (omega < 1) or positive Darwinian (omega > 1) selection. We show that current models used to estimate omega are substantially biased by naturally occurring sequence compositions. We present a novel model that weights substitutions by conditional nucleotide frequencies and which escapes these artifacts. Applying it to the genomes of pathogens causing malaria, leprosy, tuberculosis, and Lyme disease gave significant discrepancies in estimates with approximately 10-30% of genes affected. Our work has substantial implications for how vaccine targets are chosen and for studying the molecular basis of adaptive evolution."

		"abstract": "The members of the genus Borrelia are transmitted by arthropods and known to be infectious to vertebrates. Here we found isolates and DNAs belonging to the Borrelia turcica and unknown Borrelia species from imported reptiles and their ectoparasites. The Borrelia strains were isolated from blood and multiple organs of exotic tortoises, and were experimentally infectious to captive-bred tortoises. These findings suggest that these tortoises may be a candidate as the reservoir host of the Borrelia species. In this study, the Borrelia strains were also isolated from and/or detected in hard-bodied ticks, Amblyomma ticks and Hyalomma ticks. In some of these ticks, immunofluorescence imaging analysis revealed that the Borrelia had also invaded into the tick salivary glands. Accordingly, these ticks were expected to be a potential vector of the Borrelia species. Sequencing analyses of both housekeeping genes (flaB gene, gyrB gene and 16S rDNA gene) and 23S rRNA gene-16S rRNA gene intergenic spacer region revealed that these Borrelia strains formed a monophyletic group that was independent from two other Borrelia groups, Lyme disease Borrelia and relapsing fever Borrelia. From these results, the novel group of Borrelia comprises the third major group of arthropod-transmitted borreliae identified to date."

Imaging was used to exclude intracranial, cervical and intrathoracic embryological lesions, vascular malformations and tumours. Laboratory and electrophysiological investigations were used to exclude inflammatory and paraneoplastic processes, endocrinopathy and metabolic disorders. Serological testing was positive for Lyme disease. Parenteral ceftriaxone therapy was commenced. The patient's nerve paralysis showed complete recovery on the seventh day of antibiotic treatment; this was confirmed by videolaryngoscopy.

The spatially defined focus, or nidus, of transmission may be characterized by vegetation as well as by climate, latitude, elevation, and geology. The ecological complexity, dimensions, and temporal stability of the nidus are determined largely by pathogen natural history and vector bionomics. Host populations, transmission efficiency, and therefore pathogen amplification vary spatially, thereby creating a heterogeneous surface that may be defined by remote sensing and statistical tools. The current review describes the evolution of landscape epidemiology as a science and exemplifies selected aspects by contrasting the ecology of two different recent disease outbreaks in North America caused by West Nile virus, an explosive, highly virulent mosquito-borne virus producing ephemeral nidi, and Borrelia burgdorferi, a slowly amplifying chronic pathogen producing semipermanent nidi."

The differential diagnosis includes multiple well-known diseases including herpes, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, bartonellosis, Lyme disease, and others. However, clinician should be aware of emerging infectious agents as potential causes of systemic illness and also intraocular inflammation. Air travel, immigration, and globalization of business have overturned traditional pattern of geographic distribution of infectious diseases, and therefore one should work locally but think globally. This review recapitulates the systemic and ocular manifestations of several emergent infectious diseases relevant to the ophthalmologist including Rickettsioses, West Nile virus infection, Rift valley fever, Dengue fever, and Chikungunya. Retinitis, chorioretinitis, retinal vasculitis, and optic nerve involvement have been associated with these emergent infectious diseases. The diagnosis of any of these infections is usually based on pattern of uveitis, systemic symptoms and signs, and specific epidemiological data and confirmed by detection of specific antibody in serum. A systematic ocular examination, showing fairly typical fundus findings, may help establish an early clinical diagnosis, which allows prompt, appropriate management."

These motors are rotary nanomachines that use the electrochemical potential from ion gradients. The motor can spin in both directions with specific proteins regulating the direction in response to chemotactic stimuli. Here we investigated the structure of flagellar motors of Borrelia spirochetes, the causative agents of Lyme disease in humans. We revealed the structure of the motor complex at 4.6-nm resolution by sub-volume averaging of cryo-electron tomograms and subsequently imposing rotational symmetry. This allowed direct visualisation of individual motor components, the connection between the stator and the peptidoglycan as well as filamentous linkers between the stator and the rod. Two different motor assemblies seem to co-exist at a single bacterial pole. While most motors were completely assembled, a smaller fraction appeared to lack part of the C-ring, which plays a role in protein export and switching the directionality of rotation. Our data suggest a novel mechanism that bacteria may use to control the direction of movement."

In Europe the primary arthropod vectors of zoonotic diseases are ticks, which transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the agent of Lyme disease), tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus between humans, livestock and wildlife. Ixodes ricinus ticks and reported tick-borne disease cases are currently increasing in the UK. Theories for this include climate change and increasing host abundance. This study aimed to test how I. ricinus tick abundance might be influenced by climate change in Scotland by using altitudinal gradients as a proxy, while also taking into account the effects of hosts, vegetation and weather effects. It was predicted that tick abundance would be higher at lower altitudes (i.e. warmer climates) and increase with host abundance. Surveys were conducted on nine hills in Scotland, all of open moorland habitat. Tick abundance was positively associated with deer abundance, but even after taking this into account, there was a strong negative association of ticks with altitude. This was probably a real climate effect, with temperature (and humidity, i.e. saturation deficit) most likely playing an important role. It could be inferred that ticks may become more abundant at higher altitudes in response to climate warming. This has potential implications for pathogen prevalence such as louping ill virus if tick numbers increase at elevations where competent transmission hosts (red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus and mountain hares Lepus timidus) occur in higher numbers."

Out of 85 patients 41 (48%) had remaining complaints; 14 had objective findings and 27 subjective symptoms. Remaining complaints were associated with pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks (OR = 4.062, P = 0.044), high pre-treatment cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count (OR = 1.005, P = 0.001), and female gender (OR = 3.218, P = 0.025). Presence of CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) was not analyzed in the logistic regression model due to many missing observations, but was found to be more frequent both pre-treatment (P = 0.004) and after 12 months (P = 0.015) among patients with remaining complaints as compared to patients with complete recovery. Further evaluation showed that objective remaining findings, and not subjective symptoms, were associated with pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks. No difference in outcome was observed between patients treated with IV ceftriaxone and patients treated with oral doxycycline. Remaining complaints are common after neuroborreliosis. The majority of the complaints are subjective. Pre-treatment symptom duration >or=6 weeks, high pre-treatment CSF cell count, and female gender seem to be risk factors for remaining complaints. Presence of CSF OCBs may also predict a non-favorable outcome, but this should be further studied. Whether subjective and objective complaints are associated with different risk factors is also an issue for future studies."

		"abstract": "Scrub typhus is a zoonotic disease that is caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. Although hepatic dysfunction occurred in 77-96.7% of the scrub typhus patients, its mechanism is unknown. IL-17 is a potent proinflammatory cytokine known for its role in several chronic disease conditions. Abundant IL-17 was found in conditions affected by microbial pathogens, including the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme arthritis or Chlamydia-induced reactive arthritis, Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, and listeria infection. It is also suggested as a marker of acute hepatic injury. In our study, we postulated that IL-17 might be a cytokine with a role in hepatic dysfunction in scrub typhus. In September-November 2006, our study involved 43 patients with Boryong-type scrub typhus patients and 40 age- and sex-matched control healthy people. Scrub typhus was confirmed on the basis of immunofluorescence and a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. IL-17 was measured using human IL-17 immunoassay. We gathered the clinical and laboratory data by chart reviews. We used an independent t-test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and correlation analysis. The IL-17 levels were significantly higher in scrub typhus patients than in the healthy group. Also, the patients with scrub typhus showed significantly higher aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, and lower hemoglobin levels than the healthy group. However, in our correlation analysis, we did not find any correlation between IL-17 and hepatic, kidney, and hemogram panels. The IL-17 level in patients with headaches was higher than in patients without headaches, showing a borderline significance. This suggests that IL-17 level might be a cause of a vasculitis-associated headache. More prospective, large-scale studies are needed about the mechanism of hepatic dysfunction and headaches in scrub typhus patients."

In Lyme disease diagnostic problems are still discussed extensively as the laboratory workup is not standardized and a positive antibody result is not proof of active infection. It is therefore important to appreciate all clinical signs that can prompt us to the diagnostic investigation of Lyme borreliosis. We present a case of a woman with Lyme borreliosis and recurrent unilateral anterior uveitis in her right eye for 2 years, who developed cotton wool spots (CWS) in her left eye, followed by acute and recurrent anterior uveitis in this second eye. An extensive general examination, including blood coagulopathies and ultrasound of the carotid arteries, did not reveal any pathology. The CWS resolved within a few months. The recurrent anterior uveitis could be controlled by topical steroids. After treatment with 2 g of i.v. ceftriaxone for 3 weeks, she remained free of recurrences for 1 year of observation time. CWS can be the first clinical sign of ocular vascular pathology and/or uveitis. Further investigation will be necessary to confirm the relationship between CWS and ocular borreliosis. In patients with otherwise unexplained CWS, the possibility of an infection with borreliosis should be ruled out carefully."

		"abstract": "Disease prevention models have shown individuals are more likely to engage in precautionary behavior if they have confidence in their ability to identify disease symptoms and understand health risks. In immigrant populations, communicating the risks poses greater challenges since linguistic and cultural barriers may impede acceptance of the new behavior. The Brazilian population on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, is at high risk for Lyme disease (LD), the most common vector-borne illness in the United States largely preventable by limiting tick exposure. We surveyed 103 Brazilians on MV about their health beliefs and perceptions of LD risk and assessed their level of precautionary behaviors and the cultural factors influencing them. The population had only a moderate perception of risk and little understanding of LD. Forty-one percent did not think LD posed a risk, while 79% were not sure they could recognize symptoms. Accordingly, the population as a whole reported taking few precautions."

		"abstract": "To confidently diagnose and treat Lyme disease, the clinician must first understand the natural history of this disease, especially its protean early manifestations. Emergency physicians, primary care physicians, and other providers need to be vigilant in terms of the timely recognition of erythema migrans (EM), the unique marker of early localized stage 1 disease. The classic EM, originally described as a slowly expanding bull's eye lesion, is now recognized to be present in only the minority of cases (9%); the dominant morphologic lesion of EM is now recognized to be the diffusely homogenous red plaque or patch, which occurs in over 50% of cases. This update will define the current morphologic features of early Lyme disease, the indication for serologic studies, and the most recent treatment guidelines, including therapeutic pitfalls."
