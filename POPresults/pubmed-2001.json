		"abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies in horses from the metropolitan area of Monterrey, Nuevo León, México. Blood serum was obtained from a total of 100 horses residing at different counties in the area. From each animal data was obtained on age, sex, county of residence, presence of ectoparasites and clinical signs. All sera samples were analyzed by indirect immunofluoresence and the sera that resulted positive to this test was analyzed by Western blot. The serological test yielded 34 positive sera at 1:64 dilution, and from them 6 were positive at 1:128 dilution, 3 at 1:256, and only one at 1:512. Confirmation of the infection by Western blot was obtained only in the sample positive at the 1:512 dilution. These results shown a low frequency of seropositivity to B. burgdorferi of the horses in the area, confirming previous studies indicating that in northeast Mexico Lyme disease is present in different animal species."

The features of Lyme disease and Parvovirus B19 infection that may mimic systemic lupus erythematosus include a facial rash, often in a malar distribution, hematologic abnormalities, arthritis, neurologic disorders, and autoantibody positivity.

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the B. burgdorferi flagellin gene revealed consistent decreases in spirochete numbers in skin at the sites of tick attachment compared with non-tick attachment sites. This phenomenon was found during early (2 weeks) and late (8 weeks) infection and at 24, 48, and 72 h after tick attachment. A nonspecific inflammatory stimulus, implantation of suture material, did not have this effect. In contrast to B. burgdorferi, copy numbers of an aoHGE p44 target gene target were significantly increased at the sites of tick attachment, compared with non-tick sites. The non-specific stimulus of suture material had the same effect on aoHGE recruitment as tick attachment in aoHGE infected mice. These results reinforce the concept that B. burgdorferi interfaces with its vector by virtue of its non-systemic dermatotropism, and not via systemic hematogenous acquisition. In contrast, results indicate that the aoHGE relies upon hematogenous acquisition. Thus, these two cotransmitted tick-borne pathogens utilize distinctly different means of vector acquisition."

		"abstract": "An acarologic study was conducted in a semirural community in northern California to determine the relative abundance of, and the prevalence of infection with, three emerging bacterial pathogens in the western black-legged tick (Ixodes pacificus). These included the agents causing Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi), human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [Ehrlichia phagocytophila (formerly Ehrlichia equi)], and human monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia chaffeensis). The study area in Sonoma County consisted of two properties each with four residents and an uninhabited adjacent comparison area. Six of the eight residents had been either physician-diagnosed or serodiagnosed previously with Lyme disease, and, of these, one also had been serodiagnosed with human monocytic ehrlichiosis. Direct immunofluorescent/culture assays and bacterial species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used to test whole ticks individually for presence of B. burgdorferi and Ehrlichia spp., respectively. Overall, 6.5% of the nymphal (n = 589) and 1.6% of the adult ticks (n = 318) from the same generational cohort were found to contain B. burgdorferi. In contrast, none of 465 nymphs and 9.9% of 202 adults were infected with E. phagocytophila. Excised tissues from another 95 adult ticks yielded a comparable E. phagocytophila infection prevalence of 13.7%. E. chaffeensis was not detected in either nymphal or adult ticks. Using a combination of culture and polymerase chain reaction assays, coinfection of I. pacificus adults with B. burgdorferi and E. phagocytophila was demonstrated for the first time. The marked disparity in the infection prevalence of these pathogens in nymphal and adult ticks suggests that their maintenance cycles are inherently different."

Using I. scapularis nymphs as the mode of infectious challenge, we studied how infection with one pathogen in white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) affects their ability to acquire the other agent and subsequently to infect larvae, which these agents would do in nature. Two groups of mice were infected with either B. burgdorferi or E. phagocytophila. One week later, B. burgdorferi-infected mice were challenged with E. phagocytophila, and E. phagocytophila-infected mice were challenged with B. burgdorferi. Simultaneously, two control groups of uninfected mice were infected with each agent from the same tick cohorts used on the first groups of mice. Uninfected I. scapularis larvae were fed on all mice for xenodiagnosis at weekly intervals lasting 2 months. For the B. burgdorferi challenge, all control and E. phagocytophila-infected mice acquired B. burgdorferi. However, fewer xenodiagnostic larvae acquired B. burgdorferi from mice with mixed infections compared with mice infected with B. burgdorferi only. For the E. phagocytophila challenge, all five control mice acquired E. phagocytophila, but only two of five mice infected with B. burgdorferi subsequently acquired E. phagocytophila. Consequently, mice with both infections produced fewer xenodiagnostic ticks infected with E. phagocytophila than mice infected with E. phagocytophila only. Thus, a primary infection with either B. burgdorferi or E. phagocytophila in mice inhibited transmission of a second agent, suggesting interference between these two agents."

Despite densities of mice that fluctuated two orders of magnitude, average larval and nymphal tick burdens per mouse remained remarkably constant. Spatial variability in mouse density and tick burdens was modest. The total number of larval and nymphal ticks that fed on the mouse population each year depended strongly on population density of mice; a steady increase was observed in both mouse density and total tick meals on mice from 1996 through 1999. The result was a steady increase in the infection prevalence of nymphal and adult ticks with the etiological agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi, over this time. We suggest that fluctuations in population density of mice, combined with possible regulation of tick burdens on mice, may influence risk of human exposure to Lyme disease."

As a major reservoir host, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a candidate for a vaccination program designed to reduce infection prevalence in vector ticks. In this study we characterized the effect of various levels of immunization with recombinant OspA-glutathione transferase fusion protein on transmission dynamics from infected P. leucopus to larval ticks. Control mice were vaccinated with glutathione transferase alone. All mice were experimentally infected with B. burgdorferi before vaccination. The immune responses of the immunized mice were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antibodies to OspA. Transmission of B. burgdorferi from infected mice was determined by xenodiagnosis with uninfected larval ticks. Spirochetes in ticks were counted by direct immunofluorescence assay. The concentration of antibody to OspA increased with each OspA vaccination but most markedly after the first and second vaccinations. In comparison with control mice, there was reduced transmission by OspA-vaccinated mice to uninfected ticks. One, two, or three doses of OspA reduced infection prevalence in xenodiagnostic ticks by 48%, 92%, or 99% and the numbers of spirochetes per tick by 84%, 98%, or 99%, respectively. This study suggests that vaccination of P. leucopus with OspA could reduce transmission to the tick vector in nature despite prior infection of the reservoir host."

		"abstract": "Risk of exposure to Lyme disease is a function of the local abundance of nymphal Ixodes ticks that are infected with the etiological agent, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. We monitored abundance of white-footed mice (the principal B. burgdorferi reservoir in the eastern and central United States) and acorns (a critical food resource for mice), and Ixodes scapularis ticks, as well as ambient temperature (cumulative growing degree days) and growing season precipitation, in a forested landscape of southeastern New York State from 1994 to 2000. We found that acorn production in autumn strongly influenced abundance of white-footed mice the following summer and that abundance of mice in summer, when larval ticks are active, influenced the abundance of infected nymphs the following year. Consequently, the abundance of infected nymphal ticks can be predicted from acorn production 1.75 years earlier. Monitoring of natural fluctuations in acorn production thus supports results of prior acorn addition experiments that were conducted at small spatial scales. Growing degree days and precipitation either had no significant effect on density of nymphs or marginally increased the explanatory power of models that included acorns or mouse density as independent variables. We conclude that, at our study site in New York, the risk of human exposure to Lyme disease is affected by mouse density in the prior year and by acorn production 2 years previously."

All isolates induced multifocal, lymphoid nodular cystitis, subacute, multifocal, necrotizing myocarditis, and a localized periostitis and arthritis of the femorotibial joint 6-18 weeks after tick infestation. In terms of the number of mice that demonstrated pathology in bladder, heart, and joint, the highest incidence of lesions occurred 12 weeks after tick bite. Utilizing the Taqman quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) fluorogenic detection technology to amplify a conserved region of the flagellin gene, a trend was demonstrated between the number of spirochetes in tissue with duration of pathology. The q-PCR assay developed for this study was sensitive and could reliably measure as few as 1 to 10 spirochetes in the target tissues tested. A higher percentage of B31- and N40-infected mice (92 and 100%, respectively) developed myocarditis than JD-1- or 910255-infected mice (67 and 46%, respectively) 12 weeks after tick bite. The amount of spirochetal DNA that could be amplified for heart at this time point was not statistically different between isolates, indicating a difference in virulence between B31 and N40 relative to JD-1 and 910225. N40-infected mice demonstrated a significantly higher spirochete load (an average of 1.23 spirochetes/mg of tissue, p = 0.045) in femorotibial joints 18 weeks after infection, with 60% of these mice maintaining lesions compared with those infected with B31 (13%), JD-1 (25%), or 910255 (50%), which averaged <0.5 spirochetes/mg of tissue. This mouse model of Lyme borreliosis, including the ability to monitor lesion development and spirochete load, can facilitate the testing of therapeutic regimens for the later stages of tick-transmitted Lyme disease and help investigate aspects of the immunopathogenesis of lesion development."

Infected ticks are positive for Borrelia spp. by DFA test but negative for Borrelia burgdorferi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific primers for 16S rDNA, outer surface protein A, outer surface protein C, and flagellin genes. A 1,347-bp portion of 16S rDNA was amplified from a pool of infected nymphs, sequenced, and compared with the homologous fragment from 26 other species of Borrelia. The analysis showed 4.6% pairwise difference from B. burgdorferi, with the closest relative being Borrelia miyamotoi (99.3% similarity) reported from Ixodes persulcatus in Japan. Phylogenetic analysis showed the unknown Borrelia to cluster with relapsing fever group spirochetes rather than with Lyme disease spirochetes. A 764-bp fragment of the flagellin gene was also compared with the homologous fragment from 24 other Borrelia species. The flagellin sequence of B. burgdorferi was 19.5% different from the unknown Borrelia and showed 98.6% similarity with B. miyamotoi. A pair of PCR primers specifically designed to amplify a 219-bp fragment of the flagellin gene from this spirochete was used to survey field-collected I. scapularis nymphs from five northeastern states (Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland). Positive results were obtained in 1.9-2.5% of 712 nymphs sampled from four states but in none of 162 ticks collected from Maryland. Transovarial transmission was demonstrated by PCR of larval progeny from infected females with filial infection rates ranging from 6% to 73%. Transstadial passage occurred from larvae through adults. Vertebrate infection was demonstrated by feeding infected nymphs on Peromyscus leucopus mice and recovering the organism from uninfected xenodiagnostic larvae fed 7-21 days later. Considering the frequency of contact between I. scapularis and humans, further work is needed to determine the potential public health significance of yet another zoonotic agent transmitted by this tick species."

		"abstract": "Public health entomology focuses on the population biology of vector-borne infections, seeking to understand how such pathogens perpetuate over time and attempting to devise methods for reducing the burden that they impose on human health. As public health entomology passes its centennial, a series of pervasive research themes and spirited debates characterize the discipline, many reflecting a tension between field and laboratory research. In particular, institutional support for population-based research and training programs has fallen behind that for those using modern lab-based approaches. Discussion of modes of intervention against vector-borne infections (such as deployment of genetically modified vectors, the role of DDT in malaria control, host-targeted acaricides for Lyme disease risk reduction, and truck-mounted aerosol spraying against West Nile virus transmission) illustrates the discipline's need for strengthening population-based research programs. Even with the advent of molecular methods for describing population structure, the basis for anophelism without malaria (or its eastern North American counterpart, ixodism without borreliosis) remains elusive. Such methods have not yet been extensively used to examine the phylogeography and geographical origins of zoonoses such as Lyme disease. Basic ecological questions remain poorly explored: What regulates vector populations? How may mixtures of pathogens be maintained by a single vector? What factors might limit the invasion of Asian mosquitoes into North American sites? Putative effects of \"global warming\" remain speculative given our relative inability to answer such questions. Finally, policy and administrative issues such as the \"no-nits\" dictum in American schools, the Roll Back Malaria program, and legal liability for risk due to vector-borne infections serve to demonstrate further the nature of the crossroads that the discipline of public health entomology faces at the start of the 21st Century."

We used the automatic DNA sequencing machine (Model 377) to detect the nucleotide sequence of the inserted part of the recombinant plasmid pBX1 from Borrelia burgdorferi B31 strain. The restriction enzyme map of the inserted part of pBX1 was analysed by using computer software. The expressed product of pBX1 in E. coli XLI-Blue MRF was analysed by using SDS-PAGE and western-blotting. 1. DNA sequencing showed that pBX1 contained a 477bp inserted gene fragment, and when it was compared with the published sequence of the specific region of the gene of the 83 kd antigen protein from Borrelia burgdorferi B31 strain, only one amino acid codon was different. 2. The restriction enzyme map of the inserted part of pBX1 was successfully constructed. 3. The recombinant plasmid pBX1 expressed a 29 kd fusion protein in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF' after induced with IPTG. The recombinant fusion protein could be recongnized by rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Borrelia burgdorferi B31 strain. A recombinant plasmid which contains the gene fragment encoding the specific region of the 83 kd antigen protein from Borrelia burgdorferi B31 strain has been successfully constructed. The recombinant plasmid can stably express 29 kd fusion protein in E. coli XL1-Blue MRF'. These results could serve as a base of further studies on the usefulness of the fusion protein in serodiagnosis and vaccine for Lyme disease."

A total of 7373 ticks and 2761 samples from LB patients from the same area in southwest Germany were analyzed by PCR to assess the frequency of the occurrence of LB-associated genospecies. Fifteen percent of the tick samples and 19% of the human samples were found positive for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Further identification of 1106 B. burgdorferi sensu lato positive tick samples by reverse line blotting and 125 positive patient samples by nested PCR using species-specific primers revealed the occurrence of B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii and B. valaisiana. Both single-species and mixed infections were noted and a similar distribution of the different genospecies was found in ticks compared with human samples. It was also the purpose of this study to obtain more information about a possible correlation between the distribution of Borrelia species and clinical syndromes of LB. Skin biopsies of 59 patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and cerebrospinal fluid samples from 78 patients with possible neuroborreliosis were analyzed. In conclusion, the distribution of the different genospecies in ticks is the decisive factor for the occurrence of the different Borrelia genospecies in samples from LB patients. Borrelia afzelii is the predominant genospecies in all kind of samples from the observed area and there seems to be no association of particular Borrelia genospecies with distinct clinical manifestations of LB."

An obligate parasite of other organisms, B. burgdorferi is maintained in the mammalian reservoir (small rodents) by tick-mediated transmission from infected individuals to other members of the population. The complex requirements that must be met to ensure survival in an immunocompetent rodent and in the tick vector, coupled with a relatively small genome, suggest that B. burgdorferi has evolved elegant strategies for interacting with its hosts. Among these strategies are several distinct mechanisms of adhesion to mammalian cells and extracellular matrix components. The mammalian receptors for B. burgdorferi that have been most thoroughly studied, and for which candidate bacterial ligands have been identified, are decorin, fibronectin, glycosaminoglycans, and beta 3-chain integrins."

Tick number and prevalence were higher in males than in females, especially from April to June during the host breeding period. The level of tick infestation increased with lizard age and size. The number of ticks collected on adult lizards peaked in June and in August. Infestation levels appear to be related to lizard activity patterns and behaviour. Tick number and prevalence also varied in relation to host habitat, infestation being higher in lizards from areas with hard vegetation cover."

Individual male and female Ixodes ricinus. the vector of Lyme disease in Europe. readily arrest on filter paper strips contaminated with their own faeces. I. ricinus also responds, but to a lesser degree, to faeces-contaminated papers enclosed in metal mesh envelopes. i.e. without directly contacting the faeces, suggesting a role for volatiles in the arrestment response. The faccal constituents guanine. xanthine, uric acid and 8-azaguanine (a bacterial breakdown product of guanine) also caused arrestment of individual I. ricinus males and females. However, mixtures of these products induced arrestment of I. ricinus at doses one hundred fold lower than the lowest active dose of any of them tested singly. Saline extracts of faeces activated receptor cells in terminal pore sensilla on the first leg tarsi of I. ricinus. One cell in these sensilla responded in a similar dose dependent manner to guanine and 8-azaguanine, whereas a second cell was more sensitive to lower doses of 8-azaguanine. The response threshold approached 100 fM for both cells. These findings suggest that faeces and faecal breakdown products are implicated in aggregation responses of I. ricinus. This may account for the clumped distribution of this ectoparasite on the ground and contribute to the high proportion of mated individuals recorded prior to host colonization."

A two-step testing strategy was used in which sera were tested for anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies by a commercially available passive hemagglutination assays (PHA). All PHA positive sera were then evaluated by Western blot IgG. Demographic data regarding age, sex, profession, work place/residence, duration of employment (forestry workers), animals in the environment, and tick bites history were collected using a questionnaire. Data obtained from serological study were matched with that obtained from the questionnaire. The seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi in blood donors was of 4.3% (range 1.4-8.7%) and 9.3% (range 2.8-31.7%) in forestry workers. Seroprevalence was higher in forestry workers with a tick bite history (10.7 vs. 4.3%, p < 0.05). The highest seroprevalence in blood donors (8.7%) was noted in Maramures, a northern district of the country, whereas in forestry workers the highest seroprevalence (31.7%) was observed in a western district (Arad), where a previous study in entomology has demonstrated the highest density of Ixodes ricinus ticks in Romania."

Here we examine the effect of ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) on motile and cystic forms of Borrelia burgdorferi in vitro, to determine whether it could cure this bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract. When motile forms of B. burgdorferi were exposed to RBC for 1 week at 37 degrees C, the minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was > 64 mg/ml. At 30 degrees C, the MBC was > 256 mg/ml. When the incubation lasted for 2 weeks at 37 degrees C, the MBC dropped to > 2 mg/ml. Bismuth aggregates were present on the surface of B. burgdorferi when RBC > or = MBC, as shown by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cystic forms of B. burgdorferi, exposed to RBC for 2 weeks at 37 degrees C, were examined by cultivation in BSK-H medium (Sigma B3528). They were stained with acridine orange (pH 6.4, pH 7.4) and studied by TEM. The MBC for RBC for young cystic forms (1 day old) and old cysts (8 months old) was estimated to be > 0.125 mg/ml and > 2 mg/ml, respectively. Bismuth aggregates were attached to the cysts and, in some, the pin-shaped aggregates penetrated the cyst wall. The bismuth aggregates also bound strongly to blebs and granules of B. burgdorferi when RBC > or = MBC. When B. burgdorferi is responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms, bismuth compounds may be candidates for eradication of the bacterium from the gastrointestinal tract."

The new cases of Lyme borreliosis reported in the years of 1996-2000 in Podlasie Province were analyzed. The analysis included the data from Mz-56 and Mz-57 forms and the information from epidemiologic investigations sent to Regional Sanitary and Epidemiologic Station in Bialystok. In 1996-2000, screening examinations were carried out in the same group of 358 forestry workers including 44 (12.29%) females and 314 (87.71%) males aged from 21 to 64 (x = 41.2) years. Immunoenzymatic test of ELISA Borrelia recombinant IgM and IgG by Biomedica firm (Austria) were used to detect B. burgdorferi antibodies. In 1996-2000, 4933 of borreliosis cases were registered in Poland including 1377 (27.91%) in Podlasie Province. The morbidity rate in Podlasie province ranged from 15.05% in 1996 year to 21.29% in 2000 year of the whole country morbidity. At the same time, the incidence rate in Podlasie Province ranged from 9.09 in 1996 to 32.2 in 2000 year and was 6.72-fold higher than the incidence rate in the whole country. In Eastern and Central region of the province, 80.54% of cases were registered whereas, 14.09% by the Lakeside of Augustów and Suwalki only 5.37% in the western region of the province. It was proved that the morbidity increased in proportion to the age of patients (41.39% of patients were at the age of 30-49) and it decreased only above the age of 60. Thus, Lyme borreliosis affects mainly people at working age. The increase in B. burgdorferi antibody detectability was noticed in the population of forestry workers; it was detected in 38.55% in 1995 and in 2000 in 43.56% of the examined. Interestingly, 81 people infected with B.b in 1995-2000 included 74 men and only 7 women, supporting the statement that B.b infection affects mainly working professionals and the risk increases with the practice. Our studies indicate that Lyme borreliosis is a serious health problem among the inhabitants of Podlasie Province which is an endemic area for Ixodes ricinus ticks infected with B. burgdorferi spirochete."

The specimens so far analysed (n = 55), grouped in 11 pools, were sampled in Feltre area (Veneto region, NE Italy). Five pools proved positive for B. valaisiana (45%) and one of them (9%) was also positive for Ehrlichia, that was further characterised as a HGE-like Ehrlichia. This is the first report of the two bacteria in the Veneto region. The pool positive for both pathogens was used to adjust a multiplex PCR assay, which allowed the detection and identification of both parasites in a single experiment. The advantages offered by this assay, when standardised, will substantially broaden the perspectives of ecological and epidemiological investigations on animal/human Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis, greatly facilitating disease surveillance and control programs."

In the early phase of the disease serology can still be negative, whereas false-positive results are also common. The interpretation of confirmatory Western blot tests is not always easy. Furthermore, routine serology cannot discriminate between active and past infection. In addition, recombinant antigens are being introduced to improve serologic tests. New developments in the diagnosis of Lyme disease are the development of PCR tests. This review gives an overview of the molecular diagnostic possibilities of Lyme borreliosis, mainly by PCR, and describes some interesting possibilities for future serology."

Still, the diagnosis of Lyme disease remains based on history and clinical findings, supplemented by careful use of laboratory tests, and requires that the physician be familiar with the disease's clinical manifestations and the shortcomings of the available diagnostic tests."

In this study we analysed phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of 40 Borrelia strains isolated from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 38 Slovenian patients with different clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. In seven of the patients, Borreliae were also isolated from skin lesions. Species identification and plasmid profiles were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and protein profiles by SDS-PAGE. MluI digestion profiles of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA showed that 25 (62.5%) isolates were B. garinii, 14 (35%) B. afzelii, and one (2.5%) B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. All strains, except one, possessed a large plasmid and a varying number of smaller plasmids. Three (7.5%) isolates exhibited an unusual plasmid profile, with a large plasmid dimer or three copies of the large plasmid. In protein analyses, all strains expressed OspA protein. OspB was present significantly more often in B. afzelii than B. garinii strains (p=0.0000), while OspC was more often present in B. garinii than B. afzelii strains (p=0.0052). In the seven patients with Borreliae isolated also from the skin, the CSF and skin isolates were identical, either B. garinii (six patients) or B. afzelii (one patient). Species and plasmid heterogeneity as well as antigen diversity could play a role in the pathogenesis of the infection. When combined with our own earlier data, the results suggest species-related organotropism."

The authors designed an unmatched case-control study involving 294 incident cases reported to the Chester County Health Department in 1998 and 449 controls selected by random digit dialing. All case and control participants were interviewed by telephone. Age is a risk factor for Lyme disease for groups aged 10-19 years old and 50 years or older. Sex was not a risk factor. Incidence of Lyme disease in a rural setting was three times the incidence in an urban setting. Increased risk also was associated with living in single family homes, homes with yards or attached land, woods on the land, signs of tick hosts seen on the land, and homes within 100 feet of woodland. Gardening for more than four hours per week was also a risk factor, but most other outdoor activities were not. Twice as many participants took protective measures against tick bites before outdoor employment than those who merely ventured into the yard or land associated with the home. Only checking for ticks during outdoor activity and the use of repellents prior to outdoor activities outside the yard were unequivocally associated with a reduced risk of Lyme disease. It is important to increase public awareness about the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from ticks in the immediate environment of the home."

		"abstract": "The Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) has played a critical lead role over the past two years in fostering activities associated with the medical and public health response to bioterrorism. Based on a charge from Secretary Donna Shalala in 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is leading public health efforts to strengthen the nation's capacity to detect and respond to a bioterrorist event. As a result of our efforts, federal, state, and local communities are improving their public health capacities to respond to these types of emergencies. For many of us in public health, developing plans and capacities to respond to acts of bioterrorism is an extension of our long-standing roles and responsibilities. These are stated in the CDC Mission Statement: to promote health and quality of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability, and the Bioterrorism Mission: to lead the public health effort in enhancing readiness to detect and respond to bioterrorism. CDC's infectious diseases control efforts are summarized below: --Initially formed to address malaria control in 1946; --Established the epidemic Intelligence Service in 1951; --Participated in global smallpox eradication and other immunization programs; --Estimated 800-1,000 + field investigations/year since late 1990s; --New diseases: Legionnaire's Disease, toxic shock syndrome, Lyme disease, HIV, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, West Nile, etc. -- Today: focus on emerging infections and bioterrorism. Over the past 50 years, CDC has seen a decline in the incidence of some infectious diseases and an increase in some, whereas others continue to present on a more unpredictable basis (i.e., hantavirus). Outbreak identification, investigation, and control have been an integral part of what we do for more than 50 years. We estimate that 800 to 1,000 field investigations have occurred every year since the late 1990s. Today, however, we have a new focus on emerging infectious diseases and bioterrorism."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, is transmitted by the bite of Ixodes ricinus, registered in all parts of Yugoslavia. Vectors are very active in spring and early summer and the disease has a seasonal distribution. Generally speaking, there are three defined stages of the disease, but some of them can be misdiagnosed or really absent. Serological analysis of Lyme disease is very difficult to interpret, especially in later stages, so confirmation by immunoblot assays is recommended. The aim of this study was to present some epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of Lyme disease in Vojvodina in the period from 1993-1998. Throughout this period, 1.659 persons with tick bite were registered, whereas 560 with diagnosed Lyme disease have been treated at the Clinic for Infectious Diseases in Novi Sad. In 511 patients (91.25%) we registered the first stage of the disease, in 42 (7.50%) the second stage and in 7 (1.25%) the third stage of the disease. The mean age of patients with erythema migranes was 38.67 years, mean incubation period was 9.37 days, and tick was removed from the skin after 2.29 days on average. Most of the identified tick bites originated from suburban areas (50.29%), they predominantly occurred in May and June (63.01%), and most of the ticks were removed improperly (57.67%). Dominant clinical manifestations of the second stage were acute meningitis (9.52%), Bannwarth's syndrome (9.52%), arthralgia and arthritis (50%), skin lesions (14.28%), cardiac disorders (11.90%) and mild liver lesions (2.38%) and generalized lymphadenopathy (2.38%). Chronic neuroborreliosis (42.85%), acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (28.57%) and chronic arthritis were dominant clinical manifestations of the third stage. Up to 81.63% of patients with late stage of disease had a history of previous tick bite. One third of patients were asymptomatic in the first stage of the disease. Improper treatment of the first stage resulted in development of late stage disease in 57.14% of patients. Morbidity of Lyme disease in Vojvodina is about 1.98-9.8 cases on 100.000 inhabitants, and it belongs to regions with low incidence. Majority of bites are registered during summer months arround cities. Longer persistence of vector on the skin is a risk factor for manifested diseases. Inappropriately treated or completely untreated persons have higher risk for disseminated infection. In our country, most common manifestations of the second stage are neurological and articular manifestations as in the third stage. Leading symptoms and epidemiology aren't enough for diagnosis of Lyme disease, and more specific and sensitive serologic assays are necessary."

We have evaluated clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, treatment effects, and incidence variations. We included 25 patients in the study. Isolated facial palsy was often seen, but clinical manifestations showed huge variation. Fourteen of 25 (56%) patients had positive Borrelia burgdorferi-IgM and IgG titres in cerebrospinal fluid despite negative tests in serum. The mean annual incidence rate in the county judged by notified cases to the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS) was 4.4/100,000 in the period 1989-99 as compared to the national rate of 4.3/100,000 in the same period. In 1998, however, the annual incidence rate in the county was 8.8/100,000 as compared to the national rate of 4.1/100,000. The diversity of symptoms and signs suggests a liberal attitude towards serological testing including CSF analyses. Møre and Romsdal is a high incidence region for Lyme borreliosis in Norway. The annual variation in incidence might reflect a changing prevalence of the tick vector along the Norwegian coastline."

		"abstract": "Although Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, is found at the site of many disease manifestations, local infection may not explain all its features. B. burgdorferi's flagellin cross-reacts with a component of human peripheral nerve axon, previously identified as heat shock protein 60 (HSP60). The cross-reacting epitopes are bound by a monoclonal antibody to B. burgdorferi's flagellin, H9724. Addition of H9724 to neuroblastoma cell cultures blocks in vitro spontaneous and peptide growth-factor-stimulated neuritogenesis. Withdrawal of H9724 allows return to normal growth and differentiation. Using electron microscopy, immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, and FACS analysis we sought to identify the site of binding of H9724, with the starting hypotheses that the binding was intracellular and not identical to the binding site of II-13, a monoclonal anti-HSP60 antibody. The current studies show that H9724 binds to an intracellular target in cultured cells with negligible, if any, surface binding. We previously showed that sera from patients with neurological manifestations of Lyme disease bound to human axons in a pattern identical to H9724's binding; these same sera also bind to an intracellular neuroblastoma cell target. II-13 binds to a different HSP60 epitope than H9724: II-13 does not modify cellular function in vitro. As predicted, II-13 bound to mitochondria, in a pattern of cellular binding very different from H9724, which bound in a scattered cytoplasmic, nonorganelle-related pattern. H9724's effect is the first evidence that HSP60 may play a role in peptide-hormone-receptor function and demonstrates the modulatory potential of a monoclonal antibody on living cells."

Parsimony analysis of the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and a part of 16S rDNA of I. uriae from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres indicated that northern and southern I. uriae might be reproductively separated.

In the current study, an experimental model was developed to determine under what conditions immature co-feeding ticks exchange B. burgdorferi using the principal North American vector (Ixodes scapularis) and reservoir (Peromyscus leucopus) species. Experiments conducted with the density of ticks likely to be encountered in nature (8 nymphs & < 40 larvae) demonstrated that no co-feeding larvae became infected; in contrast, horizontal transmission infected 30-64% of test larvae. Only the highest densities of ticks (40 nymphs & > 200 larvae) produced infected larvae (5%) upon co-feeding of larvae and nymphs. An important role for co-feeding in the ecology of Lyme disease in North America has yet to be established."

It was predicted that the conquest of all infectious diseases was imminent. However, 50 years later, in 1999, they were still the major cause of disease worldwide, and caused nearly one third of all deaths (a total of 55.9 million). The eradication of smallpox in the 1970s and the approaching eradication of poliomyelitis represent major achievements. The prevalence of measles, pertussis and tetanus neonatorum is also markedly reduced, but still 1.5 million children in developing countries die each year because of lack of vaccines. Malaria and tuberculosis are re-emerging. Tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS are the diseases with known aetiology that cause most deaths, altogether 5 million each year. Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections cause 6.5 million deaths annually. Infections in the immunocompromised host have become a \"trade mark\" of today's advanced medicine. Almost every year, new diseases related to new micro-organisms are described; over the last 30 years, approximately 40 new diseases/micro-organisms have been diagnosed. Among the best known are HIV/AIDS, peptic ulcer caused by Helicobacter pylori, Legionnaires' disease, borreliosis (Lyme disease), hepatitis C, gastroenteritis caused by rotavirus, and Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Antimicrobial resistance development of micro-organisms has become one of the major health problems worldwide; a number of preventive measures are being introduced."

In our study antibodies to B. burgdorferi were tested in neurological patients with suspected Lyme borreliosis, depending on syndrome and clinical diagnosis. Antibodies were tested with IFT, ELISA and immunoblot. Blood samples of patients tested with IFT and ELISA tests were positive in 88 patients. Positive indirect immunofluorescence tests were found in 83 patients; in 5 patients the antibody level was borderline. Of these, 40 were positive also in ELISA but a correlation between IF titers and ELISA-positivity was not established. The immunoblot method confirmed specific antibody positivity in 36 of 88 patients (45.45%) who were positive (or borderline positive) in the indirect IF test, and in 28 of 40 (70%) ELISA-positive patients. Antibody specificity was found in 8 indirect IF-positive patients who were ELISA negative. This may be explained by the higher immunoblot sensitivity in comparison with ELISA. The Lyme borreliosis diagnosis was clinically established in 19 patients; antibodies to B. burgdorferi were only found in 13 patients in all three tests, and in 4 patients only in the indirect IF test. The results of serological tests for antibodies to B. burgdorferi should be interpreted with caution, as the tests are not standardized and may show false positive or false negative results. A two-step serological examination with the immunoblot test is recommended, whereby some nonspecific reactions may be eliminated. The results of serological tests have only supportive value and cannot be deemed conclusive when establishing an etiological diagnosis."

Accurate diagnosis is increasingly important with available disease modifying therapy. Unfortunately the rate of misdiagnosis remains around 5%-10%, indicating that 1 in 20 patients thought to have MS has, instead, a condition resembling MS. In this review we describe conditions that may be confused with MS because they can present as lesions disseminated in time, space, or both. Conditions often confused with MS may be inflammatory (systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, vasculitis, sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease), infectious (Lyme disease, syphilis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, HTLV-1 infection, herpes zoster), genetic (lysosomal disorders, adrenoleukodystrophy, mitochondrial disorders, CADASIL), metabolic (vitamin B12 deficiency), neoplastic (CNS lymphoma) and spinal (degenerative and vascular malformations) diseases. The key to the accurate diagnosis of MS is vigilance for atypical features, suggesting the possibility of an alternative diagnosis."

We review the inflammatory, vascular, neoplastic and metabolic conditions which show features similar to those of MS on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Behcet's disease, Lyme disease, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, neurosarcoidosis, Whipple's disease, listeria rhombencephalitis, Bickerstaff's brainstem encephalitis, vasculitis due to systemic lupus erythematosus, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis produce inflammatory lesions similar to those of MS in the brainstem and cerebellum. Neoplastic diseases, in particular pontine gliomas and lymphomas, can mimic MS. Vascular ischaemic lesions, either due to infarction produced by occlusion of a major posterior circulation artery or due to small vessel vasculopathy, can lead to posterior fossa lesions. The MRI changes of central pontine myelinolysis can also mimic MS. Diffuse axonal injury, radiation and chemotherapy induce lesions that resemble MS, however the clinical history will exclude these possibilities. Finally, we discuss a few conditions which are similar to MS in clinical presentation but have different MRI appearances, such as brainstem cavernomas, posterior fossa tumoural lesions, aneurysms and vascular loops producing neurovascular conflicts. Analysis of the MRI findings with clinical history and laboratory data helps to narrow down the diagnosis of the infratentorial pathology."

		"abstract": "A serosurvey of 9,673 United States military personnel was conducted to estimate infection rates with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is the cause of Lyme disease in the United States. Initial screening of sera from 9,673 military personnel on active duty in 1997 was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); supplemental testing of all ELISA-positive sera was performed by Western blot. Initial screening identified 1,594 (16.5%) ELISA-positive samples, but only 12 (0.12%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05-0.19%) were confirmed by Western blot. Antecedent serum samples collected from 1988 to 1996 were available for 7,368 (76%) subjects, accounting for 34,020 person-years of observation. Just two of the nine Western blot-positive individuals for whom antecedent samples were available seroconverted during military service for an annual incidence rate of six seroconversions per 100,000 persons (95% CI = 0.7-21.5). The risk of Lyme disease in the U.S. military population was found to be low. Although there may be sub-groups of military personnel who could potentially benefit from vaccination, force-wide use of the Lyme disease vaccine is not warranted."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is a multisystemic infectious disorder with prominent neurologic involvement, affecting both the peripheral and the central nervous system. Meningitis, cranial neuritis and radiculoneuritis are the usual manifestations in the acute phase, and peripheral neuropathy in the chronic phase. Other less common manifestations have been also described. Here we report one case of Lyme disease confirmed by PCR, with a previously undescribed neurological manifestation, and the neurophysiological studies performed before and after treatment. Our patient showed a chronic and progressive clinical picture consisting of instability on walking and distal paresthesia of lower limbs, suggestive of posterior column disfunction. The neurophysiological exam performed prior to treatment with ceftriaxone revealed bilateral absence of lower limbs somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), without alterations in the distal nervous conduction or in upper limbs SEPs. The exam performed after treatment revealed a partial recovery of lower limb SEP with presence of an evoked response in SEP of left lower limb, coincident with a transitory clinical improvement of paresthesia in the same extremity. Our findings reveal that posterior column disfunction can be a neurological manifestation of Lyme disease. Furthermore the neurophysiological study shows that this manifestation is partially reversible following treatment. Our study emphasize the importance of the neurophysiological tests for the diagnosis and follow up of neurological manifestations of Lyme disease."

In the NHP model of Lyme neuroborreliosis, spirochetal density in the nervous system and other tissues has been measured by polymerase chain reaction and correlated to anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid and to inflammation in tissues. Despite the demonstrable presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, only minor inflammation of the central nervous system occurs, though inflammation can be demonstrated in other tissues. Infected animals also develop anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum, although increased amplitude of antibody is not predictive of higher levels of infection. The NHP model continues to provide important insight into the disease process in humans."

Eight species were collected, including cotton mouse, hispid cotton rat, eastern woodrat, marsh rice rat, white-footed mouse, eastern harvest mouse, golden mouse, and black rat. Of the 1,514 ticks recovered from these hosts, Ixodes minor Neumann, including larvae, nymphs, and adults, was the most abundant species, representing 54% of the total. Only immature stages of other tick species were found, including larvae and nymphs of Dermacentor variabilis (Say), Amblyomma maculatum Koch, Ixodes affinis Neumann, and Ixodes scapularis Say. All 5 tick species parasitized cotton mice, cotton rats, and woodrats, which were the most important small mammal hosts for ticks at the localities studied. Rice rats were hosts of A. maculatum, D. variabilis, and L. minor. Amblyomma maculatum was more strongly associated with cotton rats than other rodent species. Ixodes scapularis was most strongly associated with cotton mice, and I. minor was more strongly associated with both woodrats and cotton mice than other species of rodents. Ixodes minor parasitized hosts in the Coastal Zone only, where among spirochete-infected hosts, it was present in significantly greater numbers than other ticks. Furthermore, I. minor was the only tick species that showed a statistically significant positive association with spirochetal infection in rodents. More I. affinis parasitized spirochete-infected hosts than I. scapularis, but fewer than I. minor. The findings discussed herein provide evidence that implicates I. minor as the possible primary enzootic vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt and Brenner in the Coastal Zone of South Carolina. They also indicate that the high level of B. burgdorferi infection in rodents from this region may be a function of the combined involvement of I. minor, I. affinis, and I. scapularis in the enzootic transmission of the spirochete."

Based on the assembled results by means of discrimination analysis and logistic regression the most suitable combinations of antigens for evaluation of immunoblots in different genotypes were determined.

Borrelia burgdorferi, which is the etiology of LD, is a spirochete and, as such, may share the potential for causing fetal infection, which may occur in the setting of maternal spirochetemia. Information concerning the effects of gestational LD derives from case reports and series, epidemiologic studies, and experimental animal models. Although provocative, these studies fail to define a characteristic teratogenic effect. However, skin and cardiac involvement have predominated in some reports. Pregnancy wastage has been suggested primarily by animal studies. Gestational LD appears to be associated with a low risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, particularly with appropriated antibiotic therapy. Suggestions for management of clinical situations are presented."

The present study was conducted to determine the phenotypes of ex vivo lymph node cells obtained from infected mice of both strains at this time point. The percentages of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), TCRalpha/beta (+) and TCRgamma/delta (+) cells decreased in both strains of mice compared to LN from naive mice. In contrast, there was a threefold increase in the proportion of CD19(+) cells. In view of this expansion of the B cell proportion, we examined the ability of purified CD19(+) cells and CD43(+) cells to produce both IL-10 and IFN-gamma when the cells were restimulated in vitro with B. burgdorferi freeze-thawed spirochetes. As expected, CD43(+) cells were able to produce both cytokines, but not IL-4. Surprisingly, CD19(+) (B) cells also were able to produce IFN-gamma in comparable amounts, in addition to IL-10. Intracellular staining of CD19(+) cells with anti-IFN-gamma antibody confirmed this finding. We discuss this novel phenomenon in terms of its possible underlying mechanisms and its relevance, both in the context of the immunology of Lyme disease and that of other infectious diseases."

Twelve of these patients had normal MRI, including the more sensitive fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence, 10 had primarily punctate and subcortical lesions, and one patient had multiple periventricular lesions. In a portion of patients with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, white-matter hyperintensities tend to occur in subcortical arteriolar watershed areas and are not specific. Magnetization transfer ratio analysis did not provide evidence for structural abnormalities of the brain parenchyma in patients with nonfocal disease."

		"abstract": "An association between Borrelia burgdorferi and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (CBCL) has been made in several European countries. The evidence in favor of such an association has recently been based on more definitive tests for the pathogenetic role of B. burgdorferi in CBCL, including positive cultures or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of borrelial DNA from lesional skin. However, there is only one report of B. burgdorferi in four North American cases of B-cell lymphoma. We retrieved 38 cases of primary and secondary CBCL from different geographic regions of the United States. Two separate techniques were used to detect borrelial DNA by PCR, a nested PCR method to amplify a B. burgdorferi-specific gene as well as a borrelial chromosomal Ly-1 clone amplification method. Southern blot hybridization was used for confirmation of the PCR results. No B. burgdorferi-specific DNA was detected in any of the 38 CBCL cases, whereas detectable PCR products were obtained with our positive controls. Our findings, in light of previous studies, suggest that B. burgdorferi plays a minimal role in the development or pathogenesis of CBCL in the United States. The findings also suggest that the geographic variations in the clinical manifestations of B. burgdorferi are indeed real and may be secondary to the genetic and phenotypic differences between B. burgdorferi strains present in Europe and North America."

Two common LD management problems are antibiotic prophylaxis of deer tick bites (deer ticks may carry Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes LD) and antibiotic treatment of erythema migrans, the pathognomonic rash of LD. A 1-page questionnaire was sent to a 13% (573/4300) sample of Connecticut physicians to define how they treat deer tick bites and erythema migrans. Questionnaires were returned by 320 (56%) of 573 physicians. Questionnaires were analyzed for the 267 physicians who saw patients with LD. Seventy (26%) of the 267 surveyed physicians prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis for patients with tick bites. B burgdorferi serology was ordered by 31% of physicians for patients with tick bites. Most surveyed physicians treated erythema migrans with doxycycline or amoxicillin for a mean of 21 days. Serology was ordered by 49% of physicians for patients with erythema migrans. Most physicians did not use prophylaxis for patients with deer tick bites. In addition, most of the physicians surveyed followed established guidelines for treating patients with erythema migrans. However, many of the physicians surveyed do serologic testing for patients with tick bites and/or erythema migrans. Serologic testing for these patients is usually not necessary."

According to the US Centers for Disease Control, the incidence of Lyme disease in the US has increased 25-fold since national surveillance began and the geographical spread of Lyme disease causing spirochetes would indicate that the annual number of cases will continue to rise. Humoral immunity has been shown to play a role in protection and this has spurred efforts towards developing a Lyme disease vaccine. A number of protective immunogens have been characterised to date, but due to the heterogeneity of Lyme disease Borreliae, no single molecule has proven to be completely effective as a vaccinogen. This review will describe the immunogens that have been used to protect against B. burgdorferi infection, with a focus on the inherent challenges involved with providing successful immunity to B. burgdorferi. In addition, the promising aspects and the limitations of each protective immunogen will be discussed."

		"abstract": "The orientation of an immobilized antigen is important for recognition by, e.g., an antibody. When noncovalent passive adsorption is used for immobilization, the number of ways that the antigen can attach to the surface is numerous and control of how the antigen orientates on the surface is limited. Covalent immobilization restricts the number of the ways that the antigen can be immobilized to the number of reactive groups on the antigen and, hence, the orientation of the immobilized antigen is more predictable. Peptide antigens were synthesized and purified with protection groups on the lysine and cysteine side chains. These peptides, which have only one good nucleophilic group (the N-terminal alpha-amino group), were immobilized covalently in microtiter plates supplied with tresyl groups on the surface and the protection groups were cleaved off in situ after immobilization. The controlled orientation of these peptides resulted in enhanced recognition by antibodies in general. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of antibodies against a peptide derived from outer surface protein C from Borrelia burgdorferi, found in Lyme borreliosis patients, was established using this strategy. Lyme borreliosis suspect patient sera showed up to a 10-fold increase in the signal when the orientation of the peptide antigen was controlled by the in situ deprotection strategy."

Nineteen consecutive patients were included and trends between the degree of hearing recovery and serum/CSF pathology and given therapy were examined. The pilot study showed a high prevalence (68%) of pathology in serum and CSF in patients with SHL. In 54% of the patients, elevated levels of CSF proteins and/or pathological CSF cell counts were present without positive antibodies to Bb. Positive levels of antibodies against Bb or pathological proteins in CSF were associated with better hearing recovery (means of 47.2 and 51.7%, respectively). The audiometric configuration \"high frequency sloping\" hearing impairment was associated with the lowest degree of hearing recovery. Patients with SHL and positive serology to Bb who received antibiotic treatment (oral tetracycline), with or without steroids, had the best hearing recovery in this study (61.7 and 48.4%, respectively). In conclusion, we found a high prevalence of serum and CSF pathology in a consecutive group of patients with SHL. Early appropriate antibiotic treatment may prevent the development of major late complications of Lyme disease/borreliosis. We also find it justified to perform more general serological analyses, including CSF analysis, in patients with SHL. A more liberal approach to testing and development of test protocols for SHL patients will increase our knowledge in this field."

Unlike conserved regions of other proteins involved in antigenic variation, the most conserved invariable region of VlsE is immunodominant in Lyme-disease patients. Physicochemical analyses of pure recombinant VlsE yielded the following results: The protein appeared oligomeric in solution, with a secondary structure dominated by alpha-helices. Thermal denaturation (pH 7) probed by calorimetry involved two transitions: oligomer-to-monomer conversion (around 40 degrees C) followed by protein unfolding (55 +/- 1 degrees C). Chemical denaturation monitored by far-UV circular dichroism (20 degrees C, pH 7) sensed only polypeptide unfolding and took place in a single transition (Delta G(U)(H(2)O) = 23 +/- 2 kJ/mol). VlsE did not adopt a native structure at pH 3; at pH 10 the stability was significantly reduced. Knowledge of biophysical properties of VlsE may aid in understanding the mechanism of VlsE antigenic variation in B. burgdorferi."

The specificity of this approach was evaluated among residents of a LD-endemic community and was compared with WB alone and with a simplified 2-test approach (WB of equivocal EIA only). Participants reporting no previous diagnosis of LD were recruited during a community-wide serosurvey on Block Island, Rhode Island. Of 80 eligible participants, 20 had received LD vaccine. Seven (35%) of 20 vaccinees and 22 (37%) of 60 nonvaccinees reported nonspecific symptoms compatible with LD in the previous year.

Information obtained for each dog included place of residence, Lyme disease vaccination status, history of travel and tick exposure, signalment, and medical history. Serum samples were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by an immunoblot procedure. Seroprevalence by county ranged 0-40%, with the highest estimates from west-central Wisconsin. The spatial pattern was significantly correlated with human incidence of Lyme disease and with abundance of the tick vector, Ixodes scapularis. A geographic information system (GIS) was used to integrate environmental data with the location of the residences of the dogs to determine environmental risk factors. Seropositivity among dogs was positively associated with increased tick exposure and time spent outdoors and negatively associated with vaccination against Lyme disease. Seropositivity was also associated with living in forested and urban areas, and on sandy, fertile soils. A canine surveillance system is a useful method for assessing the geographic distribution of Lyme disease, and in combination with a GIS, it can be effective in determining environmental factors associated with I. scapularis endemicity."

Over each of nine consecutive years, incidence rates from 57 New York State counties were subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis. Although the epidemic advanced during the study period, the analyses reveal a consistent pattern of spatial dependence. The correlation distance, the distance over which incidence rates covary positively, remained near 120 km over the nine years. A local spatial analysis around Westchester County, a major disease focus, indicated that the global correlation distance matched the extent of the most intense local clustering; statistically weaker clustering extended to 200 km from Westchester. Analyzing the spatial character of the epidemic may reveal the epizootic processes underlying patterns in human infection, and may help identify a spatial scale for regional control of disease."

The clinical presentation is often similar to that of reactive arthritis (ReA) and other spondylarthropathies or to Lyme arthritis. We therefore determined how often Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) can be identified in patients with UOA, by using an extensive laboratory approach. We prospectively studied 52 patients with UOA who presented at an early synovitis clinic in a region highly endemic for Lyme disease. Patients were examined by standardized clinical and immunoserologic procedures. Synovial fluid was screened for the presence of Ct and Bb DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Urine was tested for Ct DNA by ligase chain reaction, and serum was tested for Ct antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Bb antibodies by hemagglutination test and Western blotting. PCR results in the UOA patients were compared with the results in cohorts of patients with definite rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Lyme arthritis, and Chlamydia-induced arthritis (CIA). In the synovial fluid of 9 of 52 patients with UOA (17%), we found Ct DNA, and in 6 of the 52 patients (12%), Bb DNA was found. The frequency of bacteria-specific DNA was 50% (7 of 14) in CIA patients and 69% (11 of 16) in patients with Lyme arthritis. No Bb or Ct DNA was found in the synovial fluid of the 31 RA patients. With optimized PCR protocols, it is possible to detect considerable levels of Bb and Ct DNA in the synovial fluid of patients with UOA. Although the presence of bacterial DNA does not unequivocally prove its etiologic significance, we suggest that at least one-third of patients with UOA may have a form of ReA that involves asymptomatic primary infection."

		"abstract": "The three genospecies Borrelia burgdorferi, Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia afzelii, all causative agents of Lyme disease, differ in their susceptibilities to human complement-mediated lysis. We recently reported that serum resistance of borrelias correlates largely with their ability to bind the human complement regulators FHL-1/reconectin and factor H. To date, two complement regulator-acquiring-proteins (CRASP-1 and CRASP-2) have been identified in serum-resistant B. afzelii isolates (P. Kraiczy, C. Skerka, M. Kirschfink, V. Brade, and P. F. Zipfel, Eur. J. Immunol. 31:1674-1684, 2001). Here, we present a comprehensive study of the CRASPs detectable in both serum-resistant and intermediate serum-sensitive B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi isolates. These CRASPs were designated according to the genospecies either as BaCRASPs, when derived from B. afzelii, or as BbCRASPs, for proteins identified in B. burgdorferi isolates. Each borrelial isolate expresses distinct CRASPs that can be differentiated by their mobility and binding phenotypes. A detailed comparison reveals overlapping and even identical binding profiles for BaCRASP-1 (27.5 kDa), BbCRASP-1 (25.9 kDa), and BbCRASP-2 (23.2 kDa), which bind FHL-1/reconectin strongly and interact weakly with factor H. In contrast, two B. afzelii proteins (BaCRASP-4 [19.2 kDa] and BaCRASP-5 [22.5 kDa]) and three B. burgdorferi proteins (BbCRASP-3 [19.8 kDa], BbCRASP-4 [18.5 kDa], and BbCRASP-5 [17.7 kDa]) bind factor H but not FHL-1/reconectin. Most CRASPs bind both human immune regulators at their C-terminal ends. Temperature-dependent up-regulation of CRASPs (BaCRASP-1, BaCRASP-2, and BaCRASP-5) is detected in low-passage borrelias cultured at 33 or 37 degrees C compared with those cultured at 20 degrees C. The characterization of the individual CRASPs on the molecular level is expected to identify new virulence factors and potential vaccine candidates."

During the acute illness, a median of 4 days after the onset of erythema migrans, 51% of the patients had proliferative cellular responses and 72% had antibody responses to at least one of the borrelial antigens tested. During convalescence, at the conclusion of antibiotic therapy, 64% of the patients had proliferative cellular reactivity and 95% had antibody reactivity with at least one of the spirochetal antigens tested. In both acute- and convalescent-phase samples, cellular immune responses were found as frequently to OspA as to OspC and FlaB. Although antibody responses were also frequently seen to OspC and FlaB, only a few patients had marginal antibody reactivity with OspA. The percentage of patients with proliferative responses was similar in those with clinical evidence of localized or disseminated infection, whereas humoral reactivity was found more often in those with disseminated disease. We conclude that cellular and humoral responses to B. burgdorferi antigens are often found among patients with early Lyme disease. In contrast with the other antigens tested, cellular but not humoral reactivity was often found with OspA."

		"abstract": "C3H/He mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi develop severe arthritis and are high antibody responders, while infected C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice develop mild arthritis and less robust humoral responses. Genetic analysis using composite interval mapping (CIM) on reciprocal backcross populations derived from C3H/HeN and C57BL/6N or C3H/HeJ and BALB/cAnN mice identified 12 new quantitative trait loci (QTL) linked to 10 murine Lyme disease phenotypes. These QTL reside on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. A reanalysis of an F(2) intercross between C57BL/6N and C3H/HeN mice using CIM identified two new QTL on chromosomes 4 and 15 and confirmed the location of seven previously identified loci. Two or more experimental crosses independently verified six QTL controlling phenotypes after B. burgdorferi infection. Additionally, Bb2 on chromosome 5 was reproduced in four experimental populations and was linked to the candidate locus Cora1. Evidence of four distinct QTL residing within the 30-cM region of chromosome 5 encompassing the previously mapped Bb2 and Bb3 loci was shown by CIM. Interestingly, some alleles contributing to susceptibility to Lyme arthritis were derived from C57BL/6N and BALB/cAnN mice, showing that disease-resistant strains harbor susceptibility alleles."

		"abstract": "Recently, a number of refinements in diagnostic modalities for detection of Borrelia burgdorferi infection have been developed. These include large-volume blood cultures, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, and 2-stage serologic testing. In the present study, we compared 6 diagnostic modalities in 47 adult patients who had a clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans. Quantitative PCR on skin biopsy-derived material was the most sensitive diagnostic method (80.9%), followed by 2-stage serologic testing of convalescent-phase samples (66.0%), conventional nested PCR (63.8%), skin culture (51.1%), blood culture (44.7%), and serologic testing of acute-phase samples (40.4%). Results of all assays were negative for 3 patients (6.4%). We conclude that the clinical diagnosis of erythema migrans is highly accurate in an area where B. burgdorferi is endemic if it is made by experienced health care personnel, but some patients with this diagnosis may not have B. burgdorferi infection. No single diagnostic modality is suitable for detection of B. burgdorferi in every patient with erythema migrans."

Because of the possibility of cross-reactions, sera were also tested for different serological strains of Leptospira interrogans and L. biflexa using microscopic sera agglutination test. Twenty-three of 237 (9.7%) serum samples were positive in the ELISA; 20 of them (86.9%) were confirmed by the Western blotting, what suggests that Cotia may be a risk area for Lyme disease. Although 4 samples (1.7%) were positive for Lyme disease and leptospirosis, no correlation was found between the results (X(2) = 0.725; p = 0.394) what suggests absence of serological cross reactivity."

In laboratory experiments, however, they failed to transmit B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. In this study, carried out from 1994 to 1996, we determined the seroprevalences of B. burgdorferi (1.2%), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (7%), E. phagocytophila (0%), Rickettsia rickettsii (0%), R. typhi (0%), Coxiella burneti (0%), Francisella tularensis (0%), and Babesia microti (0%) by standard serological methods for 325 residents (97% of the total population) of Gibson Island, coastal Maryland, USA, where 15% of the residents reported having had Lyme disease within a recent 5-year span. Of the 167 seronegative individuals who were followed up prospectively for 235 person-years of observation, only 2 (0.85%) seroconverted for B. burgdorferi. Of 1556 ticks submitted from residents, 95% were identified as Lone Star ticks; only 3% were deer ticks (Ixodes dammini), the main American vector of Lyme disease. B. burgdorferi s.s. infected 20% of host-seeking immature deer ticks, and borreliae (\"B. lonestari\") were detected in 1-2% of Lone Star ticks. Erythema migrans was noted in 65% of self-reports of Lyme disease, but many such reports indicated that the rash was present while the tick was still attached, suggesting a reaction to the bite itself rather than true Lyme disease. Sera from individuals reporting Lyme disease generally failed to react to B. burgdorferi or any other pathogen antigens. The residents of Gibson Island had an exaggerated perception of the risk of Lyme disease because they were intensely infested with an aggressively human-biting and irritating nonvector tick. In addition, a Lyme disease mimic of undescribed etiology (named Masters' disease) seems to be associated with Lone Star ticks, and may confound Lyme disease surveillance. The epidemiological and entomological approach used in this study might fruitfully be applied wherever newly emergent tickborne zoonoses have been discovered."

		"abstract": "Ixodes spinipalpis maintains Borrelia bissettii spirochetes in Colorado in a cycle involving wood rats and deer mice. This tick has been described as nidicolous, remaining either attached to its rodent hosts or in the rodent nest. Nidicolous ticks pose little risk of pathogen transmission to humans if they do not actively quest for hosts. To investigate the questing potential of I. spinipalpis, sentinel mice were placed in an area where I. spinipalpis had been commonly found on wood rats and deer mice. Concurrently, wild rodent populations were trapped and analyzed for Lyme disease spirochetes, the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (aoHGE), and Babesia microti. A total of 122 I. spinipalpis larvae and 10 nymphs were found on 19% of 244 sentinel mice. In addition, 4 sentinel mice became infested with Malaraeus telchinus or Orchopeas neotomae fleas. Questing I. spinipalpis were positively associated with woody shrubs and negatively associated with sunny and grassy areas. Four sentinel mice became infected with aoHGE after having been fed upon only by I. spinipalpis larvae. One sentinel mouse became infected with B. bissettii after having an I. spinipalpis nymph feed on it, and one sentinel mouse became coinfected with aoHGE and B. bissettii after it was fed upon by a single I. spinipalpis nymph. These sentinel mouse conversions suggest the possibility that the aoHGE is transovarially transmitted by I. spinipalpis, and that I. spinipalpis is capable of simultaneously transmitting B. bissettii and the aoHGE. The findings that I. spinipalpis quest away from rodent nests and will attach to and infect sentinel mice may be of public health importance. It suggests the potential transmission of the agents of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and Lyme disease to other hosts by I. spinipalpis, in regions of the western United States where Ixodes pacificus is not found."

We also used an indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) test to study the presence of antibodies to the HGE agent in 147 human serum samples including patients with Lyme disease (LD), forestry workers, and persons with history of previous tick bite. Fifty serum samples from healthy people resident in urban areas and with no history of tick-bite disorder and without tick exposure were used as controls. Four of 76 adults and 49 of 203 nymphs pools carried E. phagocytophila DNA. This result, and the finding of 1.4% of sera reacting in the IFI test confirms that this tick-borne agent is present in La Rioja, and that humans show evidence of contact with it.

The clinical picture of Lyme disease is characterized by the variety of tissue and organ involvement and differing severity of symptoms. One of the pathogenic symptoms of early Lyme disease is a skin lesion called erythema migrans. The purpose of our research was to estimate the parameters of the antioxidant system and the concentration of lipid peroxidation products in the plasma of patients with erythema migrans (EM). The parameters measured included the activity levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) according to Sykes, gluthatione reductase (GSSG-R) according to Mize and Langdon, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) according to Paglia and Valentine; the concentrations of malondialdehyde (MDA) were examined by means of a Bioxytech LPO-586 kit. The total sulphydryl groups (-SH) according to Ellman and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured using a Bioxytech GSH-400 test in plasma samples collected from 20 patients with EM aged from 19 to 50, taken before (examination 1) and after (examination 2) therapy with amoxycycline. The control group consisted of 8 healthy people. The results of our examinations prove that beta-lactamase antibiotic therapy brings non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters to control values, though the treatment causes no change in enzymatic antioxidant parameters, resulting in the further activation of free radicals. In patients with Erythema migrans, the decreased capability to reduce lipid superoxidants leads to maintaining a high concentration of membrane lipid peroxidation products."

Our objective, therefore, was to determine the efficacy of and develop interpretive criteria for an immunoblot antibody test for diagnosing acute human babesiosis using a Babesia microti whole-cell lysate as the antigen. We compared the reactivity of sera to a B. microti immunoblot assay in 24 human subjects experiencing symptoms and expressing laboratory evidence of babesiosis, 28 subjects who experienced Lyme disease, 12 subjects who experienced human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and 51 subjects who reported no history of any of these diseases and whose sera did not react against B. microti antigen in an IFA test. Immunoblot strips were impregnated with proteins derived from the GI strain of B. microti that had been electrophoresed in an acrylamide sodium dodecyl sulfate gel, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. The sera of all subjects who experienced babesiosis reacted against the B. microti antigen in the IFA and against at least one of nine immunoblot protein bands specific to B. microti. In contrast, none of the sera from people who appeared not to have experienced this infection reacted against the B. microti antigen in the IFA (compared to 4% in the immunoblot assay). When two reactive bands were considered as definitive, immunoblot test sensitivity was 96%, while specificity was 99% and predictive positivity and predictive negativity were 96 and 99%, respectively. Our B. microti immunoblot procedure shows promise as a sensitive, specific, and reproducible assay for routine clinical diagnosis of acute babesiosis."

An identity of 92 to 93% was observed in the flaA sequences of the different species. Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant FlaA (rFlaA) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and used as antigens in Western blotting (WB) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In immunoglobulin G (IgG) WB, 71% (10 of 14) of the sera from neuroborreliosis and 86% (12 of 14) of those from Lyme arthritis patients reacted with one to three rFlaAs. In IgG ELISA, 74% (14 of 19) and 79% (15 of 19) of patients with neuroborreliosis and arthritis, respectively, were positive. The immunoreactivity in local European patient sera was stronger against rFlaA from B. garinii and B. afzelii than against rFlaA from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Neither IgG nor IgM ELISA was sensitive in the serodiagnosis of erythema migrans. Serum samples from patients with syphilis and systemic lupus erythematosus showed mild cross-reactivity in IgG tests. Sera from Yersinia enterocolitica or beta-hemolytic Streptococcus infections showed only occasional responses. With IgM ELISA, 58% (11 of 19) and 37% (7 of 19) of patients with neuroborreliosis and arthritis, respectively, were positive. Cross-reactive antibodies to FlaA, especially in serum samples from patients with rheumatoid factor positivity and Epstein-Barr virus infection, reduced the specificity of IgM serodiagnosis. Therefore, rFlaA seems to have a limited role for IgM serodiagnosis, yet rFlaA might be useful in the IgG serodiagnosis of disseminated Lyme borreliosis."

Ixodes persulcatus ticks were obtained in a Tianchi Lake valley with primary forest, while the tick fauna was poor in the semidesert or at higher altitudes in this region. Species identities were confirmed by molecular analysis in which an internal transcribed spacer sequence was used. Of 55 adult ticks, 22 (40%) were positive for spirochetes as determined by Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly culture passages. In addition, some rodents, including Apodemus uralensis (5 of 14 animals) and Cricetulus longicaudatus (the only animal examined), and some immature stages of I. persulcatus (4 of 11 ticks) that had fed on A. uralensis were positive for spirochetes. Based on 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies, 35 cultures (including double isolation cultures) were identified as Borrelia garinii (20 isolates, including 9 Eurasian pattern B isolates and 11 Asian pattern C isolates), Borrelia afzelii (10 pattern D isolates), and mixed cultures (5 cultures, including isolates that produced B. garinii patterns B and C plus B. afzelii pattern D). These findings revealed that Lyme disease pathogens are distributed in the mountainous areas in northwestern China even though it is an arid region, and they also confirmed the specific relationship between I. persulcatus and genetic patterns of Borrelia spp. on the Asian continent."

A fragment of the flagellin gene sequence was amplified with the TaqMan chemistry using primers and a probe common to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana. A recombinant plasmid containing the chromosomal gene coding for the flagellin protein was used as standard. The specificity of the assay was documented with 48 different clinically relevant Borrelia burgdorferi strains. No cross-reaction occurred with unrelated bacteria, viruses and fungi. At an analytic sensitivity of 10 copies, excellent precision within runs and between runs was observed. The potential presence of inhibitors of the Taq DNA polymerase was monitored by spiking aliquots of each sample with a plasmid containing the target sequence. Among 56 cerebrospinal fluid samples taken from 54 patients with clinical suspicion of neuroborreliosis, one (1.8%) tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA. Borrelia burgdorferi DNA was also detected in five (17.9%) of 28 synovial fluid specimens and in one (20%) of five synovial membrane biopsies obtained from 31 patients with arthropathies. In order to test for the absence of false-positive results, 84 samples from 83 patients without evidence of Lyme disease were investigated. None of these samples showed measurable amounts of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA. By its established features, such as speed, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, the inclusion of carryover prevention and the monitoring of inhibitors in individual test tubes, this real-time PCR assay has proved to be a potent tool for the detection of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA under routine conditions in diagnostic laboratories."

The control sera from reference labs represented various disease problems. All nine HIV-1 positive plasma had antibody to between two and five milk proteins. All nine HIV-1 positive plasma had antibody to albumin and immunoglobulin (IgG); in addition, seven reacted with butyrophilin, five with alpha-lactalbumin, six with casein. Four of the control sera had no antibody to milk proteins; three had minor reactivity to casein and two, one diagnosed as an IgM Lyme positive, one diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori detected three and four milk proteins. None of the control sera had antibody to albumin or alpha-lactalbumin. Bovine and human albumin have almost identical sequence, and antibody generated to bovine serum albumin could react with human serum albumin. To look at this, three of the HIV-1 positive plasmas were assayed with 2-D Western blots of human milk and did have reactivity with albumin and IgG. Also, the protein butyrophilin is highly immunogenic and has significant homology with human neural and cellular proteins. Whether these antibodies can be causing allergy or autoimmune disease is speculative, but they indicate an immune system which is highly activated."

However also the main rickettsial infections transmitted by ticks are reported together the hemorragic fevers transmitted by such arthropods. In particular it is exhaustively analysed the Mediterranean tick fever in consideration of its presence in some regions of Italy and of the wrong opinion of considering this pathology not very severe. Lastly has been included a treatment about some emergent infections transmitted by ticks, like as the ehrlichiosis and babesiasis, but also the mention of tularaemia that can be considered a re-emergent infection, also in consideration of the epidemic focus now present in Kossovo. The above-mentioned pathologies are analysed also as regards the laboratory diagnosis (direct and serologic methods), the therapeutic treatment and the prophilaxis, both directed against the arthropods vectors and that of individual type, employing also some vaccines, when disposable."

In addition to frequently recognized manifestations such as erythema migrans, neuroborreliosis, and Lyme arthritis, rarer manifestations, including eye and ear disease, are increasingly understood. Clinical diagnosis is supported by serologic confirmation. Improvement of laboratory methodology, especially polymerase chain reaction-based tests, is continuing. Actual treatment recommendations based on controlled studies reflect expanding scientific knowledge. In the United States, license of a vaccine to prevent infection in children is awaited. Lyme borreliosis is an intriguing human example of bacterial persistence in the presence of the host immune system. Chronic Lyme arthritis is a model of chronic arthritis resembling forms of arthritis of unknown cause, such as rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis."

Our analysis of the asymptomatic infections diagnosed serologically in a recent OspA vaccine trial conducted in the United States (N Engl J Med 1998;339: 209-215), suggests that the natural history of this event is more benign than that reported for untreated patients with erythema migrans (Ann Intern Med 1987;107: 725-731). We hypothesize that this is due either to incorrect diagnosis since the specificity of the serologic criteria used to diagnose asymptomatic infection in the vaccine study is unknown, or to infection with non-pathogenic strains of B. burgdorferi. Increasing evidence indicates that the invasive potential of strains of B. burgdorferi varies according to the specific subtype. Theoretically, a serologic testing method could be devised which would distinguish infection with invasive versus non-invasive strains of B. burgdorferi, and allow testing of the second hypothesis."

In this study, the cellular immune response to B. burgdorferi and the major outer surface proteins OspC and Osp17 was investigated in children during the course of early disseminated B. burgdorferi infection. Lymphoproliferative responses to recombinant proteins were compared to the protein-specific humoral immune reaction. OspC induced a clear antibody response but elicited an even stronger cellular immune response. In contrast, a cellular as well as humoral immune reaction to Osp17 was only rarely detected. Follow-up examinations demonstrated that the lymphoproliferative response to B. burgdorferi and OspC persisted for several months after antibiotic therapy. Here, we show that in early disseminated Lyme disease of childhood, OspC is a potent antigen influencing both the humoral and cellular immunity, while Osp17 plays only a minor role in immune activation."

Borrelia strains were isolated from blood of 70 patients with Lyme borreliosis, including 10 patients from whom borreliae were also isolated from skin. The aim of the present study was to characterise the isolates with regard to their phenotypic and genotypic characteristics. Borreliae were cultivated in MKP medium. Species identification and plasmid profiles were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and protein profiles by SDS-PAGE. Digestion of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA showed 63 (90%) B. afzelii Mla1 and 7 (10%) B. garinii Mlg2. No B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were isolated. Borreliae were isolated from both skin and blood of 10 patients, nine pairs of isolates were identical: seven B. afzelii and two B. garinii. B. afzelii was isolated from the skin and B. garinii from blood of the tenth patient. All but one isolate possessed at least one large plasmid and varying numbers of smaller plasmids. Eight (11.4%) of 70 isolates possessed an unusual plasmid profile (2 of 63 B. afzelii and 6 of 7 B. garinii). Borreliae differed in their protein profiles. OspA and OspB proteins were expressed by all B. afzelii isolates; 85.7% of B. garinii isolates expressed OspA and 71.4% expressed OspB. OspC was expressed by 65% of B. afzelii isolates and all B. garinii isolates. The ratios of B. afzelii and B. garinii isolated from blood and skin were similar. These results do not support the hypothesis that B. garinii has a higher propensity for haematogenous dissemination than B. afzelii. Antigen diversity as well as species and plasmid heterogeneity could play a role in the pathogenesis of the infection, suggesting distinctive strain organotropism."

		"abstract": "Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) with separate preparations of 10 purified recombinant antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto were used to test sera from 36 dogs not vaccinated with whole cells of this agent and from five dogs vaccinated with whole-cell B. burgdorferi bacteria. All dogs lived in tick-infested areas of Connecticut and south-eastern New York state, USA. The non-vaccinated dogs had limb or joint disorder, lameness and fever during the period 1984-1991 and had antibodies to B. burgdorferi, as determined by a polyvalent ELISA with whole-cell antigen. In re-analyses of sera for total immunoglobulins in ELISAs with recombinant antigens, reactions were most frequently recorded when outer-surface protein (Osp) F, protein (p)35, p37, p39 and p-41G (a flagellin component) were tested separately. Western immunoblots of a subset of 16 sera, positive by ELISA with whole-cell antigen and representing a range of antibody titres (640-40960), verified immune responses to these or other lysed whole-cell antigens. Sera from vaccinated dogs contained antibodies to OspA, OspB, p22, p37 and p41-G. Therefore, serological reactions to OspF, p35 and p39 were the most important indicators of natural exposure to B. burgdorferi. Serum reactivities to these recombinant antigens in ELISAs can be used to help identify possible natural infections of canine borreliosis in dogs not vaccinated with whole-cell B. burgdorferi and to provide information on the geographic distribution of this bacterium."

		"abstract": "Expression and recombination of the antigenic variation vlsE gene of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi were analyzed in the tick vector. To assess vlsE expression, Ixodes scapularis nymphs infected with the B. burgdorferi strain B31 were fed on mice for 48 or 96 h or to repletion and then crushed and acetone fixed either immediately thereafter (ticks collected at the two earlier time points) or 4 days after repletion. Unfed nymphs also were examined. At all of the time points investigated, spirochetes were able to bind a rabbit antibody raised against the conserved invariable region 6 of VlsE, as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence, but not preimmune serum from the same rabbit. This same antibody also bound to B31 spirochetes cultivated in vitro. Intensity of fluorescence appeared highest in cultured spirochetes, followed by spirochetes present in unfed ticks. Only a dim fluorescent signal was observed on spirochetes at the 48 and 96 h time points and at day 4 postrepletion. Expression of vlsE in vitro was affected by a rise in pH from 7.0 to 8.0 at 34 degrees C. Hence, vlsE expression appears to be sensitive to environmental cues of the type found in the B. burgdorferi natural history. To assess vlsE recombination, nymphs were capillary fed the B. burgdorferi B31 clonal isolate 5A3. Ticks thus infected were either left to rest for 4 weeks (Group I) or fed to repletion on a mouse (Group II). The contents of each tick from both groups were cultured and 10 B. burgdorferi clones from the spirochetal isolate of each tick were obtained. The vlsE cassettes from several of these clones were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Regardless of whether the isolate was derived from Group I or Group II ticks, no changes were observed in the vlsE sequence. In contrast, vlsE cassettes amplified from B. burgdorferi clones derived from a mouse that was infected with B31-5A3 capillary-fed nymphs showed considerable recombination. It follows that vlsE recombination does not occur in the tick vector."

		"abstract": "A survey was performed for Lyme disease borrelia in the southern part of China, in Zhejiang, Sichuan and Anhui provinces, along the Yangtze River valley, in May of 1997 and 1998. Twenty isolates from Ixodes granulatus, Ixodes ovatus, Apodemus agrarius and Niviventer confucianus were obtained. These isolates were characterized by RFLP of the 5S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer, sequence analysis of the intergenic spacer, 16S rDNA and flagellin gene, DNA-DNA hybridization analysis, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with mAbs. Six isolates from A. agrarius, five from I. granulatus collected in Zhejiang province and one from N. confucianus in Sichuan province were highly similar to strains 10MT and 5MT isolated in Korea and classified as Borrelia valaisiana. Four isolates from A. agrarius and I. granulatus collected in Zhejiang province generated unique RFLP patterns and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rDNA and flagellin gene sequences suggested that the isolates should be classified as B. valaisiana. Furthermore, three isolates (CMN1a, CNM2, CMN3T) from N. confucianus captured in Sichuan province and one (CWO1) from I. ovatus in Anhui province showed lower 165 rDNA sequence similarity (less than 99.0%) to sequences of previously described Lyme disease-related Borrelia species. DNA-DNA hybridization results revealed that strains CMN3T and CMN1a were clearly distinct from all other known Lyme disease Borrelia species. Electron microscope observation showed the spirochaetes to be morphologically similar to those of Borrelia, but the cells contained only four periplasmic flagella inserted at each end of the spirochaetes. Based on these results, a new Borrelia species, Borrelia sinica sp. nov., is proposed. Strain CMN3T is the type strain of this new species."

The purpose of this article is to review the changes that have taken place in active immunization in the United States over the past decade. Since 1990, new vaccines have become available to prevent five infectious diseases: varicella, rotavirus, hepatitis A, Lyme disease, and Japanese encephalitis virus infection. Improved vaccines have been developed to prevent Haemophilus influenzae type b, pneumococcus, pertussis, rabies, and typhoid infections. Immunization strategies for the prevention of hepatitis B, measles, meningococcal infections, and poliomyelitis have changed as a result of the changing epidemiology of these diseases. Combination vaccines are being developed to facilitate the delivery of multiple antigens, and improved vaccines are under development for cholera, influenza, and meningococcal disease. Major advances in molecular biology have enabled scientists to devise new approaches to the development of vaccines against diseases ranging from respiratory viral to enteric bacterial infections that continue to plague the world's population."

		"abstract": "The developmental timing of Ixodes pacficus Cooley & Kohls, the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis in the far-western United States, was determined under field and laboratory conditions. During their seasonal peaks of abundance, each of the three parasitic stages of L. pacificus, both fed and unfed, was placed inside silk-screen packets. These packets were apportioned between four topographic exposures of two hilltop sites in northwestern California. The sites differed in vegetational composition and elevation: the first (elevation 390 m) was dominated by woodland-grass, the second (elevation 914 m) by chaparral. The timing of oviposition, larval eclosion, molting, and mortality were recorded in the field every 2-3 wk for 2.5 yr. Microenvironmental temperatures were measured on all four exposures at both sites. Accelerated developmental rates of all three stages were correlated with warmer soil temperatures and the time of placement in the field. In the laboratory, replete female I. pacificus maintained under uniform environmental conditions sustained constant preovipositional and prehatch periods independent of date-of-feeding. In the field, all unfed stages survived through one active feeding season with most larvae and nymphs remaining in behavioral diapause between late summer and early spring. No life stage survived through two active feeding periods which suggests that cohorts do not overlap. We concluded that I. pacificus takes a minimum of 3 yr to complete its life cycle in northwestern California."

All adolescents and adults should be immunized against measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, tetanus, and diphtheria, and many should also receive hepatitis A, hepatitis B, influenza, and pneumococcal vaccines. In addition, active patients who engage in outdoor activities may benefit from vaccination against Lyme and meningococcal disease. Regular, strenuous exercise and foreign travel may increase the risk of some infectious diseases. Athletes often see a physician only for sports physical exams and injuries, so it is important for providers to take the opportunity to vaccinate patients during these visits."

The recovery rate per plasma culture and the frequency of positive results for plasma cultures for individual patients were consistent with a level of spirochetemia of approximately 0.1 cultivable cell/mL of whole blood.

Our laboratory has developed recombinant chimeric proteins composed of key Borrelia epitopes. These novel antigens are consistent and are easily standardized. We adapted these recombinant proteins into a new immunochromatographic format that can be used as a highly sensitive and specific first-tier assay that can be used to replace the ELISA or immunofluorescent assay. This rapid test was equally sensitive (P>.05) and more specific (P<.05) than a frequently used commercial whole cell ELISA. The overall clinical accuracy achieved on agreement studies among 3 Lyme research laboratories on clinically defined serum panels was shown to be statistically equivalent to the commercial ELISA. The assay can detect anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies in either serum or whole blood. This sensitive and specific rapid assay, which is suited for the physician's office, streamlines the 2-tier system by allowing the physician to determine if a Western blot is necessary at the time of the initial office visit."

About 70 and 154 days after the first immunization, dogs were challenged by exposing them to field-collected Ixodes scapularis ticks harboring B. burgdorferi. Vaccinated dogs were completely protected from infection by all criteria utilized to assess infection, developed high-titer anti-B. burgdorferi serum antibodies and growth inhibitory activity which persisted for over 200 days, and did not demonstrate any untoward consequence of vaccination. Serum absorption experiments revealed that borreliacidal and most likely protective antibodies in dogs receiving the multiantigenic preparation were not only elicited against the OspA antigen, but were also produced against additional yet to be determined targets on B. burgdorferi organisms. These data demonstrate that a multiantigenic vaccine is effective in preventing Lyme disease transmitted via the natural vector."

		"abstract": "We previously demonstrated that a beta-hairpin peptide, termed BH(9-10), derived from a single-layer beta-sheet of Borrelia OspA protein, formed a native-like beta-turn in trifluoroethanol (TFE) solution, and it assembled into amyloid-like fibrils at higher TFE concentrations. This peptide is highly charged, and fibrillization of such a hydrophilic peptide is quite unusual. In this study, we designed a circularly permutated peptide of BH(9-10), termed BH(10-9). When folded into their respective beta-hairpin structures found in OspA, these peptides would have identical cross-strand interactions but different turns connecting the strands. NMR study revealed that BH(10-9) had little propensity to form a turn structure both in aqueous and TFE solutions. At higher TFE concentration, BH(10-9) precipitated with a concomitant alpha-to-beta conformational conversion, in a similar manner to the BH(9-10) fibrillization. However, the BH(10-9) precipitates were nonfibrillar aggregation. The precipitation kinetics of BH(10-9) was exponential, consistent with a first-order molecular assembly reaction, while the fibrillization of BH(9-10) showed sigmoidal kinetics, indicative of a two-step reaction consisting of nucleation and molecular assembly. The correlation between native-like turn formation and fibrillization of our peptide system strongly suggests that BH(9-10) adopts a native-like beta-hairpin conformation in the fibrils. Remarkably, seeding with the preformed BH(10-9) precipitates changed the two-step BH(9-10) fibrillization to a one-step molecular assembly reaction, and disrupted the BH(9-10) fibril structure, indicating interactions between the BH(10-9) aggregates and the BH(9-10) peptide. Our results suggest that, in these peptides, cross-strand interactions are the driving force for molecular assembly, and turn formation limits modes of peptide assembly."

		"abstract": "In the Lyme disease spirochetes, both the ospE and vlsE gene families have been demonstrated to undergo sequence variation during infection. To further investigate the mechanisms associated with the generation of vls variation, single-nucleotide polymorphism and subsequent DNA sequence analyses were performed on the vlsE gene and its paralog, BBJ51, a related gene with a frameshift mutation. These analyses focused on a series of postinfection clonal populations obtained from mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi B31MIpc or its clonal derivative, B31MIc53. vlsE, but not BBJ51, was found to undergo sequence changes during infection. Consistent with that reported previously (J.-R. Zhang et al., Cell 89:275-285, 1997) many of the sequence changes appear to have arisen through gene conversion events and to be localized to the variable regions of vlsE. However, analysis of the vlsE nucleotide sequences revealed that some sequence changes were the result of point mutations, as these changes did not have potential contributing sources in the vls cassettes. To determine if sequence changes accumulate in vlsE over long-term infection, the vlsE genes of clonal populations recovered after 7 months of infection in mice were analyzed. While new sequence changes developed, a significant number of these changes resulted in the restoration of the vlsE sequence of the original infecting clone. In addition, we noted that some positions within the variable regions (VR) are stable even though the cassettes possess residues that could contribute to sequence variation through gene conversion. These analyses suggest that the total number of amino acid sequence changes that can be maintained by VlsE levels off during infection. In summary, in this report we demonstrate that the development of point mutations serves as a second mechanism by which vlsE sequence variation can be generated and that the capacity for vlsE variation, while still significant, is less than previously postulated."

Two male patients (aged 14 and 36 years) and 2 female patients (aged 15 and 30 years, respectively) with a history of tick bites and Lyme disease. Laboratory and diagnostic findings before and after antimicrobial therapy. Patients residing in a Lyme-endemic area of New Jersey with ongoing symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease were evaluated for possible coinfection with Bartonella species. Elevated levels of B henselae-specific antibodies were found in these patients using the immunofluorescent assay. Bartonella henselae-specific DNA was detected in their blood. None of these patients exhibited the clinical characteristics of cat-scratch disease. Findings of cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed the presence of both B henselae- and Borrelia burgdorferi-specific DNA. Bartonella henselae-specific DNA was also detected in live deer ticks obtained from the households of 2 of these patients. Our data implicate B henselae as a potential human tick-borne pathogen. Patients with a history of neuroborreliosis who have incomplete resolution of symptoms should be evaluated for B henselae infection."

		"abstract": "Cefuroxime axetil, a prodrug of the cephalosporin cefuroxime, has proven in vitro antibacterial activity against several gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, including those most frequently associated with various common community-acquired infections. In numerous randomised, controlled trials, 5 to 10 days' treatment with oral cefuroxime axetil (250 or 500 mg twice daily) was an effective treatment in patients with upper (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) as assessed by clinical and bacteriological criteria. The drug was as effective as several other cephalosporins, quinolones, macrolides and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Shorter courses (5 to 10 days') of cefuroxime axetil were at least as effective as a 10 day course. Furthermore, sequential therapy with intravenous cefuroxime (750 mg 2 or 3 times daily for 2 to 5 days) followed by oral cefuroxime axetil (500 mg twice daily for 3 to 8 days) proved an effective treatment in adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). This approach provided similar efficacy to intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam followed by oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, a full parenteral course of cefuroxime, or intravenous then oral azithromycin or clarithromycin. Additionally, cefuroxime axetil was an effective treatment in patients with genitourinary, skin and soft-tissue infections, and erythema migrans associated with early stage Lyme disease. The drug is well tolerated by adult and paediatric patients, with adverse effects that are consistent with those of other cephalosporins. The majority of adverse events (primarily gastrointestinal disturbances) were mild to moderate in intensity and reversible upon discontinuation of treatment, with very few serious adverse events reported. Cefuroxime axetil is a broad spectrum antibacterial agent with a pharmacokinetic profile that permits convenient twice-daily administration. The drug is an effective and well tolerated treatment in patients with various infections, including otitis media, pharyngitis, sinusitis, CAP and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Cefuroxime axetil proved effective as a component of intravenous/oral sequential therapy in the treatment of CAP, although there are currently no dosage recommendations available for this regimen in some countries. Cefuroxime axetil may be considered as an empirical therapy for a range of community-acquired infections, including those in which beta-lactamase-producing strains of common respiratory pathogens are identified as the causative organisms. In an era of rapidly emerging bacterial resistance, empirical treatment with bacterial agents, potentially preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance to agents such as cefuroxime axetil may ensure the appropriate use of newer antibacterial agents, potentially preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance to these newer drugs."

In the nonhuman primate model of Lyme neuroborreliosis, we measured spirochetal density in the nervous system and other tissues by polymerase chain reaction and correlated these values to anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and to inflammation in tissues. Despite substantial presence of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis, in the central nervous system, only minor inflammation was present there, though skeletal and cardiac muscle, which contained similar levels of spirochete, were highly inflamed. Anti-Borrelia burgdoferi antibody was present in the cerebrospinal fluid but was not selectively concentrated. All infected animals developed anti-Borrelia burgdorferi antibody in the serum, but increased amplitude of antibody was not predictive of higher levels of infection. These data demonstrate that Lyme neuroborreliosis is a persistent infection, that spirochetal presence is a necessary but not sufficient condition for inflammation, and that antibody measured in serum may not predict the severity of infection."

Serologic evidence of exposure to Babesia microti did not significantly impact the clinical course of Lyme disease. Two clinical studies indicated that the long-term outcome of Lyme disease is good. Results are pending of chronic Lyme disease studies funded by the US National Institutes of Health. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of Lyme disease provided clues about possible mechanisms for persistent symptoms.

		"abstract": "Natural antibodies are those immunoglobulin molecules found in mammalian serum that arise in the absence of exposure to environmental pathogens and may comprise an early host defense against invading pathogens. The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi first encounters natural antibodies when its arthropod vector, Ixodes scapularis, begins feeding on a mammalian host. Natural antibodies may therefore have an impact on pathogens within blood-sucking vectors, prior to pathogen transmission to the mammal. In this study, we investigated whether natural antibodies influenced the number and/or phenotype of B. burgdorferi organisms within feeding I. scapularis nymphs. Using a competitive PCR, we found that ticks ingesting a blood meal from B-cell-deficient mice, which lack all immunoglobulins, contained fivefold more spirochete DNA than ticks feeding on control mice. Spirochete DNA levels could be reduced to that of controls with passive transfer of normal mouse serum or polyclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM), but not IgG, into B-cell-deficient mice prior to placement of infected ticks. At 48 h of tick feeding, 90% of spirochetes within salivary glands of ticks removed from B-cell-deficient mice were found by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy to express outer surface protein A (OspA), compared to only 5% of salivary gland spirochetes from ticks detached from control mice. Taken together, these results show that ingestion of natural antibodies limits the spirochete burden within feeding ticks. Because OspA is normally downregulated when spirochetes moved from the tick midgut to the salivary gland, our findings suggest that OspA-expressing midgut spirochetes may be particularly susceptible to the borrelicidal effects of these molecules."

A longitudinal assessment of anti-IR(6) antibody levels in B. burgdorferi-infected rhesus monkeys revealed that this level diminished sharply after antibiotic treatment (within 25 weeks). In contrast, antibody levels to P39 and to whole-cell antigen extracts of B. burgdorferi either remained unchanged or diminished less. A longitudinal analysis in dogs yielded similar results. In humans, the anti-IR(6) antibody titer diminished by a factor of > or =4 in successfully treated patients and by a factor of <4 in treatment-resistant patients. This result suggests that the quantification of anti-IR(6) antibody titer as a function of time should be investigated further as a test to assess response to Lyme disease therapy or to determine whether a B. burgdorferi infection has been eliminated."

In this paper, we show that the administration of B. burgdorferi-immune sera to IFN-gammaR-deficient mice that have been infected with B. burgdorferi N40 for 4 days causes spirochete clearance. In contrast, immune sera-mediated clearance of B. burgdorferi N40 is not apparent in immunocompetent mice, suggesting a role for IFN-gamma-mediated responses in B. burgdorferi N40 host adaptation. B. burgdorferi-immune sera also induces clearance of B. burgdorferi N40 that have been passaged in vitro 75 times (B. burgdorferi N40-75), a derivative of B. burgdorferi N40 that does not rapidly adapt in vivo in immunocompetent mice. B. burgdorferi N40-75 produce lower levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 in mice than does B. burgdorferi N40, and the administration of these cytokines to B. burgdorferi N40-75-infected mice results in an increased spirochetal burden, further indicating that IFN-gamma-mediated events promote B. burgdorferi survival. Differential immunoscreening and RT-PCR demonstrate that IFN-gamma-mediated signals facilitate spirochete recombination at the variable major protein like sequence locus, a site for early antigenic variation in vivo, and that recombination rates by B. burgdorferi N40 are lower in IFN-gammaR-deficient mice than in control animals. These results suggest that the murine immune response can promote the in vivo adaptation of B. burgdorferi."

In this study, we demonstrate that functionally unique IgM Abs develop in vivo and are responsible for the elimination of spirochetemia in murine models of relapsing fever, without the assistance of complement. Mice deficient in the fifth or third component of complement can clear the spirochetemia, whereas B cell-deficient mice cannot.

In total, 234 birds were captured and recaptured (15%); nearly 2.5 times more birds were captured in chaparral than in woodland-grass. Overall, 34 species representing 15 families were collected during this study; of these, 24 species were caught in chaparral, 19 in woodland-grass, and 9 in both vegetational types. The most frequently captured birds were sage sparrows (Amphispiza belli) in chaparral, and American robins (Turdus migratorius) and oak titmice (Baelophus inornatus) in woodland-grass. Birds hosted 35 Ixodes pacificus (15 larvae, 20 nymphs) and 9 Haemaphysalis leporispalustris (3 larvae, 5 nymphs, 1 adult) ticks, of which 32 were removed from chaparral birds and 12 from woodland birds. The prevalence of tick infestation was 13% (21/167) in chaparral and 5% (3/67) in woodland-grass, but the relative and mean tick intensities of 0.19 and 1.5 for chaparral birds, and 0.18 and 4.0 for woodland birds, respectively, did not differ significantly by habitat. Spirochetes were not detected in either bird-blood or tick-tissue samples when tested by culture, immunofluorescence, or Giemsa-staining. In contrast, over 90% (86/94) of western fence lizards (Sceloporus occidentalis) collected in June or July were infested with an average of 6.9 and 8.9 immature I. pacificus in chaparral and woodland-grass, respectively. We conclude that birds contribute little to the enzootiology of B. burgdorferi in chaparral and woodland-grass habitats in northwestern California because of their limited parasitism by tick vectors and lack of detectable spirochetemias."

Our research provides additional evidence of a genetic predisposition for seronegativity in some individuals with Lyme disease. Because human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II, a heterodimeric glycoprotein, plays an essential role in the regulation of antibody production, we investigated the difference in HLA genes between seropositive and seronegative patients with Lyme disease (LD). Our results show that HLA-DR7 was associated with anti-Bb antibody production. Nine out of the 22 seropositive LD patients (40.9%) had HLA-DRB1*0701, *0703, *0704 (HLA-DR7); only 1 out of the 18 seronegative LD patients (5.6%) had HLA-DR7 (odds ratio (OR)=11.8, P=0.0126).

Seven of 18 seronegative LD patients had HLA-DR1, only 1 of 22 seropositive LD patients had HLA-DR1 (38.9% vs. 4.5%, OR=13.4, P=0.0138). These results suggest that the presence and or lack of production of specific antibody to Bb infection may be associated with particular HLA specificities of the Class II."

		"abstract": "The diagnostic and analytical performance of the coupled-particle light-scattering assay in detecting anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies (the 60-kDa [Ro60] and the 52-kDa [Ro52] antibodies) and anti-La/SSB autoantibodies was evaluated. The antigens were obtained by recombinant DNA procedures to include the most immunogenic epitopes for each protein by using a prokaryotic expression system. Serum samples from 151 patients with connective tissue diseases and 52 control subjects (including patients with viral infections, patients with Lyme disease, and healthy subjects) were studied. Sensitivities for detection of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB were 88.2 and 95.2%, respectively; specificities were 97.6 and 98.1%, respectively. The intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 4.3 to 10.9% for anti-Ro/SSA and from 2.8 to 12.5% for anti-La/SSB; interassay CVs ranged from 6.5 to 13.2% and from 8.2 to 14.5%, respectively. Among the anti-Ro/SSA-positive samples, Ro60 was recognized by 66% of the test sera and Ro52 was recognized by 95% of the test sera. Thirty-four percent of the Ro/SSA-positive sera were reactive only with the Ro52 antigen, indicating that anti-Ro52 is the most common antibody specificity recognized by anti-Ro/SSA autoantibodies. No differences were found between the prevalences of anti-Ro60 and anti-Ro52 in relation to systemic lupus erythematosus or Sjögren's syndrome. The results of the present study indicate that this new immunoassay is an efficient diagnostic tool for the detection of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies in patients with autoimmune disorders."

		"abstract": "Autoimmune diseases remain one of the mysteries that perplex immunologists. What makes the immune system, which has evolved to protect an organism from foreign invaders, turn on the organism itself? A popular answer to this question involves the lymphoid network's primordial function: autoimmunity is a by-product of the immune response to microbial infection. For decades there have been tantalizing associations between infectious agents and autoimmunity: beta-hemolytic streptococci and rheumatic fever; B3 Coxsackieviruses and myocarditis; Trypanosoma cruzi and Chagas' disease; diverse viruses and multiple sclerosis; Borrelia burgdorfii and Lyme arthritis; and B4 Coxsackievirus, cytomegalovirus or rubella and type 1 diabetes, to name the most frequently cited examples. In addition, animal models have provided direct evidence that infection with a particular microbe can incite a particular autoimmune disease. Nonetheless, many of the associations appear less than convincing and, even for those that seem to be on solid footing, there is no real understanding of the underlying mechanism(s)."

We have evaluated the diagnostic utility of five recombinant antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for serodiagnosis of leptospirosis. Sera from 50 healthy residents of a high-incidence region were used to determine cutoff values for 96% specificity. In paired sera from 50 cases of leptospirosis confirmed by the microscopic agglutination test, immunoglobulin G (IgG) but not IgM reacted with the recombinant leptospiral proteins. The recombinant LipL32 IgG ELISA had the highest sensitivities in the acute (56%) and convalescent (94%) phases of leptospirosis. ELISAs based on recombinant OmpL1, LipL41, and Hsp58 had sensitivities of 16, 24, and 18% during the acute phase and 72, 44, and 32% during convalescence, respectively. Compared to sera from healthy individuals, patient sera did not react significantly with recombinant LipL36 (P > 0.05). Recombinant LipL32 IgG ELISA demonstrated 95% specificity among 100 healthy individuals, and specificities ranging from 90 to 97% among 30 dengue patients, 30 hepatitis patients, and 16 patients with diseases initially thought to be leptospirosis. Among 39 Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test-positive individuals and 30 Lyme disease patients, 13 and 23% of sera, respectively, reacted positively with the rLipL32 antigen. These findings indicate that rLipL32 may be an useful antigen for the serodiagnosis of leptospirosis."

		"abstract": "The present recommendation for serologic confirmation of Lyme disease (LD) calls for immunoblotting in support of positive or equivocal ELISA. Borrelia burgdorferi releases large quantities of proteins, suggesting that specific antibodies in serum might be trapped in immune complexes (ICs), rendering the antibodies undetectable by standard assays using unmodified serum. Production of ICs requires ongoing antigen production, so persistence of IC might be a marker of ongoing or persisting infection. We developed an immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture assay (EMIBA) measuring IC-derived IgM antibodies and tested it using three well-defined LD populations (from an academic LD referral center, a well-described Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serum bank, and a group of erythema migrans patients from whose skin lesions B. burgdorferi was grown) and controls (non-Lyme arthritis inflammatory joint disease, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and nondisease subjects from a region where LD is endemic, perhaps the most relevant comparison group of all). Previous studies demonstrated that specific antigen-antibody complexes in the sera of patients with LD could be precipitated by polyethylene glycol and could then be disrupted with maintenance of the immunoreactivity of the released antibodies, that specific anti-B. burgdorferi IgM was concentrated in ICs, and that occasionally IgM to specific B. burgdorferi antigens was found in the IC but not in unprocessed serum. EMIBA compared favorably with commercial and CDC flagellin-enhanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other assays in confirming the diagnosis of LD. EMIBA confirmed early B. burgdorferi infection more accurately than the comparator assays. In addition, EMIBA more accurately differentiated seropositivity in patients with active ongoing infection from seroreactivity persisting long after clinically successful antibiotic therapy; i.e., EMIBA identified seroreactivity indicating a clinical circumstance requiring antibiotic therapy. Thus, EMIBA is a promising new assay for accurate serologic confirmation of early and/or active LD."

The lipid fraction could be separated by HPTLC into 11 components. Staining of these components revealed two glycolipids and two phospholipids. The glycolipids represented about 50% of the total lipids and comprised only galactose as monosaccharide constituents. By means of mass spectrometric and gas chromatographic analysis both glycolipids could be identified as alpha-galactosyl-diacylglycerolipids with different fatty acid compositions. The phospholipids were identified as phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. Immunoassays with sera from patients with Lyme disease showed antibody reactivity only to the glycolipids, which was present in all stages of the disease. Other lipid components seemed to be non-immunogenic in Lyme disease. The glycolipids of B. burgdorferi may be, thus, considered promising candidates for diagnosis and possibly also for vaccination."

Antibodies to B vinsonii subsp berkhoffii were detected in 162 dogs (8.7%; 95% confidence interval, 7.4 to 10.0%). Dogs living in the southeast, plains states, southwest, and south-central were significantly more likely to be seropositive than were dogs living in other regions of the United States. German Shepherd-type dogs were significantly less likely to be seropositive than were dogs of other breeds, and dogs entering training programs or that had been rejected from a training program were significantly more likely to be seropositive than were dogs used for narcotics detection and dogs trained to patrol or detect explosives. Dogs used by the border patrol or Federal Aviation Administration were more likely to be seropositive than were dogs used by the Department of Defense or customs service. Odds that dogs would be seropositive were significantly higher for dogs stationed in the southern United States, the northeastern United States, or a foreign country, compared with dogs stationed in all other regions of the United States. Overall, 8.7% of this diverse group of healthy dogs was found to be seropositive for antibodies to B vinsonii subsp berkhoffii, and seropositivity rates were associated with location, suggesting either that there are multiple vectors for the organism or that the major vector for the organism depends on geographic and environmental factors."

		"abstract": "The two major vector-borne diseases of northern temperate regions, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme borreliosis (LB), show very different epidemiological patterns, but both have increased significantly in incidence since the 1980s. Insight into the temporal dynamics of TBE, gained from statistical analysis of spatial patterns integrated with biological explanation, suggests that the recent increases in TBE cases in Central Europe and the Baltic States may have arisen largely from changes in human behaviour that have brought more people into contact with infected ticks. Under forecast climate change scenarios, it is predicted that enzootic cycles of TBE virus may not survive along the southern edge of their present range, e.g. in Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary, where case numbers are indeed decreasing. New foci, however, are predicted and have been observed in Scandinavia. At the same time, human impact on the landscape, increasing both the habitat and wildlife hosts of ticks, has allowed tick populations to multiply significantly. This probably accounts for a genuine emergence of LB, with its high potential transmission rate, in both the USA and Europe, although the rate of emergence has been exaggerated by improved surveillance and diagnosis."

The second part of the paper develops some matrix models for quantifying the basic reproductive number, R(0), for a variety of potential types of emergent pathogen that cause outbreaks in wildlife. These analyses emphasize the sensitivity of R(0) to heterogeneities created by either the spatial structure of the host population, or the ability of the pathogens to utilize multiple host species. At each stage we illustrate how the approach provides insight into the initial dynamics of emergent pathogens such as canine parvovirus, Lyme disease, and West Nile virus in the United States."

The ehrlichioses have only been identified as agents of human disease in the United States in the past few decades, and knowledge about them is still evolving. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is relatively common and can be severe, especially in children, if the diagnosis is not made quickly. Tularemia has long been known to cause disease in humans, but there is renewed interest because of its potential as a biologic warfare agent. These diseases can be severe or even fatal. Most of them are easily treatable when identified early. These diseases result from a variety of infectious agents including bacteria, rickettsia, viruses and protozoa, or they may be caused by substances produced by the tick. Most of these diseases present initially with nonspecific symptoms and are often difficult to recognize. Few definitive diagnostic tests are available. Therefore, knowledge of the epidemiology and common presentations, as well as the diagnostic options and treatments available, are important issues for family physicians."

B. burgdorferi apparently uses temperature as a cue to its location, producing proteins required for infection of warm-blooded animals at temperatures corresponding to host body temperature, but does not produce such virulence factors at cooler, ambient temperatures. We have observed that B. burgdorferi regulates expression of RevA in response to temperature, with the protein being synthesized by bacteria cultivated at 34 degrees C but not by those grown at 23 degrees C. Tissues encountered by B. burgdorferi during its infectious cycle vary in their pH values, and the level of RevA expression was also found to be dependent upon pH of the culture medium. The cellular localization of RevA was also analyzed. Borrelial inner and outer membranes were purified by isopycnic centrifugation, and membrane fractions were conclusively identified by immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against the integral inner membrane protein MotB and outer membrane-associated Erp lipoproteins. Immunoblot analyses indicated that RevA is located in the B. burgdorferi outer membrane. These analyses also demonstrated that an earlier report (H. A. Bledsoe et al., Infect. Immun. 176:7447-7455, 1994) had misidentified such B. burgdorferi membrane fractions. RevA was further demonstrated to be exposed to the external environment, where it could facilitate interactions with host tissues."

		"abstract": "Murine Lyme borreliosis, caused by infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, results in acute arthritis and carditis that regress as a result of B. burgdorferi-specific immune responses. B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies can attenuate arthritis in mice deficient in both B cells and T cells but have no effect on carditis. Because macrophages comprise the principal immune cell in carditis, T-cell responses that augment cell-mediated immunity may be important for carditis regression. To investigate this hypothesis, we examined the course of Lyme carditis in mice selectively deficient in B cells or alphabeta T cells. Our results show that carditis regresses in B-cell-deficient B10.A(k) mice but not in alphabeta T-cell-deficient mice, independently of the mouse strain background. Despite prominent macrophage infiltrates, hearts from B. burgdorferi-infected alphabeta T-cell-deficient mice had less mRNA for tumor necrosis factor alpha as measured by reverse transcription-PCR compared to infected control mice. Anti-inflammatory cytokine mRNA levels were equivalent. Adoptive transfer of gamma interferon-secreting CD4+ T cells into infected alphabeta T-cell-deficient mice promoted carditis resolution. These results show that alphabeta T cells can promote resolution of murine Lyme carditis and are the first demonstration of a beneficial role for CD4+ T helper 1 cells in this disease."

		"abstract": "The heightened worldwide recognition of the health burden of tickborne infection derives largely from the increasing incidence of Lyme disease, human babesiosis, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, both individually and in concert. Because these infections share the same rodent reservoir and tick vector hosts, they can be cotransmitted to human hosts. Indeed, human coinfections involving various combinations of these pathogens are common, and some tend to be particularly severe. Diagnostic procedures and clinical management of the resulting disease syndrome is rendered complex by the diversity of pathogens involved and by the unusual diversity and duration of symptoms."

Of the 4 children reported here with optic nerve abnormalities, 2 had decreased vision months after disease onset attributable to optic neuritis, and 1 had headache and diplopia early in the infection because of increased intracranial pressure associated with Lyme meningitis. In these 3 children, optic nerve involvement responded well to intravenous ceftriaxone therapy. The fourth child had headache and visual loss attributable to increased intracranial pressure and perhaps also to optic neuritis. Despite treatment with ceftriaxone and steroids, he had persistent increased intracranial pressure leading to permanent bilateral blindness. Clinicians should be aware that neuro-ophthalmologic involvement of Lyme disease may have significant consequences. If increased intracranial pressure persists despite antibiotic therapy, measures must be taken quickly to reduce the pressure."

The aim of this study was to determine whether motile B. garinii could develop from cystic forms, not only in vitro but also in vivo, in cyst-inoculated mice. The cysts prepared in distilled water were able to reconvert into normal motile spirochetes at any time during in vitro experiments, lasting one month, even after freeze-thawing of the cysts. Motile spirochetes were successfully isolated from 2 out of 15 mice inoculated intraperitoneally with cystic forms, showing the infectivity of the cysts. The demonstrated capacity of the cysts to reconvert into motile spirochetes in vivo and their surprising resistance to adverse environmental conditions should lead to further studies on the role and function of these forms in Lyme disease."

The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi Johnson, Schmidt, Hyde, Steigerwaldt & Brenner was cultured from the nymph of a blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis Say, that had been removed from a common yellowthroat, Geothlypis trichas L., from Bon Portage Island, Nova Scotia. As a result of bird movement, a nymphal I. scapularis removed from a Swainson's thrush, Catharus ustulatus incanus (Godfrey), at Slave Lake, Alberta, during spring migration becomes the new, most western and northern record of this tick species in Canada. Amblyomma longirostre Koch, Amblyomma sabanerae Stoll, and Ixodes baergi Cooley & Kohls are reported for the first time in Canada. Similarly, Amblyomma americanum L., Arnblyomma maculatum Koch, and ixodes muris Bishopp & Smith are reported for the first time on birds in Canada. After removal of an I. muris gravid female from a song sparrow, Melospiza melodia Wilson, at St. Andrews, New Brunswick, eggs were laid, which developed into larvae, and this new tick-host record demonstrates that birds have the potential to start a new tick population. We conclude that passerine birds disperse several species of ixodid ticks in Canada, and during spring migration translocate ticks from the United States, and Central and South America, some of which are infected with B. burgdorferi."

On day 0, 4 dogs were each fitted with an amitraz-impregnated (9%) collar, and 4 dogs served as untreated controls. On day 7, all dogs were infested with 100/scapularis (approx 50 females and 50 males) with a known B. burgdorferi infectivity rate of 39.4%. On days 21, 28, 35, 42, 56, 70, and 84, each dog was tested for serum antibodies against B. burgdorferi via ELISA and a western blot technique. Additional ELISA were also performed for serum antibodies against antigenically similar organisms. By day 70, all control dogs had developed serum ELISA responses ranging from 328 to 510 kinetics-ELISA units (equivalent to end-point titers of approx 43,500 to 60,000), whereas treated dogs remained seronegative throughout the study. Western blot assays performed on all serum samples confirmed that antibodies detected in control dogs reflected responses to specific antigens of B. burgdorferi, whereas treated dogs had no such antibodies. Additional serologic analyses confirmed that antibody responses observed in control dogs were not attributable to antigenically similar organisms. Amitraz-impregnated collars prevented transmission of B. burgdorferi in 4 of 4 treated dogs and may be a useful management tool for prevention of borreliosis in dogs."

In this second part, the stress is placed on the reemergence of diphtheria and of serious streptococcal infections, on bartonelloses, Chlamydia infections, fungal infections, while malaria and cholera are still prevalent in several areas. The increasing resistance of too many pathogens to antimicrobial agents is a major source of concern, directly related to the challenge of nosocomial infections. An infectious cause has been demonstrated (or strongly suspected) for various diseases and the scope of infectiology keeps widening, while the threat of bioterrorism cannot be neglected. The causes of the emergence or reemergence of infectious diseases are multiple and diverse, often in direct relation with human activities (population migrations, changes in husbandry or farming practices, worldwide exchanges of goods and foods, inadequate uses of antibiotics) but also with climatic variations in several areas. The challenge represented by this unexpected comeback of infections to the forefront of human and animal pathology can only be met with a significant improvement of hygienic practices, cessation of certain dangerous behaviors and also, of course, with the development of novel antimicrobial molecules (acting on original targets) as well as of a whole series of new specific vaccines."

To demonstrate the ability of phiBB-1 to package and transduce DNA, a kanamycin resistance cassette was inserted into a cloned fragment of phage DNA, and the resulting construct was transformed into B. burgdorferi CA-11.2A cells. The kan cassette recombined into a resident cp32 and was stably maintained. The cp32 containing the kan cassette was packaged by phiBB-1 released from this B. burgdorferi strain. phiBB-1 has been used to transduce this antibiotic resistance marker into naive CA-11.2A cells, as well as two other strains of B. burgdorferi. This is the first direct evidence of a mechanism for lateral gene transfer in B. burgdorferi."

The aetiology of OCD and tic disorders is unknown, although it appears that both disorders may arise from a variety of genetic and environmental factors. Post-streptococcal autoimmunity has been postulated as one possible mechanism for some. The acronym PANDAS (for paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections) has been given to a subgroup of paediatric patients who meet five inclusionary criteria: presence of OCD and/or tic disorder, pre-pubertal symptom onset, sudden onset or episodic course of symptoms, temporal association between streptococcal infections and neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations, and associated neurological abnormalities. The proposed model of pathophysiology provides for several unique treatment strategies, including the use of antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent streptococcal-triggered exacerbations, and the use of immunomodulatory interventions (such as intravenous immunoglobulin or therapeutic plasma exchange) in the treatment severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. For the latter study group, long-term (2--5 yr) follow-up revealed continued symptom improvement for the majority of patients, particularly when antibiotic prophylaxis had been effective in preventing recurrent streptococcal infections. In addition, the episodic nature of the subgroup's illness provides for opportunities to study brain structure and function during health and disease, as well as allowing for investigations of the aetiologic role of anti-neuronal antibodies and neuroimmune dysfunction in both OCD and tic disorders. Although much research remains to be done, an increasing body of evidence provides support for the postulate that OCD and tic disorders may arise from post-streptococcal autoimmunity. The unique clinical characteristics of the PANDAS subgroup, the presence of volumetric changes in the basal ganglia, and the dramatic response to immunomodulatory treatments, suggest that symptoms arise from a combination of local, regional and systemic dysfunction. Ongoing research is directed at understanding the nature of the abnormal immune response, as well as identifying at-risk children, in order to provide for novel strategies of prevention and treatment."

		"abstract": "RNA isolated from virulent Borrelia burgdorferi cells incubated with human endothelial or neurological tissue cells was subjected to subtractive hybridization using RNA from the same strain incubated in tissue culture medium alone. This RNA subtractive technique generated specific probes that hybridized to two restriction fragments (8.2 kb and 10 kb respectively) generated by EcoRI digestion of total plasmid DNA. The 10 kb EcoRI fragment localized to lp28-1 and was subsequently identified as the variable membrane protein-like sequence (vls) region, which includes an expression locus (vlsE) and 15 silent cassettes. vlsE encodes a 36 kDa outer surface protein that undergoes antigenic variation during animal infections. Primer extension analysis identified the 5' end of a transcript and a putative promoter for vlsE. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) suggested that the expression of vlsE increased when virulent B. burgdorferi cells were incubated with human tissue cells or purified cell membranes isolated from those same cell lines. A 138 bp region upstream of the vlsE region that was not reported in the genome sequence was sequenced using specific 32P end-labelled primers in a DNA cycle sequencing system at high annealing temperatures. Analysis revealed that it contained a 51 bp inverted repeat, which could form an extremely stable cruciform structure. Southern blots probed with the vlsE promoter/operator region indicated that part or all of this sequence could be found on other B. burgdorferi plasmids."

Twenty 6-month-old dogs were exposed to Borrelia burgdorferi-infected adult ticks and treated with dexamethasone for 5 consecutive days. Two dogs not exposed to ticks were treated with dexamethasone and served as negative-control dogs. Clinical signs, results of microbial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, immunologic responses, and gross and histologic lesions were evaluated 9 months after tick exposure. Predominant clinical signs were episodic pyrexia and lameness in 12 of 20 dogs. Infection with B burgdorferi was detected in microbial cultures of skin biopsy specimens and various tissues obtained during necropsy in 19 of 20 dogs and in all 20 dogs by use of a PCR assay. All 20 exposed dogs seroconverted and developed chronic nonsuppurative arthritis. Three dogs also developed mild focal meningitis, 1 dog developed mild focal encephalitis, and 18 dogs developed perineuritis or rare neuritis. Control dogs were seronegative, had negative results for microbial culture and PCR testing, and did not develop lesions. Use of this technique successfully induced borreliosis in young dogs. Dogs with experimentally induced borreliosis may be useful in evaluating vaccines, chemotherapeutic agents, and the pathogenesis of borreliosis-induced arthritis."

		"abstract": "It is controversial whether prolonged antibiotic treatment is effective for patients in whom symptoms persist after the recommended antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease. We conducted two randomized trials: one in 78 patients who were seropositive for IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi at the time of enrollment and the other in 51 patients who were seronegative. The patients received either intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g daily for 30 days, followed by oral doxycycline, 200 mg daily for 60 days, or matching intravenous and oral placebos. Each patient had well-documented, previously treated Lyme disease but had persistent musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms, or dysesthesia, often associated with fatigue. The primary outcome measures were improvement on the physical- and mental-health-component summary scales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36)--a scale measuring the health-related quality of life--on day 180 of the study. After a planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the studies be discontinued because data from the first 107 patients indicated that it was highly unlikely that a significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups would be observed with the planned full enrollment of 260 patients. Base-line assessments documented severe impairment in the patients' health-related quality of life. In intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences in the outcomes with prolonged antibiotic treatment as compared with placebo. Among the seropositive patients who were treated with antibiotics, there was improvement in the score on the physical-component summary scale of the SF-36, the mental-component summary scale, or both in 37 percent, no change in 29 percent, and worsening in 34 percent; among seropositive patients receiving placebo, there was improvement in 40 percent, no change in 26 percent, and worsening in 34 percent (P=0.96 for the comparison between treatment groups). The results were similar for the seronegative patients. There is considerable impairment of health-related quality of life among patients with persistent symptoms despite previous antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease. However, in these two trials, treatment with intravenous and oral antibiotics for 90 days did not improve symptoms more than placebo."

		"abstract": "It is unclear whether antimicrobial treatment after an Ixodes scapularis tick bite will prevent Lyme disease. In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At base line, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi. Entomologists confirmed the species of the ticks and classified them according to sex, stage, and degree of engorgement. Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than of those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P<0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions. Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P<0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks (8 of 142 bites [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 bites [0 percent], P=0.02) and particularly after bites from nymphal ticks that were at least partially engorged with blood (8 of 81 bites [9.9 percent], as compared with 0 of 59 bites from unfed, or flat, nymphal ticks [0 percent]; P=0.02). A single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours after an I. scapularis tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Infection with Lyme disease spirochetes can be chronic. This suggests that the spirochetes are capable of immune evasion. In a previous study we demonstrated that the ospE gene family, which is one of three gene families whose members are flanked at their 5' end by the highly conserved upstream homology box (UHB) element, undergoes mutation and rearrangement during infection. This results in the generation of antigenically distinct variants that may contribute to immune evasion. In this study we have assessed the genetic stability of the UHB-flanked ospF gene family during infection in mice. Using postinfection clonal populations of Borrelia burgdorferi B31MI, PCR amplicons were generated for three members of the ospF gene family after a 3-month infection time frame. The amplicons were analyzed by single-nucleotide polymorphism pattern analysis and DNA sequencing. Members of the ospF gene family were found to be stable during infection, as no mutations or rearrangements were detected. An analysis of the humoral immune response to these proteins during infection revealed that the immune response to each is specific and that there is a delayed humoral immune response to some OspF protein family members. These analyses suggest that there is a temporal component to the expression of these genes during infection. In addition to a possible contribution to immune evasion, members of the OspF protein family may play specific roles at different stages of infection."

		"abstract": "Decorin binding protein A (DbpA) has been shown by several laboratories to be a protective antigen for the prevention of experimental Borrelia burgdorferi infection in the mouse model of Lyme borreliosis. However, different recombinant forms of the antigen having either lipidated amino termini, approximating the natural secretion and posttranslational processing, or nonprocessed cytosolic forms have elicited disparate levels of protection in the mouse model. We have now used the unique functional properties of this molecule to investigate the structural requirements needed to elicit a protective immune response. Genetic and physicochemical alterations to DbpA showed that the ability to bind to the ligand decorin is indicative of a potent immunogen but is not conclusive. By mutating the two carboxy-terminal nonconserved cysteines of DbpA from B. burgdorferi strain N40, we have determined that the stability afforded by the putative disulfide bond is essential for the generation of protective antibodies. This mutated protein was more sensitive to thermal denaturation and proteolysis, suggesting that it is in a less ordered state. Immunization with DbpA that was thermally denatured and functionally inactivated stimulated an immune response that was not protective and lacked bactericidal antibodies. Antibodies against conformationally altered forms of DbpA also failed to kill heterologous B. garinii and B. afzelii strains. Additionally, nonsecreted recombinant forms of DbpA(N40) were found to be inferior to secreted lipoprotein DbpA(N40) in terms of functional activity and antigenic potency. These data suggest that elicitation of a bactericidal and protective immune response to DbpA requires a properly folded conformation for the production of functional antibodies."

To review Lyme disease prevention, clinical trials, epidemiological and experimental studies, and predictive models were evaluated. Geographic distribution of ixodid vectors and local landscape predict Lyme disease risk. Density of infected ticks correlates with incidence and prevalence of Lyme disease, but risk quantitation is made uncertain by tick aggregation and inability to predict tick-human interactions. Outdoor activities are inconsistently or weakly associated with risk, and most infections likely occur in residential areas during routine activities. Tick control (burning or removing vegetation, acaricide use, and deer elimination) reduces Ixodes scapularis populations by up to 94%, and acaricide application to wildlife decreases nymphal I scapularis populations by up to 83%. The effect of these strategies on incidence of Lyme disease in humans is unknown. Studies show that only 40% to 50% of adults take precautions against tick bites even when they are aware of Lyme disease. Effective protection afforded by personal precautions (wearing protective clothing, avoiding ticks, and using insect repellant) has not been shown prospectively. Antimicrobial prophylaxis of tick bites is not warranted. Clinical trials showed vaccines containing recombinant OspA of Borrelia burgdorferi to be efficacious and well tolerated. Currently, vaccination is the only empirically demonstrated method to prevent Lyme disease. The best evidence supports prevention efforts focused on practices that encourage immunization, Lyme disease awareness, and possibly treatment of deer."

We have previously shown that human dermal endothelial cells (HMEC) express TLR4, but very little TLR2, and respond to LPS, but not to Mycobacterium tuberculosis 19-kDa lipoprotein, unless transfected with TLR2. Here we report that HMEC are unresponsive to several additional biologically relevant TLR2 ligands, including, phenol-soluble modulin (PSM), a complex of three small secreted polypeptides from the skin commensal Staphylococcus epidermidis, soluble tuberculosis factor (STF), and Borrelia burgdorferi outer surface protein A lipoprotein (OspA-L). Expression of TLR2 renders HMEC responsive to all these ligands. We further characterized the signaling pathway in response to STF, OspA-L, and PSM in TLR2-transfected HMEC. The TLR2 signaling pathway for NF-kappaB trans-activation shares the IL-1R signaling molecules. Dominant negative constructs of TLR2 or TLR6 inhibit the responses of STF and OspA-L as well as PSM in TLR2-transfected HMEC, supporting the concept of functional cooperation between TLR2 and TLR6 for all these TLR2 ligands. Moreover, we show that Toll-interacting protein (Tollip) coimmunoprecipitates with TLR2 and TLR4 using HEK 293 cells, and overexpression of Tollip inhibits NF-kappaB activation in response to TLR2 and TLR4 signaling. Collectively, these findings suggest that there is functional interaction between TLR2 and TLR6 in the cellular response to STF and OspA-L in addition to S. epidermidis (PSM) Ags, and that engagement of TLR2 triggers a signaling cascade, which shares the IL-1R signaling molecules, similar to the TLR4-LPS signaling cascade. Our data also suggest that Tollip may be an important constituent of both the TLR2 and TLR4 signaling pathways."

		"abstract": "A recombinant lipoprotein outer surface protein A (OspA) Lyme disease (LD) vaccine (LYMErix) has been shown to be safe and effective in preventing LD in adults and in adolescents 15 years of age and older. Children are at risk for developing LD. This clinical study was conducted to address the safety and immunogenicity of LD vaccine in children 4 to 18 years of age. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted at 17 investigational sites in Lyme-endemic areas in the United States. Immunogenicity data from this study also were compared with data obtained from the adult efficacy study. A total of 4090 healthy children and adolescents (age range: 4-18; mean age: 10.4 years) were randomized; 4087 were vaccinated, and a subset of 301 children participated in the immunogenicity analysis. Children were randomized to receive either 30 microgram of LD vaccine (N = 3063) or placebo (N = 1024) on a 0, 1, 12-month schedule. Safety assessments evaluated both solicited (local: redness, swelling, and pain; general: fever, headache, fatigue, arthralgia, and rash) and unsolicited adverse events. Serum specimens were collected at month 0 or month 2, and months 6, 12, and 13. Solicited reactogenicity data revealed a higher incidence of local injection site reactions and general symptoms (fever, headache, fatigue, and arthralgia) in vaccine than placebo recipients. The majority of events were limited in duration (mean: 2-3 days) and were mild to moderate in severity. The total IgG anti-OspA geometric mean titer (GMT) in the pediatric vaccine recipients at month 13 was as good as and statistically higher than the GMT in the adult cohort at month 13 (27 485 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units [EL.U]/mL vs 8216 EL.U /mL). All of the pediatric vaccine recipients attained a level of antibody concentration >/=1400 EL.U/mL (proposed seroprotective level) compared with 90% of adults attaining levels >/=1400 EL.U/mL in the efficacy trial. LD vaccine administered on a 0, 1, 12-month schedule generally is well tolerated and immunogenic in children 4 to 18 years of age. The safety profile consists of mild to moderate local injection site reactions and flu-like symptoms of limited duration and did not worsen with subsequent injections. IgG GMT at month 13 was threefold higher than the month 13 GMT obtained in the adult efficacy study. This higher immune response in children should provide protection against LD."

New and widespread hepatotropic viruses (mainly hepatitis C) have been identified, while the bacterial cause (Helicobacter pylori) of gastric ulcer was demonstrated. The second part of this review will deal with other examples of emerging or reemerging infections and with the problem of the increasing resistance of pathogens to antimicrobial agents. It will analyse the multiple causes of these various phenomena and describe the diverse strategies which should become available for the prevention and/or treatment of these numerous infectious diseases."

Minocycline has an antiinfectious activity with a spectrum similar to that of other cyclines, notably against Chlamydias, Treonema and Proprionibacterium acenes. The antiinflammatory activity is associated with this antiinfectious action is greater than that of first generation cyclines with specifically a modulator effect on epidermal cytokines. The pharmokinetics of minocycline is characterized by an excellent absorption, a long half-life and an important lipophilic property inducing good tissue distribution. Clinical trials of minocycline have mainly been performed in sexually transmissible diseases and in acne, a field where randomized studies are the most frequent. These trials show that the effect of minocycline is not stronger than first generation cyclines or doxycycline, but that the action is quicker than that of tetracycline at the dose of 500 mg a day. Minocycline is also efficient in nocardiasis, mycobacteriosis, leprosy, Lyme disease, pyoderma gangrenosum, autoimmune bullous dermatitis, Carteaud disease, and prurigo. However, the effect of minocycline in these different conditions has always been evaluated in open trials with a small number of patients. The usual side effects of cyclines, i.e. digestive problems, fungal infections, are less frequent than with first generation cyclines. No photosensitivity has been demonstrated although pigmentations have been described. Dizziness is a specific side effect of minocycline. Furthermore, rare but severe side effects have been reported, including hypersensitivity syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, and lupus. Regular indications for minocycline in dermatology are acne and three sexually transmissible diseases (mycoplasm, chlamydia, treponema). Proposed dosage is 100 mg per day in sexually transmissible disease with a reduction to 50 mg per day after 15 days in acne."

It was demonstrated that nested LightCycler PCR amplification of p66 is more sensitive in the detection of borrelia DNA than amplification of the recA gene. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto could be differentiated from Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii by melting-curve analysis of the p66 gene amplicon. B. garinii could be differentiated from B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto by melting-curve analysis of the recA gene amplicon. Therefore, the PCRs complement each other in subtyping different Borrelia species, and combined LightCycler PCR and melting-curve analysis of both target genes is a rapid method to distinguish the three species of B. burgdorferi sensu lato."

		"abstract": "Fifty-six strains of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, isolated from ticks and vertebrate animals in Missouri, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Texas, were identified and characterized by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer amplicons. A total of 241 to 258 bp of intergenic spacers between tandemly duplicated rrf (5S) and rrl (23S) was amplified by PCR. MseI and DraI restriction fragment polymorphisms were used to analyze these strains. PCR-RFLP analysis results indicated that the strains represented at least three genospecies and 10 different restriction patterns. Most of the strains isolated from the tick Ixodes dentatus in Missouri and Georgia belonged to the genospecies Borrelia andersonii. Excluding the I. dentatus strains, most southern strains, isolated from the ticks Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes affinis, the cotton rat (Sigmodon hispidus), and cotton mouse (Peromyscus gossypinus) in Georgia and Florida, belonged to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Seven strains, isolated from Ixodes minor, the wood rat (Neotoma floridana), the cotton rat, and the cotton mouse in South Carolina and Florida, belonged to Borrelia bissettii. Two strains, MI-8 from Florida and TXW-1 from Texas, exhibited MseI and DraI restriction patterns different from those of previously reported genospecies. Eight Missouri tick strains (MOK-3a group) had MseI patterns similar to that of B. andersonii reference strain 21038 but had a DraI restriction site in the spacer. Strain SCGT-8a had DraI restriction patterns identical to that of strain 25015 (B. bissettii) but differed from strain 25015 in its MseI restriction pattern. Strain AI-1 had the same DraI pattern as other southern strains in the B. bissettii genospecies but had a distinct MseI profile. The taxonomic status of these atypical strains needs to be further evaluated. To clarify the taxonomic positions of these atypical Borrelia strains, the complete sequences of rrf-rrl intergenic spacers from 20 southeastern and Missouri strains were determined. The evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of these strains were compared with those of the described genospecies in the B. burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. The 20 strains clustered into five separate lineages on the basis of sequence analysis. MI-8 and TXW-1 appeared to belong to two different undescribed genospecies, although TXW-1 was closely related to Borrelia garinii. The MOK-3a group separated into a distinct deep branch in the B. andersonii lineage. PCR-RFLP analysis results and the results of sequence analyses of the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer confirm that greater genetic heterogeneity exists among B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains isolated from the southern United States than among strains isolated from the northern United States. The B. andersonii genospecies and its MOK-3a subgroup are associated with the I. dentatus-cottontail rabbit enzootic cycle, but I. scapularis was also found to harbor a strain of this genospecies. Strains that appear to be B. bissettii in our study were isolated from I. minor and the cotton mouse, cotton rat, and wood rat. The B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains from the south are genetically and phenotypically similar to the B31 reference strain."

The 65-year-old man with a seven-months history of articulation disturbances was examined. The speech of the patient was slow and laboured. A slight weakness of the muscles of the tongue (left-side) was observed. The patient suffered from meningitis due to Borrelia burgdorferi infection in 1999 and initially underwent a successful antibiotic treatment. Detailed radiological investigation and psychological tests were performed and co-existing neurological diseases were excluded. To describe profile of speech abnormalities the dysarthria scale was designed based on S. J. Robertson Dysarthria Profile. There were a few disturbances found in self-assessment of speech, intelligibility, articulation, and prosody but especially in the morphology of the articulation muscles, diadochokinesis, the reflexes (in the mouth, larynx and pharynx). Needle EMG examination confirmed the diagnosis of mono-neuropathy of left hypoglossal nerve. The study confirms the fact that neuroborreliosis may evoke chronic consequences."

In this study, synovial fluid levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were compared in persons with untreated and antibiotic-resistant Lyme arthritis. Levels of MMP-1 and MMP-3, as determined by ELISA, were higher in untreated patients (P=.0064 and P=.002, respectively), whereas levels of MMP-8 and MMP-9 were higher in antibiotic-resistant patients (P=.0002 and P=.0014, respectively). In vitro studies of chondrocyte cultures infected with Borrelia burgdorferi revealed induction of MMP-1 and MMP-3 but not of MMP-8 or MMP-9. Neither Staphylococcus aureus nor lipopolysaccharide stimulated MMP-1 or MMP-3 release from these cells. The mechanism of recognition of B. burgdorferi may be through CD14 and toll-like receptor-2, which were up-regulated in the presence of B. burgdorferi. These findings suggest different stimuli for MMP induction in untreated and antibiotic-resistant Lyme arthritis."

An unusual feature of these bacteria is a genome that includes linear DNA molecules with covalently closed hairpin ends referred to as telomeres. We have investigated the mechanism by which the hairpin telomeres are processed during replication. A synthetic 140 bp sequence having the predicted structure of a replicated telomere was shown to function as a viable substrate for telomere resolution in vivo, and was sufficient to convert a circular replicon to a linear form. Our results suggest that the final step in the replication of linear Borrelia replicons is a site-specific DNA breakage and reunion event to regenerate covalently closed hairpin ends. The telomere substrate described here will be valuable both for in vivo manipulation of linear DNA in Borrelia and for in vitro studies to identify and characterize the telomere resolvase."

		"abstract": "Chronic intrathecal immunoglobulin (Ig) production is a hallmark of multiple sclerosis characterized by the presence of oligoclonal IgGs and, in addition, polyspecific recognition of different pathogens such as measles, rubella and herpes zoster virus. While the antigen specificity of the oligoclonal IgGs in multiple sclerosis is largely unknown, the oligoclonal IgGs arising during CNS infectious diseases are reactive against the specific pathogen. Recently, a link between Chlamydia pneumoniae and multiple sclerosis has been claimed. To test the possible role of C. pneumoniae in multiple sclerosis, we analysed (i) whether there is intrathecal IgG production against C. pneumoniae in multiple sclerosis and (ii) if the oligoclonal IgGs in the CSF of multiple sclerosis patients recognize C. pneumoniae. By studying paired serum-CSF samples from 120 subjects (definite multiple sclerosis, 46; probable multiple sclerosis, 12; other inflammatory neurological diseases, 35; other neurological diseases, 27) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we found that 24% of all patients with definite multiple sclerosis, but only 5% of patients with other inflammatory or non-inflammatory diseases, produced IgGs specific for C. pneumoniae intrathecally (definite multiple sclerosis versus other inflammatory neurological diseases: P = 0.027). The presence of intrathecal IgGs to C. pneumoniae was independent of the duration of disease and relatively stable over time. The major CSF oligoclonal IgG bands from multiple sclerosis patients with an intrathecal Ig production to C. pneumoniae did not react towards purified elementary bodies and reticulate bodies of C. pneumoniae on affinity-mediated immunoblot following isoelectric focusing (IEF-western blots). In contrast, the IgGs in the CSF of control patients with neuroborreliosis strongly reacted with their specific pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, by IEF-western blot analysis. Concomitant analysis of the CSF of 23 patients with a nested polymerase chain reaction for C. pneumoniae was negative in all cases. Together, our findings strongly suggest that the immune response to C. pneumoniae is part of a polyspecific intrathecal Ig production, as is commonly observed with other pathogens. This argues against a specific role for C. pneumoniae in multiple sclerosis."

We developed an in vitro model of Lyme arthritis using cartilage explants and observed changes in cartilage degradation in the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi and/or various protease inhibitors. Synovial fluid from patients with Lyme arthritis was found to contain at least 3 MMPs: gelatinase A (MMP-2), stromelysin (MMP-3), and gelatinase B (MMP-9). In addition, there was evidence in 2 patients of \"aggrecanase\" activity not accounted for by the above enzymes. Infection of cartilage explants with B. burgdorferi resulted in induction of MMP-3, MMP-9, and \"aggrecanase\" activity. Increased induction of these enzymes by B. burgdorferi alone was not sufficient to cause cartilage destruction in the explants as measured by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and hydroxyproline release. However, addition of plasminogen, which can act as an MMP activator, to cultures resulted in significant GAG and hydroxyproline release in the presence of B. burgdorferi. The MMP inhibitor batimastat significantly reduced the GAG release and completely inhibited the collagen degradation. MMPs are found in synovial fluids from patients with Lyme arthritis and are induced from cartilage tissue by the presence of B. burgdorferi. Inhibition of MMP activity prevents B. burgdorferi-induced cartilage degradation in vitro."

The third patient had negative serology at first assessment, on the basis of which the diagnosis of Lyme disease was temporarily rejected. Ultimately, all three appeared to have neuroborreliosis. They were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and recovered well. Facial palsy in childhood is frequently caused by Lyme borreliosis and infection with Borrelia burgdorferi should therefore be investigated, even if there are no signs of a tick bite or erythema migrans. Diagnosis is made by serology, followed by immunoblotting to confirm a positive result. In case of strong suspicion based on the patient's history or physical examination or a positive serology, lumbar puncture should be carried out. Antibiotic treatment facilitates recovery and prevents complications."

In particular, many new infections of the nervous system have been recognised, including the lethal infections of Enterovirus 71, and the Nipah and West Nile viruses. Increased interest in prion diseases has occurred, following the recognition of animal-to-human transmission in Europe. Familiar bacteria such as the pneumococcus continue to cause problems due to increasing resistance to multiple antibiotics. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus-infected and other immunocompromised patients are under the constant threat of opportunistic infections, many of which are targeted towards the brain and spinal cord. This paper reviews the changing world of nervous system infections, highlighting some of the most significant recent developments."

		"abstract": "Various genotypes of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto have been previously identified among a large collection of isolates cultured from patients with Lyme disease in the United States. Furthermore, association of specific genotypes with hematogenous dissemination early in the disease course has been observed. The present study assessed kinetics of spirochete dissemination and disease severity in C3H/HeJ mice infected with two different genotypes of B. burgdorferi. Spirochete load in plasma and ear and other tissue samples of infected mice was measured by quantitative PCR, and these data were compared to those obtained by culture and histopathologic analysis. In mice infected with isolate BL206 (a type 1 strain), the peak number of spirochetes was observed in plasma between day 4 and 7, in heart and ear tissue on day 14, and in joints on day 28 postinoculation. There was a correlation between the peak number of spirochetes in plasma on day 4 or 7 and that in ear biopsy and joint specimens on day 14. By contrast, spirochete burdens in plasma of mice infected with isolate B356 (a type 3 strain) were 16- and 5-fold lower than those of BL206-infected mice on days 7 and 14 of infection, respectively. Similarly, approximately 6- and 13-fold fewer spirochetes were detected in the heart tissues of B356-infected mice compared to BL206-infected mice. Histopathologically, severe arthritis and aortitis were noted only in mice infected with isolate BL206. Spirochete dissemination and disease severity vary significantly in mice infected with distinct genotypes of B. burgdorferi, suggesting that genotypic differences in the infecting spirochetes play a key role in the pathogenesis and development of clinical disease."

Investigations of the cerebrospinal fluid for signs of inflammation and borrelial antibodies were negative, and the patient did not benefit from repeated antibiotic treatment. Electrophysiologic studies and sural nerve biopsy showed axonal neuropathy consistent with a paraneoplastic syndrome. Further workup revealed mediastinal Hodgkin's disease (HD; nodular sclerosing subtype) Ann Arbor stage II and non-small cell cancer of the lung (stage T1N0M0). Surgical resection of the lung cancer and combined chemo- and radiotherapy for HD resulted in complete remission of both malignancies. While the preexisting neurologic symptoms persisted during treatment, neurography showed some improvement of the distal nerves. During radiation therapy the patient developed transient left-sided brachial plexopathy. This case illustrates that the diagnosis of borreliosis in patients with isolated painful peripheral neuritis cannot be based solely upon positive IgG titers and supports the requirement for a thorough workup for an underlying--potentially curable--disease. In addition, singular pulmonary lesions in the setting of HD should be suspected to have a separate cause."

		"abstract": "Since very little is known about the clinical expression of Lyme borreliosis in Western Europe, a 3-year prospective study was conducted that included all patients seen for suspected Lyme borreliosis at the Strasbourg University Hospital in northeastern France. The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis was made on the basis of the presence of erythema migrans or on the basis of another suggestive clinical manifestation and laboratory confirmation. A total of 132 patients, 70 women and 62 men, mean age 54 years, had Lyme borreliosis according to these criteria. Within this study group, 77% of the patients were regularly exposed to tick bites and 64% could remember one. Erythema migrans, the most frequent clinical manifestation, occurred in 60% of the patients and was the only sign of Lyme borreliosis in 40%. Lymphocytoma and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans were rare (1 and 3 patients, respectively). Nervous system involvement (mainly radiculoneuropathy), the second most common clinical manifestation, was found in 40% of the patients and was the only sign of Lyme borreliosis in 22%. Musculoskeletal involvement was present in 26% of the patients and was an isolated finding in 14%. During the study period, no patient was diagnosed with Lyme carditis. There was serological evidence of Lyme borreliosis in 75% of the cases and direct evidence of borrelial infection in 10 (7.5%). The results show that the clinical expression of Lyme borreliosis in northeastern France is similar to that in other European countries but different from that in North America."

In this study, we demonstrate that changes in B. burgdorferi-specific immunologic responses associated with pregnancy can alter the outcome of Lyme arthritis in mice. Whereas nonpregnant female C3H mice consistently developed severe Lyme arthritis, pregnant mice had a marked reduction in arthritis severity that was associated with a slight reduction in IFN-gamma and markedly increased levels of IL-4 production by B. burgdorferi-specific T cells. Similar reductions in arthritis severity and patterns of cytokine production were observed in nonpregnant, progesterone-implanted mice. Ab neutralization of IL-4 in progesterone-implanted mice resulted in severe arthritis. Our results are consistent with the known shift toward Th2 cytokine expression at the maternal-fetal interface, and are the first to show a pregnancy-related therapeutic effect in an infectious model."

Here we examined B. burgdorferi-tick interactions in vivo by using Abs directed against OspA from each of the three major B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies: B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii. Abs directed against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (isolate N40) destroy the spirochete and can protect mice from infection. In contrast, antisera raised against OspA from B. afzelii (isolate ACA-1) and B. garinii (isolate ZQ-1) bind to B. burgdorferi N40 but are not borreliacidal against the N40 isolate. Our present studies assess whether these selected OspA Abs interfere with B. burgdorferi-tick attachment in a murine model of Lyme disease with I. scapularis. We examined engorged ticks that had fed on B. burgdorferi N40-infected scid mice previously treated with OspA (N40, ACA-1, ZQ-1, or mAb C3.78) or control Abs. OspA-N40 antisera or mAb C3.78 destroyed B. burgdorferi N40 within the engorged ticks. In contrast, treatment of mice with OspA-ACA-1 and OspA-ZQ-1 antisera did not kill B. burgdorferi N40 within the ticks but did effectively interfere with B. burgdorferi-I. scapularis adherence, thereby preventing efficient colonization of the vector. These studies show that nonborreliacidal OspA Abs can inhibit B. burgdorferi attachment to the tick gut, highlighting the importance of OspA in spirochete-arthropod interactions in vivo."

Here we demonstrate that the two borrelial genospecies show different binding of the two important human complement regulators, FHL-1/reconectin and Factor H. All serum-resistant B. afzelii isolates bound FHL-1/reconectin and also Factor H, and all analyzed serum-sensitive B. garinii isolates showed no or a significantly lower binding activity. Using recombinant deletion mutants, the binding domains were localized to the C terminus of FHL-1/reconectin to short consensus repeats 5-7. The borrelial binding proteins were located in the surface of the bacteria as demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining of intact, serum-exposed bacteria and by enrichment of outer membrane proteins. The surface-attached complement regulators maintained complement regulatory activity as demonstrated in a cofactor assay. By ligand blotting two different borrelial binding proteins were identified that were responsible for the surface attachment of FHL-1/reconectin and Factor H. These borrelial complement regulators acquiring surface proteins (CRASP) were further characterized as either CRASP-1, a 27.5-kDa molecule which preferentially binds FHL-1/reconectin and which was present in all serum-resistant borreliae, or CRASP-2, a 20/21-kDa protein which interacts preferentially with Factor H and the expression of which was more restricted, being detected in four of the six isolates analyzed. In summary, we describe a new immune evasion mechanism of B. burgdorferi, as these bacteria acquire human complement regulators to control complement activation on their surface and to prevent formation of toxic activation products."

Upon hospitalization, all patients presented erythema migrans. Isolates were typed using ribosomal DNA PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the rrfA-rrlB intergenic spacer. Of the 41 isolates typed, 37 belonged to Borrelia afzelii, 2 to Borrelia garinii, and 2 to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, performed on 21 strains (13 new isolates and 8 controls), revealed different RFLP patterns within the B. garinii and B. afzelii strains; among the five B. garinii strains and the 12 B. afzelii strains, three or two different RFLP patterns were identified, according to the restriction enzyme used. The protein patterns of the new isolates confirmed their genotypic classification and revealed the level of expression of some immunodominant proteins like OspA and other characteristic Osps. These findings constitute the first report of such a high recovery rate of B. burgdorferi from patients in a very restricted area in Italy; they also indicate the predominance of the genospecies B. afzelii in the study area and the heterogeneity of the circulating strains."

A total of 3,426 Ixodes ricinus and 1,267 Ixodes persulcatus specimens were collected, and dark-field microscopy showed that 265 (11.5%) I. ricinus and 333 (26.3%) I. persulcatus ticks were positive. From these samples, 472 dark-field-positive and 159 dark-field-negative ticks were subjected to PCR and subsequent reverse line blot hybridization. Fifty-four ticks (8.6%) carried Ehrlichia species, and 4 (0.6%) carried ehrlichiae belonging to the Ehrlichia phagocytophila complex, which includes the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent. The E. phagocytophila complex and an Ehrlichia-like species were detected only in I. ricinus whereas Ehrlichia muris was found exclusively in I. persulcatus, indicating a possible vector-specific infection. Borrelia garinii was found predominantly in I. persulcatus, but Borrelia afzelii was evenly distributed among the two tick species. Only two I. ricinus ticks carried B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, while Borrelia valaisiana and a newly identified B. afzelii-like species were found in 1.7 and 2.5% of all ticks, respectively. Of the dark-field-positive ticks, only 64.8% yielded a Borrelia PCR product, indicating that dark-field microscopy may detect organisms other than B. burgdorferi sensu lato. These observations show that the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis may be present in ticks in the Baltic regions of Russia and that clinicians should be aware of this agent as a cause of febrile disease."

We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a new commercial ELISA in detecting anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies for the diagnosis of RA. Anti-CCP antibodies were determined in 330 serum samples: 98 from RA patients and 232 from controls, including patients with connective tissue diseases, other rheumatic diseases, viral infections, Lyme disease, autoimmune thyroiditis, cancer, and monoclonal gammopathy, and sex- and age-matched healthy subjects. Intra- and interassay CVs were 5-13% and 9-17%, respectively. Rheumatoid factor (RF) was also assayed in every sample, and results were compared to anti-CCP for sensitivity and specificity. At a cutoff value of 50 units, sensitivity was 41% (confidence interval, 31-50%) and specificity was 97.8% (95-100%). Anti-CCP-positive RA patients had a mean antibody concentration of 1100 units (range, 57-3419 units), and anti-CCP-negative RA patients and controls had mean values of 7.6 and 6.8 units, respectively (range, 1-39 units). The area under the ROC curve was 0.71 (95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.78). RF had a higher sensitivity (62%) and a lower specificity (84%) than anti-CCP. When the two antibodies were used together, specificity was 99.6%. Anti-CCP antibody testing may be useful if performed concomitantly with RF assay to diagnose patients with suspected early RA."

Borrelia lonestari sp nov, an uncultured spirochete, has been detected in A. americanum ticks by DNA amplification techniques, but its role in human illness is unknown. We observed erythema migrans in a patient with an attached A. americanum tick. DNA amplification of the flagellin gene flaB produced B. lonestari sequences from the skin of the patient that were identical to those found in the attached tick. B. lonestari is a probable cause of erythema migrans in humans."

		"abstract": "These studies addressed the hypothesis that UV radiation (UVR) could affect immune responses in mice infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. Immunity against the Lyme spirochete B. burgdorferi was studied in a murine model of UV-induced immune suppression. Borrelia-specific cellular and humoral responses were examined following immunosuppressive doses of UVR. Low-passage Borrelia were injected intradermally at the base of the tail following irradiation. At various time points after infection the blood was cultured for the presence of Borrelia and the serum analyzed for Borrelia-specific antibodies. Two weeks after infection one hind-limb joint was cultured for the presence of spirochetes and the contralateral joint was examined histologically for arthritis formation. The results demonstrated that UV irradiation, administered at the site of infection or at a distant site, suppressed Borrelia-specific cellular and humoral responses in infected mice. Suppression of delayed-type hypersensitivity and antibody responses to UV was abrogated by administration of anti-interleukin (IL)-10 after UV irradiation. In addition, UV irradiation altered the dissemination pattern of the bacteria from the skin into the blood and exacerbated arthritis when compared with unirradiated controls. From these studies we concluded that UV irradiation can modulate the immune response to Borrelia and exacerbate the subsequent arthritic component of Lyme disease in mice. Furthermore, our studies suggest that IL-10 is in part responsible for the suppression of both cellular and humoral responses in addition to playing a role in the development of Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, differ in their susceptibility to normal human serum and are consequently classified as complement-resistant, complement-sensitive and intermediate complement-sensitive. Most isolates belonging to the genospecies B. afzelii are complement-resistant, while particularly B. garinii isolates were rapidly killed by complement. In general, isolates of the genospecies B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) are intermediate complement-sensitive. Independent of the genospecies, all Borreliae were capable to activate the classical and/or the alternative pathway. Deposition of the activation products C3, C6, and TCC is much stronger by B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. garinii isolates than by B. afzelii isolates. The mechanism(s) on how Borreliae evade complement-mediated bacteriolysis has recently been described by showing that complement-resistant B. afzelii isolates but not the complement-sensitive B. garinii isolates absorb human complement regulators FHL-1/reconectin and factor H. Surface-attached FHL-1/reconectin maintains its complement regulatory activity and supports factor I-mediated C3b cleavage to iC3b. In complement-resistant Borreliae, two outer surface proteins, the 27.5 kDa (CRASP-1, complement regulator-acquiring surface protein 1) and the 20/21 kDa (CRASP-2), are responsible for the surface attachment of the two complement regulators. CRASP-1, which is present in complement-resistant Borreliae, binds preferentially FHL-1/reconectin while CRASP-2, which is restrictively expressed, binds preferentially factor H. Thus, complement-resistant Borreliae bind human complement regulators and control complement activation on their surface and prevent the formation of toxic activation products."

Few studies, however, have used Western blot analyses to confirm the serological diagnosis. To analyze the prevalence of anti-Borrelia antibodies in patients with APFP compared with healthy control subjects living in Hokkaido Island, Japan. In total, 113 patients with APFP were analyzed. They included 32 patients with varicella zoster virus (VZV) reactivation (Ramsay Hunt syndrome and zoster sine herpete) and 81 patients with Bell's palsy. Fifty-eight healthy control subjects were also included. IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia garinii and afzelii were tested by Western blot, and diagnoses were made according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. Five of 81 (6.2%) patients with Bell's palsy, 1 of 32 (3.1%) patients with VZV reactivation, and 1 of 58 control subjects (1.7%) were judged to have both IgM and IgG antibodies to Borrelia. This difference was not significant (P >.05, chi2 test). Patients with Bell's palsy who had herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) reactivation at the onset of palsy had a higher IgM-immunoreactivity to Borrelia afzelii. Although it is one of the endemic areas of Lyme disease in Japan, the prevalence of APFP caused by Lyme borreliosis is low in Hokkaido Island. In addition, cross-reactivity to B. afzelii in IgM blots is often observed in patients with HSV-1 reactivation, suggesting that careful interpretation of Borrelia IgM immunoblot data are needed for accurate serological diagnosis."

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis and Southern hybridization of the PFGE blot indicated that the vls locus of B. garinii A87SA, consisting of at least eight vls cassettes, was located on a 21-kb linear plasmid. The size of the three complete vls cassettes varied from 573 to 612 bp. They had 93.8-94.3% identity at the nucleotide level and 84.9-87.3% amino acid identity. The amino acid sequences of the three vls cassettes of B. garinii A87SA exhibited 45.9-50.8% identity to the VlsE sequence of B. burgdorferi B31, and 30.0-33.8% identity to the VMP17 sequence of B. hermsii HS1. Homologues of the vls locus of B. garinii were detected by dot blot hybridization among 24 of the 30 (80.0%) isolates representing four B. burgdorferi sensu lato species distributed widely in Europe. Our findings indicate that B. garinii might possess a similar vls structure to that described in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The highly conserved nature of the vls locus among various B. burgdorferi sensu lato species suggests that it may be important in the physiology and pathogenesis of Lyme disease spirochetes."

The aim of this study was to determine whether the two organisms occur simultaneously in joint material from patients with arthritis. Seventy six patients with unexplained arthritis were prospectively studied. Synovial fluid was obtained from all patients and examined for DNA from C trachomatis and B burgdorferi using specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols. Data concerning prior genitourinary infection or a history of tick bite were recorded and serum antibodies to C trachomatis and B burgdorferi were determined. Six patients (8%) had DNA from both C trachomatis and B burgdorferi in the same synovial fluid specimen (mean leucocyte count 11.925/mm(3), 65% granulocytes). These patients (four men, two women; mean age 33.7 years) all had oligoarthritis of the knee, ankle, or both (mean disease duration 11.3 months). From the history and serological examination, four patients had some evidence of actual or previous infection with one or other of the bacteria, while the other two patients had a positive serological test for Chlamydia only. DNA from two different microorganisms which are known to be triggering agents for arthritis may be present simultaneously in joint material from patients with unexplained oligoarthritis. This finding raises the question as to whether, in such cases, one or both bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease or whether they are only innocent bystanders."

The presence or absence of spirochetes in relationship to host cellular immune responses was determined from the time of intradermal inoculation to the time of erythema migrans (EM) development (approximately 7 days in naive rabbits) and through development of challenge immunity (approximately 5 months in naive rabbits). Skin biopsies were obtained and analyzed for the presence of spirochetes, B cells, T cells, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and macrophages by immunohistochemical techniques. In infected naive animals, morphologically identifiable spirochetes were detected at 2 h and up to 3 weeks postinfection. At 12 and 24 h postinfection there was a marked PMN response that decreased by 36 to 48 h; by 72 h the PMNs were replaced by a few infiltrating macrophages. At the time of EM development and 14 days postinfection, the PMNs and macrophages were replaced by a lymphocytic infiltrate. There was a greater number of spirochetes at 14 days, a time when EM had resolved, than at 7 days postinfection. By 3 weeks postinfection there were few organisms and lymphocytes detectable. In contrast to infected naive rabbits, intact spirochetes were never visualized in skin biopsies from infection-immune rabbits; only spirochetal antigen was detected at 2, 12, and 24 h in the presence of a numerous PMN infiltrate. By 36 h postchallenge, spirochetal antigen could not be detected and the PMN response was replaced by a few infiltrating macrophages. By 72 h postchallenge, PMNs and macrophages were absent from the skin; B and T cells were never detected at any time point in skin from infection-immune rabbits. The destruction of spirochetes in immune animals in the presence of PMNs and in the absence of a lymphocytic infiltrate suggests that infection-derived immunity is antibody mediated."

IFN-gammaR(-/-) and parental 129/SvEv mice developed mild arthritis of similar severity, as determined both by weekly tibiotarsal joint measurements and histopathology at 2 and 5 weeks postinfection. Both strains of mice had the same spirochetal burden in the joints, suggesting that the IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice were not impaired in controlling spirochetal expansion in vivo. The wild-type mice mounted a Th1 response, with a predominance of CD4(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells observed by flow cytometry. In contrast, the IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice mounted a Th2 response, with a predominance of CD4(+) IL-4(+) T cells. As expected given their cytokine profile, the IFN-gammaR(-/-) mice produced fewer CD8(+) IFN-gamma(+) and MAC-1(+) IL-12(+) cells and less immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) than their wild-type counterparts. These results strongly suggest that IFN-gamma is not required for arthritis resistance or as part of an effective immune response against B. burgdorferi."

		"abstract": "The most characteristic features of the Lyme disease pathogens, the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) group, are their ability to invade tissues and to circumvent the immune defenses of the host for extended periods of time, despite elevated levels of borrelia-specific antibodies in serum and other body fluids. Our aim in the present study was to determine whether B. burgdorferi is able to interfere with complement (C) at the level of C3 by accelerating C3b inactivation and thus to inhibit the amplification of the C cascade. Strains belonging to different genospecies (Borrelia garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and Borrelia afzelii) were compared for their sensitivities to normal human serum and abilities to promote factor I-mediated C3b degradation. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii strains were found to be serum resistant. When the spirochetes were incubated with radiolabeled C3b, factor I-mediated degradation of C3b was observed in the presence of C-resistant B. afzelii (n = 3) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (n = 1) strains but not in the presence of C-sensitive B. garinii (n = 7) strains or control bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). Immunoblotting and radioligand binding analyses showed that the C-resistant strains had the capacity to acquire the C inhibitors factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) from growth medium and human serum. A novel surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was found to preferentially bind to the N terminus region of factor H. Thus, the serum-resistant B. burgdorferi s.l. strains can circumvent C attack by binding the C inhibitors factor H and FHL-1 to their surfaces and promoting factor I-mediated C3b degradation."

		"abstract": "Numerous studies have provided suggestive evidence that the loss of plasmids correlates with the loss of infectivity of the Lyme disease spirochetes. In this study we have further investigated this correlation. Clonal populations were obtained from the skin of a mouse infected for 3 months with a clonal population of Borrelia burgdorferi B31MI. The complete plasmid compositions of these populations were determined using a combination of PCR and Southern hybridization. The infectivities of clones differing in plasmid composition were tested using the C3H-HeJ murine model for Lyme disease. While several clones were found to be noninfectious, a correlation between the loss of a specific plasmid and loss of infectivity in the clones analyzed in this report was not observed. While it is clear from recent studies that the loss of some specific plasmids results in attenuated virulence, this study demonstrates that additional mechanisms also contribute to the loss of infectivity."

		"abstract": "In previous studies we have characterized the cp32/18 loci in Borrelia burgdorferi 297 which encode OspE and OspF orthologs and a third group of lipoproteins which possess OspE/F-like leader peptides (Elps). To further these studies, we have comprehensively analyzed their patterns of expression throughout the borrelial enzootic cycle. Serial dilution reverse transcription-PCR analysis indicated that although a shift in temperature from 23 to 37 degrees C induced transcription for all nine genes analyzed, this effect was often markedly enhanced in mammalian host-adapted organisms cultivated within dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted within the peritoneal cavities of rats. Indirect immunofluorescence assays performed on temperature-shifted, in vitro-cultivated spirochetes and organisms in the midguts of unfed and fed ticks revealed distinct expression profiles for many of the OspE-related, OspF-related, and Elp proteins. Other than BbK2.10 and ElpA1, all were expressed by temperature-shifted organisms, while only OspE, ElpB1, OspF, and BbK2.11 were expressed in the midguts of fed ticks. Additionally, although mRNA was detected for all nine lipoprotein-encoding genes, two of these proteins (BbK2.10 and ElpA1) were not expressed by spirochetes cultivated in vitro, within DMCs, or by spirochetes within tick midguts. However, the observation that B. burgdorferi-infected mice generated specific antibodies against BbK2.10 and ElpA1 indicated that these antigens are expressed only in the mammalian host and that a form of posttranscriptional regulation is involved. Analysis of the upstream regions of these genes revealed several differences between their promoter regions, the majority of which were found in the -10 and -35 hexamers and the spacer regions between them. Also, rather than undergoing simultaneous upregulation during tick feeding, these genes and the corresponding lipoproteins appear to be subject to progressive recruitment or enhancement of expression as B. burgdorferi is transmitted from its tick vector to the mammalian host. These findings underscore the potential relevance of these molecules to the pathogenic events of early Lyme disease."

The purified spirochetes were motile and 10- to 20-fold purer than the bacteria in crude tick homogenates. The purified bacteria were present in sufficient quantity for protein and gene expression studies. In comparison to culture-grown bacteria, tick-borne spirochetes had several proteins that were upregulated and a few that were downregulated. When the levels of B. burgdorferi outer surface proteins OspA and OspC were measured, OspC protein and mRNA levels were lower in cultured bacteria than in bacteria purified from ticks. Although differences in OspA mRNA levels were observed between cultured and tick-borne bacteria, no differences were observed at the protein level. These experiments demonstrate that tick-transmitted borreliae display a gene expression and antigen profile different from that of spirochetes cultured in vitro."

Laboratory diagnostics of ehrlichiosis was based on hematological examination of blood, on anamnestic and epidemiological data, on indirect immunofluorescence serology verified using Western blot test with specific antigen and by determination of DNA agents using polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR). From 37 goal-directed examinations done in years 1998-2000, bacteria Ehrlichia chaffeensis was found to be the cause of human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) in two patients who had stayed in Bulgaria, USA and Thailand. DNA of E. chaffeensis was confirmed by PCR with subsequent product sequentiation (determination of the order of pairs of the oligonucleotide bases). In both patients monocytosis and positive antibodies in indirect immunofluorescence were found. The agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) caused by group Ehrlichia phagocytophila was determined in three serologically positive patients using PCR and Western blot test with specific antigen P44. Cocobacils were identified electronmicroscopically in intracytoplasmatic vacuoles of isolated leukocytes. Coincidence of Borrelia afzelii and Ehrlichia sp. was found in the blood of a woman patient with erythema migrans formed in the place where from the tick's nymph was removed one week earlier. Cutaneous manifestations were accompanied by subfebrilia, myalgia and gastroenteritis. The patient was positive for both agents in Western blood and PCR. DNA of Borrelia and Ehrlichia was isolated from the patient's blood and urine in the first week of illness. Further study and an increase of sensitivity of the g. Borrelia and Ehrlichia cultivation become necessary to clarify the role of ehrlichias in the disease in our conditions."

The study was performed in 42 patients, residents of Podlasie province, who were initially evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence assay as a seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Antibodies against particular antigens of B. afzelii were demonstrated using a Western-blot technique. Evaluation of results showed the most frequent prevalence of antibodies against 41 kDa antigen in majority of patients, which were predominantly of IgM class in patients with short-lasting lesions, and IgG class in patients with long-lasting lesions. Results of IgM blots were recognized as a positive in 26 patients, and IgG blots in 22 patients. Positive result in at least one class of antibodies was noted in 34 patients (81%), and in both classes in 14 (33%). IgM antibodies against 21 kDa antigen, and IgG antibodies against 43 kDa antigen were two fold more frequent in patients with short-lasting lesions. These results confirm the diagnostic usefulness of determination of antibodies against B. afzelii antigens in Poland. The most important for an early diagnosis can be simultaneous demonstration of IgM antibodies against 21 and 41 kDa antigens."

One strategy for such survival may be the down-regulation of the immune system. To test this, we evaluated the degree of macrophage activation in a site of active disease-the heart-by examining cytokine expression in murine macrophages from control and B. burgdorferi-infected animals. Using double-label immunofluorescent staining in situ, we showed that infiltrating macrophages in infected hearts produce interleukin (IL)-1. By semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, increased levels of mRNA were measured for the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-12 during peak and resolving disease. No increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta were detected. In an infected site without active disease--the peritoneal cavity--no increases in levels of proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines were detected in local macrophages. Thus, there is no evidence of pressure toward the down-regulation of inflammatory activity in the regions tested."

Mice models of Lyme disease have been developed, however their electrophysiologic (EP) properties of conduction are unknown.

In a first phase of the study, 40 male C3H/J mice were divided into 2 groups: Group (A) mice were infected at age 3 (weeks) and studied at 5, and Group (B) mice were infected at 9 and studied at 11. In a second phase, 36 female mice were divided into 2 groups: Group (C) mice were infected at 3 weeks and studied at 5, and Group (D) mice were infected at 3 and studied at 11. Infected mice of group (A) and (C) had wider QRS complexes (21.0+/-1.6 versus 17.3+/-1.3ms, p< or =0.0001 and 20.3+/-2.1 versus 18.5+/-1.7, p = 0.05, respectively) compared to the healthy controls (HC). Infected mice of group (B) and group (D) were similar to the HC. In all groups, the presence of conduction abnormalities correlated very closely with the amount of inflammation on pathology. This study describes the first EP mouse model of Lyme carditis. C3H/J mice exhibit conduction abnormalities that are reversible 8 weeks after inoculation, closely paralleling the resolution of inflammation on pathology. This model can be a valuable tool in the developing and testing of new modalities for the prevention and treatment of Lyme carditis."

The diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis based on clinical features was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot. The assays of sCD4, sCD8 and sCD25 concentrations were performed using Endogen (USA) kits. In group I the sCD4 level decreased in examination 2 (p < 0.001) compared to examination 1. The mean concentration of sCD8 in initial examination 1 in group II was higher than in controls (p < 0.0001); it decreased in examination 2 but was still higher (p < 0.01) than in controls (p < 0.006). Prior to treatment mean sCD25 concentration in group II was higher compared to controls (p < 0.0008) like in examination 2 after treatment (p < 0.02) and this persisted. The mean value of sCD8 in initial examination 1 before treatment in group II was higher than in group I (p < 0.00001). Increased initial concentrations of sCD8 and sCD25 indicate the activation of CD8 and CD25 lymphocytes and their role in immunopathogenesis of Lyme disease. Elevated levels of sCD8 in group II before and after treatment suggest a significant involvement of CD8 lymphocytes, indicating the role of long-lasting cellular response in this stage of Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "In about 10% of patients with Lyme arthritis in the United States, joint inflammation persists for months or even several years after the apparent eradication of the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, from the joint with antibiotic treatment. We propose a model of molecular mimicry affecting genetically susceptible individuals to explain this treatment-resistant course. The majority of patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis have HLA-DRB1*0401 or related alleles, and the severity and duration of their arthritis correlate with cellular and humoral immune responses to outer-surface protein A OspA) of the spirochete. Using an algorithm, the immunodominant epitope of OspA presented by the DRB1*0401 molecule was predicted to be located at aa 165-173. In a search of the Genetics Computer Group gene bank, only one human protein was identified, lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (hLFA-1), that had sequence homology with OspA(165-173)and predicted binding in the DRB1*0401 molecule. Synovial fluid T cells from most patients with treatment-resistant arthritis responded to both OspA and hLFA-1, whereas those from patients with other forms of chronic inflammatory arthritis did not. Molecular mimicry between a dominant T cell epitope of OspA and hLFA-1 may be an important factor in the persistence of joint inflammation in genetically susceptible patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "The concept of molecular mimicry provides and elegant framework as to how cross-reactivity between antigens from a foreign agent with self proteins may trigger autoimmune diseases. While it was previously thought that sequence and structural homology between foreign and self proteins or the sharing of T cell receptor (TCR) and MHC-binding motifs are required for molecular mimicry to occur, we have shown that even completely unrelated peptide sequences may lead to cross-recognition by T cells. The use of synthetic combinatorial peptide libraries in the positional scanning format (PS-SCL) together with novel biometric prediction approaches has allowed us to describe the recognition profiles of individual autoreactive T cell clones (TCC) with unprecedented accuracy. Through studies of myelin-specific TCC as well as clones from the nervous system of patients suffering from chronic central nervous (CNS) Lyme disease it has become clear that at least some T cells are more degenerate than previously anticipated. These data will not only help us to redefine what constitutes specific T cell recognition, but also allow us to study in more detail the biological role of molecular mimicry. A recent clinical trial with an altered peptide ligand (APL) of one of the candidate myelin basic protein (MBP) epitopes in MS (amino acids 83-99) has shown that such a modified MBP peptide may not only have therapeutic efficacy, but also bears the potential to exacerbate disease. Thus, we provide firm evidence that the basic principles of cross-recognition and their pathogenetic significance are relevant in MS."

This single-layer beta-sheet segment (beta-strands 8-10) is highly stable in solution, although it is exposed to the solvent on both faces of the sheet and thus it does not contain a hydrophobic core. Here, we tested whether interactions with the C-terminal domain are essential for the formation of the single-layer beta-sheet. We characterized the solution structure, dynamics and stability of an OspA fragment corresponding to beta-strands 1-12 (termed OspA[27-163]), which lacks a majority of the C-terminal globular domain. Analyses of NMR chemical shifts and backbone nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities showed that OspA[27-163] is folded except the 12th and final beta-strand. (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear NOE measurements and amide H-(2)H exchange revealed that the single-layer beta-sheet in this fragment is more flexible than the corresponding region in full-length OspA. Thermal-denaturation experiments using differential scanning calorimetry and NMR spectroscopy revealed that the N-terminal globular domain in the fragment has a conformational stability similar to that of the same region in the full-length protein, and that the single-layer beta-sheet region also has a modest thermal stability. These results demonstrate that the unique single-layer beta-sheet retains its conformation in the absence of its interactions with the C-terminal domain. This fragment is significantly smaller than the full-length OspA, and thus it is expected to facilitate studies of the folding mechanism of this unusual beta-sheet structure."

Lyme disease is a zoonosis due to infection by Borrelia burdorferi transmitted by ticks. The multiple phases of the disease explain the polymorphism of the clinical manifestations. Usually, extrahepatic symptoms are first observed, including neurological tropisms of Borrelia burdorferi.

Serologic survey. Serum samples from 277 dogs in animal shelters and veterinary hospitals in Rhode Island. Overall, 143 (52%) dogs were seropositive for B burgdorferi, 59 (21.3%) were seropositive for R rickettsii, 40 (14.4%) were seropositive for the HGE agent, 8 (2.9%) were seropositive for E canis, and 6 (2.2%) were seropositive for B vinsonii. Regression analysis indicated that the natural logarithm of nymphal deer tick abundance was correlated with rate of seropositivity to the HGE agent and to B burgdorferi but not to rate of seropositivity to R rickettsii, E canis, or B vinsonii. Percentages of samples seropositive for B burgdorferi, R rickettsii, the HGE agent, and E canis were significantly higher for samples from the southwestern part of the state where ticks in general and deer ticks in particular are abundant than for samples from the northern and eastern portions of the state, where ticks are relatively rare. Results suggested that all 5 disease agents are in Rhode Island and pose a risk to dogs and humans. Knowledge concerning tick distributions may be useful in predicting the pattern of disease associated with particular tick species and may aid diagnostic, prevention, and control efforts."

To assess their importance as a cause of nonspecific fever, we recruited patients with febrile illness at 10 clinics in northwestern Wisconsin from May through August of both 1997 and 1998. Eligible patients had a temperature >38.0 degrees C but no rash or other localizing source. Acute and convalescent serological tests were performed for Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti, and Ehrlichia equi; polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect granulocytic Ehrlichia rDNA. Seventeen (27%) of 62 eligible patients had laboratory evidence of tickborne infection, including 7 (11%) with probable Lyme disease only, 8 (13%) with HGE only, and 2 (3%) with apparent coinfection. No patients with Babesia infection were identified. Patients with and without tickborne infection were similar with regard to age, sex, symptoms, history of tick bite, and outdoor exposure. The results suggest that tickborne infections are an important cause of nonspecific febrile illness during the tick season in northwestern Wisconsin."

This technique is currently used in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis in our laboratory. Ninety-three patients, either examined in our outpatient clinic or coming from other clinical centres, were divided in two groups on the basis of a correlation between clinical picture and serologic tests (ELISA and Western Blot): 42 patients were true positives (tp) and 51 true negatives (tn). The samples (77 sera, 16 cerebrospinal fluids) have been tested with the above PCR technique. The results obtained were used to calculate the SE, SP, PPV and NPV. Subsequently, 13 urine samples of patients with negative serum PCR were examined with the same technique. A high SP and a low SE, high PPV and a considerably lower NPV have been reported. 50% of the PCR positive results, obtained with serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples corresponded to patients who were true positives at clinical examination but negatives at serologic tests. 62.5% of urine samples positive results belonged to tp patients who had negative serologic and serum PCR RESULTS. The obtained results suggested a good reliability of positive results obtained with the PCR technique used in this study and allowed the false negatives of serologic tests to be detected, more specifically when urine samples were used."

Lyme serology was performed by ELISA and western blotting. Urine samples were examined by an optimised nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. Only four of six uveitis patients suspected for Lyme borreliosis were ELISA positive, while all six subjects showed a positive western blot. B burgdorferi PCR was positive in all of these six patients. Whereas two of the 30 controls had a positive Lyme serology, B burgdorferi DNA was not detectable by PCR in any sample from these patients.

Even within regions where only one species is found, Lyme disease progresses very differently from one patient to another. Since Borrelia shows very little recombination either within or between species, alleles of a gene can be used to mark clones. The ospC gene is highly variable within each species and can be used to define groups of related clones. It has been previously shown that only four out of seventeen ospC groups of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto cause invasive forms of the disease. Other groups cause erythema migrans, a skin rash at the site of the tick bite, but not invasive disease, while still other groups seem to be nonpathogenic to humans. In this study we extend the analysis of the ospC gene to the other pathogenic species, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii. Only two groups in B. afzelii and four groups in B. garinii cause invasive disease. Thus, only ten out of the 58 defined ospC groups cause invasive and presumably chronic Lyme disease."

Standardized questionnaires with information both from owners and attending veterinarians accompanied each blood sample. The apparent seroprevalences to B. burgdorferi s. l. and granulocytic Ehrlichia spp. were 16.8 and 16.7%, respectively. The northern region had the lowest seroprevalences. Four logistic models were developed (controlling for demographic variables). In the disease model of seropositivity to B. burgdorferi s. l., age, breed, geographic region, the serologic titer to granulocytic Ehrlichia spp., season and the diagnosis coffin-joint arthritis were significant. In the tick-exposure model of B. burgdorferi s. l., pasture access the previous year and gender were significant. Age, racing activity, geographic region, season and the serologic titer to B. burgdorferi s. l. were associated with positivity to granulocytic Ehrlichia spp. In the tick-exposure model of granulocytic Ehrlichia spp., pasture access was a risk factor. An interaction between racing activity and geographic region showed that the risk of positive serologic reactions to Ehrlichia spp. was increased in the horse population in the south and middle of Sweden, but only among horses not used for racing. Except for the positive association between coffin-joint arthritis and serologic reactions to B. burgdorferi s. l., there were no significant associations in the multivariable models between non-specific or specific clinical sign or disease with seropositivity to either of these agents."

		"abstract": "Genetic transformation of Borrelia spp. is limited in development and has found application in only one species. For a non-genetic approach for manipulating the phenotype of these spirochaetes, we determined whether exogenous recombinant lipoproteins would incorporate in the cell's outer membrane. Using unlabelled or 125I-labelled Osp proteins, Osp-specific monoclonal antibodies, proteinase K and formaldehyde as reagents, we found that decoration of spirochaetes had the following characteristics. (i) Purified recombinant OspA or OspD lipoproteins associated with Borrelia burgdorferi and B. hermsii cells that lacked abundant lipoproteins of their own. (ii) This decoration of the cells with exogenous OspA did not affect cell's viability. (iii) The decoration was concentration and temperature dependent and stable for at least 24 h. (iv) Like native OspA, the recombinant OspA decorating the cells was accessible to antibodies and proteases and could be cross-linked to the integral outer membrane protein, P66. (v) Decoration of viable B. burgdorferi and B. hermsii with OspA rendered the cells susceptible to killing by OspA-specific antiserum. Such non-genetic alteration of the surface of a bacterium may be used to study functions and properties of lipoproteins in situ."

		"abstract": "The development of an effective vaccine for Lyme disease represents a major advance in the control of the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States. It has a definite place in the total approach to control of this disease. Its use should be restricted to individuals who are at moderate to high risk of exposure to infected vector ticks. Vaccinated individuals should not be complacent about other personal protection measures, because the vaccine is not uniformly effective and protective antibody levels decay rapidly. Booster doses will be necessary, but the intervals have not yet been determined. There is a theoretical concern about the possible induction of inflammatory arthritis through an autoimmune mechanism, but there is no evidence that this condition has clinical relevance. The impact of the current lawsuits on vaccine recommendations and use remains to be determined. Continued surveillance for rare long-term side effects should address the medical risk issue. Alternative primary vaccine administration schedules are currently under study, and could lead to regimens permitting achievement of protective immunity in 6 months or less. Vaccine is not approved for use in children under the age of 15 years."

Recent studies have suggested a transfer of maternal immunity to offspring as an induced response to the local presence of parasites in the environment, but evidence has been indirect. Here, we show the presence of antibodies against the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, a spirochaete transmitted by the seabird tick Ixodes uriae, in the eggs of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla. We report higher prevalence of antibodies against Borrelia in eggs from breeding areas with higher prevalence and abundance of ticks. Further, high repeatabilities of antibody-positive eggs within clutches and between first and replacement clutches show that, within a breeding season, females differ consistently with respect to the expression of this induced maternal response. Our results suggest that mothers can alter investment in their young depending on local conditions. Such maternal effects clearly have implications for the ecology and evolution of host-parasite interactions."

Overall nervous system involvement is also the predominant manifestation of Lyme disease in children, chiefly as facial palsy and/or aseptic meningitis. The medical records of ten patients with discharge diagnosis of facial palsy associated to borreliosis were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnostic criteria for borreliosis included acute peripheral facial palsy associated with erythema migrans (1/10) and/or positive Lyme serology in serum (10/10) or CSF (6/10). Facial palsy was associated with a high rate (9/10) of occult meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid findings showed lymphocytic pleocytosis associated to moderate increased protein level. PCR assays displayed a very low sensitivity. All patients with meningitis were treated with intravenous ceftriaxone for 3 weeks and received their treatment as outpatients with an heparinised venous catheter. Our study confirm that borreliosis should be considered in every case of peripheral facial palsy and based on the high rate of occult meningitis, we also advocate to perform a lumbar puncture. Although long term prognosis of facial palsy associated with Lyme disease in children appears excellent, current treatment recommendations advocate prolonged antibiotic therapy."

		"abstract": "Reactive arthritis (ReA) is definitely caused by an infection. Several observations suggest that the triggering microbe may persist in the tissues of the patient for a prolonged time. The obvious conclusion is to consider antibacterial treatment. In two instances antibacterial agents are of definite value: in the primary and secondary prevention of rheumatic fever and for early eradication of Borrelia burgdorferi in order to prevent development of the arthritis associated with Lyme disease. Altogether, clinical and experimental data exist to indicate that if antibacterial treatment of ReA can be started very early during the pathogenetic process, the disease can be prevented or the prognosis improved. In fully developed ReA, the value of antibacterial agents is less certain. All available evidence indicates that short term antibacterial treatment has no effect on the prognosis and final outcome of ReA, and the results with long term administration of antibacterials are also overall poor. In some instances sulfasalazine appears useful, rather as a result of its antirheumatic effect or influence on an underlying inflammatory bowel disease than its action as an antibacterial agent. Tetracyclines have also been found to have an effect on ReA, but again, this is probably due to their anti-inflammatory action rather than any antibacterial effect."

We have characterized two isogenic serotypes, A and B, which differ in their variable small proteins (Vsps) and disease manifestations. Serotype A but not serotype B was cultured from the brain during early infection, and serotype B caused more severe arthritis, myocarditis, and vestibular dysfunction than serotype A. Here we compared the localization and number of spirochetes and the severity of inflammation in scid mice, using immunostained and hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained coronal sections of decalcified heads. Spirochetes in the brain localized predominantly to the leptomeninges, and those in peripheral tissues localized mainly to the extracellular matrix. There were significantly more serotype A than B spirochetes in the leptomeninges and more serotype B than A spirochetes in the skin. The first tissue where spirochetes were observed outside the vasculature was the dura mater. Inflammation was more severe in the skin than in the brain. VspA, VspB, and the periplasmic flagellin protein were expressed in all tissues examined. These findings indicate that isogenic but antigenically distinct Borrelia serotypes can have marked differences in their localization in tissues."

We investigated the influence of dual infection with B. burgdorferi and the HGE agent on the course of murine Lyme arthritis and granulocytic ehrlichiosis. Coinfection resulted in increased levels of both pathogens and more severe Lyme arthritis compared with those in mice infected with B. burgdorferi alone. The increase in bacterial burden during dual infection was associated with enhanced acquisition of both organisms by larval ticks that were allowed to engorge upon infected mice. Coinfection also resulted in diminished interleukin-12 (IL-12), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha levels and elevated IL-6 levels in murine sera. During dual infection, IFN-gamma receptor expression on macrophages was also reduced, implying a decrease in phagocyte activation. These results suggest that coinfection of mice with B. burgdorferi and the HGE agent modulates host immune responses, resulting in increased bacterial burden, Lyme arthritis, and pathogen transmission to the vector."

Mouse antiserum to a 51-mer synthetic peptide (Ct) which reproduced the entire sequence of the C-terminal invariable domain of VlsE from B. burgdorferi strain B31 was reacted on immunoblots with whole-cell lysates extracted from spirochetes of 12 strains from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. The antiserum recognized only VlsE from strain B31, indicating that epitopes of this domain differed among these strains. When Ct was used as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigen, all of the seven monkeys and six mice that were infected with B31 spirochetes produced a strong antibody response to this peptide, indicating that the C-terminal invariable domain is immunodominant. None of 12 monkeys and only 11 of 26 mice that were infected with strains other than B31 produced a detectable anti-Ct response, indicating a limited antigenic conservation of this domain among these strains. Twenty-six of 33 dogs that were experimentally infected by tick inoculation were positive by the Ct ELISA, while only 5 of 18 serum samples from dogs clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease contained detectable anti-Ct antibody. Fifty-seven of 64 serum specimens that were collected from American patients with Lyme disease were positive by the Ct ELISA, while only 12 of 21 European samples contained detectable anti-Ct antibody. In contrast, antibody to the more conserved invariable region IR(6) of VlsE was present in all of these dog and human serum samples."

A marked Ab and T cell response to BB: outer surface protein A (OspA) often develops during prolonged episodes of arthritis. Furthermore, cross-reaction between the bacterial OspA and human LFA-1alpha(L) at the T cell level and the inability to detect BB: in the joint implicate an autoimmune mechanism. To analyze the nature of response to OspA and LFA-1alpha(L), we used OspA-specific T cell hybrids from DR4 transgenic mice, as well as cloned human cells specific for OspA(165-184), the immunodominant epitope, from five DRB1*0401(+) patients, using OspA-MHC class II tetramers. Although OspA(165-184) stimulated nearly all OspA-specific human T cell clones tested to proliferate and secrete IFN-gamma and IL-13, LFA-1alpha(L326-345) stimulated approximately 10% of these clones to proliferate and a greater percentage to secrete IL-13. Assays with LFA- or OspA-DR4 monomers revealed that higher concentrations of LFA-DR4 were needed to stimulate dual-reactive T cell hybrids. Our analysis at the clonal level demonstrates that human LFA-1alpha(L326-345) behaves as a partial agonist, perhaps playing a role in perpetuating symptoms of arthritis."

BORRELIA: burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease (LD), expresses two surface-exposed decorin-binding adhesins, DbpA and DbpB. A decorin-deficient (Dcn(-/-)) mouse was recently developed and found to have a relatively mild phenotype. We have now examined the process of experimental LD in Dcn(-/-) mice using both needle inoculation and tick transmission of spirochetes. When exposed to low doses of the infective agent, Dcn(-/-) mice had fewer Borrelia-positive cultures from most tissues analyzed than did Dcn(+/+) or Dcn(+/-) mice. When the infection dose was increased, similar differences were not observed in most tissues but were seen in bacterial colonization of joints and the extent of Borreila-induced arthritis. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that joints harvested from Dcn(-/-) mice had diminished Borrelia numbers compared with issues harvested from Dcn(+/+) controls. Histological examination also revealed a low incidence and severity of arthritis in Dcn(-/-) mice. Conversely, no differences in the numbers of Borreila-positive skin cultures were observed among the different genotypes regardless of the infection dose. These differences, which were observed regardless of genetic background of the mice (BALB/c or C3H/HeN) or method of infection, demonstrate the importance of decorin in the pathogenesis of LD."

During a 1-year interval 2403 patients were referred to our department for B. burgdorferi serology. Sixty-three patients had repetitive positive tests for IgM anti-p41 antibodies and negative tests for anti-p41 IgG antibodies. Ten of the 63 patients recently had symptoms of erythema migrans. A confirmatory IgM Western blot gave a positive reaction in 5 patients out of 53 patients with little or no clinical evidence of B. burgdorferi infection. The remaining 48 patients were negative in this test and were considered as false-positives. Two whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISAs), two immunofluorescence assays and Western blotting were not useful as confirmatory tests. Sera from 330 blood donors and 72 cord sera were also screened for anti-p41 IgM. Five blood donor sera and five cord sera showed an IgM reactivity against p41. Based on our data we hypothesize that up to 1.5% of the population may have natural IgM antibodies against p41 in their sera. We observed that six out of nine sera with such antibodies could immobilize a B. afzelii reference strain in vitro. Whether anti-p41 IgM antibodies are capable of inactivating infective spirochetes and thereby prevent infection in vivo is, however, not yet clarified. The paradoxical conclusion that anti-p41 IgM antibodies may be a sign of resistance to infection rather than a sign of infection should be given consideration."

		"abstract": "Epidemiological data on chronic polyneuropathies, especially inflammatory types, is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the spectrum of causes and estimated prevalence of various polyneuropathy types in Vest-Agder, and to examine the clinical features of the Vest-Agder population of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). In Vest-Agder county (population of 155 464), polyneuropathy patients are registered in a database and followed prospectively. We did a measure of the database on October 31 1999. A total of 192 patients were registered. The prevalence for chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) was 7.7 per 100 000 population. The course was relapsing in five of fifteen patients, progressive in four patients and slowly progressive in six of fifteen patients. Two of the fifteen patients had pure sensory symptoms. The mean Rankin disability score was 3.4 at maximal deficit and 2.1 at last follow-up. The prevalence of paraproteinemic polyneuropathy was 5.1 per 100 000 population. None of the patients with paraproteinemic polyneuropathy were worse than slightly disabled (disability score < or = 2). The prevalences for other polyneuropathies were as follows: polyneuropathy and RA, 1.3; polyneuropathy and Sjögren's syndrome or sicca complex, 4.5 (polyneuropathy was the presenting symptom in five of seven patients); sarcoidosis 1.9; polyneuropathy and chronic Lyme, 0.6; paraneoplastic polyneuropathy, 1.9; diabetic polyneuropathy 23.2; vitamin deficiency, 5.1; alcoholic and toxic polyneuropathy, 19.9; hereditary polyneuropathy, 14.8. Cryptogenic polyneuropathies made up 26% of all polyneuropathies. The mean disability score was 2.0 (SD 1.1). In conclusion, prevalence of CIDP was significantly higher than previously reported, and the prognosis was good in the majority of patients. Patients with paraproteinemic polyneuropathy were not severely disabled. Polyneuropathy was the presenting symptom in the majority of patients with Sjögren's syndrome or sicca complex."

		"abstract": "Southern Sweden is an area of Lyme borreliosis (LB) endemicity, with an incidence of 69 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The most frequent clinical manifestations are erythema migrans (77%) and neuroborreliosis (16%). There was no record of human Borrelia strains being isolated from patients in this region before the prospective study reported here. Borrelia spirochetes were isolated from skin and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from LB patients living in the region. A total of 39 strains were characterized by OspA serotype analysis, species-specific PCR, and signature nucleotide analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. Of 33 skin isolates, 31 (93.9%) were Borrelia afzelii strains and 2 (6.1%) were Borrelia garinii strains. Of six CSF isolates, five (83.3%) were B. garinii and one (16.7%) was B. afzelii. Neither Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto strains nor multiple infections were observed. The B. afzelii isolates were of OspA serotype 2. Three B. garinii strains were of OspA serotype 5, and the remaining four strains were of OspA serotype 6. All of the B. garinii strains belonged to the same 16S ribosomal DNA ribotype class. Our findings agree with earlier findings from other geographic regions in Europe where B. afzelii and B. garinii have been recovered predominantly from skin and CSF cultures, respectively. To further study the possible presence in Sweden of the genotype B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is known to be present in Europe and to occur predominantly in patients with Lyme arthritis, molecular detection of Borrelia-specific DNA in synovial samples from Lyme arthritis patients should be performed."

		"abstract": "Ticks are the vectors of many zoonotic diseases in the United States, including Lyme disease, human monocytic and granulocytic ehrlichioses, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Most known Bartonella species are arthropod borne. Therefore, it is important to determine if some Bartonella species, which are emerging pathogens, could be carried or transmitted by ticks. In this study, adult Ixodes pacificus ticks were collected by flagging vegetation in three sites in Santa Clara County, Calif. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and partial sequencing of 273 bp of the gltA gene were applied for Bartonella identification. Twenty-nine (19.2%) of 151 individually tested ticks were PCR positive for Bartonella. Male ticks were more likely to be infected with Bartonella than female ticks (26 versus 12%, P = 0.05). None of the nine ticks collected at Baird Ranch was PCR positive for Bartonella. However, 7 (50%) of 14 ticks from Red Fern Ranch and 22 (17%) of 128 ticks from the Windy Hill Open Space Reserve were infected with Bartonella. In these infected ticks, molecular analysis showed a variety of Bartonella strains, which were closely related to a cattle Bartonella strain and to several known human-pathogenic Bartonella species and subspecies: Bartonella henselae, B. quintana, B. washoensis, and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. These findings indicate that I. pacificus ticks may play an important role in Bartonella transmission among animals and humans."

Our study explored the in vitro susceptibility of B. burgdorferi to mezlocillin, meropenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, teicoplanin, ribostamycin and fusidic acid. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal borreliacidal concentrations (MBCs) were measured using a standardised colorimetric microdilution method and conventional subculture experiments. MIC values were lowest for mezlocillin (MIC(90), < or =0.06 mg/l) and meropenem (MIC(90), 0.33 mg/l). Vancomycin (MIC(90), 0.83 mg/l) was less effective in vitro. Borreliae proved to be resistant to aztreonam (MIC(90), >32 mg/l), teicoplanin (MIC(90), 6.6 mg/l), ribostamycin (MIC(90), 32 mg/l), and fusidic acid (MIC(90), >4 mg/l). The mean MBCs resulting in 100% killing of the final inoculum after 72 h of incubation were lowest for mezlocillin (MBC, 0.83 mg/l). This study gathered further data on the in vitro susceptibility patterns of the B. burgdorferi complex. The excellent in vitro effectiveness of acylamino-penicillin derivatives and their suitability for the therapy of Lyme disease is emphasised."

This report summarizes the number of LD cases reported to CDC during 1999. Although the number of cases decreased from 1998, the number of cases in 1999 was higher than the number reported during the early 1990s. LD can be prevented by avoiding tick-infested habitats, by using personal protective measures, by vaccination, by checking for and removing ticks attached to the body and clothes, and by reducing tick populations."

A survey with questions on Lyme disease symptoms, history, and preventive behaviors was mailed to all residents. Respondents were stratified by likelihood of having had Lyme disease. A subsample was selected for examination, and then classified according to the Lyme disease national surveillance case definition. The overall lifetime prevalence of Lyme disease for Nantucket residents was 15% (CI, 10%-19.8%): 19% among females, and 11% among males. The prevalence was highest among age groups 0-16 and 30-49 years. Overall, 86% of the population practiced at least one behavior. The most frequently reported preventive behavior was checking oneself for ticks (80%), followed by wearing protective clothing (53%), avoiding tick areas (34%), and using tick repellent (11%). Younger individuals practiced fewer preventive behaviors than older individuals (p=0.001). Although males reported greater tick exposure than females, females uniformly practiced preventive behaviors more frequently (p=0.001). The practice of preventive behaviors was not associated with a history of Lyme disease, but finding more than 5 ticks per year on oneself was (p=0.001). Lyme disease is highly prevalent on Nantucket Island. Young people are particularly at risk and health education should emphasize preventive behaviors less frequently practiced: using tick repellent, avoiding tick areas, and wearing protective clothing."

We compared the innate immune response of these ticks against spirochetes directly inoculated into the hemocoel cavity of ticks. In I. scapularis, some Borrelia were found associated with hemocytes, while numerous other spiral-shaped, intact bacteria remained free in the hemolymph. In contrast, in D. variabilis only remnants of the bacteria were evident in the hemolymph, indicating lysis; intact spirochetes were rare. Spirochetes were observed bound to or within the organs of both tick species, although many more spirochetes were found associated with the I. scapularis organs. The few spirochetes observed with the D. variabilis organs appeared to be dead because D. variabilis tissues rarely contained culturable bacteria, unlike I. scapularis tissues. When spirochetes were incubated with I. scapularis hemolymph plasma in vitro, bacterial survival and motility were not reduced. In contrast, incubation of spirochetes with D. variabilis hemolymph plasma resulted in > 50% of the spirochetes becoming nonmotile by 45 min. The differences in the responses of the two different tick species indicate that I. scapularis is immunotolerant when challenged with B. burgdorferi and dependent on a slow phagocytic response to clear Borrelia from the hemolymph. In contrast, D. variabilis is highly immunocompetent (i.e., innate immunity), using plasma borreliacidal factors and a rapid increase in phagocytic cells to clear the infection and limit tissue invasion."

Nymphal abundance varied between parks, with the average number of nymphs encountered in 1 h ranging from 6.2 +/- 3.8-47.1 +/- 36.3 (mean +/- SD). Questing nymphs were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi by culture in BSK medium and 7-12% was found to be infected. The average risk of encountering an infected nymph (entomologic risk index) ranged from 0.5 to 5.2 infected nymphs per hour. The highest entomological risk index was recorded from a small island park in northwestern Wisconsin during the last week in May (8.0 infected nymphs per hour). These results indicate a lower risk for human Lyme disease exposure in Wisconsin state parks in comparison with highly endemic areas of the northeastern United States."

Bacterin preparations of P. salmonis were found to elicit a dose-dependent response in coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), which varied from inadequate protection to exacerbation of the disease. However, an outer surface lipoprotein of P. salmonis, OspA, recombinantly produced in Escherichia coli elicited a high level of protection in vaccinated coho salmon with a relative percent survival as high as 59% for this single antigen. In an effort to further improve the efficacy of the OspA recombinant vaccine, T cell epitopes (TCE's) from tetanus toxin and measles virus fusion protein, that are universally immunogenic in mammalian immune systems, were incorporated tandemly into an OspA fusion protein. Addition of these TCE's dramatically enhanced the efficacy of the OspA vaccine, reflected by a three-fold increase in vaccine efficacy. These results represent a highly effective monovalent recombinant subunit vaccine for a rickettsia-like pathogen, P. salmonis, and for the first time demonstrate the immunostimulatory effect of mammalian TCE's in the salmonid immune model. These results may also be particularly pertinent to salmonid aquaculture in which the various subspecies are outbred and of heterologous haplotypes."

Personal protective and environmental measures have not significantly impacted its increasing incidence. An adjuvanted recombinant vaccine (LYMErix) has been approved in the United States for the prevention of Lyme disease in adults, and has demonstrated both safety and efficacy. A clinical trial of over 10000 adults showed 76% efficacy following the third dose of a 0, 1, 12 schedule. Accelerated schedules demonstrate equivalent levels of protective antibody. Up to 100% of children 2-14 years of age achieve seroprotective levels of antibody. Booster doses induced protective levels of antibody in more than 96% of recipients when administered at months 12 and 24. Only mild or moderate, transient vaccine-associated adverse events have been reported after immunization. The vaccine is a safe and effective method of preventing Lyme disease."

Molecular methods are controversial because of differences in assays, gene targets, and limited clinical validation. This review summarizes published assays for Lyme disease diagnosis using skin, plasma, synovial fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and urine. Meta-analyses show the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. Overall, assays for skin and synovial fluid (68% and 73%, respectively) have high sensitivity and uniformity. The low test sensitivity of CSF (18%) and plasma (29%), variable sensitivities among CSF and urine assays, and persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi DNA in urine and synovial fluid even with therapy and convalescence make these unsuitable for primary diagnosis. Molecular assays for Lyme disease are best used with other diagnostic methods and only in situations in which the clinical probability of Lyme disease is high."

Such areas in Germany include Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, and the Odenwald region in Hessen. So far, it has not been endemic to Rhineland-Palatinate. There, only two single cases of TBE occurred in the years 1992 and 1997, near the town of Idar-Oberstein. We report two new cases of TBE which appeared in 1999 and two current cases from the Idar-Oberstein region which have been verified clinically and serologically. At admission, the patients suffered from headache, muscle pains, and high fever, in one case meningitis was suspected. In all four patients, serology for borrelia was negative in serum and CSF. The described cases indicate that it is possible to acquire TBE in Rhineland-Palatinate, although only two cases have been reported in this area over the previous 10 years. Particularly in regions with a low incidence of TBE, the disease should be taken into consideration as a differential diagnosis. Studies of tick populations in regions with a low incidence can help in evaluating the benefit of possible vaccine recommendations by local public health authorities."

Due to the marked clinical heterogeneity and the difficult serologic diagnosis, neuroborreliosis is often part of the differential diagnosis in neurology. The antibiotic treatment is necessary because it decreases the risk of more advanced stages of the disease. We hope that a vaccination will soon be available in Belgium."

		"abstract": "A potent inhibitor of mitogen-stimulated T cell proliferation exists in the saliva of several species of hard ticks, including the Lyme disease vector tick, Ixodes scapularis. Our characterization of this phenomenon has led to the identification of a possible mechanism for the T cell inhibitory activity of I. scapularis saliva. The T cell inhibitor can overcome stimulation of mouse spleen cells with anti-CD3 mAb; however, a direct and avid interaction with T cells does not appear to be necessary. Tick saliva inhibits a mouse IL-2 capture ELISA, suggesting that a soluble IL-2 binding factor is present in the saliva. This hypothesis was verified by using a direct binding assay in which plate-immobilized tick saliva was shown to bind both mouse and human IL-2. Elimination of the IL-2 binding capacity of saliva in the in vitro assays by trypsin digestion demonstrated that the IL-2 binding factor is a protein. These experiments comprise the first demonstration of the existence of such a secreted IL-2 binding protein from any parasite or pathogen. This arthropod salivary IL-2 binding capacity provides a simple mechanism for the suppression of T cell proliferation as well as for the activity of other immune effector cells that are responsive to IL-2 stimulation. Relevance of the tick T cell inhibitory activity to the human immune system is demonstrated by the ability of tick saliva to inhibit proliferation of human T cells and CTLL-2 cells grown in the presence of human IL-2."

		"abstract": "We previously showed that adoptive transfer of Borrelia burgdorferi-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) into syngeneic mice protects animals from challenge with tick-transmitted spirochetes. Here, we demonstrate that the protective immune response is antibody (Ab) dependent and does not require the presence of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on DCs. Mice sensitized with B. burgdorferi-pulsed MHC class II-deficient (MHC class II(-/-)) DCs mounted a humoral response against protective antigens, including B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA) and OspC. B-cell help for the generation of neutralizing anti-OspC immunoglobulin G Abs could be provided by gammadelta T cells. In contrast, anti-OspA Ab production required the presence of alphabeta T cells, although this pathway could be independent of MHC class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. Moreover, depletion of NK cells prior to transfer of antigen-pulsed MHC class II(-/-) DCs resulted in significant increases in the levels of neutralizing Abs induced by DCs. Altogether, these data suggest that the initial interactions between DCs and innate immune cells, such as gammadelta and NK cells, can influence the generation of a protective humoral response against B. burgdorferi antigens."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is characterized by the accumulation of lymphocytes and monocytes in the affected tissue. Endothelial cells line the blood vessel walls and control the trafficking of inflammatory leukocytes from the blood into the surrounding tissues. A model of the blood vessel wall, consisting of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) grown on amniotic connective tissue, was utilized to examine the effects of B. burgdorferi on the transendothelial migration of T lymphocytes. Maximal migration occurred when the HUVEC-amnion cultures were preincubated with B. burgdorferi for 24 h and T lymphocytes were added for an additional 4 h, yielding a two- to fourfold increase compared to migration across unstimulated cultures. The number of T lymphocytes that migrated was proportional to the number added. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10), added during activation of the HUVEC, significantly diminished (by an average of 70% +/- 21%) the migration of T lymphocytes across endothelium stimulated for 8 or 24 h with B. burgdorferi, but not IL-1. Compared to the initially added population of T lymphocytes, the population that migrated across untreated endothelium or HUVEC activated with B. burgdorferi or IL-1 contained a significantly smaller percentage of CD45RA+RO- (naïve) cells and a greater proportion of CD45RA+RO+ cells. The migratory population was also enriched for CD8+ T lymphocytes when the endothelium was incubated with either control medium or B. burgdorferi, but not IL-1. B. burgdorferi thus activates endothelium in a manner that promotes the transmigration of T lymphocytes, and IL-10 inhibits this activation. These data further suggest that endothelium plays an active role in promoting the recruitment of specific subpopulations of T lymphocytes."

Subsequent studies showed that an established infection or disease could be resolved by passive transfer of antibodies to OspC. In the present study, DNA vaccines encoding either the OspC antigen alone or fused to OspA and under the transcriptional control of the human elongation factor 1alpha promoter were evaluated for their protective and/or curative potential. In contrast to ospA-containing plasmids, none of the six constructs with ospC alone were immunogenic in vivo, independent of whether they contained promoter or leader sequences from ospA and/or ospC, or alternatively, the signal sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator. Solely, a DNA vaccine encoding an OspA-OspC fusion product led to expression of the respective polypeptide chain in transfected cells in vitro and to the induction of OspA- and OspC-specific antibodies in vivo. Immune sera raised against the OspA-OspC fusion product conveyed full protection against subsequent infection, most probably via OspA-specific antibodies, but were unable to resolve infection."

We developed a decision-analytic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination compared with no vaccination in individuals living in endemic areas of Lyme disease. Our analysis encompassed a 10-year time horizon including a 2-year vaccination schedule with an additional year of vaccine effectiveness. The costs and probabilities of vaccination risk, compliance and efficacy, and Lyme disease clinical sequelae and treatment were estimated from the literature. Health-related quality-of-life weights of the various clinical sequelae of Lyme disease infection were obtained from a sample of 105 residents from Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. Vaccinating 10 000 residents living in endemic areas with a probability of Lyme disease per season of 0.01 averted 202 cases of Lyme disease during a 10-year period. The additional cost per QALY gained compared with no vaccination was $62 300. Vaccination cost $12 600/QALY gained for endemic areas with an attack rate of 2.5% per season, and $145 200/QALY gained for an attack rate of 0.5%. Vaccinating individuals over an accelerated 2-month vaccination schedule improved the cost-effectiveness to $53 700/QALY gained. If a yearly booster shot is required for persisting efficacy, the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio increases to $72 700/QALY. The cost-effectiveness of vaccination was most sensitive to the Lyme disease treatment efficacy and assumptions about the persistence of vaccination effect. Vaccination against Lyme disease appears only to be economically attractive for individuals who have a seasonal probability of Borrelia burgdorferi infection of greater than 1%."

		"abstract": "Ticks are currently considered to be second only to mosquitoes as vectors of human infectious diseases in the world. Each tick species has preferred environmental conditions and biotopes that determine the geographic distribution of the ticks and, consequently, the risk areas for tickborne diseases. This is particularly the case when ticks are vectors and reservoirs of the pathogens. Since the identification of Borrelia burgdorferi as the agent of Lyme disease in 1982, 15 ixodid-borne bacterial pathogens have been described throughout the world, including 8 rickettsiae, 3 ehrlichiae, and 4 species of the Borrelia burgdorferi complex. This article reviews and illustrate various aspects of the biology of ticks and the tickborne bacterial diseases (rickettsioses, ehrlichioses, Lyme disease, relapsing fever borrelioses, tularemia, Q fever), particularly those regarded as emerging diseases. Methods are described for the detection and isolation of bacteria from ticks and advice is given on how tick bites may be prevented and how clinicians should deal with patients who have been bitten by ticks."

For example the enzymes involved in aminoacyl-tRNA (AA-tRNA) synthesis, the key process responsible for the accuracy of protein synthesis, have been found to be highly species-specific. In particular, a number of pathogens contain certain pathways of AA-tRNA synthesis that are unrelated to those found in their mammalian hosts. Since AA-tRNA synthesis is indispensable for cell viability, the discovery of pathogen-specific pathways and enzymes presents novel therapeutic and diagnostic targets. Here we will review recent advances in the elucidation of AA-tRNA synthesis pathways and discuss the possible pharmaceutical exploitation of these discoveries. In particular, the integration of genomic and biochemical approaches to identify novel targets for the treatment of Chlamydial infections and the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease will be presented."

Results confirmed high efficacy of the tested drugs, particularly on B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. A strain of B. garinii, isolated from cerebrospinal fluid, required a longer period of antibiotic activity before inhibitory effects were achieved. Penicillin G was effective only in higher concentrations, attainable by i. v. application. Ceftriaxone had the strongest borreliacidal activity."

		"abstract": "Diagnosis of Lyme disease by analysis of T cell immune responses in vitro is curtailed by poor correlation between test results and status of infection. This is probably due to the inherent nonspecific activation potential of the causative agent, the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, for bystander lymphocytes, in particular via their outer surface lipoproteins. We have now applied a novel protocol to determine specific T cell responses in Lyme disease patients and exclude unrelated cellular responses in vitro. Non-lipidated spirochetal antigens (OspA, OspC and P39) including those selectively expressed in the mammalian host (pG and BapA) were used for antigenic stimulation and autologous dendritic cells served as antigen-presenting cells. The majority of patients with well-defined early and late manifestations of Lyme disease exhibited specific T cell proliferative responses to one or more of the indicated antigens, however at distinct levels. Most notably, among the five antigens tested, pG was specifically recognized by the majority of T cell populations (>70%) - mainly Th1 cells - from patients but not control individuals. These data indicate a causal relationship between B. burgdorferi infection and T cell reactivity to pG, thus making this protein a promising additional diagnostic marker for Lyme disease."

In Europe five genospecies have been described from the original B. burgdorferi sensu lato (sl): B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss), B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. lusitaniae, and B. valaisiana. In the United States, B. burgdorferi ss as well as B. bissettii in California and B. andersonii on the East Coast were differentiated. In Asia, B. japonica has been identified along, with B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. valaisiana. In order to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of four species-specific monoclonal antibodies, we analyzed 210 B. burgdorferi sl isolates belonging to eight genospecies by immunoblot and confirmed genospecies by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of rrf (5S)-rrl (23S) intergenic spacer amplicon. Monoclonal antibody H3TS had 100% sensitivity for 55 B. burgdorferi ss isolates but showed reactivity with all four isolates belonging to B. bissetii. Monoclonal antibody I 17.3 showed 100% specificity and sensitivity for 45 B. afzelii isolates. Monoclonal antibody D6 was 100% specific for B. garinii but missed 1 of 64 isolates (98.5% sensitivity). Monoclonal antibody A116k was 100% specific for B. valaisiana but was unreactive with 4 of 24 isolates (83.5% sensitivity). Genetic analysis correlated well with results of reactivity and confirmed efficacy of the phenotypic typing of these antibodies. Some isolates showed atypical RFLP. Therefore, both phenotypic and genotypic analyses are needed to characterize new Borrelia isolates."

		"abstract": "Experimental Borrelia burgdorferi infection of rhesus monkeys is an excellent model of Lyme disease and closely parallels the infection in humans. Little is known about the interaction of host immunity with the spirochete in patients with chronic infection. We hypothesized that rapid development of anti-B. burgdorferi antibody in immunocompetent nonhuman primates (NHPs) is the major determinant of the reduction of the spirochetal load in Lyme borreliosis. This hypothesis was tested by measurement of the spirochetal load by PCR in association with characterization of the anti-B. burgdorferi humoral immune response in immunocompetent NHPs versus that in corticosteroid-treated NHPs. Although anti-B. burgdorferi immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody was effectively inhibited in dexamethasone (Dex)-treated NHPs, anti-B. burgdorferi IgM antibody levels continued to rise after the first month and reached levels in excess of IgM levels in immunocompetent NHPs. This vigorous production of anti-B. burgdorferi IgM antibodies was also studied in vitro by measurement of antibody produced by B. burgdorferi-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Despite these high IgM antispirochetal antibodies in Dex-treated NHPs, spirochetal loads were much higher in these animals. These data indicate that Dex treatment results in interference with isotype switching in this model and provide evidence that anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibody is much more effective than IgM antibody in decreasing the spirochetal load in infected animals."

The patient is a 48-year old male with a progressive spastic paraparesis of months' duration who presented acute headache, confusion, severe left hemiparesis with sensory deficit and homonymous hemianopsia. A cranial computed tomography scan showed an extensive right temporal lobe hemorrhage with subarachnoid invasion. Brain angiographic and angio-magnetic resonance imaging studies excluded hemorrhage-predisposing vascular abnormalities. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies disclosed mononuclear pleocytosis with elevated protein levels. Both serum and CSF anti-Borrelia titers were significantly increased, and serum Western Blot showed bands to protein 34 (ops B), 57, 59 and 62. The patient was treated with ceftriaxone for 4 weeks, with a favorable outcome. It is suspected that cause of the hemorrhage was parenchymatous Lyme-associated vascular damage and/or microaneurysmatic rupture."

The participants answered a questionnaire and blood specimens were collected to estimate the prevalence of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in each group. Sera were analysed with an enzyme-linked immunoassay technique to determine IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi flagellum. The prevalence of B. burgdorferi antibodies was 7.6% in the farmers and forest workers vs. 5.3% in the clerks (adjusted odds ratio [age, sex] = 1.2 [95% confidence interval = 0.5-2.8]). One case of Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed. The positive predictive value of the antibody test was estimated to be 3% in the studied populations. B. burgdorferi infection is of low endemicity in south-west Sweden and is probably not an occupational risk among outdoor workers. Undiagnosed cases of Lyme borreliosis are uncommon. The test used is not acceptable for screening purposes."

In nine subjects with confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in the cerebrospinal fluid the cytological and biochemical finding was normal. Examination of antibodies by the ELISA method was negative in 7 of 18 patients during the first examination and in 12 of 18 during the second examination. In all negative examinations the specific antibodies were assessed by the Western blot or ELISA method after liberation from the immunocomplexes. In the authors' opinion it is advisable to examine repeatedly plasma and other biological material from potentially affected organs by PCR and subjects with persisting or relapsing complaints after the acute form of Lyme borreliosis as well as to examine cerebrospinal fluid in case on non-specific symptoms and concurrent pathic EEG or MR findings."

		"abstract": "Although the frequency of Lyme carditis is not high, it is one of the most challenging conditions in terms of diagnosis. No long-term studies that would help expand our body of knowledge concerning the circumstances of its development and the natural course of this form of Lyme borreliosis (LB), the most widespread anthropozoonosis in Central Europe, have been reported to date. The authors sought to describe and assess the consequences of a less common form of Lyme carditis (LC). An assessment of the following aspects was made: a) the forms, natural history and sequelae of the less common clinical appearances of LC, b) the role of antibiotic therapy with reference to the late manifestations of LB. Three patients were selected from a group of 60 consecutive patients with demonstrated LC during a follow-up period from 1987 to 2000. Patient no. 1 was being followed for myocarditis with frequent ventricular extrasystoles, patient no. 2 for pericarditis, and patient no. 3 for dilated cardiomyopathy as a late manifestation of LB. In addition to routine examination at entry, the patients were subjected to a standard 12-lead ECG, continuous 24-hour Holter ECG monitoring, exercise testing (bicycle ergometry), investigations of antibodies using ELISA and Western blot, investigation of thyroid (T3, T4, TSH tests) and mineral levels. The study showed no significant correlation between the clinical course and levels of specific antibodies. It confirmed the concept that inadequate or no therapy with antibiotics in the initial stage of the disease has a significant effect on the development of late sequelae. Based on the long-term treatment of three patients with less common, yet clinically urgent findings, the authors conclude that even a relatively serious clinical course is associated with no major limitations for affected individuals after an interval of several years."

In the present study, I. ricinus nymphs collected in an area of endemicity in southern Germany were allowed to feed on mice. Cultivation of ear biopsy specimens showed that six of seven B. garinii-infected mice were infected by OspA serotype 4. In contrast, very few B. garinii OspA serotype 4 organisms were isolated directly from the ticks which infected the mice; most isolates were B. afzelii. The infected mice transmitted mainly OspA serotype 4 to xenodiagnostic ticks, preferentially in combination with B. afzelii."

Additionally, 75 healthy pet dogs were tested. The results of this study indicate that the seroprevalence among hunting dogs (18%) was of the same order as the seroprevalence among pet dogs (17%) and hunters (15%). The seropositivity of a hunting dog was not a significant indicator of increased risk of Lyme borreliosis for its owner. No significant rise in seroprevalence was found in dogs older than 24 months. This indicated that seropositivity after an infection with B. burgdorferi in dogs is rather short, approximately 1 year. In humans this is considerably longer but is also not lifelong. Therefore, the incidence of B. burgdorferi infections among dogs was greater than that among hunters, despite a similar prevalence of seropositivity among hunters and their hunting dogs. Because no positive correlation was observed between the seropositivity of a hunter and the seropositivity of the hunter's dog, direct transfer of ticks between dog and hunter does not seem important and owning a dog should not be considered a risk factor for Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "The allergist may frequently be involved with cases of Lyme disease. There are at least three reasons for this. First, the major symptom is often a rash that brings into the differential diagnosis several diseases that the allergist is likely to have expertise in; therefore, the allergist's role as a diagnostician is very important. The second reason is that the Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) infection is treated with antibiotics and the patients may frequently develop reactions that may be immune-mediated. The allergist's expertise in diagnosis and management of allergic reactions is important. The third reason is that there is no established laboratory diagnostic test so that the clinician must use the existing tests, most often serologic, with their limitations, in the context of a history and physical. The allergist as an immunologist can be very helpful in the proper interpretation of the test results. The differential of the rash and the immune response to the infecting agent is described."

		"abstract": "Serologic tests for Lyme disease are problematic. Because of cross-reactive antigens Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) shares with other organisms, Lyme disease can be overdiagnosed. However, in addition to specificity problems, serologic tests for early Lyme disease can be falsely negative due to lack of sensitivity of ELISAs and Western blots. Most routine antibody tests are designed to detect free antibodies, and in early, active disease, circulating antibodies may not be free in serum but sequestered in complexes with the antigens which originally triggered their production. This difficulty may be overcome by first isolating immune complexes (IC) from the serum and using this fraction for testing. Free Borrelia-specific antibodies can then be liberated from the immune complexes which may enhance test sensitivity in patients with active disease. We developed a technique that captures the antibody component of IC on immunobeads, and subsequently releases the antigen component of IC. Immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody detected at least one antigen to be OspA, thus definitively demonstrating a Borrelia-specific antigen in circulating IC in early Lyme disease. This test is also useful in demonstrating Bb antigen in otherwise seronegative Lyme disease patients."

		"abstract": "Chronic Lyme disease (LD) is a debilitating illness caused by tickborne infection with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Although immunologic abnormalities appear to play a role in this disease, specific immunologic markers of chronic LD have not been identified. We evaluated 73 patients with chronic LD for lymphocyte subset abnormalities using flow cytometry. Of these, 53 patients had predominant musculoskeletal symptoms, while 20 patients had predominant neurologic symptoms. The estimated duration of infection ranged from 3 months to 15 years, and all patients had positive serologic tests for B. burgdorferi. Ten patients with acute LD (infection less than 1 month) and 22 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) served as disease controls. All 31 chronic LD patients who were tested prior to antibiotic treatment had significantly decreased CD57 lymphocyte counts (mean, 30+/-16 cells per microl; normal, 60-360 cells per microl, P<0.001). Nineteen of 37 patients (51%) who were tested after initiating antibiotic therapy had decreased CD57 levels (mean, 66+/-39 cells per microl), and all five patients tested after completing antibiotic treatment had normal CD57 counts (mean, 173+/-98 cells per microl). In contrast, all 10 patients with acute LD and 82% of AIDS patients had normal CD57 levels, and the difference between these groups and the pre-treatment patients with chronic LD was significant (P<0.001). Patients with chronic LD and predominant neurologic symptoms had significantly lower mean CD57 levels than patients with predominant musculoskeletal symptoms (30+/-21 vs. 58+/-37 cells per microl, P=0.002). CD57 levels increased in chronic LD patients whose symptoms improved, while patients with refractory disease had persistently low CD57 counts. A decrease in the CD57 lymphocyte subset may be an important marker of chronic LD. Changes in the CD57 subset may be useful to monitor the response to therapy in this disease."

Detection of IgG1 versus total IgG was found to be more sensitive in detecting Borrelia burgdorferi antigens, especially flagellin (41 kD) protein, but did not improve the performance of Western blotting. The use of IgG1 detection showed an increase in sensitivity and specificity for the early Lyme borreliosis patient group compared to the standard IgG and IgM detection method by enzyme immunoassays using purified Borrelia burgdorferi flagellum. However, in an enzyme immunoassay using a total sonicate, sensitivity in detecting early Lyme borreliosis and late Lyme borreliosis with IgG1 remained lower compared to the detection of early Lyme borreliosis by IgM antibodies and late Lyme borreliosis by total IgG antibodies."

Two distinct culture systems, consisting of synovial membrane explants or interactive synovial cells embedded in 3-D fibrin matrices, were chosen. Both systems were artificially infected with Bb, and the interactions between Bb and synovial tissue/cells were studied by histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Functional analyses included the induction/secretion of cytokines by Bb in the model system. Both culture systems proved to be stable and reproducible. The host cells and spirochetes showed high levels of viability and maintained their physiologic shape for >3 weeks. Bb invaded the synovial tissue and the artifical matrix in a time-dependent manner. Host cells were activated by Bb, as indicated by the induction of interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Electron microscopic analysis revealed Bb intracellularly within macrophages as well as synovial fibroblasts, suggesting that not only professional phagocytes, but also resident synovial cells are capable of phagocytosing Bb. Most interestingly, the uptake of the spirochetes appeared to cause severe damage of the synovial fibroblasts, since the majority of these cells displayed ultrastructural features of disintegration. A novel 3-D in vitro model has been established that allows the study of distinct aspects of Lyme arthritis under conditions that resemble the pathologic condition in humans. This reproducible, standardized model supplements animal studies and conventional 2-D cultures. The disintegration of synovial fibroblasts containing Bb or Bb fragments challenges the concept of an intracellular persistence of Bb and may instead reflect a mechanism that contributes to the inflammatory processes characteristic of Lyme arthritis."

In this regard the first non-ribosomal DNA sequences from the obligate intracellular pathogen Piscirickettsia salmonis are presented. Genomic DNA isolated from Percoll density gradient purified P. salmonis, was used to construct an expression library in lambda ZAP II. In the absence of preexisting DNA sequence, rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against P. salmonis, with a bias toward P. salmonis surface antigens, was used to identify immunoreactive clones. Catabolite repression of the lac promoter was required to obtain a stable clone of a 4,983 bp insert in Escherichia coli due to insert toxicity exerted by the accompanying radA open reading frame (ORF). DNA sequence analysis of the insert revealed 1 partial and 4 intact predicted ORF's. A 486 bp ORF, ospA, encoded a 17 kDa antigenic outer surface protein (OspA) with 62% amino acid sequence homology to the genus common 17 kDa outer membrane lipoprotein of Rickettsia prowazekii, previously thought confined to members of the genus Rickettsia. Palmitate incorporation demonstrated that OspA is posttranslationally lipidated in E. coli, albeit poorly expressed as a lipoprotein even after replacement of the signal sequence with the signal sequence from lpp (Braun lipoprotein) or the rickettsial 17 kDa homologue. To enhance expression, ospA was optimized for codon usage in E. coli by PCR synthesis. Expression of ospA was ultimately improved (approximately 13% of total protein) with a truncated variant lacking a signal sequence. High level expression (approximately 42% tot. prot.) was attained as an N-terminal fusion protein with the fusion product recovered as inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21. Expression of OspA in P. salmonis was confirmed by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal antibodies generated against a synthetic peptide of OspA (110-129) and a strong antibody response against OspA was detected in convalescent sera from coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch)."

		"abstract": "Despite the growing list of agents that can present as neuroretinitis, nearly one-half remain idiopathic. However, many of the candidate etiologies are treatable conditions, and accurate diagnosis can result in visual rehabilitation. A complete workup in patients presenting with acute neuroretinitis should include a thorough history and general medical evaluation. Exposure history should be thoroughly explored, including recent travel, unpasteurized and uncooked foods, sexual experience, and animal contacts. A detailed physical examination should be performed to note hidden rashes and inoculation sites and should include routine measurements of blood pressure and heart rate. Laboratory tests should be tailored to the history and may include complete blood count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; bacterial, fungal, and viral blood cultures; antinuclear antibody test; angiotensin-converting enzyme; anti-double-stranded DNA; and C3. Serological evaluation should look for syphilis, Lyme disease, histoplasmosis, brucellosis, chlamydia, HIV, toxoplasmosis, Epstein-Barr virus, viral hepatitis B and C, and tuberculin skin test. Neuroretinitis is a clinical entity in which there is inflammation of the retinal architecture and optic nerve. There are numerous entities that can cause a picture of neuroretinitis ranging from vascular to infectious to autoimmune. With regards to the infectious etiologies, it is interesting to note that many of these organisms are obligate intracellular pathogens. The microorganisms B. henselae, T. gondii, R. typhi, T. pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and various viruses, such as HIV, mumps, and HSV, are known intracellular agents. Other major infectious agents, such as B. burgdorferi and Leptospirosis spp. are known to remain sequestered within the circulatory system. It is possible that in this way these agents are able to breach the delicate blood-brain barrier. The implication of such findings on the treatment and management of neuroretinitis remains to be explored. Interestingly, the vast majority of infected patients do not develop neuroretinitis or demonstrate CNS involvement. Detailed examination of this variability may provide further insight into the pathogenic properties of these infectious agents, host tissue susceptibility, and mechanisms of blood-retina barrier integrity. A detailed retinal examination can provide an unobstructed view of the CNS. Careful inspection of this delicate interface may reveal subtle findings critical for accurate and rapid diagnosis of underlying systemic pathology. The varied visual and neurological symptoms of neuroretinitis attest to the fact that this is a disease of both the retina and contiguous neuronal elements. Such involvement significantly elevates the risk to the patient and emphasizes the need for early detection and prompt treatment."

The availability of generic forms of the older drugs reduces their cost. Besides traditional uses, some older drugs have become the preferred therapy for newly recognized infectious diseases. Doxycycline is the preferred drug for rickettsial tickborne diseases, ehrlichiosis and early Lyme disease. TMP-SMX is the preferred drug for I. belli and Cyclospora. Minocycline has been used to treat MRSA and MRSE infections. Clindamycin or metronidazole combined with a quinolone is an excellent oral regimen for polymicrobial infections. [table: see text]"

		"abstract": "The genome of Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a large number of lipoproteins, many of which are expressed only at certain stages of the spirochete's life cycle. In the current study we describe the B. burgdorferi population structure with respect to the production of two lipoproteins [outer surface protein A (OspA) and outer surface protein C (OspC)] during transmission from the tick vector to the mammalian host. Before the blood meal, the bacteria in the tick were a homogeneous population that mainly produced OspA only. During the blood meal, the population became more heterogeneous; many bacteria produced both OspA and OspC, whereas others produced only a single Osp and a few produced neither Osp. From the heterogeneous spirochetal population in the gut, a subset depleted of OspA entered the salivary glands and stably infected the host at time points >53 hr into the blood meal. We also examined genetic heterogeneity at the B. burgdorferi vlsE locus before and during the blood meal. In unfed ticks, the vlsE locus was stable and one predominant and two minor alleles were detected. During the blood meal, multiple vlsE alleles were observed in the tick. Tick feeding may increase recombination at the vlsE locus or selectively amplify rare vlsE alleles present in unfed ticks. On the basis of our data we propose a model, which is different from the established model for B. burgdorferi transmission. Implicit in our model is the concept that tick transmission converts a homogeneous spirochete population into a heterogeneous population that is poised to infect the mammalian host."

Mice were assayed for infection by culture, serologic testing, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Fed ticks were assayed by culture or PCR analysis. Transmission of B. burgdorferi did not occur during the first 24 h among 66 attempts, with maximum transmission occurring between 48 and 72 h. A model estimating the probability of infection from individual ticks removed by patients in a Lyme disease-endemic area yielded an overall probability of 4.6%.

In examining antibody responses to full-length p66 and to three overlapping fragments of the protein, we found that the majority of Lyme disease patients had immunoglobulin M (IgM) and/or IgG responses to p66 and that, particularly early in the disease, epitopes throughout p66 were recognized.

		"abstract": "The expression of adhesion molecules in synovium in patients with Lyme arthritis is surely critical in the control of Borrelia burgdorferi infection but may also have pathologic consequences. For example, molecular mimicry between a dominant T-cell epitope of B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A and an adhesion molecule, human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis. Using immunohistochemical methods, we examined synovial samples for expression of adhesion molecules in 29 patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis and in 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or chronic inflammatory monoarthritis. In Lyme arthritis synovia, endothelial cells showed intense expression of P-selectin and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1). Expression of LFA-1 was also intense on infiltrating cells, particularly in lymphoid aggregates, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was markedly expressed on synovial lining and endothelial and infiltrating cells. Moderate expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was seen on synovial lining and endothelial cells, and mild expression of its ligand, very late antigen-4, was apparent in perivascular lymphoid infiltrates. Except for lesser expression of VCAM-1 in Lyme synovia, the levels of expression of these adhesion molecules were similar in the three patient groups. We conclude that certain adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1 and LFA-1, are expressed intensely in the synovia of patients with Lyme arthritis. Upregulation of LFA-1 on lymphocytes in this lesion may be critical in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is a multisystemic disorder primarily affecting the skin, nervous system, and joints. It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and is transmitted via ticks of the Ixodidae family. Persistence of borreliae within macrophages has been implicated in the often chronic history of borreliosis. The uptake of B. burgdorferi by professional phagocytes occurs predominantly by coiling phagocytosis, a host cell-driven process in which single pseudopods wrap around and engulf the spirochetes. In the present study, we investigated the molecular machinery and the signal transduction pathways controlling the formation of these unique uptake structures. We found that the phagocytosis of borreliae by primary human macrophages is accompanied by the formation of f-actin-rich structures, which in their morphological organization correspond well to the earlier described coiling pseudopods. Further experiments revealed that Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and Arp2/3 complex, major regulators of actin polymerization, are also recruited to these sites of actin accumulation. In addition, inhibition of an upstream regulator of Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, the Rho-family GTPase CDC42Hs, greatly inhibited the occurrence of borrelia-induced phagocytic uptake structures. Inhibition of Rac1, another Rho family GTPase, had a less-pronounced inhibitory effect, while blocking of Rho activity showed no discernible influence. These results suggest that basic mechanisms of actin polymerization that control other types of phagocytosis are also functional in the formation of the morphologically unique uptake structures in coiling phagocytosis. Our findings should enhance the understanding of the infection process of B. burgdorferi and contribute to devising new strategies for countering Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "We have previously described the expression cloning of nine Borrelia burgdorferi antigens, using rabbit serum enriched for antibodies specific for infection-associated antigens, and determined that seven of these antigens were associated with infectious B. burgdorferi strain B31. One of these infection-associated antigens encoded a 451-amino-acid putative lipoprotein containing 21 consecutive and invariant 9-amino-acid repeat sequences near the amino terminus that we have designated VraA for virulent strain-associated repetitive antigen A. The vraA locus (designated BBI16 by The Institute for Genomic Research) maps to one of the 28-kb linear plasmids (designated lp28-4) that is not present in noninfectious strain B31 isolates. Subsequent PCR analysis of clonal isolates of B. burgdorferi B31 from infected mouse skin revealed a clone that lacked only lp28-4. Southern blot and Western blot analyses indicated that the lp28-4 and VraA proteins, respectively, were missing from this clone. We have also determined that VraA is a surface-exposed protein based on protease accessibility assays of intact whole cells. Furthermore, vraA expression is modestly derepressed when cells are grown at 37 degrees C relative to cells grown at 32 degrees C, suggesting that VraA is, in part, a temperature-inducible antigen. Homologues cross-reactive to B. burgdorferi B31 VraA, most with different molecular masses, were identified in several B. burgdorferi sensu lato isolates, including B. andersonii, suggesting that the immunogenic epitope(s) present in strain B31 VraA is conserved between Borrelia spp. In protection studies, only 8.3% of mice (1 of 12) immunized with full-length recombinant VraA fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST) were susceptible to infectious challenge with 10(2) B. burgdorferi strain B31, whereas naive mice or mice immunized with GST alone were infected 40% or 63 to 67% (depending on tissues assayed) of the time, respectively. As such, the partial protection elicited by VraA immunization provides an additional testable vaccine candidate to help protect against Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "VlsE, the variable surface antigen of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, contains two invariable domains, at the amino and carboxyl termini, respectively, which collectively account for approximately one-half of the entire molecule's length and remain unchanged during antigenic variation. It is not known if these two invariable domains are exposed at the surface of either the antigen or the spirochete. If they are exposed at the spirochete's surface, they may elicit a protective immune response against B. burgdorferi and serve as vaccine candidates. In this study, a 51-mer synthetic peptide that reproduced the entire sequence of the C-terminal invariable domain of VlsE was conjugated to the carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to immunize mice. Generated mouse antibody was able to immunoprecipitate native VlsE extracted from cultured B. burgdorferi B31 spirochetes, indicating that the C-terminal invariable domain was exposed at the antigen's surface. However, this domain was inaccessible to antibody binding at the surface of cultured intact spirochetes, as demonstrated by both an immunofluorescence experiment and an in vitro killing assay. Mouse antibody to the C-terminal invariable domain was not able to confer protection against B. burgdorferi infection, indicating that this domain was unlikely exposed at the spirochete's surface in vivo. We concluded that the C-terminal invariable domain was exposed at the antigen's surface but not at the surface of either cultured or in vivo spirochetes and thus cannot elicit protection against B. burgdorferi infection."

Because few synovial samples have yet been analysed by species-specific DNA amplification methods, further studies are needed to define the spectra of clinical manifestations associated with these different species. Two cases of treatment resistant Lyme arthritis are reported here, in which DNA amplification of the flagellin gene followed by dot-blot hybridisation in the synovial fluid identified B garinii as the causative agent. Clinical and biological data did not differ from the usual descriptions of Lyme arthritis, but as the recently reported molecular mimicry between OspA and hLFA1 is not applicable to B garinii, the pathogenesis of the present cases remains unclear. Future studies should aim at assessing the role of B garinii in European Lyme arthritis and its possible pathogenic and therapeutic consequences."

White blood cell counts were normal in both groups. To investigate direct interactions between the pathogen and the immune cells, blood from healthy controls was exposed in vitro to live or heat-killed Borrelia or to Borrelia lysate. Compared to the pattern induced by bacterial endotoxins, a reduced release of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and an enhanced secretion of interleukin-10 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was found. In blood from 10 borreliosis patients stimulated with Borrelia lysate, TNF-alpha formation was decreased to 31% +/- 14% and IFN-gamma formation was decreased to 8% +/- 3% (P < or = 0.001) compared to the cytokine response of blood from healthy controls (n = 24). We propose to consider anti-inflammatory changes in the blood cytokine response capacity elicited by Borrelia as a condition that might favor the persistence of the spirochete."

We tested the previously published hypothesis that spirochetes infecting Lone Star ticks (Amblyomma americanum) may comprise B. theileri by analyzing the 16S ribosomal DNAs (rDNAs) and flagellin genes of these spirochetes. B. theileri, the Amblyomma agent, and B. miyamotoi formed a natural group or clade distinct from but most closely related to that of the relapsing fever spirochetes. B. theileri and the Amblyomma agent were 97 and 98% similar at the nucleotide level within the analyzed portions of the 16S rDNA and the flagellin gene respectively, suggesting a recent divergence. The agent of bovine borreliosis might be explored as a surrogate antigen for the as-yet-uncultivatable Amblyomma agent in studies designed to explore the etiology of a Lyme disease-like infection associated with Lone Star ticks."

We have solved the crystal structure of recombinant OspC to a resolution of 2.5 A. OspC, a largely alpha-helical protein, is a dimer with a characteristic central four-helical bundle formed by association of the two longest helices from each subunit. OspC is very different from OspA and similar to the extracellular domain of the bacterial aspartate receptor and the variant surface glycoprotein from Trypanosoma brucei. Most of the surface-exposed residues of OspC are highly variable among different OspC isolates. The membrane proximal halves of the two long alpha-helices are the only conserved regions that are solvent accessible. As vaccination with recombinant OspC has been shown to elicit a protective immune response in mice, these regions are candidates for peptide-based vaccines."

The peptides define eight sequence motifs, none of which can be matched convincingly with segments of proteins from Borrelia burgdorferi, the LD pathogen; evidently, then, they are \"mimotopes,\" mimicking natural pathogen epitopes without matching contiguous amino acids of pathogen proteins. Peptides like these could be the basis of a new diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for LD, with sufficient specificity and sensitivity to replace expensive immunoblotting tests that are currently required for definitive serological diagnosis. Moreover, the method used to discover these peptides did not require any knowledge of the pathogen and involved generic procedures that are applicable to almost any infectious disease, including emerging diseases for which no pathogen has yet been identified."

Sera from control and OspA-immunized mice and from OspA-immunized human volunteers were tested for serologic reactivity to Borrelia burgdorferi. Testing was performed with samples obtained prior to administration of vaccine and at 30 days following administration of an initial and a second dose of OspA vaccine. The assays used to assess serologic reactivity included an in-house-developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), an in-house-developed Western blot assay, two commercial Western blot tests, and a commercially available dot blot assay. Data obtained from this study demonstrate that immunization with the OspA vaccine will cause ELISA to yield positive results (as reported previously) for the majority of vaccine recipients. Results obtained from Western blot analysis indicate that vaccination with recombinant OspA induces production of antibodies which bind to several different borrelial proteins. The degree of reactivity detected by Western blotting varied greatly between the three assays used. The in-house assay showed the least reactivity, while one commercial Western blot test actually yielded positive test results for infection with B. burgdorferi. The usefulness of all three Western blot assays for the diagnosis of potential infection in a vaccine recipient is severely limited by the extensive reactivity caused by vaccination alone. Antibodies produced in response to OspA vaccination did not significantly affect the performance of the dot blot test; thus, it could provide a reliable means to test for infection with B. burgdorferi in OspA vaccine recipients."

We investigated whether Borrelia burgdorferi could stimulate up-regulation of cell membrane uPAR in vitro. B. burgdorferi, purified native outer surface protein A, and a synthetic outer surface protein A hexalipopeptide stimulated human monocytes to up-regulate membrane uPAR as measured by immunofluorescence/FACS and Western blot. The presence of soluble uPAR in culture supernatants, measured by Ag capture ELISA, was also observed. LPS from Salmonella typhimurium and lipotechoic acid from Streptococcus pyogenes also induced the up-regulation of both membrane and soluble uPAR protein by monocytes. Up-regulation of uPAR was induced by conditioned medium from B. burgdorferi/monocyte cocultures. The up-regulation of uPAR by B. burgdorferi was concomitant with an increase in uPAR mRNA, indicating that synthesis was de novo. The expression and release of uPAR in response to B. burgdorferi and other bacterial components suggests a role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease as well as in other bacterial infections."

Human neutrophils also released pro-MMP-9 and a 130-kDa protein with gelatinolytic activity in response to live B. burgdorferi. In addition, U937 cells and human keratinocyte cells were also stimulated to release pro-MMP-9 under the same conditions. However, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) released pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 in a constitutive manner and were not influenced by live spirochetes. MMPs produced by human monocytes also enhanced the penetration of B. burgdorferi through extracellular matrix component barriers in vitro. Plasmin stabilized on the surface of the Lyme disease spirochete was shown to activate pro-MMP-9 to its active form. This active form was also observed in the plasma of mice infected with a relapsing fever borrelia. These results suggest that borreliae can upregulate MMPs and possibly mediate an activation cascade initiated by plasmin bound to the microbial surface. MMPs may play a role in dissemination of the Lyme disease spirochete and in the pathogenesis of Borrelia infection."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochetal bacterium that causes human Lyme disease, encodes numerous lipoproteins which have the capacity to trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines from a variety of host cell types, and it is generally believed that these cytokines contribute to the disease process in vivo. We previously reported that low-passage-number infectious B. burgdorferi spirochetes express a novel lipidation-independent activity which induces secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by the mouse MC/9 mast cell line. Using RNase protection assays, we determined that mast cells exposed in vitro to low-passage-number, but not high-passage-number, B. burgdorferi spirochetes show increased expression of additional mRNAs representing several chemokines, including macrophage-inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and TCA3, as well as the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-6. Furthermore, mast cell TNF-alpha secretion can be inhibited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin and also by preincubation with purified mouse immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a, but not mouse IgG3, and by a mouse Fc gamma receptor II and III (FcgammaRII/III)-specific rat monoclonal antibody, suggesting the likely involvement of host FcgammaRIII in B. burgdorferi-mediated signaling. A role for passively adsorbed rabbit or bovine IgG or serum components in B. burgdorferi-mediated FcgammaR signaling was excluded in control experiments. These studies confirm that low-passage-number B. burgdorferi spirochetes express a novel activity which upregulates the expression of a variety of host cell chemokine and cytokine genes, and they also establish a novel antibody-independent role for FcgammaRs in transduction of activation signals by bacterial products."

		"abstract": "Spirochete bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex cause Lyme borreliosis. The three pathogenic subspecies Borrelia garinii, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto differ in their disease profiles and susceptibility to complement lysis. We investigated whether complement resistance of Borreliae could be due to acquisition of the main soluble inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway, factor H and the factor H-like protein 1. When exposed to nonimmune EDTA-plasma, the serum-resistant B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains bound factor H/factor H-like protein 1 to their surfaces. Assays with radiolabeled proteins showed that factor H bound strongly to the B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strain. To identify factor H ligands on the borrelial surface, we analyzed a panel of outer surface proteins of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto with the surface plasmon resonance technique. The outer surface lipoprotein OspE was identified as a specific ligand for factor H. Using recombinant constructs of factor H, the binding site for OspE was localized to the C-terminal short consensus repeat domains 15-20. Specific binding of factor H to B. burgdorferi sensu stricto OspE may help the pathogen to evade complement attack and phagocytosis."

		"abstract": "Vsp surface lipoproteins are serotype-defining antigens of relapsing fever spirochetes that undergo multiphasic antigenic variation to avoid the immune response. One of these proteins, VspA of Borrelia turicatae, is also associated with neurotropism in infected mice. Vsp proteins are highly polymorphic in sequence, which may relate to their specific antibody reactivities and host cell interactions. To determine whether sequence variations affect protein structure, we compared B. turicatae VspA with three related proteins: VspB of B. turicatae, Vsp26 of the relapsing fever agent Borrelia hermsii, and OspC of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. Recombinant non-lipidated proteins were purified by affinity or ion exchange chromatography. Circular dichroism spectra revealed similar, highly alpha-helical secondary structures for all four proteins. In vitro assays demonstrated protease-resistant, thermostable Vsp cores starting at a conserved serine at position 34 (Ser(34)). All proteins aggregate as dimers in solution. In situ trypsin treatment and surface protein cross-linking showed that the native lipoproteins also form protease-resistant dimers. These findings indicate that Vsp proteins have a common compact fold and that their established functions are based on localized polymorphisms. Two forms of VspA crystals suitable for structure determination by x-ray diffraction methods have been obtained."

		"abstract": "We have recently found that strain B31 infection-immune rabbits are completely protected against homologous challenge with large numbers (>10(6)) of host-adapted Borrelia burgdorferi (HAB) (E. S. Shang, C. I. Champion, X. Wu, J. T. Skare, D. B. Blanco, J. N. Miller, and M. A. Lovett, Infect. Immun. 68:4189-4199, 2000). In this study, we have extended these findings to determine whether B31 strain infection-immune rabbits are also protected against heterologous HAB challenge. Infection-immune rabbits challenged with large numbers (>10(6)) of homologous HAB strain B31 were completely protected from erythema migrans (EM) and skin and disseminated infection. In contrast, infection-immune rabbits challenged with heterologous HAB strains N40 and Sh-2-82 were completely susceptible to EM and skin and disseminated infection; challenge with strain 297 also resulted in EM and infection of the skin and viscera, but clearance of infection occurred 3 weeks postchallenge. These findings confirm that immunity elicited in rabbits by B31 strain infection confers complete protection against large-dose homologous HAB challenge but not against a heterologous strain."
