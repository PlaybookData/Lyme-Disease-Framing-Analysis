		"abstract": "Lyme's disease also known as Erythema chronicum Migrans, is a multisystem infectious disease caused by the spirochete \"Borrelia burgdorferi\" which is transmitted by \"Ixodes\" tick, with both specific and nonspecific manifestations. Nervous system involvement occurs in 10%-15% of untreated patients and typically involves lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, and/or polyradiculitis. Here, we are reporting an interesting and challenging case of Neuro-Borreliosis in a young officer cadet, meeting the description for Bannwarth's syndrome and presenting initially as a surgical emergency followed by paraparesis. The diagnosis was finally clinched based on clinical profile of Chronic Myeloradiculopathy with focal myositis in the setting of recent outdoor camping, and confirmed by demonstrating high IgG antibody titres in serum and Cerebro spinal fluid (CSF). The officer cadet was treated successfully with a 6 week course of Ceftriaxone and Doxycycline, and went back to full training."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) is one of the most prevalent tick-borne emerging infections in North America, Europe, and far Eastern Asia including Korea and Japan. This study was undertaken with the aim of a comparative and quantitative analysis of the epidemiological aspects of LD infections in Korea and Japan from 2011 to 2016. The raw data analyzed in this study were obtained from the websites of the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), Korea, and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan. In total 65 cases of LD were observed with a cumulative incidence rate (CIR) of 0.22 per million population in Korea from 2011 to 2016. During the same period in Japan, there were 75 cases of LD with a CIR of 0.10 [significantly higher than that in Korea (p <0.01)]. Further, the results showed that in Korea, LD incidence was slightly higher in women than in men; but in Japan, the case was reverse, with incidence much higher in men than women. The proportion of cases differed significantly by age-specific adjusted groups within both countries (p <0.01). In both the countries, the incidence of LD was highest among those aged ≤20 yr (93.8% cases in Korea, and 94.7% cases in Japan). Cases peaked in autumn (46.7% of total cases) in Korea and in summer (60.0%) in Japan (p <0.01). The counties in rural areas had a significantly higher proportion of cases than the capital cities in both the countries (p <0.01). The study indicates that LD in Korea and Japan is an emerging zoonosis, and pose a serious risk to public health. The results underscore the continued emergency of LD and provide a basis for targeting prevention campaigns to a population with increasing incidence. Proper information, education and communication (IEC) activities can be helpful in reducing the spread of infection."

		"abstract": "Climate change threatens human health, but there remains a lack of evidence on the economic toll of climate-sensitive public health impacts. We characterize human mortality and morbidity costs associated with 10 climate-sensitive case study events spanning 11 US states in 2012: wildfires in Colorado and Washington, ozone air pollution in Nevada, extreme heat in Wisconsin, infectious disease outbreaks of tick-borne Lyme disease in Michigan and mosquito-borne West Nile virus in Texas, extreme weather in Ohio, impacts of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey and New York, allergenic oak pollen in North Carolina, and harmful algal blooms on the Florida coast. Applying a consistent economic valuation approach to published studies and state estimates, we estimate total health-related costs from 917 deaths, 20,568 hospitalizations, and 17,857 emergency department visits of $10.0 billion in 2018 dollars, with a sensitivity range of $2.7-24.6 billion. Our estimates indicate that the financial burden of deaths, hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and associated medical care is a key dimension of the overall economic impact of climate-sensitive events. We found that mortality costs (i.e., the value of a statistical life) of $8.4 billion exceeded morbidity costs and lost wages ($1.6 billion combined). By better characterizing health damages in economic terms, this work helps to shed light on the burden climate-sensitive events already place on U.S. public health each year. In doing so, we provide a conceptual framework for broader estimation of climate-sensitive health-related costs. The high health-related costs associated with climate-sensitive events highlight the importance of actions to mitigate climate change and adapt to its unavoidable impacts."

		"abstract": "Use of emerging technology allowing for identification of genetic material from pathogens and endosymbionts in ticks collected from humans, domestic animals, wildlife, or the environment has resulted in an avalanche of new data on tick-microorganism associations. This rapidly growing stream of new information is a tremendous resource but also presents challenges, including how detection of pathogen genetic material in ticks should best be interpreted. There is a tendency in the more recent published literature to incorrectly use the term \"vector\" based on detection of pathogen genetic material from tick species not experimentally confirmed to serve as vectors of the pathogen in question. To serve as a vector of a horizontally maintained pathogen, such as a Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) Lyme borreliosis spirochete, the tick species in question must be capable of acquiring the pathogen while feeding in the larval or nymphal stage on an infectious host, maintaining it transstadially through the molt, and then transmitting the pathogen to a naïve host while feeding in the subsequent nymphal or adult stage. This review examines the experimental evidence for and against species of hard (ixodid) ticks from different genera to serve as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. Of the 18 Ixodes species ticks evaluated to date, 13 were experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. These studies focused primarily on the three major Lyme borreliosis agents: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii, and Borrelia garinii. In striking contrast, none of 8 tick species from other genera (1 Amblyomma species, 5 Dermacentor species, and 2 Haemaphysalis species) evaluated to date were unequivocally experimentally confirmed as vectors of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes. The strength of the evidence for or against each tick species to serve as a vector of B. burgdorferi s.l. spirochetes is discussed together with key knowledge gaps and research challenges."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease has been well-described in the North America and European countries. However, information is still very limited in the developing countries including Malaysia. The Orang Asli (OA), the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia reside mostly in the forest and forest fringe areas abundant with the vector for Lyme disease. Here, we described the seroprevalence of Borellia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) among the OA and demographic variables that could be associated with seroprevalence. A total of 16 OA villages distributed across 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia participated in this study. Sera obtained from 904 OA volunteers were screened for anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibodies. ELISA results obtained and demographic information collected were analysed to identify possible variables associated with seroprevalence. A total of 73 (8.1%) OA tested positive for anti-B. burgdorferi IgG antibodies. Among all the variables examined, village of residence (p = 0.045) was the only significant predictor for seropositivity. High (> 10.0%) prevalence was associated with three OA villages. Those living in one particular village were 1.65 times more likely to be seropositive as compared to other OA villages. Age, gender, marital status, household size, level of education, monthly household income and occupation were not significant predictors for seropositivity. Results of the present study support earlier findings that B. burgdorferi infection among Malaysians is currently under-recognized. Further studies will be needed at these locations to confirm the presence of Lyme disease among these populations."

		"abstract": "The prevalence of tickborne diseases worldwide is increasing virtually unchecked due to the lack of effective control strategies. The transmission dynamics of tickborne pathogens are influenced by the tick microbiome, tick co-infection with other pathogens, and environmental features. Understanding this complex system could lead to new strategies for pathogen control, but will require large-scale, high-resolution data. Here, we introduce Project Acari, a citizen science-based project to assay, at single-tick resolution, species, pathogen infection status, microbiome profile, and environmental conditions of tens of thousands of ticks collected from numerous sites across the United States. In the first phase of the project, we collected more than 2,400 ticks wild-caught by citizen scientists and developed high-throughput methods to process and sequence them individually. Applying these methods to 192 Ixodes scapularis ticks collected in a region with a high incidence of Lyme disease, we found that 62% were colonized by Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease pathogen. In contrast to previous reports, we did not find an association between the microbiome diversity of a tick and its probability of carrying B. burgdorferi. However, we did find undescribed associations between B. burgdorferi carriage and the presence of specific microbial taxa within individual ticks. Our findings underscore the power of coupling citizen science with high-throughput processing to reveal pathogen dynamics. Our approach can be extended for massively parallel screening of individual ticks, offering a powerful tool to elucidate the ecology of tickborne disease and to guide pathogen-control initiatives."

Over the seven weeks, he had several evaluations and was treated for cellulitis and facial swelling before ultimately being diagnosed and treated for Lyme disease with seventh nerve palsy and meningitis. His symptoms failed to completely resolve after treatment, and he was diagnosed with post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) due to ongoing symptoms which lasted for more than six months after treatment. Delayed diagnosis increases the risk of PTLDS and other long-term complications from Lyme disease. Provider awareness of Lyme disease risk factors, common neurologic and other presentations, and racial differences in diagnostic findings such as the skin rash can improve care by achieving earlier, accurate diagnoses and reduce risk of PTLDS."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, the most common anthropozoonosis, is a transmissible natural focal infection affecting various organs and systems. Also known as Lyme borreliosis, it is caused by Borrelia spirochetes, which are distributed by ticks of the genus Ixodes. Early diagnosis is difficult due to frequent occurrence of atypical symptoms, unnoticed tick bites, the absence of migratory erythematous lesions, and symptoms occurring during the non-tick season. If not diagnosed and treated in time, dissemination of the infection occurs and various complications develop since borrelias damage not only the skin but also the nervous system, joints, and, in rare cases, the heart and eyes. This article presents a clinical case of Lyme borreliosis-induced myocarditis, which led to the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and, consequently, urgent cardiac transplantation. According to our data, this is one of the first described cases of this complication in the world. When diagnosed in time and treated properly, the prognosis of Lyme myocarditis is usually good. In most cases, the atrioventricular block disappears within 1-2 weeks of antibiotic treatment and the implantation of a temporary pacemaker is rarely needed. In those rare cases of a chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection, dilated cardiomyopathy may develop; thus if a sudden atrioventricular block occurs, the physician should be vigilant and perform the necessary tests to exclude the diagnosis of Lyme disease.

This retrospective study included 1,200 patients (15-80 years of age) treated via laparotomy or laparoscopy, at two different institutions, for endometriosis, between 1990 and 2017. Data were collected and analyzed from medical and pathological reports. The statistical methods used included the Student's t-test and χ2 test, as well as the Mann-Whitney U test. A total of 600 women from Yale University and 600 women from Greece participated in this study. Endometrioma was confirmed in 359 (29.9%) cases. Women were compatible in terms of the site of endometriomas. Left-sided cysts were observed (P<0.001) significantly more often compared with right-sided cysts in both groups. The two groups of patients had similar rates of endometriosis stages. A statistically significant positive association (P<0.001) was found for the co-existence of benign gynecological tumors (apart from endometrioma), endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer and for post-menopausal endometriosis in women with endometriosis from Greece. Moreover, similar results were observed as regards endometriosis following in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, endometriosis-associated Lyme disease, human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV), melanoma and endometriosis in adolescents, between the two groups. To conclude, the two populations exhibited similar results as regards the surgical outcomes of endometriosis laparoscopic or open surgery. Endometriosis represents a multifactorial entity that depends on complex interactions of hormonal, genetic, immunological and environmental factors. Gynecologists should be aware that there is an association between endometriosis and cancerous diseases. It is thus suggested that the presence of comorbidities in women with endometriosis."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ticks are the main vectors for a number of zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease. Ticks secrete saliva directly into a mammalian host while feeding on the host's blood. This action serves to modulate host immunity and coagulation, thus allowing ticks to attach and feed upon their host. One of the most extensively studied components of tick saliva is Salp15. Research has shown that this protein binds specifically to CD4 molecules on the surface of T lymphocytes, interferes with TCR-mediated signaling transduction, inhibits CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation, and impedes the secretion of interleukin 2 (IL-2). Salp15 also binds specifically to dendritic cell dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) to up-regulate the expression of CD73 in regulatory T cells. Collectively, these findings render this salivary protein a potential candidate for a range of therapeutic applications. Here, we discuss our current understanding of Salp15 and the mechanisms that might be used to treat disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis caused by spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex is the most common tick-borne disease in Europe. In addition, the relapsing-fever spirochaete Borrelia miyamotoi, which has been associated with febrile illness and meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised persons, is present in Europe. This study investigated Borrelia prevalence and species distribution in ticks removed from humans and sent as diagnostic material to the Institute for Parasitology, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, in 2013-2017. A probe-based real-time PCR was carried out and Borrelia-positive samples were subjected to species determination by reverse line blot (RLB), including a B. miyamotoi-specific probe. The overall Borrelia-infection rate as determined by real-time PCR was 20.02 % (510/2547, 95 % CI: 18.48-21.63 %), with annual prevalences ranging from 17.17 % (90/524, 95 % CI: 14.04-20.68 %) in 2014 to 24.12 % (96/398, 95 % CI: 19.99-28.63 %) in 2015. In total, 271/475 (57.1 %) positive samples available for RLB were successfully differentiated. Borrelia afzelii was detected in 30.53 % of cases (145/475, 95 % CI: 26.41-34.89), followed by B. garinii/B. bavariensis (13.26 % [63/475], 95 % CI: 10.34-16.65). Borrelia valaisiana occurred in 5.89 % (28/475, 95 % CI: 3.95-8.41), B. spielmanii in 4.63 % (22/475, 95 % CI: 2.93-6.93), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.)/B. carolinensis in 2.32 % (11/475, 95 % CI: 1.16-4.11), B. lusitaniae in 0.63 % (3/475, 95 % CI: 0.13-1.83) and B. bisettiae in 0.42 % (2/475, 95 % CI: 0.05-1.51) of positive ticks. Borrelia kurtenbachii was not detected, while B. miyamotoi was identified in 7.37 % (35/475, 95 % CI: 5.19-10.10) of real-time PCR-positive samples. Sanger sequencing of B. garinii/B. bavariensis-positive ticks revealed that the majority were B. garinii-infections (50/52 successfully amplified samples), while only 2 ticks were infected with B. bavariensis. Furthermore, 6/12 B. burgdorferi s.s./B. carolinensis-positive samples could be differentiated; all of them were identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. Thirty-nine ticks (8.21 %, 95 % CI: 5.90-11.05) were coinfected with two different species. Comparison of the species distribution between ticks removed from humans in 2015 and questing ticks collected in the same year and the same area revealed a significantly higher B. afzelii-prevalence in diagnostic tick samples than in questing ticks, confirming previous observations. The obtained data indicate that Borrelia prevalence fluctuated in the same range as observed in a previous study, analysing the period from 2006 to 2012. Detection of B. miyamotoi in 7.37 % of Borrelia-positive samples points to the fact that clinicians should be aware of this pathogen as a differential diagnosis in cases of febrile illness."

Other plausible etiologies have been ruled out after extensive workups, including liver biopsy. His hyperbilirubinemia gradually resolved after being started on doxycycline. With high incidence of Lyme disease, it should be considered for patients who present with hyperbilirubinemia in endemic areas with possible tick exposure."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an illness caused by species of Borrelia spirochetes. Early diagnosis of lyme disease depends on the recognition of skin findings, which are seen in almost 80% of all cases. Erythema migrans is the most common skin lesion. Serologic tests can be used to support the clinical diagnosis. In this article, we report a six-year-old girl who was diagnosed as having early localized lyme disease, who presented with a rash on her right shoulder. The lesion was found consistent with erythema migrans. She had a history of tick bite seven days before the onset of the rash. Serologic test results were also consistent with lyme disease. Her skin lesion disappeared with cefuroxime treatment, and no additional symptoms or pathologic findings were observed on follow-up. Recognizing early signs is important for prompt diagnosis and treatment to prevent long-term complications because the diagnosis and treatment of late-stage lyme disease can be challenging."

		"abstract": "Vector-borne pathogens often consist of genetically distinct strains that can establish co-infections in the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Co-infections (or mixed infections) can result in competitive interactions between strains with important consequences for strain abundance and transmission. Here we used the spirochete bacterium, Borrelia afzelii, as a model system to investigate the interactions between strains inside its tick vector, Ixodes ricinus. Larvae were fed on mice infected with either one or two strains of B. afzelii. Engorged larvae were allowed to molt into nymphs that were subsequently exposed to three seasonal treatments (artificial summer, artificial winter, and natural winter), which differed in temperature and light conditions. We used strain-specific qPCRs to quantify the presence and abundance of each strain in the immature ticks. Co-infection in the mice reduced host-to-tick transmission to larval ticks and this effect was maintained in the resultant nymphs at 1 and 4 months after the larva-to-nymph molt. Competition between strains in co-infected ticks reduced the abundance of both strains. This inter-strain competition occurred in the three life stages that we investigated: engorged larvae, recently molted nymphs, and overwintered nymphs. The abundance of B. afzelii in the nymphs declined by 40.5% over a period of 3 months, but this phenomenon was not influenced by the seasonal treatment. Future studies should investigate whether inter-strain competition in the tick influences the subsequent strain-specific transmission success from the tick to the vertebrate host."

The study was based on an original questionnaire including questions which concerned the applied methods of removing ticks attached to the skin, the kind of preventive measures undertaken to avoid tick bites, the evaluation of knowledge concerning the prevention of tick-borne diseases, as well as the participants' willingness to be educated on this issue. Removing a tick with a pair of tweezers by a simple vertical move was more frequently practiced by the hunters (16.5%). Spreading an oily substance over a tick to make it go out on its own was more often applied by the foresters (18.8%). The occurrence of <i>erythema migrans</i> was more frequently reported by the foresters (47.2%). Among the persons declaring no knowledge of the prevention of tick-borne diseases, 77.8% of the hunters and 61.5% of the foresters were willing to gain such knowledge, and 11.1% of the hunters and 21.2% of the foresters did not want any education on this issue. The hunters more often than the foresters applied repellents and checked their body after returning from green areas. Education is needed in certain groups undertaking hobby or vocational activities in forest areas of Poland and Ukraine. It seems reasonable to undertake research on the preferences concerning the choice of repellents among the groups at risk of tick bites. Med Pr. 2020;71(1):59-68."

We previously reported the infection of C3H 5-lipoxygenase (LO)-deficient mice with Borrelia burgdorferi results in prolonged nonresolving Lyme arthritis. Here we define the role of the 5-LO metabolite leukotriene (LT)B4 and its high-affinity receptor, BLT1, in this response. C3H and C3H BLT1-/- mice were infected with B. burgdorferi and arthritis progression was monitored by ankle swelling over time. Similar to 5-LO-/- mice, BLT1-/- mice developed nonresolving Lyme arthritis characterized by increased neutrophils in the joint at later time points than WT mice, but with fewer apoptotic (caspase-3+ ) neutrophils. In vitro, BLT1-/- neutrophils were defective in their ability to undergo apoptosis due to the lack of LTB4 -mediated down-regulation of cAMP, subsequent failure to induce Death-Inducing Signaling Complex (DISC) components, and decreased FasL and CD36 expression. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with SQ 22,536 restored BLT1-/- BMN apoptosis, FasL and CD36 expression, and clearance by macrophages. We conclude that LTB4/BLT1 signaling has an unexpected critical role in mediating neutrophil apoptosis via the down-regulation of cAMP. Loss of BLT1 signaling led to defective clearance of neutrophils from the inflamed joint and failed arthritis resolution."

In the process of ruling out of atypical Masters' disease, we conducted a punch biopsy of suspected EM and a two-tier serology testing for Lyme borreliosis, where we registered antibodies against B. spielmanii. Skin biopsy showed CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocyte involvement and high activity of matrix metalloproteinase 9. No alterations were detected in distribution and morphology of collagen type I and IV. Therefore, it is suggested that other mechanisms should be considered as major contributing factors to local spreading of B.spielmanii."

		"abstract": "Medicine faces crisis with emerging \"super bugs,\" lethal viruses (Ebola), and stealth pathogens such as tick-borne infections. Thousands are dying worldwide of once easily treatable diseases. Ozone therapy, extensively studied, may be a valuable adjunctive or stand-alone therapy. Ebola again ravages Africa with over 2000 already dead, carrying a 65% mortality rate. The world desperately needs safe, inexpensive and effective anti-infective therapy to which microbes will not develop resistance. Oxidation therapies have shown an extremely high safety profile, lacking credible reports of significant injury beyond vein irritation. Ozone therapy, the most studied and least expensive to perform, is in itself a germicide, not an antibiotic, and improves several physiological parameters essential for infection defense. Recent reports indicate very favorable responses to both bacterial and viral disease, inclusive of Ebola. Despite lack of commercial profitability (not patentable), medicine would do well to revisit its pre-antibiotic era oxidation therapy roots, especially ozone in the current crisis."

		"abstract": "Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of vector-borne disease (VBD) in pets is one cornerstone of companion animal practices. Veterinarians are facing new challenges associated with the emergence, reemergence, and rising incidence of VBD, including heartworm disease, Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and ehrlichiosis. Increases in the observed prevalence of these diseases have been attributed to a multitude of factors, including diagnostic tests with improved sensitivity, expanded annual testing practices, climatologic and ecological changes enhancing vector survival and expansion, emergence or recognition of novel pathogens, and increased movement of pets as travel companions. Veterinarians have the additional responsibility of providing information about zoonotic pathogen transmission from pets, especially to vulnerable human populations: the immunocompromised, children, and the elderly. Hindering efforts to protect pets and people is the dynamic and ever-changing nature of VBD prevalence and distribution. To address this deficit in understanding, the Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC) began efforts to annually forecast VBD prevalence in 2011. These forecasts provide veterinarians and pet owners with expected disease prevalence in advance of potential changes. This review summarizes the fidelity of VBD forecasts and illustrates the practical use of CAPC pathogen prevalence maps and forecast data in the practice of veterinary medicine and client education."

The aim of the present study was to investigate if there is a constitutional difference in complement activation between individuals with previous subclinical Lyme borreliosis (SB) and patients previously diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB).Lepirudin plasma for activation studies was collected from 60 SB individuals and from 22 patients pre-diagnosed with LNB. The plasma was incubated with live Borrelia spirochetes of two strains (complement sensitive B. garinii Lu59 and complement resistant B. afzelii ACA1).Complement factor C3 was measured in non-activated lepirudin plasma with immune-nephelometry and C3a and sC5b-9 generated during complement activation were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.We found that the complement sensitive Lu59 induced higher complement activation than the complement resistant ACA1 when measuring activation products C3a and sC5b-9 in SB and LNB patients, p < 0.0001. No significant difference was found between SB and LNB patients in systemic levels of C3. Furthermore, SB individuals generated a higher activation of C3 cleavage to C3a (C3a/C3 ratio) than LNB patients after activation with ACA1, p < 0.001, but no significant differences were found in response to Lu59. In conclusion, Lu59 induced higher complement activation than ACA1 and individuals with previous SB showed increased generation of C3a compared with patients with previous LNB. In our study population, this mechanism could lead to less elimination of spirochetes in LNB patients and thereby be a factor contributing to the clinical outcome."

We present the case of a man who developed spinal myoclonus 3 weeks after returning from the Czech Republic where he developed erythema migrans on his arm following multiple tick exposures. Spinal fluid analysis showed a pleocytosis and MRI showed enhancement at C5-C6. His serology was positive for IgM antibodies to Borrelia afzelli He was successfully treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline with improvement of his spinal myoclonus and radiculitis. We conclude that early Lyme neuroborreliosis may present with uncommon neurological manifestations and so a high degree of suspicion is needed."

		"abstract": "Objective: Chronic Lyme disease has been a poorly defined term and often dismissed as a fictitious entity. In this paper, the International Lyme and Associated Diseases Society (ILADS) provides its evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease. Definition: ILADS defines chronic Lyme disease (CLD) as a multisystem illness with a wide range of symptoms and/or signs that are either continuously or intermittently present for a minimum of six months. The illness is the result of an active and ongoing infection by any of several pathogenic members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (Bbsl). The infection has variable latency periods and signs and symptoms may wax, wane and migrate. CLD has two subcategories, CLD, untreated (CLD-U) and CLD, previously treated (CLD-PT). The latter requires that CLD manifestations persist or recur following treatment and are present continuously or in a relapsing/remitting pattern for a duration of six months or more. Methods: Systematic review of over 250 peer reviewed papers in the international literature to characterize the clinical spectrum of CLD-U and CLD-PT. Conclusion: This evidence-based definition of chronic Lyme disease clarifies the term's meaning and the literature review validates that chronic and ongoing Bbsl infections can result in chronic disease. Use of this CLD definition will promote a better understanding of the infection and facilitate future research of this infection."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a complex tick-borne zoonosis that poses an escalating public health threat in several parts of the world, despite sophisticated healthcare infrastructure and decades of effort to address the problem. Concepts like the true burden of the illness, from incidence rates to longstanding consequences of infection, and optimal case management, also remain shrouded in controversy. At the heart of this multidisciplinary issue are the causative spirochetal pathogens belonging to the Borrelia Lyme complex. Their unusual physiology and versatile lifestyle have challenged microbiologists, and may also hold the key to unlocking mysteries of the disease. The goal of this review is therefore to integrate established and emerging concepts of Borrelia biology and pathogenesis, and position them in the broader context of biomedical research and clinical practice. We begin by considering the conventions around diagnosing and characterizing Lyme disease that have served as a conceptual framework for the discipline. We then explore virulence from the perspective of both host (genetic and environmental predispositions) and pathogen (serotypes, dissemination, and immune modulation), as well as considering antimicrobial strategies (lab methodology, resistance, persistence, and clinical application), and borrelial adaptations of hypothesized medical significance (phenotypic plasticity or pleomorphy)."

		"abstract": "Babesiosis is a parasitic vector-borne disease of increasing public health importance. Since the first human case was reported in 1957, zoonotic species have been reported on nearly every continent. Zoonotic Babesia is vectored by Ixodes ticks and is commonly transmitted in North America by Ixodes scapularis, the tick species responsible for transmitting the pathogens that also cause Lyme disease, Powassan virus, and anaplasmosis in humans. Predicted climate change is expected to impact the spread of vectors, which is likely to affect the distribution of vector-borne diseases including human babesiosis. A scoping review has been executed to characterize the global evidence on zoonotic babesiosis. Articles were compiled through a comprehensive search of relevant bibliographic databases and targeted government websites. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts for relevance and characterized full-text articles using a relevance screening and data characterization tool developed a priori. This review included 1394 articles relevant to human babesiosis and/or zoonotic Babesia species. The main zoonotic species were B. microti, B. divergens, B. duncani and B. venatorum. Articles described a variety of study designs used to study babesiosis in humans and/or zoonotic Babesia species in vectors, animal hosts, and in vitro cell cultures. Topics of study included: pathogenesis (680 articles), epidemiology (480), parasite characterization (243), diagnostic test accuracy (98), mitigation (94), treatment (65), transmission (54), surveillance (29), economic analysis (7), and societal knowledge (1). No articles reported predictive models investigating the impact of climate change on Babesia species. Knowledge gaps in the current evidence include research on the economic burden associated with babesiosis, societal knowledge studies, surveillance of Babesia species in vectors and animal hosts, and predictive models on the impact of climate change. The scoping review results describe the current knowledge and knowledge gaps on zoonotic Babesia which can be used to inform future policy and decision making."

		"abstract": "Ecological factors, host characteristics and/or interactions among microbes may all shape the occurrence of microbes and the structure of microbial communities within organisms. In the past, disentangling these factors and determining their relative importance in shaping within-host microbiota communities has been hampered by analytical limitations to account for (dis)similar environmental preferences ('environmental filtering'). Here we used a joint species distribution modelling (JSDM) approach to characterize the bacterial microbiota of one of the most important disease vectors in Europe, the sheep tick Ixodes ricinus, along ecological gradients in the Swiss Alps. Although our study captured extensive environmental variation along elevational clines, the explanatory power of such large-scale ecological factors was comparably weak, suggesting that tick-specific traits and behaviours, microhabitat and -climate experienced by ticks, and interactions among microbes play an important role in shaping tick microbial communities. Indeed, when accounting for shared environmental preferences, evidence for significant patterns of positive or negative co-occurrence among microbes was found, which is indicative of competition or facilitation processes. Signals of facilitation were observed primarily among human pathogens, leading to co-infection within ticks, whereas signals of competition were observed between the tick endosymbiont Spiroplasma and human pathogens. These findings highlight the important role of small-scale ecological variation and microbe-microbe interactions in shaping tick microbial communities and the dynamics of tick-borne disease."

The appropriate diagnosis and management of neuroborelliosis can be challenging and require meticulous medical approaches. Herein we present a unique case of Lyme disease with neurologic manifestations including both radiculitis and meningitis due to its atypical and challenging clinical presentation and management with updated literature review."

		"abstract": "Introduction: The multi-system symptoms accompanying acute and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome pose a challenge for time-limited assessment. The General Symptom Questionnaire (GSQ-30) was developed to fill the need for a brief patient-reported measure of multi-system symptom burden. In this study we assess the psychometric properties and sensitivity to change of the GSQ-30. Materials and Methods: 342 adult participants comprised 4 diagnostic groups: Lyme disease (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, n = 124; erythema migrans, n = 94); depression, n = 36; traumatic brain injury, n = 51; healthy, n = 37. Participants were recruited from clinical research facilities in Massachusetts, Maryland, and New York. Validation measures for the GSQ-30 included the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 for depression and anxiety, visual analog scales for fatigue and pain, the Sheehan Disability Scale for functional impairment, and one global health question. To assess sensitivity to change, 53 patients with erythema migrans completed the GSQ-30 before treatment and 6 months after 3 weeks of treatment with doxycycline. Results: The GSQ-30 demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach α = 0.95). The factor structure reflects four core domains: pain/fatigue, neuropsychiatric, neurologic, and viral-like symptoms. Symptom burden was significantly associated with depression (rs = 0.60), anxiety (rs = 0.55), pain (rs = 0.75), fatigue (rs = 0.77), functional impairment (rs = 0.79), and general health (rs = -0.58). The GSQ-30 detected significant change in symptom burden before and after antibiotic therapy; this change correlated with change in functional impairment. The GSQ-30 total score significantly differed for erythema migrans vs. three other groups (post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome, depression, healthy controls). The GSQ-30 total scores for traumatic brain injury and depression were not significantly different from post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Conclusions and Relevance: The GSQ-30 is a valid and reliable instrument to assess symptom burden among patients with acute and post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome and is sensitive in the detection of change after treatment among patients with erythema migrans. The GSQ-30 should prove useful in clinical and research settings to assess multi-system symptom burden and to monitor change over time. The GSQ-30 may also prove useful in future precision medicine studies as a clinical measure to correlate with disease-relevant biomarkers."

		"abstract": "Serologic testing is the standard for laboratory diagnosis and confirmation of Lyme disease. Serodiagnostic assays to detect antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme borreliosis, are used for detection of infection. However, serologic testing within the first month of infection is less sensitive as patients' antibody responses continue to develop. Previously, we screened several B. burgdorferi in vivo expressed antigens for candidates that elicit early antibody responses in patients with Stage 1 and 2 Lyme disease. We evaluated patient IgM seroreactivity against 6 antigens and found an increase in sensitivity without compromising specificity when compared to current IgM second-tier immunoblot scoring. In this study, we continued the evaluation using a multi-antigen panel to measure IgM plus IgG seroreactivity in these early Lyme disease patients' serum samples. Using two statistical methods for calculating positivity cutoff values, sensitivity was 70 and 84-87%, for early acute and early convalescent Lyme disease patients, respectively. Specificity was 98-100% for healthy non-endemic control patients, and 96-100% for healthy endemic controls depending on the statistical analysis. We conclude that improved serologic testing for early Lyme disease may be achieved by the addition of multiple borrelial antigens that elicit IgM and IgG antibodies early in infection."

		"abstract": "Complement is a key first line innate host defense system in the blood of vertebrates. Upon activation, this powerful defense mechanism can elicit inflammatory responses, lyse non-self-cells, or mark them for opsonophagocytic removal. Blood-feeding arthropods thus require the ability to block host complement activation in the bloodmeal to prevent undesired cell or tissue damage during feeding. The soft tick Ornithodoros moubata produces a complement inhibitory protein, OmCI. This protein binds to a mammalian complement protein C5 and blocks further activation of complement cascades, which results in the prevention of complement-mediated bacterial killing through membrane attack complex. Interestingly, the amino acids involved in OmCI binding are highly conserved among mammalian and avian C5, but the ability of this protein to inhibit the complement from birds remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that OmCI is capable of preventing quail complement-mediated erythrocyte lysis, inhibiting the capability of this animal's complement to eliminate a serum-sensitive Lyme disease bacterial strain. We also found that the ability of OmCI to inhibit quail complement-mediated killing of Lyme disease bacteria can be extended to different domestic and wild birds. Our results illustrate the utility of OmCI to block bird complement. These results provide the foundation for further use of this protein as a tool to study the molecular basis of avian complement and pathogen evasion to such a defense mechanism."

Drawing upon ethnographic research among mainstream and Lyme-literate physicians, I suggest that medically unexplained illness is not a biomedical anomaly but an intrinsic feature of biomedicine."

National surveillance shows that children are an at-risk age group. To study the epidemiology of LD in Canadian children using the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program (CPSP) to better understand exposure history, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of paediatric LD cases in Canada. A structured questionnaire was completed by paediatricians for each LD case reported as part of the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program from 2014 to 2017. There were 95 cases that met inclusion criteria as confirmed or probable cases. The median age was 7 years; 38 % were 5-9 years and 35 % were 10-15 years of age. Most cases were acquired in known Canadian endemic locations; 5 were acquired during travel to the US. Most cases were reported from Nova Scotia and Ontario (46 % and 38 % respectively). The most common clinical presentation was arthritis (59 % of all cases), which is a manifestation of the late disseminated stage of LD. Late disseminated disease presented through the year, whereas early LD (Erythema migrans) and early disseminated LD presented during the summer and fall. Antibiotic choice and duration of therapy generally followed accepted guidelines. This study of the clinical spectrum of LD in Canadian children underlines the need for preventive measures to protect children in Canada from emerging LD, and the need for health care provider awareness."

A spatio-temporal kernel is derived from training data to capture the typical interaction effects of reported infections across time and space, which provides insight into the dynamics of the spread of infectious diseases. Testing the model on a one-week-ahead prediction task for campylobacteriosis and rotavirus infections across Germany, as well as Lyme borreliosis across the federal state of Bavaria, shows that the proposed model performs on-par with the state-of-the-art hhh4 model. However, it provides a full posterior distribution over parameters in addition to model predictions, which aides in the assessment of the model. The employed Bayesian Monte Carlo regression framework is easily extensible and allows for incorporating prior domain knowledge, which makes it suitable for use on limited, yet complex datasets as often encountered in epidemiology."

		"abstract": "Borrelia (B.) mayonii sp. nov. has recently been reported as a novel human pathogenic spirochete causing Lyme disease (LD) in North America. Previous data reveal a higher spirochaetemia in the blood compared to patients infected by LD spirochetes belonging to the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex, suggesting that this novel genospecies must exploit strategies to overcome innate immunity, in particular complement. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of immune evasion, we utilized various methodologies to phenotypically characterize B. mayonii and to identify determinants involved in the interaction with complement. Employing serum bactericidal assays, we demonstrated that B. mayonii resists complement-mediated killing. To further elucidate the role of the key regulators of the alternative pathway (AP), factor H (FH), and FH-like protein 1 (FHL-1) in immune evasion of B. mayonii, serum adsorption experiments were conducted. The data revealed that viable spirochetes recruit both regulators from human serum and FH retained its factor I-mediated C3b-inactivating activity when bound to the bacterial cells. In addition, two prominent FH-binding proteins of approximately 30 and 18 kDa were detected in B. mayonii strain MN14-1420. Bioinformatics identified a gene, exhibiting 60% identity at the DNA level to the cspA encoding gene of B. burgdorferi. Following PCR amplification, the gene product was produced as a His-tagged protein. The CspA-orthologous protein of B. mayonii interacted with FH and FHL-1, and both bound regulators promoted inactivation of C3b in the presence of factor I. Additionally, the CspA ortholog counteracted complement activation by inhibiting the alternative and terminal but not the classical and Lectin pathways, respectively. Increasing concentrations of CspA of B. mayonii also strongly affected C9 polymerization, terminating the formation of the membrane attack complex. To assess the role of CspA of B. mayonii in facilitating serum resistance, a gain-of-function strain was generated, harboring a shuttle vector allowing expression of the CspA encoding gene under its native promotor. Spirochetes producing the native protein on the cell surface overcame complement-mediated killing, indicating that CspA facilitates serum resistance of B. mayonii. In conclusion, here we describe the molecular mechanism utilized by B. mayonii to resists complement-mediated killing by capturing human immune regulators."

This case was unusual because this patient did not show any other neurological or extraneurological symptoms of Lyme disease. LNB is a manifestation of infection by Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes that can manifest in a number of different clinical presentations depending on the nervous system dissemination of the bacteria. Most commonly, these neurological findings present as peripheral nerve radiculopathies, but rarer involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) can occur if a patient goes untreated. Most often, CNS involvement presents as meningitis with increased lymphocytes but can, in rarer cases, involve the spinal cord or brain parenchyma. The diagnosis of LNB was made after the patient was found to have suspicious lesions in the spinal cord and brain parenchyma on magnetic resonance imaging as well as cerebrospinal fluid Borrelia antibody index was consistent with CNS Lyme disease. We discuss this case as a unique clinical presentation of suspected LNB and the diagnostic findings associated with this infection."

Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression, current tests are insensitive in early stage LD, with a sensitivity of <50%. Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the U.S. Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 h). To address these challenges, we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care (POC) test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA). We trained a deep-learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets and then blindly tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-) = 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0%, respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning, the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3%, with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7%, respectively."

		"abstract": "Bacterial pathogens exhibit an impressive amount of genomic diversity. This diversity can be informative of evolutionary adaptations, host-pathogen interactions, and disease transmission patterns. However, capturing this diversity directly from biological samples is challenging. We introduce a framework for understanding the within-host diversity of a pathogen using multi-locus sequence types (MLST) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data. Our approach consists of two stages. First we process each sample individually by assigning it, for each locus in the MLST scheme, a set of alleles and a proportion for each allele. Next, we associate to each sample a set of strain types using the alleles and the strain proportions obtained in the first step. We achieve this by using the smallest possible number of previously unobserved strains across all samples, while using those unobserved strains which are as close to the observed ones as possible, at the same time respecting the allele proportions as closely as possible. We solve both problems using mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Our method performs accurately on simulated data and generates results on a real data set of Borrelia burgdorferi genomes suggesting a high level of diversity for this pathogen. Our approach can apply to any bacterial pathogen with an MLST scheme, even though we developed it with Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiological agent of Lyme disease, in mind. Our work paves the way for robust strain typing in the presence of within-host heterogeneity, overcoming an essential challenge currently not addressed by any existing methodology for pathogen genomics."

		"abstract": "Cattle grazing has been suggested to reduce the risk for Lyme borreliosis by decreasing the density of questing Ixodes ricinus infected with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. We tested the hypotheses that cattle grazing used in woodland management decreases the density of questing I. ricinus, and that it decreases the nympal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. We further expected the nympal infection prevalence of tick-borne pathogens that utilize cattle as amplifying hosts, namely Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia sensu stricto, to increase. To test these hypotheses, we compared the densities of questing I. ricinus between twenty pairs of plots in grazed and ungrazed forest areas. The density of I. ricinus adults, but not nymphs, was lower in areas grazed by cattle than in ungrazed areas. Nymphs were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Borrelia miyamotoi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia s.s. DNA from twelve paired areas. Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia s.s. from qPCR-positive tick lysates were identified further to the ecotype and species level, respectively, by DNA sequencing. The infection prevalence of A. phagocytophilum was lower, and infection prevalence of Babesia s.s., identified as Babesia venatorum, was higher in grazed areas. In contrast, infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi s.l. or B. miyamotoi did not differ between grazed and ungrazed areas. As a consequence, conventional cattle grazing in forested areas had no effect on the densities of questing nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi s.l. and B. miyamotoi. Similarly, we found no effect of cattle grazing on the density of infected nymphs with B. venatorum. The marked difference in the densities of questing nymphs infected with A. phagocytophilum could potentially be explained by the presence of a higher density of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in ungrazed areas, as the majority of typed A. phagocytophilum from ungrazed areas were the non-zoonotic ecotype II, which is associated with roe deer."

These vaccines produce an antibody response to spirochetal proteins that cross-react in many antibody tests, including immunofluorescence assay, Western blot, and whole cell ELISA used to document exposure to B. burgdorferi. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the in-clinic C6 ELISA assay (SNAP® 4Dx® Plus; IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, Maine) and the quantitative format C6 ELISA (Lyme Quant C6® Antibody Test, IDEXX Laboratories, Inc., Westbrook, ME) react to sera from dogs that have been vaccinated with 1 of 4 different commercially available B. burgdorferi vaccines. Four groups of 3 dogs each were each administered one of the 4 vaccines and sera evaluated over time by indirect fluorescent antibody assay, western blot immunoassay, the in-clinic C6 ELISA assay, and the quantitative format C6 ELISA. While all dogs developed B. burgdorferi antibodies detectable by indirect fluorescent antibody assay and western blot immunoassay after vaccination, none of the samples were positive in either of the C6 peptide-based assays. Based on these results, positive anti-C6 antibody results in client-owned dogs are likely to reflect exposure to B. burgdorferi rather than vaccination."

		"abstract": "In Lyme disease endemic areas, initial management of children with arthritis can be challenging because diagnostic tests take several days to return results, leading to potentially unnecessary invasive procedures. Our objective was to examine the role of the C6 peptide enzyme immunoassay (EIA) test to guide initial management. We enrolled children with acute arthritis undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease presenting to a participating Pedi Lyme Net emergency department (2015-2019) and performed a C6 EIA test. We defined Lyme arthritis with a positive or equivocal C6 EIA test result followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot result and defined septic arthritis as a positive synovial fluid culture result or a positive blood culture result with synovial fluid pleocytosis. Otherwise, children were considered to have inflammatory arthritis. We report the sensitivity and specificity of the C6 EIA for the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis. Of the 911 study patients, 211 children (23.2%) had Lyme arthritis, 11 (1.2%) had septic arthritis, and 689 (75.6%) had other inflammatory arthritis. A positive or equivocal C6 EIA result had a sensitivity of 100% (211 out of 211; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 98.2%-100%) and specificity of 94.2% (661 out of 700; 95% CI: 92.5%-95.9%) for Lyme arthritis. None of the 250 children with a positive or equivocal C6 EIA result had septic arthritis (0%; 95% CI: 0%-1.5%), although 75 children underwent diagnostic arthrocentesis and 27 underwent operative joint washout. In Lyme disease endemic areas, a C6 EIA result could be used to guide initial clinical decision-making, without misclassifying children with septic arthritis."

Retrospective case series. This study was conducted in 2 pediatric ophthalmology clinics, both providing community-based care in a large inner-city urban center in the U.S. Pediatric patients aged between 0 and 16 years diagnosed with papilledema and who had an underlying etiology identified were included in the study. Patient demographic data, ophthalmologic examination findings, and diagnostic work-up results were identified from clinical records. The mean age of 38 study patients (19 female, 19 male) was 8.6 ± 4.8 years. Of the 38 patients, 16 (42.1%) had idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) as the underlying cause of the papilledema, 7 (18.4%) had a craniosynostosis disorder, 6 (15.8%) had intracranial tumours, 2 (5.3%) had primary hydrocephalus, and 1 (2.6%) patient each had transverse sinus thrombosis related to sinusitis, hypertensive crisis, subdural hematoma, intracranial abscess, Lyme disease, presumed neurosarcoidosis, and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Of the 6 intracranial tumours, 2 (33.3%) presented in the sellar/parasellar region, 2 (33.3%) in the posterior fossa, and 2 (33.3%) were in cortical locations. Clinicians should have a high index of suspicion for IIH and brain tumours in children presenting with papilledema. Patients with craniosynostosis should have routine eye examinations to monitor for asymptomatic papilledema. Understanding the relative incidence of etiologies for papilledema highlights the urgency of appropriate work-up and the need to consider low-frequency etiologies."

		"abstract": "In Scandinavia, the distribution of ticks is expanding and tick-borne diseases constitute growing health risks. While the probability of getting a tick-borne disease after a tick bite is low, the health impacts can be large. This, as well as other characteristics of these diseases make tick-related risks difficult for laypeople to assess and perceived risk may differ substantially from actual risk. Understanding risk perceptions is important since it is the perceived risk, rather than actual risk, that determine behaviour and even more so for new and emerging risks. The aim of this study is to investigate knowledge and risk perceptions related to tick bites and the tick-borne diseases Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). By analysing risk perceptions and knowledge, the study helps inform the development of public health strategies in response to the increasing incidence of these diseases in Scandinavia. Two thousand, six hundred sixty-eight respondents in Denmark, Norway and Sweden answered an online questionnaire with 48 questions, including 7 questions on risk perceptions and 9 knowledge questions. Chi-squared tests were used to analyse statistical differences between country sub-samples, gender and age groups. A multivariate regression model was used to analyse factors associated with risk perceptions. Risk perceptions were on average high in comparison with scientific estimates, with respondents grossly overrating the probability of contracting LB or TBE if bitten by a tick. Also, the average perceived seriousness of a single tick bite and of getting LB or TBE was high. Knowledge on the other hand was low, especially among men and the youngest age group (18-29 years). Higher levels of knowledge about tick-borne diseases were associated with lower perceived seriousness of tick bites and LB and higher perceived seriousness of TBE. Also, having been diagnosed with LB was negatively associated with the perceived seriousness of LB. Our results indicate that informing about ticks and tick-borne diseases would be a relevant public health strategy as it could make risk perceptions better aligned with actual risk. Should the TBE virus spread further in Denmark and Norway, increasing knowledge about TBE vaccination would be especially important."

		"abstract": "The socio-economic and demographic changes that occurred over the past 50 years have dramatically expanded urban areas around the globe, thus bringing urban settlers in closer contact with nature. Ticks have trespassed the limits of forests and grasslands to start inhabiting green spaces within metropolitan areas. Hence, the transmission of pathogens causing tick-borne diseases is an important threat to public health. Using volunteered tick bite reports collected by two Dutch initiatives, here we present a method to model tick bite risk using human exposure and tick hazard predictors. Our method represents a step forward in risk modelling, since we combine a well-known ensemble learning method, Random Forest, with four count data models of the (zero-inflated) Poisson family. This combination allows us to better model the disproportions inherent in the volunteered tick bite reports. Unlike canonical machine learning models, our method can capture the overdispersion or zero-inflation inherent in data, thus yielding tick bite risk predictions that resemble the original signal captured by volunteers. Mapping model predictions enables a visual inspection of the spatial patterns of tick bite risk in the Netherlands. The Veluwe national park and the Utrechtse Heuvelrug forest, which are large forest-urban interfaces with several cities, are areas with high tick bite risk. This is expected, since these are popular places for recreation and tick activity is high in forests. However, our model can also predict high risk in less-intensively visited recreational areas, such as the patchy forests in the northeast of the country, the natural areas along the coastline, or some of the Frisian Islands. Our model could help public health specialists to design mitigation strategies for tick-borne diseases, and to target risky areas with awareness and prevention campaigns."

Methods: We performed a six-center prospective cohort study of children aged 1 to 21 years undergoing acute evaluation for Lyme disease. For this planned secondary analysis, we limited our cohort to children undergoing evaluation for Lyme disease who had any Lyme PCR test obtained by a treating clinician (blood, synovial fluid, or cerebrospinal fluid). We defined a case of Lyme disease with a positive two-tier Lyme disease serology: a positive or equivocal enzyme immunoassay followed by a positive supplemental immunoblot interpreted using standard criteria. We report the test characteristics of Lyme PCR for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Results: We identified 124 children of whom 54 (43.5%) had Lyme disease. Overall, 23 had a positive PCR test (sensitivity 41.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 29.7-55.0; specificity 100%, 95% CI: 94.2-100). All children with a positive Lyme PCR also had a positive two-tiered Lyme disease serology. Conclusions: The Lyme disease PCR test did not improve the diagnosis of children undergoing evaluation for acute Lyme disease. Given the additional costs of this low utility test, clinicians should not order Lyme PCR testing in the acute care setting."

		"abstract": "This study explores a suspected increasing incidence of Lyme arthritis in the Western New York pediatric population. In addition, we aim to describe a clinical picture of Lyme arthritis and the clinical features that distinguish it from other forms of arthritis. Patients diagnosed with Lyme arthritis between January 2014 and September 2018 were identified using International Classification of Diseases-10th Revision (ICD 10) codes for Lyme disease and Lyme arthritis. Patients were included in the study if they (1) exhibited arthritis, (2) tested positive for Lyme antibodies, and (3) exhibited a positive Western blot. A total of 22 patients were included in the study. There was a general trend toward an increasing number of cases of Lyme arthritis over the 45-month observation period. We identified 1 case in each 2014 and 2015, 4 cases in 2016, 7 in 2017, and 9 in the first 9 months of 2018. In total, 17 patients had arthritis as their only symptom at the time of diagnosis and 10 patients had a rash or a history that prompted suspicion of Lyme disease. The knee was the most frequent joint (86.4% of patients), and patients typically had 2 or fewer joints affected (86.4% of patients). A significant increase (P = .02) in Lyme arthritis cases was observed at Oishei Children's Hospital of Buffalo. Lyme arthritis may clinically present similarly to other forms of arthritis, such as oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so health care providers should be aware of distinguishing clinical features, which include rapid onset of swelling and patient age. Because the geographic area of endemic Lyme disease is expanding, all health care providers need to be aware of Lyme arthritis as a possible diagnosis."

		"abstract": "The spirochete Borrelia miyamotoi has recently been shown to cause relapsing fever. Like the Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, B. miyamotoi is transmitted through the bite of infected ticks; however, little is known about the response of the immune system upon infection. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the early immune response against B. burgdorferi We investigated the response of DCs to two different strains of B. miyamotoi using in vitro and ex vivo models and compared this to the response elicited by B. burgdorferi. Our findings show that B. miyamotoi is phagocytosed by monocyte-derived DCs, causing upregulation of activation markers and production of proinflammatory cytokines in a similar manner to B. burgdorferi. Recognition of B. miyamotoi was demonstrated to be partially mediated by TLR2. DCs migrated out of human skin explants upon inoculation of the skin with B. miyamotoi. Finally, we showed that B. miyamotoi-stimulated DCs induced proliferation of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to a larger extent than B. burgdorferi. In conclusion, we show in this study that DCs respond to and mount an immune response against B. miyamotoi that is similar to the response to B. burgdorferi and is able to induce T cell proliferation."

		"abstract": "The present study aimed to detect and characterize Borrelia spp. in ticks attached to dogs in Korea. Overall, 562 ticks (276 pools) attached to dogs were collected and tested for Borrelia infection by PCR targeting the 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (rrf-rrl). One tick larva (pool level, 0.4%; individual level, 0.2%) was confirmed by sequencing Borrelia garinii, a zoonotic pathogen. For molecular characterization, the outer surface protein A (ospA) and flagellin genes were analyzed. Phylogenetic ospA analysis distinguished B. garinii from B. bavariensis, which has been recently identified as a novel Borrelia species. On the other hand, phylogenetic analysis showed that single gene analysis involving rrf-rrl or flagellin was not sufficient to differentiate B. garinii from B. bavariensis. In addition, the B. garinii-infected tick was identified as Ixodes nipponensis by sequencing according to mitochondrial 16S rRNA and the second transcribed spacer region. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the molecular detection of B. garinii in I. nipponensis parasitizing a dog in Korea. Continuous monitoring of tick-borne pathogens in ticks attached to animals is required to avoid disease distribution and possible transmission to humans."

A significant increase in cases was found for both the Upper Hudson Valley (UHV) region (P < 0.001) as well as for the Lower Hudson Valley region (P = 0.03). The greatest increase in the incidence rate was found for the UHV, with a 16.8-fold increase in incidence over the 8-year time period.

		"abstract": "Prey modify their behavior in response to variation in predation risk, and such modifications can affect trophic processes such as disease transmission. However, variation in predation risk is complex, arising from direct risk from the predator itself and indirect risk due to the environment. Moreover, direct risk typically stems from multiple predators and varies over timescales (e.g., a predator nearby vs. its seasonal activities). We implemented a field-based experiment to disentangle these sources of risk and relate them to antipredator behavior in rodents. We modeled rodent occurrence and activity as a function of short- and long-term risk from a primary predator, red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), long-term risk from a second predator, coyotes (Canis latrans), and environmental variables. We found that long-term red fox activity strongly reduced rodent occurrence and that cues of nearby red fox presence decreased rodent activity by > 50%. In addition, this activity reduction was dynamic in that varied according to the background level of long-term red fox activity. Importantly, rodents did not respond to environmental variables (moonlight, temperature, and habitat) or long-term coyote activity. These results bear upon recent work that suggests predators can alter tick-borne disease dynamics via induced antipredator behavior of rodents, which are hosts for pathogens and ticks. Specifically, our study corroborates the hypothesis that red foxes act as important proximal agents in regulating tick-borne diseases by reducing rodent activity. More generally, this study highlights the need to consider the dynamic nature of prey antipredator response across landscapes with variable long-term predation risk."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease and human babesiosis are the most common tick-borne zoonoses in the Temperate Zone of North America. The number of infected patients has continued to rise globally, and these zoonoses pose a major healthcare threat. This tick-host-pathogen study was conducted to test for infectious microbes associated with Lyme disease and human babesiosis in Canada. Using the flagellin (flaB) gene, three members of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) complex were detected, namely a Borrelia lanei-like spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss), and a distinct strain that may represent a separate Bbsl genospecies. This novel Bbsl strain was detected in a mouse tick, Ixodes muris, collected from a House Wren, Troglodytes aedon, in Quebec during the southward fall migration. The presence of Bbsl in bird-feeding larvae of I. muris suggests reservoir competency in three passerines (i.e., Common Yellowthroat, House Wren, Magnolia Warbler). Based on the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene, three Babesia species (i.e., Babesia divergens-like, Babesia microti, Babesia odocoilei) were detected in field-collected ticks. Not only was B. odocoilei found in songbird-derived ticks, this piroplasm was apparent in adult questing blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis, in southern Canada. By allowing live, engorged ticks to molt, we confirm the transstadial passage of Bbsl in I. muris and B. odocoilei in I. scapularis. Bbss and Babesia microti were detected concurrently in a groundhog tick, Ixodes cookei, in Western Ontario. In Alberta, a winter tick, Dermacentor albipictus, which was collected from a moose, Alces alces, tested positive for Bbss. Notably, a B. divergens-like piroplasm was detected in a rabbit tick, Haemaphysalis leporispalustris, collected from an eastern cottontail in southern Manitoba; this Babesia species is a first-time discovery in Canada. This rabbit tick was also co-infected with Borrelia lanei-like spirochetes, which constitutes a first in Canada. Overall, five ticks were concurrently infected with Babesia and Bbsl pathogens and, after the molt, could potentially co-infect humans. Notably, we provide the first authentic report of I. scapularis ticks co-infected with Bbsl and B. odocoilei in Canada. The full extent of infectious microorganisms transmitted to humans by ticks is not fully elucidated, and clinicians need to be aware of the complexity of these tick-transmitted enzootic agents on human health. Diagnosis and treatment must be administered by those with accredited medical training in tick-borne zoonosis."

To date, the consistency of information across Canadian websites devoted to Lyme disease (LD) prevention has not been evaluated. The first aim of this study was to describe the contents and recommendations of LD prevention websites provided by two types of Canadian organizations: government (n = 3) and patient groups (n = 3). A second objective was to analyse the level of convergence among these websites in terms of their prevention-related content. Initial coding of the content resulted in information segments grouped into 114 subthemes related to nine overarching themes: tick habitat suitability, risk period, transmission, personal protection, peridomestic environmental management, tick identification and removal, early symptoms, testing and diagnosis and preventive treatment. Comparative content analyses were performed both within and between the content of websites of the two organization types. The themes most frequently addressed by both organization types were personal protection (20% of the prevention-related content in patient group websites and 22% of the prevention-related content in government websites), transmission (12% and 16%, respectively) and tick identification and removal (19% and 15%, respectively). Government websites' information was generally convergent with that of patient group websites (four highly convergent themes, three moderately convergent and two divergent). Nevertheless, of particular concern were divergent messages and inaccurate information found on 11 subthemes out of 103. Examples included other possible modes of transmission and the ineffectiveness of DEET insect repellent. These results suggest the need for public health and health communications research on the issue of the quality of LD prevention information found on the Internet."

So far, Lyme borreliosis has not been diagnosed in Uruguay and the medical relevance of the genus Ixodes in South America is uncertain. However, the growing number of new genospecies of Bbsl in the southern cone region and the scarce information about its pathogenicity, reservoirs and vectors, highlights the importance of further studies about spirochetes present in Uruguay and the region. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Bbsl in Ixodes auritulus ticks collected from birds and vegetation in two localities of southeastern Uruguay. In total 306 I. auritulus were collected from 392 passerine birds sampled and 1110 ticks were collected by flagging in vegetation. Nymphs and females were analyzed for Borrelia spp. by PCR targeting the flagellin (fla) gene and the rrfA-rrlB intergenic spacer region (IGS). The phylogenetic analysis of Borrelia spp. positive samples from passerine birds and vegetation revealed the presence of four fla haplotypes that form a clade within the Bbsl complex. They were closely related to isolates of Borrelia sp. detected in I. auritulus from Argentina and Canada."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is caused by a tick-borne bacterium Borrelia sp. This zoonotic infection is common in the Northern Hemisphere, e.g., Europe. Clinical presentation may involve multisystem symptoms and depends on the stage of the disease. The involvement of nervous system in Lyme disease is commonly referred to as neuroborreliosis. Neuroborreliosis may involve meningitis, mononeuritis multiplex, or cranial neuritis including the inflammation of vestibulocochlear nerve. In the late or chronic stage of Lyme disease, vestibular involvement may be the sole presentation, although such cases are rare. Our study was designed to present our own case and review the available literature reporting cases of neuroborreliosis with vertigo/dizziness and severe balance instability as a main disease symptom. The studies were obtained by searching the following databases: PubMed, Medline, and Embase. We included case reports of Lyme disease presenting with vertigo or gait disorders as the main symptom, written in the English language. Initially, 60 papers were identified. After analyzing the abstracts, seven manuscripts focusing on 13 clinical cases were included in this review. We conclude that the patients with neuroborreliosis sometimes present vertigo/dizziness, but rarely gait ataxia as a sole symptom. These complaints are usually accompanied by a hearing loss. Antibiotic treatment is usually effective. Balance instability in the patients with neuroborreliosis may persist but it responds well to vestibular rehabilitation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex spirochetes. The spirochete is located in the gut of the tick; as the infected tick starts the blood meal, the spirochete must travel through the hemolymph to the salivary glands, where it can spread to and infect the new host organism. In this study, we determined the crystal structures of the key outer surface protein BBE31 from B. burgdorferi and its orthologous protein BSE31 (BSPA14S_RS05060 gene product) from B. spielmanii. BBE31 is known to be important for the transfer of B. burgdorferi from the gut to the hemolymph in the tick after a tick bite. While BBE31 exerts its function by interacting with the Ixodes scapularis tick gut protein TRE31, structural and mass spectrometry data revealed that BBE31 has a glutathione (GSH) covalently attached to Cys142 suggesting that the protein may have acquired some additional functions in contrast to its orthologous protein BSE31, which lacks any interactions with GSH. In the current study, in addition to analyzing the potential reasons for GSH binding, the three-dimensional structure of BBE31 provides new insights into the molecular details of the transmission process as the protein plays an important role in the initial phase before the spirochete is physically transferred to the new host. This knowledge will be potentially used for the development of new strategies to fight against Lyme disease."

We describe 2 rare cases of tickborne infection in neonates. The first patient presented with multiple erythema migrans and fever, leading to a diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme disease. The second patient presented with irritability, fever, and worsening anemia due to babesiosis. Both infants had been bitten by arthropods fitting the description of ticks before the onset of symptoms. Our cases demonstrate the clinical course of 2 common tickborne infections occurring at an atypical age, opening the door to new, complex questions for which little guiding data exists. As tickborne infections become more prevalent, we expect other clinicians will be faced with similarly challenging neonatal cases. Providers must use past experience and a keen eye to identify neonates with tickborne infections and sort through their optimal diagnosis and management. In this article, we raise some of the questions we faced and discuss our conclusions."

		"abstract": "The cricetine rodents Peromyscus leucopus and P. maniculatus are key reservoirs for several zoonotic diseases in North America. We determined the complete circular mitochondrial genome sequences of representatives of 3 different stock colonies of P. leucopus, one stock colony of P. maniculatus and two wild populations of P. leucopus. The genomes were syntenic with that of the murids Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that these two Peromyscus species are sister taxa in a clade with P. polionotus and also uncovered a distinction between P. leucopus populations in the eastern and the central United States. In one P. leucopus lineage four extended regions of mitochondrial pseudogenes were identified in the nuclear genome. RNA-seq analysis revealed transcription of the entire genome and differences from controls in the expression profiles of mitochondrial genes in the blood, but not in liver or brain, of animals infected with the zoonotic pathogen Borrelia hermsii. PCR and sequencing of the D-loop of the mitochondrion identified 32 different haplotypes among 118 wild P. leucopus at a Connecticut field site. These findings help to further establish P. leucopus as a model organism for studies of emerging infectious diseases, ecology, and in other disciplines."

		"abstract": "Membrane-embedded proteins are critical to the establishment, survival and persistence in the host of the Lyme disease bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), but to date, there are no solved structures of transmembrane proteins representing these attractive therapeutic targets. All available structures from the genus Borrelia represent proteins expressed without a membrane-targeting signal peptide, thus avoiding conserved pathways that modify, fold and assemble membrane protein complexes. Towards elucidating structure and function of these critical proteins, we directed translocation of eleven expression-optimized Bb virulence factors, including the signal sequence, to the Escherichia coli membrane, of which five, BBA57, HtrA, BB0238, BB0323, and DipA, were expressed with C-terminal His-tags. P66 was also expressed using the PelB signal sequence fused to maltose binding protein. Membrane-associated BBA57 lipoprotein was solubilized by non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents. We show BBA57 translocation to the outer membrane, purification at a level sufficient for structural studies, and evidence for an α-helical multimer. Previous studies showed multiple critical roles of BBA57 in transmission, joint arthritis, carditis, weakening immune responses, and regulating other Bb outer surface proteins. In describing the first purification of membrane-translocated BBA57, this work will support subsequent studies that reveal the precise mechanisms of this important Lyme disease virulence factor."

The aim of the study is to assess the epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland in 2017 in comparison to the situation in previous years. The epidemiological situation of Lyme disease in Poland was assessed on data from the annual bulletin “Infectious diseases and poisoning in Poland in 2017”. (MP Czarkowski et al., Warsaw 2018, NIZP-PZH, GIS). In 2017 were registered 21,514 Lyme disease cases i.e. 1.48% more than in the previous year and 2,324 people were hospitalized. Epidemiological situation in Western European countries and Poland are similar. A slightly increase in 2017 and lack of a clear trend in individual voivodeships may indicate, that a very high level of sensitivity of epidemiological surveillance has been achieved."

Often, patients with chronic Lyme disease present with an elaborate clinical picture that can mimic many more common diagnoses such as septic arthritis, transient synovitis, ligamentous sprain, and various other traumatic injuries. With the pathognomonic erythema migrans rash reported to be present less than 50% of the time in late-stage infections, the diagnosis of Lyme disease can often be difficult, with a high rate of underdiagnosis. It is important that Lyme disease be included in the differential diagnosis of spontaneous tendon pathology, especially for physicians practicing in highly endemic areas. The treatment is relatively simple and successful-especially for an acute infection-and it is important to initiate treatment promptly to prevent disability."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease, also known as Lyme borreliosis, is the most common tick-transmitted disease in the Northern Hemisphere. The disease is caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and other related Borrelia species. One of the many fascinating features of this unique pathogen is an elaborate system for antigenic variation, whereby the sequence of the surface-bound lipoprotein VlsE is continually modified through segmental gene conversion events. This perpetual changing of the guard allows the pathogen to remain one step ahead of the acquired immune response, enabling persistent infection. Accordingly, the vls locus is the most evolutionarily diverse genetic element in Lyme disease-causing borreliae. Small stretches of information are transferred from a series of silent cassettes in the vls locus to generate an expressed mosaic vlsE gene version that contains genetic information from several different silent cassettes, resulting in ∼1040 possible vlsE sequences. Yet, despite its extreme evolutionary flexibility, the locus has rigidly conserved structural features. These include a telomeric location of the vlsE gene, an inverse orientation of vlsE and the silent cassettes, the presence of nearly perfect inverted repeats of ∼100 bp near the 5' end of vlsE, and an exceedingly high concentration of G runs in vlsE and the silent cassettes. We discuss the possible roles of these evolutionarily conserved features, highlight recent findings from several studies that have used next-generation DNA sequencing to unravel the switching process, and review advances in the development of a mini-vls system for genetic manipulation of the locus."

		"abstract": "Babesia microti can lead to severe babesiosis in immunosuppressed populations, but due to high numbers of asymptomatic cases, clinical reporting is unable to define its geographic distribution. Although Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi is endemic throughout Pennsylvania (PA), human babesiosis is under recognized, despite sharing the same vector and primary reservoir host. Ixodes ticks are known to carry B. microti throughout PA, but information about pathogen prevalence in small mammal reservoirs remains limited. Characterizing B. microti prevalence in these small mammals can elucidate mechanisms of pathogen spread and define geographic areas where humans are at risk of infection. We tested 692 small mammals across eight contiguous counties in central PA for molecular evidence of B. microti and B. burgdorferi. In total, six different small mammal species were collected. The overall prevalence of B. microti was 32% with similar rates observed across all counties. Surprisingly, this was higher than the prevalence of B. burgdorferi at 21%. In fact, high rates of B. microti were found in all six species, and both pathogens were identified in 11% of mammals tested. The prevalence of B. microti was highest in Myodes gapperi (southern red-backed vole) at 39% despite Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse) being considered the primary reservoir host for B. microti. In conclusion, B. microti has a high prevalence across multiple small mammal species throughout central PA. This prevalence is greater than B. burgdorferi despite a much higher incidence of Lyme disease compared to babesiosis in PA. Although it remains unknown how the prevalence of B. microti in small mammal hosts corresponds to human infection rates, the high pathogen prevalence of B. microti suggests that it is an emerging pathogen in this area. Currently, babesiosis is not a reportable disease in PA, and additional studies are warranted to evaluate its clinical significance in this geographic region."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi is a highly motile spirochete due to its periplasmic flagella. Unlike flagella of other bacteria, spirochetes' periplasmic flagella possess a complex structure called the collar, about which little is known in terms of function and composition. Using various approaches, we have identified a novel protein, BB0326, as a key component of the collar. We show that a peripheral portion of the collar is diminished in the Δbb0326 mutant and restored in the complemented bb0326+ cells, leading us to rename BB0326 as periplasmic flagellar collar protein A or FlcA. The ΔflcA mutant cells produced fewer, abnormally tilted and shorter flagella, as well as diminished stators, suggesting that FlcA is crucial for flagellar and stator assemblies. We provide further evidence that FlcA interacts with the stator and that this collar-stator interaction is essential for the high torque needed to power the spirochete's periplasmic flagellar motors. These observations suggest that the collar provides various important functions to the spirochete's periplasmic flagellar assembly and rotation."

		"abstract": "6S RNA binds to RNA polymerase and regulates gene expression, contributing to bacterial adaptation to environmental stresses. In this study, we examined the role of 6S RNA in murine infectivity and tick persistence of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia (Borreliella) burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi 6S RNA (Bb6S RNA) binds to RNA polymerase, is expressed independent of growth phase or nutrient stress in culture, and is processed by RNase Y. We found that rny (bb0504), the gene encoding RNase Y, is essential for B. burgdorferi growth, while ssrS, the gene encoding 6S RNA, is not essential, indicating a broader role for RNase Y activity in the spirochete. Bb6S RNA regulates expression of the ospC and dbpA genes encoding outer surface protein C and decorin binding protein A, respectively, which are lipoproteins important for host infection. The highest levels of Bb6S RNA are found when the spirochete resides in unfed nymphs. ssrS mutants lacking Bb6S RNA were compromised for infectivity by needle inoculation, but injected mice seroconverted, indicating an ability to activate the adaptive immune response. ssrS mutants were successfully acquired by larval ticks and persisted through fed nymphs. Bb6S RNA is one of the first regulatory RNAs identified in B. burgdorferi that controls the expression of lipoproteins involved in host infectivity."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Lyme borreliosis is the most common zoonotic disease in Europe and causes an estimated total burden of 10.55 disability-adjusted life years (DALY) per 100 000 population. Its incidence in Western Europe is assumed to be increasing, yet this remains to be confirmed. The aim of this study was to assess the emergence of Lyme disease in Western Europe by performing a systematic review of the scientific literature.Methods: Pubmed, Embase and grey literature were searched from database inception until August 2018 for articles reporting the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in Western European countries. We included observational studies in English that reported data on a random sample of the population and fulfilled our definition of Lyme disease diagnosis. Annual population-weighted averages and the evolution of Lyme borreliosis incidence were extracted or calculated for every Western European country.Results: Our review identified 1514 and included 18 studies next to seven surveillance reports reporting data from 16 Western European countries. Incidence of Lyme borreliosis ranged from 0.001 (Italy) to 632 (Sweden, Blekinge county) cases/100 000/year. Iceland reported the strongest emergence with an average yearly increase of 21.15% over a 12-year period, whereas Italy reported the strongest average yearly decrease of 52.71% over a 5-year period. Very limited high-quality data were available on Lyme borreliosis incidence in the southern Western European countries.Conclusion: Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is on the rise in some Western European countries, mostly in the northern and central part. Better surveillance in the southern countries is necessary."

Subsequent to treatment cessation, the patient experienced symptomatic rebound and failed to respond to a second course of the same antibiotic. The patient was eventually diagnosed with both Borrelia and Anaplasma infections by serological testing performed in a private laboratory. Following a two-month course of combination antibiotic therapy, the patient responded clinically, with a return to almost normal functioning. We discuss this case in the context of recent pre-clinical research examining potential Borrelial persistence despite antibiotic therapy."

		"abstract": "Macrophages mediate the elimination of pathogens by phagocytosis resulting in the activation of specific signaling pathways that lead to the production of cytokines, chemokines and other factors. Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, causes a wide variety of pro-inflammatory symptoms. The proinflammatory capacity of macrophages is intimately related to the internalization of the spirochete. However, most receptors mediating this process are largely unknown. We have applied a multiomic approach, including the proteomic analysis of B. burgdorferi-containing phagosome-enriched fractions, to identify surface receptors that are involved in the phagocytic capacity of macrophages as well as their inflammatory output. Sucrose gradient protein fractions of human monocyte-derived macrophages exposed to B. burgdorferi contained the phagocytic receptor, CR3/CD14 highlighting the major role played by these proteins in spirochetal phagocytosis. Other proteins identified in these fractions include C-type lectins, scavenger receptors or Siglecs, of which some are directly involved in the interaction with the spirochete. We also identified the Fc gamma receptor pathway, including the binding receptor, CD64, as involved both in the phagocytosis of, and TNF induction in response to B. burgdorferi in the absence of antibodies. The common gamma chain, FcγR, mediates the phagocytosis of the spirochete, likely through Fc receptors and C-type lectins, in a process that involves Syk activation. Overall, these findings highlight the complex array of receptors involved in the phagocytic response of macrophages to B. burgdorferi."

In each study, one group served as non-treated control, whereas the other groups were treated with the Seresto® collar. All dogs were exposed to naturally Bbsl- and Ap-infected hard ticks (Ixodes ricinus, Ixodes scapularis). In study 1, tick infestation was performed on study day (SD) 63 (2 months post-treatment [p.t.]); in study 2, it was performed on SD 32 (one month p.t.) respectively SD 219 (seven months p.t.). In situ tick counts were performed 2 days after infestation. Tick counts and removals followed 6 (study 1) or 5 days (study 2) later. Blood sampling was performed for the detection of specific Bbsl and Ap antibodies and, in study 1, for the documentation of Ap DNA by PCR. Skin biopsies were examined for Bbsl by PCR and culture (only study 1). The efficacy against Ixodes spp. was 100% at all time points. In study 1, two of six non-treated dogs became infected with Bbsl, and four of six tested positive for Ap; none of the treated dogs tested positive for Bbsl or Ap. In study 2, ten of ten non-treated dogs became infected with Bbsl and Ap; none of the treated dogs tested positive for Bbsl or Ap; 100% acaricidal efficacy was shown in both studies. Transmission of Bbsl and Ap was successfully blocked for up to 7 months."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens pose a considerable disease burden in Europe and North America, where increasing numbers of human cases and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens has renewed interest in resolving the mechanisms underpinning their geographical distribution and abundance. For Borrelia burgdorferi and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, transmission of infection from one generation of ticks to another occurs when older nymphal ticks infect younger larval ticks feeding on the same host, either indirectly via systemic infection of the vertebrate host or directly when feeding in close proximity. Here, expressions for the basic reproduction number, R0, and the related tick type-reproduction number, T, are derived that account for the observation that larval and nymphal ticks tend to aggregate on the same minority of hosts, a tick feeding behaviour known as co-aggregation. The pattern of tick blood meals is represented as a directed, acyclic, bipartite contact network, with individual vertebrate hosts having in-degree, kin, and out-degree, kout, that respectively represent cumulative counts of nymphal and larval ticks fed over the lifetime of the host. The in- and out-degree are not independent when co-aggregation occurs such that [Formula: see text] where 〈.〉 indicates expected value. When systemic infection in the vertebrate host is the dominant transmission route R02=T, whereas when direct transmission between ticks co-feeding on the same host is dominant then R0=T and the effect of co-aggregation on R0 is more pronounced. Simulations of B. burgdorferi and TBE virus transmission on theoretical tick-mouse contact networks revealed that aggregation and co-aggregation have a synergistic effect on R0 and T, that co-aggregation always increases R0 and T, and that aggregation only increases R0 and T when larvae and nymphs also co-aggregate. Co-aggregation has the greatest absolute effect on R0 and T when the mean larval burden of hosts is high, and the largest relative effect on R0 for pathogens sustained by co-feeding transmission, e.g. TBE virus in Europe, compared with those predominantly spread by systemic infection, e.g. B. burgdorferi. For both pathogens, though, co-aggregation increases the mean number of ticks infected per infectious tick, T, and so too the likelihood of pathogen persistence."

		"abstract": "We sought to characterize the shifting epidemiology and resource utilization of Lyme disease and associated carditis in US children's hospitals. We hypothesized that the Lyme carditis burden has increased and that hospitalizations for Lyme carditis are costlier than those for Lyme disease without carditis. The PHIS database was queried for Lyme disease encounters between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2013. Additional diagnostic codes consistent with carditis identified Lyme carditis cases. Demographic, clinical, and resource utilization data were analyzed. All costs were adjusted to 2014 US dollars. Lyme disease was identified in 3620 encounters with 189 (5%) associated with carditis. Lyme disease (360 cases in 2007 vs. 672 in 2013, p = 0.01) and Lyme carditis (17 cases in 2007 vs. 40 in 2013, p = 0.03) both significantly increased in frequency. This is primarily accounted for by their increase within the Midwest region. Carditis frequency among cases of Lyme disease was stable (p = 0.15). Encounters for Lyme carditis are dramatically costlier than those for Lyme disease without carditis [median $9104 (3741-19,003) vs. 922 (238-4987), p < 0.001] The increase in Lyme carditis cases in US children's hospitals is associated with an increased Lyme disease incidence, suggesting that there has not been a change in its virulence or cardiac tropism. The increasing number of serious cardiac events and costs associated with Lyme disease emphasize the need for prevention and early detection of disease and control of its spread."

		"abstract": "The tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia miyamotoi, is an emerging pathogen of public health significance. Current B. miyamotoi serodiagnostic testing depends on reactivity against GlpQ which is not highly sensitive on acute phase serum samples. Additionally, anti-B. miyamotoi antibodies can cross-react with C6 antigen testing for B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, underscoring the need for improved serological assays that produce accurate diagnostic results. We performed an immunoproteomics analysis of B. miyamotoi proteins to identify novel serodiagnostic antigens. Sera from mice infected with B. miyamotoi by subcutaneous inoculation or tick bite were collected for immunoblotting against B. miyamotoi membrane-associated proteins separated by 2-dimensional electrophoresis (2DE). In total, 88 proteins in 40 2DE immunoreactive spots were identified via mass spectrometry. Multiple variable large proteins (Vlps) and a putative lipoprotein were among those identified and analyzed. Reactivity of anti-B. miyamotoi sera against recombinant Vlps and the putative lipoprotein confirmed their immunogenicity. Mouse anti-B. burgdorferi serum was cross-reactive to all recombinant Vlps, but not against the putative lipoprotein by IgG. Furthermore, antibodies against the recombinant putative lipoprotein were present in serum from a B. miyamotoi-infected human patient, but not a Lyme disease patient. Results presented here provide a comprehensive profile of B. miyamotoi antigens that induce the host immune response and identify a putative lipoprotein as a potentially specific antigen for B. miyamotoi serodetection."

		"abstract": "Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a Borrelia lipoprotein and an established Lyme disease vaccine target. Admixing non-lipidated, recombinant B. burgdorferi OspA with liposomes containing cobalt porphyrin-phospholipid (CoPoP) resulted in rapid, particulate surface display of the conformationally intact antigen. Particleization was serum-stable and led to enhanced antigen uptake in murine macrophages in vitro. Mouse immunization using CoPoP liposomes that also contained a synthetic monophosphoryl lipid A (PHAD) elicited a Th1-biased OspA antibody response with higher IgG production compared to other vaccine adjuvants. Antibodies were reactive with intact B. burgdorferi spirochetes and Borrelia lysates, and induced complement-mediated borreliacidal activity in vitro. One year after initial immunization, mice maintained high levels of circulating borreliacidal antibodies capable of blocking B. burgdorferi transmission from infected ticks to human blood in a feeding chamber."

		"abstract": "Hand osteoarthritis is a prevalent joint condition that has a high burden of disease and an unmet medical need for effective therapeutic options. Since local inflammation is recognised as contributing to osteoarthritic complaints, the Hand Osteoarthritis Prednisolone Efficacy (HOPE) study aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of short-term prednisolone in patients with painful hand osteoarthritis and synovial inflammation. The HOPE study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. We recruited eligible adults from rheumatology outpatient clinics at two sites in the Netherlands. Patients were considered eligible if they had symptomatic hand osteoarthritis and signs of inflammation in their distal and proximal interphalangeal (DIP/PIP) joints. For inclusion, patients were required to have four or more DIP/PIP joints with osteoarthritic nodes; at least one DIP/PIP joint with soft swelling or erythema; at least one DIP/PIP joint with a positive power Doppler signal or synovial thickening of at least grade 2 on ultrasound; and finger pain of at least 30 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) that flared up during a 48-h non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) washout (defined as worsening of finger pain by at least 20 mm on the VAS). Eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 10 mg prednisolone or placebo orally once daily for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week tapering scheme, and a 6-week follow-up without study medication. The patients and study team were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was finger pain, assessed on a VAS, at 6 weeks in participants who had been randomly assigned to groups and attended the baseline visit. This study is registered with the Netherlands Trial Registry, number NTR5263. We screened patients for enrolment between Dec 3, 2015, and May 31, 2018. Patients completed baseline visits and started treatment between Dec 14, 2015, and July 2, 2018, and the last study visit of the last patient was Oct 4, 2018. Of 149 patients assessed for eligibility, 57 (38%) patients were excluded (predominantly because they did not meet one or several inclusion criteria, most often because of an absence of synovial inflammation or of flare-ups after NSAID washout) and 92 (62%) patients were eligible for inclusion. We randomly assigned 46 (50%) patients to receive prednisolone and 46 (50%) patients to receive placebo, all of whom were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis of the primary endpoint. 42 (91%) patients in the prednisolone group and 42 (91%) in the placebo group completed the 14-week study. The mean change between baseline and week 6 on VAS-reported finger pain was -21·5 (SD 21·7) in the prednisolone group and -5·2 (24·3) in the placebo group, with a mean between-group difference (of prednisolone vs placebo) of -16·5 (95% CI -26·1 to -6·9; p=0·0007). The number of non-serious adverse events was similar between the groups. Five serious adverse events were reported during our study: one serious adverse event in the prednisolone group (a myocardial infarction) and four serious adverse events in the placebo group (an infected traumatic leg haematoma that required surgery, bowel surgery, atrial fibrillation that required a pacemaker implantation, and symptomatic uterine myomas that required a hysterectomy). Four (4%) patients discontinued the study because of an adverse event: one (2%) patient receiving prednisolone (for a myocardial infarction) and three (7%) patients receiving placebo (for surgery of the bowel and for an infected leg haematoma and for Lyme disease arthritis of the knee). Treatment with 10 mg prednisolone for 6 weeks is efficacious and safe for the treatment of patients with painful hand osteoarthritis and signs of inflammation. The results of our study provide clinicians with a new short-term treatment option for patients with hand osteoarthritis who report a flare-up of their disease. Dutch Arthritis Society."

		"abstract": "Both Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and spotted fever group Rickettsiae (SFGR) are pathogens carried by ticks. There is a possibility of co-infection with these tick-borne diseases. Male patient, 63 years-of-age, admitted to hospital with skin rash presenting for 1 week and fever with cough and expectoration for 3 days before admission. We diagnosed that the patient was co-infected by B burgdorferi sl and SFGR using laboratory test results and the patient's clinical manifestations. The patient started therapy with oral minocycline, then levofloxacin by intravenous injection for SFGR. Meanwhile, he was treated with penicillin G sodium, cefoperazone sulbactam sodium and ceftriaxone by intravenous injection for B burgdorferi sl. After the patient was in stable condition, he was discharged from hospital. This case report highlights the possibility of co-infection by 2 tick-borne diseases in Urumqi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. The antibiotic therapy should be based on the detection of pathogenic bacteria, and the different susceptibilities of co-infecting bacteria should be considered."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the northern hemisphere. Neurological complications usually manifest in patients who do not receive treatment for Lyme disease. Neurological involvement may be early or late, depending on the duration of the symptoms. Early neuroborreliosis presents with symptoms such as headache and meningism; late neuroborreliosis can present with signs and symptoms of encephalopathy and stroke-like symptoms. The diagnosis is based on clinical manifestations and lumbar puncture finding. Treatment consists of intravenous antibiotics for a period of three to four weeks. Patients who receive early treatment usually have an excellent prognosis, with very few patients developing post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Here, we report an unusual case of Lyme disease with extremely high cerebrospinal fluid protein level and devastating neurological sequelae. The diagnosis of neuroborreliosis is based on neurological symptoms and lumbar puncture findings."

		"abstract": "In eastern North America, including Canada, Lyme disease is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and transmitted to humans by the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis. The last decade has seen a growing incidence of Lyme disease in Canada, following the northward range expansion of I. scapularis tick populations from endemic areas in eastern United States. This may be attributable to movement of the many hosts that they parasitize, including songbirds, deer and small mammals. In this study, we wanted to test the effect of spatial, temporal and ecological variables, on blacklegged tick density and infection rates, near the northern limit of their distribution in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. We found an effect of both proportion of forested areas and distance to roads, on density of I. scapularis ticks and prevalence of infection by B. burgdorferi. We also found an effect of both sampling year and ordinal sampling data on prevalence of infection by B. burgdorferi. In six adjacent sites showing evidence of reproducing I. scapularis populations, we found that forest composition and structure influenced density of I. scapularis ticks. Our results suggest that blacklegged tick density and infection rate in Canada may be influenced by a variety of factors."

Using conserved and pathogen-specific primers we performed a cross-kingdom analysis of bacterial, fungal, protistan and archaeal communities of I. scapularis nymphs (N = 105) collected from southern Vermont, USA. The bacterial community was dominated by a Rickettsia and several environmental taxa commonly reported in I. scapularis, as well as the human pathogens B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, agent of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. With the fungal primer set we detected primarily plant- and litter-associated taxa and >18% of sequences were Malassezia, a fungal genus associated with mammalian skin. Two 18S rRNA gene primer sets, intended to target protistan communities, returned mostly Ixodes DNA as well as the wildlife pathogen Babesia odocoilei (7% of samples), a Gregarines species (14%) and a Spirurida nematode (18%). Data from pathogen-specific and conserved primers were consistent in terms of prevalence and identification. We measured B. burgdorferi presence/absence and load and found that bacterial beta diversity varied based on B. burgdorferi presence/absence. Load was weakly associated with bacterial community composition. We identified taxa associated with B. burgdorferi infection that should be evaluated for their role in vector colonization by pathogens."

From March 2016 to March 2017, 180 in-patients with CSF pleocytosis were categorized into following groups: pyogenic CNS infections, aseptic meningoencephalitis, neuroimmunological diseases, and reactive pleocytosis. We provide evidence that CXCL13 elevation occurs at variable extent in the majority of neuroinflammatory diseases. The exact role of CXCL13 in CSF is elusive, but the broad occurrence in neuroinflammation points at CNS immune activation, which is not exclusive for LNB."

Patient tested positive for B. burgdorferi and Babesia microti, and was started on doxycycline, atovaquone and azithromycin. He also underwent exchange transfusion twice. After some initial improvement, patient had acute deterioration of mental status and appearance of neurological findings like myoclonus and tremors. Therefore, testing for arboviruses was done and results were positive for Powassan virus. During a protracted course of hospitalisation, patient required intubation for respiratory failure and temporary pacemaker for unstable arrythmias from Lyme carditis. Patient developed permanent neurological deficits even after recovery from the acute illness."

		"abstract": "Some patients have residual non-specific symptoms after therapy for Lyme disease, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms or syndrome, depending on whether there is functional impairment. A standardized test battery was used to characterize a diverse group of Lyme disease patients with and without residual symptoms. There was a strong correlation between sleep disturbance and certain other symptoms such as fatigue, pain, anxiety, and cognitive complaints. Results were subjected to a Logistic Regression model using the Neuro-QoL Fatigue t-score together with Short Form-36 Physical Functioning scale and Mental Health component scores; and to a Decision Tree model using only the QoL Fatigue t-score. The Logistic Regression model had an accuracy of 97% and Decision Tree model had an accuracy of 93%, when compared with clinical categorization. The Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were then applied to a separate cohort. Both models performed with high sensitivity (90%), but moderate specificity (62%). The overall accuracy was 74%. Agreement between 2 time points, separated by a mean of 4 months, was 89% using the Decision Tree model and 87% with the Logistic Regression model. These models are simple and can help to quantitate the level of symptom severity in post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms. More research is needed to increase the specificity of the models, exploring additional approaches that could potentially strengthen an operational definition for post-treatment Lyme disease symptoms. Evaluation of how sleep disturbance, fatigue, pain and cognitive complains interrelate can potentially lead to new interventions that will improve the overall health of these patients."

		"abstract": "As tick-borne diseases continue to emerge across the United States, there is need for a better understanding of the tick and pathogen communities in the southern states and of habitat features that influence transmission risk. We surveyed questing and on-host ticks in pine-dominated forests with various fire management regimes in the Sam Houston National Forest, a popular recreation area near Houston, Texas. Four linear transects were established- two with a history of controlled burns, and two unburned. Systematic drag sampling yielded 112 ticks from two species, Ixodes scapularis (n=73) and Amblyomma americanum (n=39), with an additional 106 questing ticks collected opportunistically from drag cloth operators. There was a significant difference in systematically-collected questing tick density between unburned (15 and 18 ticks/1000 m2) and burned (2 and 4 ticks/1000 m2) transects. We captured 106 rodents and found 74 ticks on the rodents, predominantly Dermacentor variabilis. One unburned transect had significantly more ticks per mammal than any of the other three transects. DNA of Rickettsia species was detected in 146/292 on and off-host ticks, including the 'Rickettsial endosymbiont of I. scapularis' and Rickettsia amblyommatis, which are of uncertain pathogenicity to humans. Borrelia lonestari was detected in one A. americanum, while Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, the agent of Lyme disease, was not detected in any tick samples. Neither Borrelia nor Rickettsia spp. were detected in any of the mammal ear biopsies (n=64) or blood samples (n=100) tested via PCR. This study documents a high prevalence in ticks of Rickettsia spp. thought to be endosymbionts, a low prevalence of relapsing fever group Borrelia in ticks, and a lack of detection of Lyme disease-group Borrelia in both ticks and mammals in an east Texas forested recreation area. Additionally, we observed low questing tick density in areas with a history of controlled burns. These results expand knowledge of tick-borne disease ecology in east Texas which can aid in directing future investigative, modeling, and management efforts."

		"abstract": "Lyme carditis is a rare cardiac manifestation of Lyme disease that occurs when bacterial spirochetes infect the pericardium or myocardium triggering an inflammatory response. The most common electrocardiogram (EKG) findings in these patients include atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities (first, second, and third degree heart block). A 56-year-old male with a history of hypothyroidism, from the Northeastern region of the United States, presented to the emergency department with lightheadedness and chest pain. His EKG revealed sinus bradycardia with a heart rate of 49 beats per minute, without ST segment elevation, T wave inversions, or signs of heart block. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Lyme titer was elevated, and confirmatory Western blot was positive for IgG and negative for IgM. He was treated with intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone; however, he continued to have persistent bradycardia with his heart rate dropping to 20 to 30 beats per minute throughout the night. Additionally, he had several sinus pauses while sleeping, with the longest lasting for 6.1 seconds. A pacemaker and an additional three-week course of IV ceftriaxone was determined to be the best treatment for his resistant bradycardia secondary to Lyme carditis. No symptoms were present at his one month follow-up appointment, as an outpatient, after completing ceftriaxone therapy. The patient follows up with cardiology regularly to have his pacemaker checked. Here we present a unique case of Lyme carditis, without the classical findings of Lyme disease or common EKG findings of AV conduction abnormalities. A high clinical suspicion of Lyme carditis is required when someone from a Lyme endemic region presents with unexplained cardiac symptoms and electrocardiogram abnormalities. This case report aims to add to the knowledge gap between suspicion of Lyme carditis and sinus bradycardia as the only presenting symptom."

Among 4157 adults diagnosed with erythema migrans in the period 2009-2018, 16 (2.6%) patients were receiving TNF-α inhibitors (adalimumab, infliximab, etarnecept, golimumab), often in combination with other immunosuppressants, for rheumatic (13 patients) or inflammatory bowel (three patients) disease. Findings in this group were compared with those in 32 sex- and age-matched immunocompetent patients diagnosed with erythema migrans in the same years. In comparison with the control group, the immunocompromised patients had a shorter incubation period (7 vs. 14 days; p = 0.0153), smaller diameter of erythema migrans (10.5 vs. 15.5 cm; p = 0.0014), and more frequent comorbidities other than immune-mediated diseases (62.5% vs. 25%, p = 0.0269), symptoms/signs of disseminated Lyme borreliosis (18.8% vs. 0%, p = 0.0324), and treatment failure (25% vs. 0%, p = 0.0094). After retreatment with an antibiotic, the clinical course of Lyme borreliosis resolved. Continuing TNF inhibitor treatment during concomitant borrelial infection while using identical approaches for antibiotic treatment as in immunocompetent patients resulted in more frequent failure of erythema migrans treatment in patients receiving TNF inhibitors. However, the majority of treatment failures were mild, and the course and outcome of Lyme borreliosis after retreatment with antibiotics was favourable."

		"abstract": "Ixodes scapularis is the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes in eastern and central North America, and local densities of this tick can affect human disease risk. We sampled larvae and nymphs from sites in Massachusetts and Wisconsin, USA, using flag/drag devices and by collecting ticks from hosts, and measured environmental variables to evaluate the environmental factors that affect local distribution and abundance of I. scapularis. Our sites were all forested areas with known I. scapularis populations. Environmental variables included those associated with weather (e.g., temperature and relative humidity), vegetation characteristics (at canopy, shrub, and ground levels), and host abundance (small and medium-sized mammals and reptiles). The numbers of larvae on animals at a given site and season showed a logarithmic relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples, suggesting limitation in the numbers on host animals. The numbers of nymphs on animals showed no relationship to the numbers in flag/drag samples. These results suggest that only a small proportion of larvae and nymphs found hosts because in neither stage did the numbers of host-seeking ticks decline with increased numbers on hosts. Canopy cover was predictive of larval and nymphal numbers in flag/drag samples, but not of numbers on hosts. Numbers of small and medium-sized mammal hosts the previous year were generally not predictive of the current year's tick numbers, except that mouse abundance predicted log numbers of nymphs on all hosts the following year. Some measures of larval abundance were predictive of nymphal numbers the following year. The mean number of larvae per mouse was well predicted by measures of overall larval abundance (based on flag/drag samples and samples from all hosts), and some environmental factors contributed significantly to the model. In contrast, the mean numbers of nymphs per mouse were not well predicted by environmental variables, only by overall nymphal abundance on hosts. Therefore, larvae respond differently than nymphs to environmental factors. Furthermore, flag/drag samples provide different information about nymphal numbers than do samples from hosts. Flag/drag samples can provide information about human risk of acquiring nymph-borne pathogens because they provide information on the densities of ticks that might encounter humans, but to understand the epizootiology of tick-borne agents both flag/drag and host infestation data are needed."

Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on eight chromosomally located housekeeping loci (clpA, clpX, nifS, pepX, pyrG, recG, rplB and uvrA) we analyzed 43 B. turcica isolates from Serres, Greece (n = 15) collected in 2017 and Izmir, Turkey (n = 28) collected in 2018. To understand their relationship a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree and goeBURST analysis were done based on MLST sequence data and allelic profiles, respectively. The data we generated confirmed that the samples of B. turcica investigated here were divergent from Lyme disease (LD) and relapsing fever (RF) species. Within the B. turcica clade, samples of different geographic origin (Greece, Turkey) clustered together in terminal branches; no obvious differences between the Greek and Turkish samples were noticeable. A goeBURST analysis using triple-locus variants revealed very few clonal complexes with the majority of samples appearing as singletons. Minor clonal complexes (consisting of two sequence types) comprised only Greek isolates, only Turkish isolates or both, so no pattern of clustering of isolates from the two geographical regions was observed. Interestingly, very little population structure was discerned in our study. This was surprising in view of the large geographic distance between collection sites of B. turcica and raises questions about the evolution or spatial spread of this species."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, the most common tick-borne illness in the United States. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the occurrence of Lyme disease in the U.S. has now reached approximately 300,000 cases annually. Early stage Borrelia burgdorferi infections are generally treatable with oral antibiotics, but late stage disease is more difficult to treat and more likely to lead to post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. Here we examine three unique 5'-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine (MTA/SAH) nucleosidases (MTNs or MTANs, EC 3.2.2.9) responsible for salvage of adenine and methionine in B. burgdorferi and explore their potential as antibiotic targets to treat Lyme disease. Recombinant Borrelia MTNs were expressed and purified from E. coli. The enzymes were extensively characterized for activity, specificity, and inhibition using a UV spectrophotometric assay. In vitro antibiotic activities of MTN inhibitors were assessed using a bioluminescent BacTiter-Glo™ assay. The three Borrelia MTNs showed unique activities against the native substrates MTA, SAH, and 5'-deoxyadenosine. Analysis of substrate analogs revealed that specific activity rapidly dropped as the length of the 5'-alkylthio substitution increased. Non-hydrolysable nucleoside transition state analogs demonstrated sub-nanomolar enzyme inhibition constants. Lastly, two late stage transition state analogs exerted in vitro IC50 values of 0.3-0.4 μg/mL against cultured B. burgdorferi cells. B. burgdorferi is unusual in that it expresses three distinct MTNs (cytoplasmic, membrane bound, and secreted) that are effectively inactivated by nucleoside analogs. The Borrelia MTNs appear to be promising targets for developing new antibiotics to treat Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "The incidence of Lyme borreliosis remains a matter of debate, but it can be estimated using the incidence of erythema migrans (EM), which is pathognomonic of the first phase. The aim of this prospective pilot study was to assess the feasibility of the on-line declaration of EM in rural areas where the incidence of Lyme borreliosis was previously estimated at 85 per 100,000 inhabitants per year. The study was limited to a rural area (Les Combrailles, Auvergne) of approximately 52,800 inhabitants and was preceded by an information campaign for the inhabitants and the healthcare professionals. Patients who sent a photo of the suspected EM by email or MMS message between April 2017 and April 2018 and who accepted to answer a questionnaire were included in the study. Two physicians then evaluated the quality of the photographs and the probability of EM. In parallel, the number of EM seen by physicians and pharmacists in the area over the given period was recorded. Out of the 113 emails and MMS messages received, 73 people were outside of the trial area or period and 9 did not complete the questionnaire. The photos of the remaining 31 people were analysed. The median age was 51.5 years old ([38-58] IQR) and 18 (58%) were women. Seven people (25%) stated that they did not have a smartphone and in 9 cases (29%) the photo was sent by a third party. The quality of the photos was considered very good in 22 (71%) cases, good in 7 (23%) cases, and average in 2 (6%) cases. The probability of EM was determined to be strong or possible in 12 (38%) cases, i.e. an estimated incidence of 22.7 per 100,000 inhabitants. Over the study period, 40 physicians and 20 pharmacists were contacted on a monthly basis. A median of 5 physicians [3;7] and 4 pharmacists [3 ;7] answered each month for a total of 18 and 36 declared EM respectively. The EM (strong probability/possible) collected by on-line declaration and those declared by healthcare professionals were all sent between April and October 2017. The total time spent on the information campaign and collection has been estimated at 265 h (divided between 10 people) for an overall cost of 10,669 Euros. The incidence of EM recorded by on-line self-declaration in our study seems to be lower than in previous studies, the under-reporting was probably linked to the low use of new technologies in the rural areas. Increasing the human resources and finances appears difficult to achieve in practice over a longer time period but the development of an application for the automatic recognition of EM could be one method for a more exhaustive collection in the long term and at lower cost."

		"abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) technology takes advantage of smartphone features to turn them into research tools, with the potential to reach a larger section of the population in a cost-effective manner, compared with traditional epidemiological methods. Although mHealth apps have been widely implemented in chronic diseases and psychology, their potential use in the research of vector-borne diseases has not yet been fully exploited. This study aimed to assess the usability and feasibility of The Tick App, the first tick research-focused app in the United States. The Tick App was designed as a survey tool to collect data on human behaviors and movements associated with tick exposure while engaging users in tick identification and reporting. It consists of an enrollment survey to identify general risk factors, daily surveys to collect data on human activities and tick encounters (Tick Diaries), a survey to enter the details of tick encounters coupled with tick identification services provided by the research team (Report a Tick), and educational material. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, we evaluated the enrollment strategy (passive vs active), the user profile, location, longitudinal use of its features, and users' feedback. Between May and September 2018, 1468 adult users enrolled in the app. The Tick App users were equally represented across genders and evenly distributed across age groups. Most users owned a pet (65.94%, 962/1459; P<.001), did frequent outdoor activities (recreational or peridomestic; 75.24%, 1094/1454; P<.001 and 64.58%, 941/1457; P<.001, respectively), and lived in the Midwest (56.55%, 824/1457) and Northeast (33.0%, 481/1457) regions in the United States, more specifically in Wisconsin, southern New York, and New Jersey. Users lived more frequently in high-incidence counties for Lyme disease (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.8-7.2; P<.001) and in counties with cases recently increasing (IRR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.2; P=.03). Recurring users (49.25%, 723/1468) had a similar demographic profile to all users but participated in outdoor activities more frequently (80.5%, 575/714; P<.01). The number of Tick Diaries submitted per user (median 2, interquartile range [IQR] 1-11) was higher for older age groups (aged >55 years; IRR 3.4, 95% CI 1.5-7.6; P<.001) and lower in the Northeast (IRR[NE] 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7; P<.001), whereas the number of tick reports (median 1, IQR 1-2) increased with the frequency of outdoor activities (IRR 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.8; P<.001). This assessment allowed us to identify what fraction of the population used The Tick App and how it was used during a pilot phase. This information will be used to improve future iterations of The Tick App and tailor potential tick prevention interventions to the users' characteristics."

Several advances that have been made on Notifiable Diseases Online, the CNDSS interactive website, are consistent with the Government of Canada's commitment to Open Data. This article provides an update on changes in case definitions that have been made since the case definitions were last published in 2009, and describes updates that have been made to the interactive website since 2013. Changes were made to the case definitions of five diseases. For hepatitis C, the new case definition now distinguishes between acute and chronic infection. For cyclosporiasis, the probable case definition requires an epidemiologic link, with the clarification that this would likely be due to exposure to a common food source. For rabies, the probable case definition now refers to detection of rabies-neutralizing antibody instead of specific antibody titres. For Lyme disease, the revised confirmed and probable case definitions now identify five options for Lyme disease risk areas instead of endemic areas. For tuberculosis the revised case definition now includes nucleic acid amplification testing in addition to culture for diagnosis. The Notifiable Diseases Online website is an interactive tool that enables users to create customized figures and tables. Since a major redesign in 2013, numerous changes have been made to the look and feel of the site. Figures and tables can now be extracted as Excel or PDF files and large datasets are exportable into Excel files for further analysis. Case definitions in the national surveillance system will be updated as needed and its interactive website will continue to be improved and updated in response to user comments."

		"abstract": "The invasive, human-biting Asian longhorned tick, Haemaphysalis longicornis, was detected in New Jersey in the eastern United States in August of 2017 and by November of 2018 this tick had been recorded from 45 counties across 9 states, primarily along the Eastern Seaboard. The establishment of H. longicornis in the United States has raised the questions of how commonly it will bite humans and which native pathogens may naturally infect this tick. There also is a need for experimental vector competence studies with native pathogens to determine if H. longicornis can acquire a given pathogen while feeding, pass it transstadially, and then transmit the pathogen in the next life stage. In this experimental study, we evaluated the vector competence of a population of H. longicornis originating from the United States (New York) for a native isolate (B31) of the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.). In agreement with a previous experimental study on the vector competence of H. longicornis for Borrelia garinii, we found that uninfected H. longicornis larvae could acquire B. burgdorferi s.s. while feeding on infected Mus musculus mice (infection prevalence >50% in freshly fed larvae) but that the infection was lost during the molt to the nymphal stage. None of 520 tested molted nymphs were found to be infected, indicating that transstadial passage of B. burgdorferi s.s. is absent or rare in H. longicornis; and based on the potential error associated with the number of nymphs testing negative in this study, we estimate that the upper 95% limit for infection prevalence was 0.73%. An Ixodes scapularis process control showed both effective acquisition of B. burgdorferi s.s. from infected mice by uninfected larvae and transstadial passage to the nymphal stage (infection prevalence of 80-82% for both freshly fed larvae and molted nymphs). We also observed that although H. longicornis larvae could be compelled to feed on mice by placing the ticks within feeding capsules, attachment and feeding success was minimal (<0.5%) when larvae were placed freely on the fur of the mice. We conclude that H. longicornis is unlikely to contribute more than minimally, if at all, to transmission of Lyme disease spirochetes in the United States."

TBRF shares symptoms with Lyme disease (LD) caused by related Lyme disease Borreliae (LDB). TBRF and LD are transmitted by ticks and occur in overlapping localities worldwide. Serological detection of antibodies used for laboratory confirmation of LD is not established for TBRF. A line immunoblot assay using recombinant proteins from different RFB species, termed TBRF IB, was developed and its diagnostic utility investigated. The TBRF IBs were able to differentiate between antibodies to RFB and LDB and had estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 70.5%, 99.5%, 97.3%, and 93.4%, respectively, based on results with reference sera from patients known to be positive and negative for TBRF. The use of TBRF IBs and analogous immunoblots for LD to test sera of patients from Australia, Ukraine, and the USA with LD symptoms revealed infection with TBRF alone, LD alone, and both TBRF and LD. Diagnosis by clinical criteria alone can, therefore, underestimate the incidence of TBRF. TBRF IBs will be useful for laboratory confirmation of TBRF and understanding its epidemiology worldwide."

		"abstract": "Zoonotic diseases represent a significant public health concern worldwide due to the emergence/re-emergence of vector-borne diseases in the last decade. Ticks are the most important vectors in the northern hemisphere and can transmit diseases such as Lyme disease, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, and spotted fever rickettsioses, among others. Therefore, there is a growing need to develop better and faster diagnostic tools that can detect zoonotic human pathogens in clinical samples. In this study, we present the results for a new kit tick-borne bacteria flow chip (TBFC), which allows the simultaneous screening of seven different bacterial pathogens in human samples using a DNA flow technology platform (hybriSpot system). The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were calculated spiking bacterial DNA in human DNA samples, and the results were compared with an in-house single PCR-reverse line blot (RLB) routinely used for diagnosis at the National Center for Microbiology in Spain. The analytical sensitivity and specificity of the TBFC were almost identical to the PCR-RLBs used in diagnosis. In addition, samples from patients (n = 212) with a wide range of clinical signs/symptoms consistent with multisystem disorders suggestive of a tick-borne infection were tested using the TBFC, and the results were compared with those obtained by PCR-RLB. The concordance of both methods using patient samples was 97.2%. The TBFC kit is a rapid new and cost-efficient diagnostic molecular tool capable of detecting tick-borne pathogens in clinical samples."

		"abstract": "Warmer temperatures are expected to increase the incidence of Lyme disease through enhanced tick maturation rates and a longer season of transmission. In addition, there could be an increased risk of disease export because of infected mobile hosts, usually birds. A temperature-driven seasonal model of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) transmission among four host types is constructed as a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations. The model is developed and parametrized based on a collection of lab and field studies. The model is shown to produce biologically reasonable results for both the tick vector (Ixodes scapularis) and the hosts when compared to a different set of studies. The model is used to predict the response of Lyme disease risk to a mean annual temperature increase, based on current temperature cycles in Hanover, NH. Many of the risk measures suggested by the literature are shown to change with increased mean annual temperature. The most straightforward measure of disease risk is the abundance of infected questing ticks, averaged over a year. Compared to this measure, which is difficult and resource-intensive to track in the field, all other risk measures considered underestimate the rise of risk with rise in mean annual temperature. The measure coming closest was \"degree days above zero.\" Disease prevalence in ticks and hosts showed less increase with rising temperature. Single field measurements at the height of transmission season did not show much change at all with rising temperature."

Horses in Group A (49 animals) received two vaccinations on days 0 and 14 and a booster on day 365, whereas 50 horses in Group B received an additional booster vaccination on day 180. Group C (44 animals) was not immunized. Total antibody levels and specific OspA antibody responses were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively in two-month intervals over 13-month period. Vaccinees in Groups A and B developed high OspA antibodies levels, whereas horses in Group C did not show specific antibody responses. The additional vaccination applied in Group B enhanced the specific OspA antibody response significantly and prevented its rapid decline."

However, the locations where people most frequently encounter infected ticks are not well characterized, leading to mixed messages from public health officials about where risk is highest. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on spatial risk factors for tick-borne disease and tick bites in eastern North America. We examined three scales: the residential yard, the neighborhood surrounding (but not including) the yard, and outside the neighborhood. Nineteen eligible studies represented 2741 cases of tick-borne illness and 1447 tick bites. Using random effects models, we derived pooled odds ratio (OR) estimates. The meta-analysis revealed significant disease risk factors at the scale of the yard (OR 2.60 95% CI 1.96 - 3.46), the neighborhood (OR 4.08 95% CI 2.49 - 6.68), and outside the neighborhood (OR 2.03 95% CI 1.59 - 2.59). Although significant risk exists at each scale, neighborhood scale risk factors best explained disease exposure. Analysis of variance revealed risk at the neighborhood scale was 57% greater than risk at the yard scale and 101% greater than risk outside the neighborhood. This analysis emphasizes the importance of understanding and reducing tick-borne disease risk at the neighborhood scale. Risk-reducing interventions applied at each scale could be effective, but interventions applied at the neighborhood scale are most likely to protect human health. The study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42017079169 ."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne infection common in Europe. In Finland, the LB seroprevalence in the healthy population was 3.9% in 2011. While the present-day seroprevalence of LB is well characterized in several European areas, there are no studies on the seroprevalence of LB before the description of the infection in the late 1970s. We used a subset of historical serum samples (n = 994) collected during the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Survey, a nationwide cross-sectional health survey of the 1960s and 1970s. All samples were screened with Borrelia burgdorferi whole-cell sonicate IgG ELISA. The seropositivity of the samples was further confirmed by the C6 peptide ELISA and recomBead IgG 2.0 bead immunoassay. The association of LB seropositivity with risk factors and with self-reported diseases and symptoms relating to disseminated LB were analysed by logistic regression. B. burgdorferi IgGs were detected in 199 of 994 analysed samples; hence, the overall seroprevalence was 20.0% (95% confidence interval: 17.6-22.6). The highest seroprevalence was observed in persons aged ≥50 years (165/696), in those currently not working (92/383), and in the regions of South and Central Finland (91/226 and 27/88, respectively). Further, perception of feeling unhealthy (129/197 versus 412/794) was higher among LB-seropositive individuals compared to LB-seronegative participants. LB seroprevalence was considerably higher in Finland in the late 1960s and early 1970s than in 2011. This result questions the perception of an unprecedentedly high LB seroprevalence in present-day Europe."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease results from infection of humans with the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. The first and most common clinical manifestation is the circular, inflamed skin lesion referred to as erythema migrans; later manifestations result from infections of other body sites. Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease can be challenging in patients with erythema migrans because of the time delay in the development of specific diagnostic antibodies against Borrelia. Reliable blood biomarkers for the early diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with erythema migrans are needed. Here, we performed selected reaction monitoring, a targeted mass spectrometry-based approach, to measure selected proteins that (1) are known to be predominantly expressed in one organ (i.e., organ-specific blood proteins) and whose blood concentrations may change as a result of Lyme disease, or (2) are involved in acute immune responses. In a longitudinal cohort of 40 Lyme disease patients and 20 healthy controls, we identified 10 proteins with significantly altered serum levels in patients at the time of diagnosis, and we also developed a 10-protein panel identified through multivariate analysis. In an independent cohort of patients with erythema migrans, six of these proteins, APOA4, C9, CRP, CST6, PGLYRP2, and S100A9, were confirmed to show significantly altered serum levels in patients at time of presentation. Nine of the 10 proteins from the multivariate panel were also verified in the second cohort. These proteins, primarily innate immune response proteins or proteins specific to liver, skin, or white blood cells, may serve as candidate blood biomarkers requiring further validation to aid in the laboratory diagnosis of early Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Whether Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, can persist for long periods in the human body has been a controversial question. The objective of this study was to see if we could find B. burgdorferi in a Lyme disease patient after a long clinical course and after long-term antibiotic treatment. Therefore, we investigated the potential presence of B. burgdorferi antigens and DNA in human autopsy tissues from a well-documented serum-, PCR-, and culture-positive Lyme disease patient, a 53-year-old female from northern Westchester County in the lower Hudson Valley Region of New York State, who had received extensive antibiotic treatments during extensive antibiotic treatments over the course of her 16-year-long illness. We also asked what form the organism might take, with special interest in the recently found antibiotic-resistant aggregate form, biofilm. We also examined the host tissues for the presence of inflammatory markers such as CD3+ T lymphocytes. Autopsy tissue sections of the brain, heart, kidney, and liver were analyzed by histological and immunohistochemical methods (IHC), confocal microscopy, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and whole-genome sequencing (WGS)/metagenomics. We found significant pathological changes, including borrelial spirochetal clusters, in all of the organs using IHC combined with confocal microscopy. The aggregates contained a well-established biofilm marker, alginate, on their surfaces, suggesting they are true biofilm. We found B. burgdorferi DNA by FISH, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and an independent verification by WGS/metagenomics, which resulted in the detection of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto specific DNA sequences. IHC analyses showed significant numbers of infiltrating CD3+ T lymphocytes present next to B. burgdorferi biofilms. In summary, we provide several lines of evidence that suggest that B. burgdorferi can persist in the human body, not only in the spirochetal but also in the antibiotic-resistant biofilm form, even after long-term antibiotic treatment. The presence of infiltrating lymphocytes in the vicinity of B. burgdorferi biofilms suggests that the organism in biofilm form might trigger chronic inflammation."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a common tick-borne disease in the northeastern and midwestern United States. School-aged children aged 5-15 years are at high risk for contracting Lyme disease. Many school campuses in the mid-Atlantic United States are in areas that are near, or border with, wooded habitat. We surveyed school administrators to determine the perception of risk of tick encounters and tick control methods implemented on school campuses in the mid-Atlantic. Responses from Pennsylvania and New Jersey districts indicate school district administrators had knowledge of Lyme disease and blacklegged ticks, but knowledge of other tick species and tick-borne diseases was limited. Overall, the results suggest that targeted communication of educational information regarding ticks and tick control to school districts could encourage increased participation in organized tick control or other preventative measures. Overall, respondents were aware of ticks and Lyme disease, but were not aware or had limited awareness of many other tick-borne diseases, and how tick bite risk could be reduced. Targeted communication of educational information regarding ticks and tick control to school districts could provide a framework for reducing tick-borne disease risk in mid-Atlantic school districts."

		"abstract": "Wild birds are frequently exposed to the zoonotic tick-borne bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), and some bird species act as reservoirs for some Borrelia genospecies. Studying the tropism of Borrelia in the host, how it is sequestered in different organs, and whether it is maintained in circulation and/or in the host's skin is important to understand pathogenicity, infectivity to vector ticks and reservoir competency.We evaluated tissue dissemination of Borrelia in blackbirds (Turdus merula) and great tits (Parus major), naturally and experimentally infected with Borrelia genospecies from enzootic foci. We collected both minimally invasive biological samples (feathers, skin biopsies and blood) and skin, joint, brain and visceral tissues from necropsied birds. Infectiousness of the host was evaluated through xenodiagnoses and infection rates in fed and moulted ticks. Skin biopsies were the most reliable method for assessing avian hosts' Borrelia infectiousness, which was supported by the agreement of infection status results obtained from the analysis of chin and lore skin samples from necropsied birds and of their xenodiagnostic ticks, including a significant correlation between the estimated concentration of Borrelia genome copies in the skin and the Borrelia infection rate in the xenodiagnostic ticks. This confirms a dermatropism of Borrelia garinii, B. valaisiana and B. turdi in its avian hosts. However, time elapsed from exposure to Borrelia and interaction between host species and Borrelia genospecies may affect the reliability of skin biopsies. The blood was not useful to assess infectiousness of birds, even during the period of expected maximum spirochetaemia. From the tissues sampled (foot joint, liver, spleen, heart, kidney, gut and brain), Borrelia was detected only in the gut, which could be related with infection mode, genospecies competition, genospecies-specific seasonality and/or excretion processes."

		"abstract": "Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum are tick-borne infections transmitted by Ixodes scapularis in the eastern USA; both agents cause disease in dogs and people. To characterize changes in seroprevalence over time, Cochran Armitage trend tests were used to evaluate percent positive test results for antibodies to B. burgdorferi and Anaplasma spp. in approximately 20 million canine tests from 2010-2017 in 25 states and 905 counties in the eastern USA. A significant decreasing trend in seroprevalence to B. burgdorferi was evident in eight states along the mid-Atlantic coast from Virginia to New Hampshire, and in Wisconsin. In contrast, a continued increasing trend was evident in five northeastern and Midwestern states where Lyme borreliosis is endemic or emerging, as well as in three southern states where endemicity has not yet been widely established. Similarly, seroprevalence to Anaplasma spp. showed a significant, although smaller, decreasing trend in five states along the mid-Atlantic coast from Virginia to Connecticut and Rhode Island, as well as in Minnesota and Wisconsin in the Midwest; despite the fact that those trends were significant they were weak. However, a strong increasing trend was evident in Massachusetts and three states in northern New England as well as in Pennsylvania. As expected, seroprevalence continued to increase in regions where Lyme borreliosis and anaplasmosis are more newly endemic. However, the declining seroprevalence evident in other areas was not anticipated. Although the reasons for the decreasing trends are not clear, our finding may reflect shifting ecologic factors that have resulted in decreased infection risk or the combined positive influence of canine vaccination, tick control, and routine testing of dogs in regions where these infections have long been endemic. Analysis of trends in canine test results for tick-borne infections continues to be a valuable tool to understand relative geographical and temporal risk for these zoonotic agents."

		"abstract": "Single multiplexed assays could replace the standard 2-tiered (STT) algorithm recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of Lyme disease if they perform with a specificity and a sensitivity superior or equal to those of the STT algorithm. We used human serum rigorously characterized to be sera from patients with acute- and convalescent-phase early Lyme disease, Lyme arthritis, and posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, as well as the necessary controls (n = 241 samples), to select the best of 12 Borrelia burgdorferi proteins to improve our microfluidic assay (mChip-Ld). We then evaluated its serodiagnostic performance in comparison to that of a first-tier enzyme immunoassay and the STT algorithm. We observed that more antigens became positive as Lyme disease progressed from early to late stages. We selected three antigens (3Ag) to include in the mChip-Ld: VlsE and a proprietary synthetic 33-mer peptide (PepVF) to capture sensitivity in all disease stages and OspC for early Lyme disease. With the specificity set at 95%, the sensitivity of the mChip-Ld with 3Ag ranged from 80% (95% confidence interval [CI], 56% to 94%) and 85% (95% CI, 74% to 96%) for two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease and was 100% (95% CI, 83% to 100%) for serum from patients with Lyme arthritis; the STT algorithm detected early Lyme disease in the same two panels of serum from patients with early Lyme disease with a sensitivity of 48.5% and 75% and Lyme arthritis in serum from patients with Lyme arthritis with a sensitivity of 100%, and the specificity was 97.5% to 100%. The mChip-Ld platform outperformed the STT algorithm according to sensitivity. These results open the door for the development of a single, rapid, multiplexed diagnostic test for point-of-care use that can be designed to identify the Lyme disease stage."

		"abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen's syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many \"all in your head\" conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust."

		"abstract": "Persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis often include self-reported cognitive impairment. However, it remains unclear whether these symptoms can be substantiated by objective cognitive testing. For this observational study, cognitive performance was assessed in 280 adults with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis (as part of baseline data collected for the Dutch PLEASE study). Cognitive testing covered the five major domains: episodic memory, working memory / attention, verbal fluency, information-processing speed and executive function. Patients' profiles of test scores were compared to a large age-, education- and sex-adjusted normative sample using multivariate normative comparison. Performance validity was assessed to detect suboptimal effort, and questionnaires were administered to measure self-reported cognitive complaints, fatigue, anxiety, depressive symptoms and several other psychological factors. Of 280 patients, one was excluded as the test battery could not be completed. Of the remaining 279 patients, 239 (85.4%) displayed sufficient performance validity. Patients with insufficient performance validity felt significantly more helpless and physically fatigued, and less orientated. Furthermore, they had a lower education level and less often paid work. Of the total study cohort 5.7% (n = 16) performed in the impaired range. Among the 239 patients who displayed sufficient performance validity, 2.9% (n = 7) were classified as cognitively impaired. No association between subjective cognitive symptoms and objective impairment was found. Only a small percentage of patients with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms have objective cognitive impairment. Performance validity should be taken into account in neuropsychological examinations of these patients. Self-report questionnaires are insufficiently valid to diagnose cognitive impairment.

		"abstract": "Infectious diseases emerge and reemerge over the years, and many of them can cause neurologic disease. Several factors contribute to the emergence and reemergence of these conditions, including human population growth, an increase in international travel, the geographic expansion of recognized pathogens to areas where they were previously nonendemic, and greater contact with wild animal reservoirs. The antivaccination social movement has played an important role in the reemergence of infectious diseases, especially some viral conditions. The authors review different viral (arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus; enterovirus 71; measles; and influenza), bacterial (syphilis, Lyme disease, and listeriosis), and parasitic (Chagas disease) diseases, focusing primarily on their neurologic complications. Although there are several additional infectious diseases with central nervous system manifestations that could be classified as emergent or reemergent, those listed here are the most relevant from an epidemiologic standpoint and are representative of important public health issues on all continents. The infections caused by these pathogens often show a variety of neuroimaging patterns that can be identified at CT and MRI, and radiology is central to the diagnosis and follow-up of such conditions. Given the increasing relevance of emerging and reemerging infections in clinical practice and public health scenarios, radiologists should be familiar with these infections.

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (Lyme borreliosis) is a transmissible infection, common in the temperate climate zones. It is caused by a group of spirochetal bacteria known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex. The aim of the present work was to investigate the incidence rate of borreliosis in different regions of Bulgaria and to identify possible risk factors for its occurrence. National and regional borreliosis incidence rates for 2009-2018 were obtained from the public database of the National Centre of Public Health and Analyses. Their association with some socio-demographic variables and the geographic location (south or north) of the regions was tested with Spearman's correlation analysis and simple linear regression. The mean annual incidence for the last 10 years (2009-2018) in Bulgaria was 6.9 (range 4.1-11.6) cases per 100,000 inhabitants. We found that the Lyme disease was highly fluctuating at regional level with incidence rates varied from 0.3 to 30.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. Several regions showed significantly higher endemicity for the disease. Socio-demographic factors were not found to be important for Lyme disease frequency while the geographic location in the north part of the country was a significant risk factor for it. Lyme disease is a serious health risk in Bulgaria especially in its northern part - regions on the north are the most vulnerable to a higher incidence of the disease."

I. scapularis ticks submitted by state residents to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station-Tick Testing Laboratory between 2015 and 2018 were screened using standard PCR and pathogen-specific primers. Infection and coinfection prevalence in I. scapularis was estimated to assess differences in infection status by life stage (nymph or adult female), county, and year, as well as whether infection with B. burgdorferi changes the likelihood of infection with either B. microti or A. phagocytophilum. Of the 11,254 I. scapularis acquired in Connecticut, 40.7% tested positive for at least one pathogen and the remaining 59.3% were negative. Most I. scapularis ticks tested positive for a single pathogen (33.6%), and only 7.2% were infected with more than one pathogen, of which 93.2% were identified with dual infection and 6.8% tested positive for all three pathogens. Adults were more likely than nymphs to be infected or coinfected with these pathogens. Furthermore, we found that ticks were 74% more likely to be infected with B. microti and 98% more likely to be infected with A. phagocytophilum if infected with B. burgdorferi compared with those not infected. We did not find spatial differences in infection or coinfection prevalence, but between 2015 and 2018, the likelihood that a tick was coinfected increased with time. These results from Connecticut, an endemic state for Lyme disease with long-established populations of I. scapularis, suggest that the increased likelihood of coinfection prevalence over time may have significant implications for clinical diagnosis, course, severity, and treatment of human disease cases."

Previously reported cases of M. goodii infection have included prosthetic joint infections, pacemaker pocket infections, and pneumonia. We present a case of M. goodii bacteremia with concomitant pulmonary septic emboli that developed in a 32-year-old woman with an indwelling central venous catheter (CVC). The CVC had been placed one year previously for intermittent treatment with intravenous, broadspectrum antibiotics, administered by an outside physician for the treatment of symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme disease. Despite our recommendations, the patient declined follow-up in our Infectious Diseases clinic, opting to continue care under her chronic Lyme disease physician. This case clearly demonstrates the potential for serious medical complications that can arise from the inappropriate use of longterm intravenous antibiotics using a CVC to treat non-specific symptoms attributed to Lyme disease and patients should be counseled regarding these risks."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis is an infective disease that is usually transmitted to humans via biting by bacteria-infected Ixodes tick. The disease is multisystemic and the affected organs are the skin (Erythema migrans), nervous system, eyes, heart and joints. Borrelia burgdorferi is the bacterium that causes borreliosis and the hosts are rodents of the genus Apodemus. In the Balkan region, Ixodes ricinus is the most representative vector. A bite from an infected insect is the most common mode of transmitting Borrelia; however, transplacental transmission has also been documented. Pathogenesis of the disease consists of both direct and indirect mechanisms of immunological reactions which result in the production of IgM antibodies to Borrelia in the first 3-6 weeks, and production of IgG class after 6 weeks. Many skin diseases and skin symptoms mimicking Lyme borreliosis, such as dermatomycosis, erysipelas, and undefined hyperpigmentation must be elaborated and considered for borreliosis, as skin symptoms of borreliosis can imitate many of them."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a common vector-borne illness in the U.S. caused by Borrelia species spirochetes. Neuroborreliosis has variable presentations, rarely manifesting as meningoradiculitis or \"Bannwarth Syndrome\", characterized by painful radiculopathy, neuropathy, varying degrees of motor weakness, peripheral facial nerve palsy and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytic pleocytosis. We present a case of Bannwarth Syndrome manifesting with transaminitis and significant weight loss. A 60-year-old man with history of hypertension presented with 3 weeks of progressive back pain, bilateral arm and leg weakness, bilateral hand numbness and a right facial droop in absence of sphincter dysfunction. He reported an 11.3 kg unintentional weight loss and recent holiday to Egypt. Patient was afebrile with normal vital signs but with profound transaminitis on presentation. Exam revealed a lower motor neuron right facial nerve palsy, diffuse quadriparesis, areflexia but isolated brisk ankle reflexes. A left complete facial palsy developed shortly after admission. Concern for leptomeningeal plus peripheral nerve involvement led to consideration of oncologic, infectious and inflammatory etiologies, along with Guillain-Barre variants. Contrasted MRI of the brain and total spine was normal. CSF revealed lymphocytic pleocytosis (cell count 134), elevated protein (156) with normal glucose, cytology, AFB culture, viral PCRs and paraneoplastic antibodies. Serum and CSF Lyme IgG and IgM were positive. IV Ceftriaxone 2 g daily was started one day after admission. EMG/Nerve conduction studies showed diffuse polyradiculopathy without evidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome. Babesia co-infection was considered given unexplained transaminitis but PCR and quantitation were negative. CSF following 1 week of antibiotics showed improving cell and protein counts with resolving transaminitis. On follow-up at 2 months, facial paralysis, pain, motor and sensory deficits had resolved with return to baseline weight and liver function tests. Bannwarth syndrome, a subacute painful meningoradiculitis caused by Borrelia species infection, is an uncommon presentation of neuroborreliosis in the U.S. Our case demonstrates previously unreported features such as profound transaminitis and weight loss without evidence of co-infection. Clinical manifestations of neuroborreliosis are variable, thus it is important to consider Bannwarth syndrome in the differential of meningoradiculitis in areas where Lyme Disease is prevalent."

		"abstract": "Introduction: Despite advancements in diagnostic capabilities and the availability of effective antimicrobial agents, community-acquired infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are still associated with high mortality rates. Aim: To assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of community-acquired CNS infections treated in the West Pannonian region between 2010 and 2016. Method: Clinical data of 176 patients were retrospectively analysed in two age cohorts: 15 to 65 and more than 65 years of age. Results: Neuroinfections were found to be bacterial in 81, viral in 91, parasitic in 1 and mixed in 3 cases during the observation period. The most frequent bacterial pathogens isolated were Streptococcus pneumoniae (20%) and Borrelia burgdorferi (16%). The most frequent viral pathogens isolated were tick-borne encephalitis virus (37%), herpes simplex virus (10%) and enterovirus (7%). Aetiology was unknown in 40 percent of all cases. The average incidence rate was 9.8/100 000 person/year with a mortality rate of 12%. In the cohort of patients aged >65 years, significantly higher frequencies of immunocompromising factors, lower Glasgow Coma Scale values at admission and confusion were observed (p-values: 0.008, 0.017, and 0.050, respectively). Prognosis was negatively influenced by low Glasgow Coma Scale values at admission (OR = 1.6 CI95%: 1.3-1.9; p<0.001), old age (OR = 6.5 CI95%: 2.5-17.1; p<0.001) and immunodeficiency (OR = 3.1 CI95%: 1.2-8.1; p = 0.019). Conclusions:S. pneumoniae remains the most frequently observed causative bacterial pathogen associated with community-acquired CNS infections. Incidence of tick-borne encephalitis in our county is higher than the national average (2.3 versus 0.35/100 000 person/year). Orv Hetil. 2019; 160(40): 1574-1583."

We hereby report a case of a morphological anomaly in I. scapularis, biting a human host residing in Norwich, Connecticut. Using a dichotomous morphological key, high-resolution and scanning electron microscopy images, as well as DNA sequencing, the tick was identified as an adult female I. scapularis with three legs on the left side of the abdomen versus four on the right side, which we believe is the first case of ectromely in an adult I. scapularis. Using diagnostic genes in polymerase chain reaction, the specimen tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, the causative agents for Lyme disease and anaplasmosis, respectively, and also showed evidence of a rickettsial endosymbiont. Here we discuss recent reports of morphological anomalies in I. scapularis, and emphasize the significance of additional studies of teratology in this important tick species and its potential implications."

		"abstract": "The spread of blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) and growing threat of Lyme disease transmission has increased demand for effective, safe and environmentally friendly repellent products. Plant-derived essential oils are natural products that exhibit insecticidal and repellant activities and represent a promising alternative to synthetic repellants. However, mechanisms by which ticks detect odor stimuli and how such stimuli may function as repellents are not well understood. We examined the repellent activity of selected essential oil components towards I. scapularis in short- and long-term dose-response trials. To determine the specific olfactory organs involved in detection of chemical stimuli, we tested tick behavioral response in repellency bioassays after removing appendages that house chemosensory sensilla (e.g., foretarsi or pedipalps). New prototype formulae were tested in longevity trials repelling up to 95% of tested ticks after 1 h post-application. This study provides new insight regarding tick olfaction and behavior, and innovative methods for selecting appropriate chemicals for development of novel plant-based repellent products for protection from ticks."

The controversy has led several professional societies and leading scientific journals in Europe and the United States to reaffirm their position and update their recommendations. Tick bites are common in our area, and medical practitioners must know their potential complications, respond to questions from worried patients, and confront their own doubts and uncertainties. This article aims to give an update on current knowledge of tick-borne diseases based on a number of common assumptions."

We report the case of a 62-year-old woman presenting with asymmetrical tetraparesis and hyporeflexia. Initially the presumed diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome with a possible functional component was suspected and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin was initiated. Due to partial response to therapy and further test results including positive serologies and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies for Borrelia, the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis was considered. Further exploring revealed the possibility of exposure to ticks although there was no report of typical skin lesions. Daily physical therapy and appropriate antibiotic treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone resulted in significant improvement of motor symptoms and functional status. The patient was discharged with marked functional improvement and indication for further physical rehabilitation."

		"abstract": "Multistrain microbial pathogens often induce strain-specific antibody responses in their vertebrate hosts. Mothers can transmit antibodies to their offspring, which can provide short-term, strain-specific protection against infection. Few experimental studies have investigated this phenomenon for multiple strains of zoonotic pathogens occurring in wildlife reservoir hosts. The tick-borne bacterium Borrelia afzelii causes Lyme disease in Europe and consists of multiple strains that cycle between the tick vector (Ixodes ricinus) and vertebrate hosts, such as the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). We used a controlled experiment to show that female bank voles infected with B. afzelii via tick bite transmit protective antibodies to their offspring. To test the specificity of protection, the offspring were challenged using a natural tick bite challenge with either the maternal strain to which the mothers had been exposed or a different strain. The maternal antibodies protected the offspring against a homologous infectious challenge but not against a heterologous infectious challenge. The offspring from the uninfected control mothers were equally susceptible to both strains. Borrelia outer surface protein C (OspC) is an antigen that is known to induce strain-specific immunity. Maternal antibodies in the offspring reacted more strongly with homologous than with heterologous recombinant OspC, but other antigens may also mediate strain-specific immunity. Our study shows that maternal antibodies provide strain-specific protection against B. afzelii in an ecologically important rodent reservoir host. The transmission of maternal antibodies may have important consequences for the epidemiology of multistrain pathogens in nature.IMPORTANCE Many microbial pathogen populations consist of multiple strains that induce strain-specific antibody responses in their vertebrate hosts. Females can transmit these antibodies to their offspring, thereby providing them with short-term strain-specific protection against microbial pathogens. We investigated this phenomenon using multiple strains of the tick-borne microbial pathogen Borrelia afzelii and its natural rodent reservoir host, the bank vole, as a model system. We found that female bank voles infected with B. afzelii transmitted to their offspring maternal antibodies that provided highly efficient but strain-specific protection against a natural tick bite challenge. The transgenerational transfer of antibodies could be a mechanism that maintains the high strain diversity of this tick-borne pathogen in nature."

		"abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of Lyme disease. Cranial mononeuropathy, particularly that affecting the facial nerve, can be a presenting symptom, and at times, it can be associated with polyradiculopathies or plexopathies. However, isolated femoral neuropathy has not yet been reported in Lyme disease; therefore, we felt the need to present this case. Laboratory investigations were performed on a 67-year-old man living in a region at high risk for Lyme disease after he developed erythema migrans on his chest, accompanied by the swelling of his left knee joint. A Western blot immunoglobulin assay was performed, including a screening for connective tissue disorders. Positive serological test results led to the administration of oral doxycycline therapy at a dosage of 100 mg twice daily. Shortly afterwards, he developed gait difficulties and frequent falls. The clinical examination and electrodiagnostic studies were consistent with femoral neuropathy. To look for etiologies other than Lyme disease, radiographic studies of his lumbar spine, pelvic cavity, retroperitoneal compartment, and hips were conducted. In addition, he was screened for diabetes. However, no other etiologies were found to explain the femoral neuropathy. Eventually, he recovered, and he was able to return to work. We firmly believe that the femoral neuropathy and Lyme disease seen in this patient were causally related."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne infections-including tick-borne encephalitis viruses, represented in the United States by rare infections with Powassan and deer tick viruses, and more often Lyme disease-are of increasing importance to neurologists. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) causes all or part of a triad including meningitis, radiculoneuritis, and cranial neuritis. Rarely, parenchymal brain and spinal cord involvement occur, with focal findings on examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). LNB diagnosis requires plausible exposure, objective evidence of nervous system involvement, and, generally, positive two-tier serology. Central nervous system (CNS) LNB is almost always accompanied by abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cells, protein), often with intrathecal antibody production, which is determined by concentration-adjusted comparison of serum and CSF antibody. Measuring CSF antibody in isolation and nucleic acid-based testing of CSF are not useful in LNB and should be avoided. LNB treatment is highly effective with a 2- to 3-week course of antibiotics. Increasing evidence suggests that LNB not involving the CNS parenchyma can be treated successfully with oral doxycycline."

		"abstract": "A detailed first-hand account of the events leading up to the discovery of the Lyme disease agent has been lacking. Nearly 40 years have elapsed since the discovery of the organism that was named Borrelia burgdorferi There are thousands of articles in the scientific and medical literature on this organism and the disease that it causes. In the interval since the organism's discovery, however, misconceptions have arisen regarding not only the disease but the discovery itself. Accordingly, with this paper, we aim to fill in the details of this episode in medical history with a joint introduction, first-person accounts by the two authors, a summary of contemporaneous events, and concluding comments. The history of the discovery of the Lyme disease agent has threads originating in different places in the United States. Studies on Long Island, NY, provided the epidemiological thread of studies on rickettsial diseases and babesiosis, linking the latter with the cutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease, now known as erythema migrans. The Long Island thread intersected Montana's Rocky Mountain Laboratories thread of studies on a relapsing fever Borrelia and its cultivation and expertise in vector biology. This intersection made possible the discovery of the spirochete and its recovery from patients. This paper stresses that what may seem to have been an individual scientific discovery is actually the product of several threads coming together and is attributable to more people than appreciated."

The serological study included 164 foresters and farmers with a history of tick bite. The molecular study included 540 patients, hospitalized because of various symptoms after tick bite. The control group consisted of 20 honorary blood donors. Anti-Coxiella burnetii antibodies titers were determined by Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) Phase 1 IgG ELISA (DRG International Inc. USA). PCR was performed to detect DNA of C. burnetii, Borrelia burgdorferi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in six foresters (7.3%). All foresters with the anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and anti-TBE (tick-borne encephalitis). Anti-C. burnetii IgG was detected in five farmers (6%). Four farmers with anti-C. burnetii IgG presence were positive toward anti-B. burgdorferi IgG and two with anti-TBE. Among them one was co-infected with B. burgdorferi and TBEV. Correlations between anti-C. burnetii IgG and anti-B. burgdorferi IgG presence and between anti-C. burnetii IgG presence and symptoms of Lyme disease were observed. C. burnetii DNA was not detected in any of the 540 (0%) patients. C. burnetii is rarely transmitted by ticks, but we proved that it is present in the environment, so it may be a danger to humans. The most common co-occurrence after tick bite concerns C. burnetii and B. burgdorferi."

Clinical picture of the disease is often unspecific, which makes the diagnosis relatively difficult. Uncharacteristic process of borreliosis is a result of complex molecular strategies used by spirochetes to infect, disseminate and survive in host organism. Part I of the article is focused on the current knowledge about pathogenesis of Lyme Borreliosis (LB), especially neuroborreliosis. Additionally, epidemic situation in Poland and in Europe was presented. Also, typical clinical manifestations of LB were described. In the article, the crucial pathogenic cell mechanisms were depicted. The processes of infection and dissemination of Borrelia in host were presented. The most important strategies of evading the response of host immune system were also discussed. These mechanisms are probable cause of the chronic and uncharacteristic clinical picture of the disease, as they significantly impair host immune response to bacteria. Also, there were presented molecular processes of neural cells impairment, which may lead to observed clinical symptoms of neuroborreliosis. Furthermore, diagnostic methods, treatment guidelines and some of diagnostic problems were discussed."

RpoS also exerts a 'gatekeeper' function by repressing σ70-dependent tick phase genes (e.g., ospA, lp6.6). Herein, we undertook a broad examination of RpoS functionality throughout the enzootic cycle, beginning with modeling to confirm that this alternative σ factor is a 'genuine' RpoS homolog. Using a novel dual color reporter system, we established at the single spirochete level that ospA is expressed in nymphal midguts throughout transmission and is not downregulated until spirochetes have been transmitted to a naïve host. Although it is well established that rpoS/RpoS is expressed throughout infection, its requirement for persistent infection has not been demonstrated. Plasmid retention studies using a trans-complemented ΔrpoS mutant demonstrated that (i) RpoS is required for maximal fitness throughout the mammalian phase and (ii) RpoS represses tick phase genes until spirochetes are acquired by a naïve vector. By transposon mutant screening, we established that bba34/oppA5, the only OppA oligopeptide-binding protein controlled by RpoS, is a bona fide persistence gene. Lastly, comparison of the strain 297 and B31 RpoS DMC regulons identified two cohorts of RpoS-regulated genes. The first consists of highly conserved syntenic genes that are similarly regulated by RpoS in both strains and likely required for maintenance of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto strains in the wild. The second includes RpoS-regulated plasmid-encoded variable surface lipoproteins ospC, dbpA and members of the ospE/ospF/elp, mlp, revA, and Pfam54 paralogous gene families, all of which have evolved via inter- and intra-strain recombination. Thus, while the RpoN/RpoS pathway regulates a 'core' group of orthologous genes, diversity within RpoS regulons of different strains could be an important determinant of reservoir host range as well as spirochete virulence."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne diseases have doubled in the last 12 years, and their geographic distribution has spread as well. The clinical spectrum of tick-borne diseases can range from asymptomatic to fatal infections, with a disproportionate incidence in children and the elderly. In the last few years, new agents have been discovered, and genetic changes have helped in the spread of pathogens and ticks. Polymicrobial infections, mostly in Ixodes scapularis, can complicate diagnostics and augment disease severity. Amblyomma americanum ticks have expanded their range, resulting in a dynamic and complex situation, possibly fueled by climate change. To document these changes, using molecular biology strategies for pathogen detection, an assessment of 12 microbes (9 pathogens and 3 symbionts) in three species of ticks was done in Suffolk County, New York. At least one agent was detected in 63% of I. scapularis ticksBorrelia burgdorferi was the most prevalent pathogen (57% in adults; 27% in nymphs), followed by Babesia microti (14% in adults; 15% in nymphs), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (14% in adults; 2% in nymphs), Borrelia miyamotoi (3% in adults), and Powassan virus (2% in adults). Polymicrobial infections were detected in 22% of I. scapularis ticks, with coinfections of B. burgdorferi and B. microti (9%) and of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum (7%). Three Ehrlichia species were detected in 4% of A. americanum ticks. The rickettsiae constituted the largest prokaryotic biomass of all the ticks tested and included Rickettsia amblyommatis, Rickettsia buchneri, and Rickettsia montanensis The high rates of polymicrobial infection in ticks present an opportunity to study the biological interrelationships of pathogens and their vectors.IMPORTANCE Tick-borne diseases have increased in prevalence in the United States and abroad. The reasons for these increases are multifactorial, but climate change is likely to be a major factor. One of the main features of the increase is the geographic expansion of tick vectors, notably Amblyomma americanum, which has brought new pathogens to new areas. The clinical spectrum of tick-borne diseases can range from asymptomatic to fatal infections, with a disproportionate incidence in children and the elderly. In addition, new pathogens that are cotransmitted by Ixodes scapularis have been discovered and have led to difficult diagnoses and to disease severity. Of these, Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, continues to be the most frequently transmitted pathogen. However, Babesia microti, Borrelia miyamotoi (another spirochete), Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Powassan virus are frequent cotransmitted agents. Polymicrobial infection has important consequences for the diagnosis and management of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "The Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Neurology, and American Academy of Rheumatology jointly proposed Lyme disease guidelines. Four areas most relevant to psychiatry were reviewed-the disclaimer, laboratory testing, and adult and pediatric psychiatric sections. The disclaimer and the manner in which these guidelines are implemented are insufficient to remove the authors and sponsoring organizations from liability for harm caused by these guidelines. The guidelines and supporting citations place improper credibility upon surveillance case definition rather than clinical diagnosis criteria. The guidelines fail to address the clear causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, developmental disabilities and substance abuse despite significant supporting evidence. If these guidelines are published without very major revisions, and if the sponsoring medical societies attempt to enforce these guidelines as a standard of care, it will directly contribute to increasing a national and global epidemic of psychiatric illnesses, suicide, violence, substance abuse and developmental disabilities and the associated economic and non-economic societal burdens. The guideline flaws could be improved with a more appropriate disclaimer, an evidence-based rather than an evidence-biased approach, more accurate diagnostic criteria, and recognition of the direct and serious causal association between Lyme disease and psychiatric illnesses."

		"abstract": "Hard ticks are widely distributed across temperate regions, show strong variation in host associations, and are potential vectors of a diversity of medically important zoonoses, such as Lyme disease. To address unresolved issues with respect to the evolutionary relationships among certain species or genera, we produced novel RNA-Seq data sets for nine different Ixodes species. We combined this new data with 18 data sets obtained from public databases, both for Ixodes and non-Ixodes hard tick species, using soft ticks as an outgroup. We assembled transcriptomes (for 27 species in total), predicted coding sequences and identified single copy orthologues (SCO). Using Maximum-likelihood and Bayesian frameworks, we reconstructed a hard tick phylogeny for the nuclear genome. We also obtained a mitochondrial DNA-based phylogeny using published genome sequences and mitochondrial sequences derived from the new transcriptomes. Our results confirm previous studies showing that the Ixodes genus is monophyletic and clarify the relationships among Ixodes sub-genera. This work provides a baseline for studying the evolutionary history of ticks: we indeed found an unexpected acceleration of substitutions for mitochondrial sequences of Prostriata, and for nuclear and mitochondrial genes of two species of Rhipicephalus, which we relate with patterns of genome architecture and changes of life-cycle, respectively."

		"abstract": "The density of questing ticks infected with tick-borne pathogens is an important parameter that determines tick-borne disease risk. An important factor determining this density is the availability of different wildlife species as hosts for ticks and their pathogens. Here, we investigated how wildlife communities contribute to tick-borne disease risk. The density of Ixodes ricinus nymphs infected with Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), Borrelia miyamotoi, Neoehrlichia mikurensis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum among 19 forest sites were correlated to the encounter probability of different vertebrate hosts, determined by encounter rates as measured by (camera) trapping and mathematical modeling. We found that the density of any tick life stage was proportional to the encounter probability of ungulates. Moreover, the density of nymphs decreased with the encounter probability of hare, rabbit and red fox. The density of nymphs infected with the transovarially-transmitted B. miyamotoi increased with the density of questing nymphs and the encounter probability of bank vole. The density of nymphs infected with all other pathogens increased with the encounter probability of competent hosts: bank vole for Borrelia afzelii and N. mikurensis, ungulates for A. phagocytophilum and blackbird for Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana. The negative relationship we found was a decrease in the density of nymphs infected with B. garinii and B. valaisiana with the encounter probability of wood mouse. Only a few animal species drive the densities of infected nymphs in forested areas. There, foxes and leporids have negative effects on tick abundance, and consequently on the density of infected nymphs. The abundance of competent hosts generally drives the abundances of their tick-borne pathogen. A dilution effect was only observed for bird-associated Lyme spirochetes."

		"abstract": "To correctly interpret the serological markers of Lyme disease, it is very important to determine the region's infection rate. The aim of this study was to ascertain the prevalence of specific antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi in a rural district in northern Spain. The presence of IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi was determined by qualitative enzyme immunoassay in the serum of 1,432 people divided into 3groups: 316 blood donors, 432 individuals who attended the hospital without infection and 684 for whom Lyme serology testing was specifically requested as part of a differential diagnosis. In the latter group, the presence or absence of an occupational risk factor was recorded. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were detected in 189 individuals (13.2%): 16 (5.1%) in the blood donors group, 62 (14.4%) in subjects who attended hospital without infection and 111 (16.2%) in subjects in whom a differential diagnosis of Lyme disease was requested (p < 0.0001). In subjects with an occupational risk factor, the prevalence was 23.5%, peaking at 45.8% in men over 65 years. Our study showed a high prevalence of antibodies against B. burgdorferi and higher than that seen in other areas with similar characteristics in Spain. However, our results are similar to those published from other European regions. The prevalence in the blood donors group was lower than that observed in the other groups. Older age, the male gender and occupational risks were associated with a higher prevalence of Lyme disease."

Additionally, BB0365 coordinated Zn2+ by the His51, His55, His140 residues, and the Zn2+ -binding site indicates that BB0365 could act as a potential metalloenzyme; therefore, this structure narrows down the potential functions of BB0365, an essential protein for B. burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is an infection caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi after it is transmitted to a mammalian organism during a tick blood meal. B. burgdorferi encodes at least 140 lipoproteins located on the outer or inner membrane, thus facing the surroundings or the periplasmic space, respectively. However, most of the predicted lipoproteins are of unknown function, and only a few proteins are known to be essential for the persistence and virulence of the pathogen. One such protein is the periplasmic BB0323, which is indispensable for B. burgdorferi to cause Lyme disease and the function of which is associated with cell fission and outer membrane integrity. After expression and transport to the periplasm, BB0323 is cleaved into C-terminal and N-terminal domains by the periplasmic serine protease BB0104. The resulting N-terminal domain is sufficient to ensure the survival of B. burgdorferi throughout the mouse-tick infection cycle. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of BB0323 was determined at 2.35 Å resolution. The overall fold of the protein belongs to the spectrin superfamily, with the characteristic interconnected triple-helical bundles known as spectrin repeats that function as linkers between different cell components in other organisms. Overall, the reported three-dimensional structure of the N-terminal domain of BB0323 not only reveals the molecular details of a protein that is essential for B. burgdorferi membrane integrity, cell fission and infectivity, but also suggests that spectrin repeats in bacteria are not limited to the EzrA proteins."

		"abstract": "Tickborne diseases (TBDs) such as Lyme disease (LD), babesiosis, ehrlichiosis and Rocky Mountain spotted fever cause substantial morbidity and even mortality in the USA. Data indicate that Hispanic populations may be at greater risk for occupational exposure to ticks and disseminated LD; however, information on knowledge and practices of Hispanic populations regarding TBDs is limited. We surveyed 153 Hispanic and 153 non-Hispanic residents of Maryland and Virginia to assess awareness of TBDs, prevention practices and risk of tick encounters. Hispanic respondents were less likely than non-Hispanics to report familiarity with LD symptoms (21% vs. 53%, p < 0.001) and correctly identify ticks as vectors of LD (40% vs. 85%, p < 0.001). Although there was no significant difference in overall proportion of respondents who routinely take one or more preventive measures to prevent tick bites (59% vs. 61%, p = 0.65), Hispanics were more likely to report showering after coming indoors (36% vs. 25%, p = 0.04) but less likely to conduct daily tick checks compared with non-Hispanics (17% vs. 35%, p < 0.001). History of tick bite or finding a tick crawling on oneself or a household member in the past year did not significantly differ between Hispanics and non-Hispanics (19% vs. 24%, p = 0.26). Notably, after controlling for Hispanic/non-Hispanic ethnicity, primary language (English vs. Spanish) was a significant predictor of whether an individual had knowledge of LD symptoms, correctly identified ticks as vectors for LD and performed daily tick checks. These results provide guidance for future development of more targeted and effective TBD prevention education for both Hispanic and non-Hispanic communities."

		"abstract": "Intrigued by testimonies of Saxon borreliosis self-help groups concerning considerabl improvements of their symptoms by ingestion of Cistus creticus L. (Cistaceae) leaf preparations, we recently reported on the growth inhibiting activity of extracts with different polarities and its volatile oil against Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (Bbss) in vitro, determined by a bioassay guided procedure. The most active volatile oil (only about 0.10% in leaves) was found to be dominated by labdane-type manoyloxides as well as carvacrol, determined via GC-MS. These terpenes are major active constituents of the old pharmaceutical oleoresin labdanum, which is secreted from the leaf surface of C. creticus and traditionally harvested, e.g., on Crete by brushing the shrubs. In order to elucidate the definite anti-Borrelia active principles of C. creticus, preparative scale separation of the diethyl‑ether soluble fraction of Cretan labdanum was achieved by combined silica gel 60-and RP-18 CC and analysed by novel TLC-Extractor/ES-MS as well as by 1d/2d-1H/13C-NMR data. For the antispirochaetal activity tests against Bbss in vitro, all samples were solubilised in water with addition of polysorbate 80, the effect of which on bacterial growth was examined and found to be negligible. This led to isolation and identification of the monoterpene carvacrol as well as of the four major manoyloxides manoyloxide (A), 3-acetoxy-manoyloxide (B), 3‑hydroxy-manoyloxide (C), and epi‑manoyloxide (D). Additionally, 2-keto-manoyloxide (E) and sclareol (F) were identified via GC/EI-MS. In subsequent microbiological tests of the isolated compounds, epi‑manoyloxide (D) exhibited by far the strongest individual antispirochaetal effect, equal to the positive control amoxicilline. Furthermore, manoyloxide (A), carvacrol, and the diethyl‑ether soluble fraction of labdanum as a whole contribute to the strong antispirochaetal activity, while the other labdanes were less active. Isolated manoyloxides were further used as external standards for a GC-MS screening of labdanum samples from different origins, revealing exceptionally high contents of all analysed manoyloxides in the samples of Cretan labdanum from C. creticus, while their contents in other commercial available labdanum samples were lower by several orders of magnitude. Especially in Spanish labdanum samples, declared as Cistus ladanifer L., mainly simple alkanes and at most traces of epi‑manoyloxide (D) and of manoyloxide (A) could be detected. The application of C. creticus preparations by Lyme disease self-help groups may be considered as a reasonable therapy approach. For the first time, isolated epi‑manoyloxide and carvacrol could be evaluated as most promising candidates for drug development and labdanum based phytomedicine development, respectively. They should serve as vital active markers for quality assessments of C. creticus preparations."

The goal of the initial workup is to evaluate for systemic involvement, provide adequate staging, and guide therapy. Histopathological studies are a critical part of the workup for classification of these lymphomas because they are similar to their nodal counterparts. There are limited data for treatment guidelines, and thus, therapy differs among institutions. Overall, localized therapies are preferred for indolent types and chemotherapy or immunotherapy for the aggressive forms."

		"abstract": "Land use and forest fragmentation are thought to be major drivers of Lyme disease incidence and its geographic distribution. We examined the association between landscape composition and configuration and Lyme disease in a population-based case control study in the Geisinger health system in Pennsylvania. Lyme disease cases (n = 9657) were identified using a combination of diagnosis codes, laboratory codes, and antibiotic orders from electronic health records (EHRs). Controls (5:1) were randomly selected and frequency matched on year, age, and sex. We measured six landscape variables based on prior literature, derived from the National Land Cover Database and MODIS satellite imagery: greenness (normalized difference vegetation index), percent forest, percent herbaceous, forest edge density, percent forest-herbaceous edge, and mean forest patch size. We assigned landscape variables within two spatial contexts (community and ½-mile [805 m] Euclidian residential buffer). In models stratified by community type, landscape variables were modeled as tertiles and flexible splines and associations were adjusted for demographic and clinical covariates. In general, we observed positive associations between landscape metrics and Lyme disease, except for percent herbaceous, where associations differed by community type. For example, compared to the lowest tertile, individuals with highest tertile of greenness in residential buffers had higher odds of Lyme disease (odds ratio: 95% confidence interval [CI]) in townships (1.73: 1.55, 1.93), boroughs (1.70: 1.40, 2.07), and cities (3.71: 1.74, 7.92). Similarly, corresponding odds ratios (95% CI) for forest edge density were 1.34 (1.22, 1.47), 1.56 (1.33, 1.82), and 1.90 (1.13, 3.18). Associations were generally higher in residential buffers, compared to community, and in cities, compared to boroughs or townships. Our results reinforce the importance of peridomestic landscape in Lyme disease risk, particularly measures that reflect human interaction with tick habitat. Linkage of EHR data to public data on residential and community context may lead to new health system-based approaches for improving Lyme disease diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."

		"abstract": "Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), characterized by recurring febrile episodes, is globally distributed and among the most common bacterial infections in some African countries. Despite the public health concern that this disease represents, little is known regarding the virulence determinants required by TBRF Borrelia during infection. Because the chromosomes of TBRF Borrelia show extensive colinearity with those of Lyme disease (LD) Borrelia, the exceptions represent unique genes encoding proteins that are potentially essential to the disparate enzootic cycles of these two groups of spirochetes. One such exception is a gene encoding an HtrA family protease, BtpA, that is present in TBRF Borrelia, but not in LD spirochetes. Previous work suggested that btpA orthologs may be important for resistance to stresses faced during mammalian infection. Herein, proteomic analyses of the TBRF spirochete, Borrelia turicatae, demonstrated that BtpA, as well as proteins encoded by adjacent genes in the B. turicatae genome, were produced in response to culture at mammalian body temperature, suggesting a role in mammalian infection. Further, transcriptional analyses revealed that btpA was expressed with the genes immediately upstream and downstream as part of an operon. To directly assess if btpA is involved in resistance to environmental stresses, btpA deletion mutants were generated. btpA mutants demonstrated no growth defect in response to heat shock, but were more sensitive to oxidative stress produced by t-butyl peroxide compared to wild-type B. turicatae. Finally, btpA mutants were fully infectious in a murine relapsing fever (RF) infection model. These results indicate that BtpA is either not required for mammalian infection, or that compensatory mechanisms exist in TBRF spirochetes to combat environmental stresses encountered during mammalian infection in the absence of BtpA."

		"abstract": "Objectives: Tick-borne diseases (T-BD) represent a potential health threat for outdoor workers in endemic areas, such as the Autonomous Province of Trento (APT). We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to assess T-BD knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices among APT farmers, specifically focusing on the use of protective habits and the uptake of the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) vaccine.Methods: A convenience sample of 106 farmers (all males, mean age 47.3 ± 13.6 years) attending pesticide training courses (12/2016-03/2017) completed the anonymous survey. Binary regression analysis, calculations of multivariate odds ratios (mOR) and 95% confidence intervals were used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and risk perceptions as predictors of preventive measures.Results: Though general understanding of T-BD was fairly low, the majority of the participants perceived TBE infection as a frequent (73.6%) and severe disease (61.3%). Overall, 43.3% of participants knew a TBE vaccine was available, and 24.5% had been vaccinated. Protective habits were reported by 53.8% of respondents, with self-checks for tick bites particularly low at 2.8% of participants. Better knowledge of T-BD and favorable attitudes toward vaccinations were associated with TBE immunization (mOR 4.708; 95%CI 1.273-17.409 and mOR 3.555; 95%CI 1.175-10.760, respectively), while previous history of tick bite and any interaction with T-BD significantly predicted adherence to protective measures (mOR 4.458; 95%CI 1.808-10.991, and mOR 9.433; 95%CI 1.127-78.973, respectively).Conclusions: Adherence to preventive measures (TBE vaccine) and protective habits was unsatisfactory in our sampled group, being a possible consequence of significant knowledge gaps. Public health communication on T-BD in farmers should, therefore, target understanding of health issues and appropriate preventive measures."

		"abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs) are an excellent source of data for disease symptoms, laboratory results, and medical treatments. Thus, EHR data may improve the completeness of notifiable disease case reporting and enable longitudinal collection of disease data. The purpose of this review is to examine the current state of EHR use in public health infectious disease surveillance in the USA. A wide variety of EHR data is used in infectious disease surveillance. EHR data were used to assess the incidence of Lyme disease and identify newly diagnosed HIV infections. EHR disease detection algorithms combined laboratory reports, diagnosis codes, and medication orders to identify cases and, in the case of Lyme disease, found incidence rates 4-7 times higher than those from traditional surveillance. EHR data were also used to evaluate temporal trends in sexually transmitted disease testing, positivity, and re-testing in several primary care settings. Multiple studies were also able to control for additional confounders in multivariable models, such as number of sexual partners and concurrent infections, because of the breadth of data available in EHR systems. Studies highlighted in this review demonstrate that EHR data enhance provider-based and laboratory-based disease reports and may facilitate more complete case reporting. EHR data also provides corollary patient information that enables longitudinal disease reporting and analysis of important health outcomes. As public health infrastructure and investment allow health departments to establish closer relationships with healthcare providers, EHR data use in public health surveillance activities should continue to increase."

Dogs with Borrelia C6 antigen-seroreactive PLN have distinct clinicopathologic findings when compared to dogs with Borrelia seronegative PLN. Forty dogs with PLN and Borrelia C6 antigen seroreactivity and 78 C6-seronegative temporally matched dogs with PLN. Retrospective prevalence case-control study. Clinical information was retrieved from records of dogs examined at the University of California, Davis, Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital. Histopathologic findings in renal tissue procured by biopsy or necropsy of dogs with PLN were reviewed. Retrievers and retriever mixes were overrepresented in seroreactive dogs (P < .001). Seroreactive dogs were more likely to have thrombocytopenia (P < .001), azotemia (P = .002), hyperphosphatemia (P < .001), anemia (P < .001), and neutrophilia (P = .003). Hematuria, glucosuria, and pyuria despite negative urine culture were more likely in seroreactive dogs (all P ≤ .002). Histopathologic findings were consistent with immune-complex glomerulonephritis in 16 of 16 case dogs and 7 of 23 control dogs (P = 006). Prevalence of polyarthritis was not different between groups (P = .17). C6 seroreactivity in dogs with PLN is associated with a clinicopathologically distinct syndrome when compared with other types of PLN. Early recognition of this syndrome has the potential to improve outcomes through specific aggressive and early treatment."

Of the 1,176 first-tier immunoassays, 1,114 (94.7%) were negative, and of the 285 immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunoblots, 242 (84.9%) followed a negative first-tier assay or were performed without an antecedent first-tier assay. Eighty-three positive IgM immunoblot tests were adjudicated using modified published criteria, of which 40 (48.2%) were deemed false positives. Thirtytwo patients with false-positive tests were treated with an antibiotic. Additionally, 30 patients with uncomplicated erythema migrans could have been treated without laboratory confirmation. Understanding the use and limitations of 2-tier diagnostic criteria, as well as the common pitfalls in diagnosing Lyme disease, may help prevent overdiagnosis, reduce unnecessary testing, and promote antibiotic stewardship."

Up-to-date information on the use of various prevention methods, as well as attitudes toward available and potential prevention options, is critical for effective promotion of recommended behaviors. During 2016-2017, printed invitations were mailed via the post office to 27,029 households requesting participation in an online survey regarding knowledge of TBD, risk perceptions, and prevention behaviors. Prevention behaviors included tick checks, showering/bathing, insect repellents, pet tick control, and chemical or natural pesticide use on residential properties. Associations of sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge and attitude variables with prevention behaviors were assessed in unadjusted analyses and multivariable models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR). Participants were also asked if they would be willing to get a Lyme disease (LD) vaccine, if one becomes available. Overall, 1883 (7%) persons completed the survey. Participants reported using preventive behaviors most of the time or always as follows: pet tick control (83%), tick checks (58%), showering/bathing (42%), insect repellent (31%), and chemical (23%) or natural (15%) pesticides on property. Self-rated knowledge of LD, perceived prevalence of LD, perceived severity of LD, and perceived likelihood of contracting LD or another TBD were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with performing a tick check [aOR 2.5, aOR 1.71, aOR 1.36, aOR 1.83, respectively]. Female gender and perceived prevalence of LD were significantly associated with applying insect repellent [aOR 1.56, aOR 1.64, respectively]. Perceived prevalence of LD was significantly associated with showering or bathing, insect repellents, and pet tick control [aOR 1.42, aOR 1.64, aOR 1.92, respectively]. Income > $100,000 was significantly associated with applying a chemical or natural pesticide to one's property [aOR 1.29, aOR 1.40, respectively]. A majority of respondents (84%) reported that they were very likely or somewhat likely to get a LD vaccine if one were available. Few behaviors (tick checks and pet tick control) were reported to be practiced by more than half of the respondents living in LD endemic areas. Perceived prevalence of LD was the only factor associated with performing most of the prevention behaviors (tick checks, showering/bathing, use of insect repellents, and pet tick control). Use of chemical or natural pesticides appears to be driven by income. Greater efforts are needed to encourage use of prevention behaviors in endemic areas, and this may be facilitated by increasing awareness of local prevalence."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB) is a tick-borne disease caused by spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species. Due to a variety of clinical manifestations, diagnosing LB can be challenging, and laboratory work-up is usually required in case of disseminated LB. However, the current standard of diagnostics is serology, which comes with several shortcomings. Antibody formation may be absent in the early phase of the disease, and once IgG-seroconversion has occurred, it can be difficult to distinguish between a past (cured or self-cleared) LB and an active infection. It has been postulated that novel cellular tests for LB may have both higher sensitivity earlier in the course of the disease, and may be able to discriminate between a past and active infection. VICTORY is a prospective two-gate case-control study. We strive to include 150 patients who meet the European case definitions for either localized or disseminated LB. In addition, we aim to include 225 healthy controls without current LB and 60 controls with potentially cross-reactive conditions. We will perform four different cellular tests in all of these participants, which will allow us to determine sensitivity and specificity. In LB patients, we will repeat cellular tests at 6 weeks and 12 weeks after start of antibiotic treatment to assess the usefulness as 'test-of-cure'. Furthermore, we will investigate the performance of the different cellular tests in a cohort of patients with persistent symptoms attributed to LB. This article describes the background and design of the VICTORY study protocol. The findings of our study will help to better appreciate the utility of cellular tests in the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis. NL7732 (Netherlands Trial Register, trialregister.nl)."

MTTT has shown promising results as an alternative strategy for the diagnosis of Lyme disease in adults but has not yet been evaluated in children. We performed a cross-sectional study of children and adolescents ≤21 years of age undergoing clinical investigation for suspected Lyme disease. Serum specimens were analyzed with both a whole-cell sonicate (WCS) and a C6 EIA, with a supplemental immunoblot if either EIA was positive or equivocal. We compared CTTT (WCS EIA followed by supplemental immunoblot) to MTTT (WCS EIA followed by C6 EIA) using McNemar's test to evaluate for agreement beyond chance alone. We then used a kappa statistic to measure level of the agreement between testing strategies. We included 1,066 serum specimens, of which 156 (14.6%) had a positive CTTT and 165 (15.5%) had a positive MTTT. There were no significant differences between MTTT and CTTT (P = 0.16). Although the overall agreement between MTTT and CTTT was high (kappa, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.92), 33 children had discordant test results. In a cohort of children and adolescents undergoing investigation for suspected Lyme disease, CTTT and MTTT results agreed in most cases. Since immunoblots are time-consuming, laborious, and challenging to interpret, MTTT provides a promising alternate Lyme disease testing strategy for children."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease of increasing global importance. There is scant information on Lyme disease patient demographics in England and Wales, and how they interact with the National Health Service (NHS). Our aims were to explore the demographic characteristics of Lyme disease patients within the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW), and to describe patient pathways. Data from 1st January 1998 to 31st December 2015 was retrieved from the two administrative hospital datasets (HES and PEDW), based on patients coded with Lyme disease. Information was collected on demographic characteristics, home address and case management. Incidence rates were calculated, and demographics compared to the national population. Within HES and PEDW, 2361 patients were coded with Lyme disease. There was a significant increase (p < 0.01) in incidence from 0.08 cases/100,000 in 1998, to 0.53 cases/100,000 in 2015. There was a bimodal age distribution, patients were predominantly female, white and from areas of low deprivation. New cases peaked annually in August, with higher incidence rates in southern central and western England. Within hospital admission data (n = 2066), most cases were either referred from primary care (28.8%, n = 596) or admitted via accident and emergency (A&E) (29.5%, n = 610). This population entering secondary care through A&E suggest a poor understanding of the recommended care pathways for symptoms related to Lyme disease by the general population. These data can be used to inform future investigations into Lyme disease burden, and patient management within the NHS. They provide demographic information for clinicians to target public health messaging or interventions."

A widely used test for serodiagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) based on the C6 peptide of the B. burgdorferi sl VlsE protein. We set out to study C6 reactivity upon infection with B. miyamotoi in a large well-characterized set of B. miyamotoi disease (BMD) patient sera and in experimental murine infection. We performed in silico analyses, comparing the C6-peptide to immunodominant B. miyamotoi variable large proteins (Vlps). Next, we determined C6 reactivity in sera from mice infected with B. miyamotoi and in a unique longitudinal set of 191 sera from 46 BMD patients. In silico analyses revealed similarity of the C6 peptide to domains within B. miyamotoi Vlps. Cross-reactivity against the C6 peptide was confirmed in 21 out of 24 mice experimentally infected with B. miyamotoi. Moreover, 35 out of 46 BMD patients had a C6 EIA Lyme index higher than 1.1 (positive). Interestingly, 27 out of 37 patients with a C6 EIA Lyme index higher than 0.9 (equivocal) were negative when tested for specific B. burgdorferi sl antibodies using a commercially available immunoblot. We show that infection with B. miyamotoi leads to cross-reactive antibodies to the C6 peptide. Since BMD and Lyme borreliosis are found in the same geographical locations, caution should be used when relying solely on C6 reactivity testing. We propose that a positive C6 EIA with negative immunoblot, especially in patients with fever several weeks after a tick bite, warrants further testing for B. miyamotoi."

		"abstract": "Disease emergence events, epidemics and pandemics all underscore the need to predict zoonotic pathogen spillover. Because cross-species transmission is inherently hierarchical, involving processes that occur at varying levels of biological organization, such predictive efforts can be complicated by the many scales and vastness of data potentially required for forecasting. A wide range of approaches are currently used to forecast spillover risk (e.g. macroecology, pathogen discovery, surveillance of human populations, among others), each of which is bound within particular phylogenetic, spatial and temporal scales of prediction. Here, we contextualize these diverse approaches within their forecasting goals and resulting scales of prediction to illustrate critical areas of conceptual and pragmatic overlap. Specifically, we focus on an ecological perspective to envision a research pipeline that connects these different scales of data and predictions from the aims of discovery to intervention. Pathogen discovery and predictions focused at the phylogenetic scale can first provide coarse and pattern-based guidance for which reservoirs, vectors and pathogens are likely to be involved in spillover, thereby narrowing surveillance targets and where such efforts should be conducted. Next, these predictions can be followed with ecologically driven spatio-temporal studies of reservoirs and vectors to quantify spatio-temporal fluctuations in infection and to mechanistically understand how pathogens circulate and are transmitted to humans. This approach can also help identify general regions and periods for which spillover is most likely. We illustrate this point by highlighting several case studies where long-term, ecologically focused studies (e.g. Lyme disease in the northeast USA, Hendra virus in eastern Australia, Plasmodium knowlesi in Southeast Asia) have facilitated predicting spillover in space and time and facilitated the design of possible intervention strategies. Such studies can in turn help narrow human surveillance efforts and help refine and improve future large-scale, phylogenetic predictions. We conclude by discussing how greater integration and exchange between data and predictions generated across these varying scales could ultimately help generate more actionable forecasts and interventions. This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'."

		"abstract": "Lyme borreliosis (LB), caused by spirochetes belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, is the most common tick-borne infection in Europe. Laboratory diagnosis of LB is mainly based on the patients' medical history, clinical signs and symptoms in combination with detection of Borrelia-specific antibodies where indirect enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the most widely used technique. The objective of the study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivities and specificities) of serological tests that are currently in use for diagnosis of LB in clinical laboratories in Northern Europe, by use of a large serum panel. The panel consisted of 195 serum samples from well-characterized and classified patients under investigation for clinically suspected LB (n = 59) including patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, erythema migrans or other diseases (n = 112). A total of 201 serum samples from healthy blood donors were also included. The panel (396 serum samples altogether) was sent to 12 clinical laboratories (using five different ELISA methods) as blinded for group affiliation and the laboratories were asked to perform serological analysis according to their routine procedure. The results from the study demonstrated high diagnostic concordance between the laboratories using the same diagnostic assay and lower diagnostic concordance between laboratories using different diagnostic assays. For IgG, the results were in general rather homogenous and showed an average sensitivity of 88% (range 85-91%) compared to IgM which showed lower average sensitivity of 59% (range 50-67%) and more heterogeneous results between assays and laboratories."

		"abstract": "Increasing numbers of Canadians, including children and adolescents, are being infected with Borrelia burgdorferi and contracting Lyme disease. In the present study, we provided a qualitative analysis of written correspondence produced by 23 parents of children and adolescents with Lyme disease. The goal of this study was to investigate how medical and psychological issues were highlighted by parents describing their family's Lyme disease experiences. The results suggest a series of four stages in these families where satisfactory treatment had not been obtained over months or years. The experiences of parents evolved from feelings of worry for the child to frustration with the lack of a helpful treatment, to mistrust of physicians' actions, and, in some case, to a rejection of the conventional health care system as a whole. Improved diagnostic testing and treatment guidelines, as well as family-centered practices of medical care were proposed as important features for improving the experiences of families living with Lyme disease."

		"abstract": "Ixodes ricinus is the most common tick species parasitizing humans in Europe, and the main vector of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme disease in the continent. This tick species also harbors the endosymbiont Midichloria mitochondrii, and there is strong evidence that this bacterium is inoculated into the vertebrate host during the blood meal. A high proportion of tick bites remains unnoticed due to rarity of immediate symptoms, implying the risk of occult tick-borne infections in turn a potential risk factor for the onset of chronic-degenerative diseases. Since suitable tools to determine the previous exposure to I. ricinus bites are needed, this work investigated whether seropositivity toward a protein of M. mitochondrii (rFliD) could represent a marker for diagnosis of I. ricinus bite. We screened 274 sera collected from patients from several European countries, at different risk of tick bite, using an ELISA protocol. Our results show a clear trend indicating that positivity to rFliD is higher where the tick bite can be regarded as certain/almost certain, and lower where there is an uncertainty on the bite, with the highest positivity in Lyme patients (47.30%) and the lowest (2.00%) in negative controls. According to the obtained results, M. mitochondrii can be regarded as a useful source of antigens, with the potential to be used to assess the exposure to ticks harboring this bacterium. In prospect, additional antigens from M. mitochondrii and tick salivary glands should be investigated and incorporated in a multi-antigen test for tick bite diagnosis."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease (LD) accounts for over 70% of tick-borne disease reported in the United States. The disease in humans is characterized by skin rash, arthritis, cardiac and neurological signs. Vaccination is the most efficient preventive measure that could be taken to reduce the incidence of the LD worldwide; however, at present no vaccine is available. In this study, evaluation of the Borrelia burgdorferi BB0172-derived peptide (PepB) in conjugated formulations was investigated as a vaccine candidate in murine model of LD. In brief, PepB was conjugated to the Cross-Reacting Material 197 (CRM197) and to Tetanus Toxoid heavy chain (TTHc) molecules, and subsequently used to immunize C3H/HeN mice. Following the challenge with 105 spirochetes/mouse via subcutaneous inoculation, TTHc:PepB construct showed protection in 66% of the immunized animals. Hence, to further evaluate the efficacy of TTHc:PepB, immunized mice were challenged with B. burgdorferi using the tick model of infection. The outcome of this experiment revealed that serum from TTHc:PepB immunized mice was borrelicidal. After tick infection, bacterial burden was significantly reduced (over 70%) in vaccinated animals when compared with the control groups regardless of whether the mice were infested 8 or 12-weeks post-priming. Therefore, we conclude that PepB conjugated antigens can serve as an alternative to prevent LD; nevertheless, further studies will be needed to dissect the mechanisms by which anti-PepB IgG antibodies are able to kill B. burgdorferi in vitro and in vivo to further advance in the development of formulations and delivery alternative to generate a safe anti-LD vaccine."

		"abstract": "In Poland, out of the 21 species of ticks described, two species have the greatest epidemiological significance: Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus. Their participation in the transmission of etiologic agents of vector diseases such as Lyme disease, tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis, babesiosis, rickettsiosis and many others is widely known. Due to the often severe and sometimes fatal course of diseases transmitted by ticks, a great deal of emphasis is placed on prophylactic activities, minimizing the possibility of biting and transfering pathogens along with the arachnid saliva. In addition to means of personal protection, including appropriate clothing, protective vaccinations, avoiding tick habitats or body checking after returning from this type of places, one of the most important elements of anti-tick prevention is the use of effective repellents. The key role of using the repellent is to discourage the arthropod from attacking and to prevent it from taking food, as a result of which there is no phenomenon of transmission of pathogens from the hematophage to the host organism. The most commonly used substances with arthropod repellent properties are: N-N-diethylm-toluamide (DEET), 3-(N-acetyl-N-butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester (IR3535), icaridine, permethrin and essential oils. However, it should be remembered that no repellent ever protects 100% all the time after application - its use should be considered as one of many elements of personal protection in the prevention of tick bites."

		"abstract": "Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are nanoparticles produced by Gram-negative bacteria that can be used as vaccines. The application of OMVs as vaccine component can be expanded by expressing heterologous antigens on OMVs, creating an OMV-based antigen presenting platform. This study aims to develop a production process for such OMV-based vaccines and studies a production method based on meningococcal OMVs that express heterologous antigens on their surface. As a proof of concept, the Borrelia burgdorferi antigens OspA and OspC were expressed on Neisseria meningitidis OMVs to create a concept anti-Lyme disease vaccine. Production of OMVs released in the culture supernatant was induced by high dissolved oxygen concentrations and purification was based on scalable unit operations. A crude recovery of 90 mg OMV protein could be obtained per liter culture. Expressing heterologous antigens on the OMVs did result in minor reduction of bacterial growth, while OMV production remained constant. The antigen expression did not alter the OMV characteristics. This study shows that production of well characterized OMVs containing heterologous antigens is possible with high yields by combining high oxygen concentrations with an optimized purification process. It is concluded that heterologous OMVs show potential as a vaccine platform."

		"abstract": "Surveillance of vector-borne diseases (VBDs) exemplifies a One Health approach, which entails coordinated, collaborative, multidisciplinary, and cross-sectoral approaches to address potential or existing health risks originating at the animal-human-ecosystem interface. However, at the intervention stage of the surveillance system, it is sometimes difficult or even impossible to act. The human dimension of VBD control makes them wicked problems requiring an interdisciplinary systems approach beyond the One Health domain. Here, we make a case that the agenda of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can offer new opportunities to address these issues. The health of the population is a concern to us all and is more or less related to all 17 SDGs. The SDGs can provide a common language by which the interests of various stakeholders can be matched and the challenges that society faces identified, studied, and alleviated. To illustrate, the control and prevention of two VBDs, dengue and Lyme borreliosis, were selected and related to specific SDGs. Further, we use the framework proposed by the International Council of Science to: (1) show synergies and trade-offs between the various SDGs; and (2) present SDG 3 to identify policy that can be related to prevention. Engaging in an integrated approach will confront stakeholders with various viewpoints and through these oppositions, innovation can be nurtured. By adhering to the SDG agenda, we present policy advice including new opportunities for vector-borne disease control to reach its own health goals, while simultaneously supporting other sustainable development goals."

We here questioned whether alterations in circulating monocytes/macrophages, inflammatory biomarkers and a functional SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of the Interleukin-6 (IL-6) promotor might play a role in patients with persistent, and treatment resistant borreliosis. (2) Methods: Leukocyte subpopulations were studied by flow cytometry; plasma cytokines were determined by a chemiluminescence based ELISA (Immulite®), and genotypes of the IL-6 promotor SNP rs1800795 were determined by pyrosequencing. (3) Results: In a cohort of n = 107 Lyme borreliosis patients, who concomitantly manifested either malignant diseases (group 1), autoimmune disorders (group 2), neurological diseases (group 3), or morbidities caused by multiple other infectious complications (group 4), we found decreased numbers of anti-inflammatory CD163-positive macrophages, elevated concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, and an imbalance of IL-6 promotor SNP rs1800795 genotypes. The most prominently upregulated cytokines were IL-1β, and IL-8. (4) Conclusions: Increased pro-inflammatory phenotypes identified by monocyte/macrophage subtypes and concomitantly increased cytokines appear to be valid to monitor disease activity in patients with persistent Lyme borreliosis. Patterns may vary by additional co-morbidities. In patients with autoimmune diseases, increased frequencies of a heterozygous IL-6 promotor SNP rs1800795 were identified. This functional SNP may guide chronic inflammation, impacting other cytokines to trigger trigger chronicity and therapeutic resistance in Lyme borreliosis."

		"abstract": "Blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis Say) are the vector for pathogens that cause more cases of human disease than any other arthropod. Lyme disease is the most common, caused by the bacterial spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner) in the northeastern United States. Further knowledge of seasonal effects on survival is important for management and modeling of both blacklegged ticks and tick-borne diseases. The focus of our study was on the impact of environmental factors on overwintering success of nymphal blacklegged ticks. In a three-year field study conducted in Connecticut and Maine, we determined that ground-level conditions play an important role in unfed nymphal overwintering survival. Ticks in plots where leaf litter and snow accumulation were unmanipulated had significantly greater survival compared to those where leaf litter was removed (p = 0.045) and where both leaf litter and snow were removed (p = 0.008). Additionally, we determined that the key overwintering predictors for nymphal blacklegged tick survival were the mean and mean minimum temperatures within a year. The findings of this research can be utilized in both small- and large-scale management of blacklegged ticks to potentially reduce the risk and occurrence of tick-borne diseases."

		"abstract": "Although Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne infection in the United States, diagnostic accuracy within community settings is not well characterized. A retrospective observational cohort study of patients referred to an academic center with a presumed diagnosis or concern for Lyme disease between 2000 and 2013 was performed to analyze diagnoses and treatments. Characteristics of those with Lyme disease and those misdiagnosed as having Lyme disease were compared. Of 1261 patients, 911 (72.2%) did not have Lyme disease, 184 (14.6%) had active or recent Lyme disease, 150 (11.9%) had a remote history of Lyme disease, and 16 (1.3%) were identified as having possible Lyme disease. Patients without current Lyme disease were more likely to be female (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.45), to have had symptoms for >3 months (OR, 8.78; 95% CI, 5.87-13.1), to have higher symptom counts (OR per additional symptom, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13), to have had more Lyme-related laboratory testing (OR per additional laboratory test, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.32), and to have been diagnosed with what were regarded as coinfections (OR, 3.13; 95% CI, 1.14-8.57). Of the 911 patients without Lyme disease, 764 (83.9%) had received antimicrobials to treat Lyme disease or their coinfections. The percentage of patients established to have Lyme disease was lower than in earlier studies of referred populations. Among patients referred to an academic Infectious Diseases practice for Lyme disease, incorrect diagnoses and unnecessary antibiotic treatment were common, both for Lyme disease and for coinfections."

		"abstract": "Lyme disease is a tick-borne disease of increasing incidence and public concern across the Northern Hemisphere. However, the socio-demographics and geographic distribution of the population affected in England and Wales are poorly understood. Therefore, the proposed study was designed to describe the demographics and distribution of laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease from a national testing laboratory. An ecological study of routinely collected laboratory surveillance data. Public Health England's national Lyme disease testing laboratory. 3986 laboratory-confirmed cases of Lyme disease between 2013 and 2016. In England and Wales, the incidence of laboratory-confirmed Lyme disease rose significantly over the study period from 1.62 cases per 100 000 in 2013 to 1.95 cases per 100 000 in 2016. There was a bimodal age distribution (with peaks at 6-10 and 61-65 years age bands) with a predominance of male patients. A significant clustering of areas with high Lyme disease incidence was located in southern England. An association was found between disease incidence and socioeconomic status, based on the patient's resident postcode, with more cases found in less deprived areas. Cases were disproportionately found in rural areas compared with the national population distribution. These results suggest that Lyme disease patients originate from areas with higher socioeconomic status and disproportionately in rural areas. Identification of the Lyme disease hotspots in southern England, alongside the socio-demographics described, will enable a targeted approach to public health interventions and messages."
