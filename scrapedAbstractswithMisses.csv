In Europe, the main manifestations are dermatological. During the early stage, the diagnosis is clinical: finding erythema migrans (EM) a few days after a tick bite is sufficient; several EM mean an early-disseminated disease. Borrelial lymphocytoma (only in Europe) is a solitary nodule or plaque (earlobe, nipple, scrotum), which appears during the second stage. The diagnosis relies on clinical and histological findings (B-cell infiltration) and a positive serological test. It is sometimes difficult to make the difference between BL and B-cell lymphoma and pseudo lymphoma; an empirical antibiotic trial period will be helpful for the diagnosis in this case. During the late stage, the clinical evolution of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is progressive: inflammatory then atrophic lesions appear, often on the hands, limbs, or feet. The diagnosis is made on histological findings (T-cell infiltration) and a positive serological test.

Synovial cysts and enthesitis are common. Myositis is rare, polymorphic, and has been linked to other symptoms in the same localizations. Minor arthralgia and myalgia frequently occur, principally early in the course of the infection. It was suggested that sequels of the disease include so-called fibromyalgic syndromes.

Ticks of the genus Ixodes are the vectors that transmit the infection to host mammals in endemic foci. Ixodes is infected by Borrelia at larval stage when it feeds on infected mammals. Man is an occasional host. The infection risk is linked to interaction between human and the natural environment. Strategies for prevention are closely related to the enzootic cycle of the Ixodes tick. Environmental measures to reduced tick density or host mammals are expensive, need to be repeated annually and cannot be applied to large areas. The primary prevention could be reduced to personal preventive measures such as reducing the amount of exposed skin and frequent checking for ticks. The risk of Lyme disease transmission after a tick bite is relatively low, and remains under 4%. The transmission rate depends on the duration of feeding.

The determination of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato susceptibility to antibiotics is difficult, especially because of the lack of standardization in the methods used. In vitro data is helpful to determine Lyme treatment but discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo results highlight the need to confirm this data by clinical trials. The second part is an analysis of the literature made to evaluate the current strategies of treatment and follow up of early Lyme disease characterized by erythema migrans (EM). β-lactams (penicillin G and V, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, ceftriaxone), tetracyclines (doxycycline), and macrolides (mainly azithromycin) are the drugs most frequently used during clinical trials. The comparison between treatments is difficult because of the lack of reliable clinical and biological criteria to identify complete recovery. However the prognosis of treated EM is good in most trials. If a clinical follow-up remains necessary after the treatment of an EM, prolonged antibody production among asymptomatic patients reduces the interest of a serological follow-up.",1235,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

Thus, serological testing (Elisa, immunoblotting) is essential for a biological diagnosis. Specific antibody detection is usually done in serum and CSF of patients suspected of Lyme borreliosis. Laboratories must follow European recommendations to validate these assays in routine practice. Antibody detection lacks sensitivity in the early cutaneous phase of the infection. Therefore, serological testing is not recommended for the diagnosis of erythema migrans . The interpretation of serology must take into account the variability of Elisa sensitivity and specificity and the lack of standardization for Western-blotting in Europe. Besides these indirect diagnosis techniques, there is also direct detection of spirochetes by culture or by in vitro DNA amplification but these require adequate samples. These molecular tests must not be performed routinely, but only for specific clinical situations and in specialized laboratories only.",1066,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

To tackle this risk, health authorities promote individual-based prevention measures.

For neuroborreliosis, it is recommended to simultaneously perform ELISA tests in samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid to test for intrathecal synthesis of Lyme antibodies.

The B. burgdorferi genome encodes five Oligopeptide ABC transporters (Opp) that are predicted to be involve in transport of various nutrients. Previously, it was reported that OppA5 is important for the optimal production of OspC, a major virulence factor of B. burgdorferi . In this study, possible role of another Oligopeptide ABC transporter, OppA4 in ospC expression was investigated by construction of an oppA4 deletion mutant and the complemented strain. Inactivation of oppA4 resulted an increased production of OspC, suggesting that OppA4 has a negative impact on ospC expression. Expression of ospC is controlled by Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS, the central pathway essential for mammal infection. We showed that increased ospC expression in the oppA4 mutant was due to an increased rpoS expression. We then further investigated how OppA4 negatively regulates this pathway. Two regulators, BosR and BadR, are known to positively and negatively, respectively, regulate the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway. We found that deletion of oppA4 resulted in an increased level of BosR. Previous reports showed that bosR is mainly regulated at the post-transcriptional level by other factors. However, OppA4 appears to negatively regulate bosR expression at the transcriptional level. The finding of OppA4 involved in regulation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway further reinforces the importance of nutritional virulence to the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi .",1588,0,0,1,0,en,en,

To quantify and synthesize the patterns of I. scapularis and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and sensu lato prevalence relative to wildlife hosts, we reviewed the findings of independent studies conducted throughout the United States. We performed a comprehensive literature search from 1970 to 2017 using the ISS Web of Science Core Collection and the keywords “ Ixodes scapularis,” “Ixodes dammini” and “ Borrelia burgdorferi.” We identified 116 studies for inclusion in our meta-analysis, with 187,414 individual wildlife hosts captured and examined for I. scapularis and either the host or ticks collected subsequently tested for B. burgdorferi. We found that only 13% of the wildlife mammals sampled comprised species other than Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) and Peromyscus leucopus (white-footed mouse). To examine whether there were regional differences between the Northeast, Midwest and the Southeast U.S. in I. scapularis infestation rates on wildlife hosts, we used general linear models (glm), with post hoc pairwise comparisons. In most cases, detection of I. scapularis and B. burgdorferi was significantly higher in the Northeast than the Midwest. Using data on host-specific I. scapularis infestation prevalence, B. burgdorferi prevalence in feeding larvae, and host permissiveness, we developed an epizootiological model to determine the relative contributions of individual hosts to B. burgdorferi -infected nymphs. Our model provides additional evidence that wildlife hosts other than P. leucopus may contribute more to Lyme disease risk than commonly thought. To aid in understanding the ecology of Lyme disease, we propose that additional studies sample non- Peromyscus spp. hosts to obtain more detailed tick and pathogen infestation and infection estimates, respectively, for these less frequently sampled wildlife hosts.",2100,0,0,1,0,en,en,

CSF samples obtained from four clinically well-defined groups of patients (proven LNB, suspected LNB, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), and aseptic meningitis/meningoencephalitis other than TBE) – 25 samples per group – were analyzed. The performance of the Luminex recomBead CXCL13 assay (Microgen, Neuried, Germany) and ELISA (Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) was assessed by receiver operating characteristics. CXCL13 cut-off values were presented as functions of CSF lymphocyte/monocyte counts. Demographic variables, CSF findings, and history of erythema migrans were assessed as possible predictors for CXCL13 CSF concentrations by a general linear model. The calculated cut-off values determined by the maximum of the Youden index were >131 pg/mL for recomBead and >259 pg/mL for the ELISA. RecomBead showed a sensitivity of 88% (68.8–97.5%) and a specificity of 94% (83.5–98.7%). For the ELISA the corresponding values were 84% (63.9–95.5%) and 98% (89.4–99.9%). The CXCL13 concentration positively correlated with CSF lymphocyte/monocyte count and Borrelia -specific intrathecal antibody index ( p < 0.05).

As host species differ in their ability to transmit the Lyme borreliosis bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. to ticks, increased host diversity can decrease disease prevalence by increasing the proportion of dilution hosts, host species that transmit pathogens less efficiently. Previous research shows that Lyme borreliosis risk differs between forest types and suggests that a higher diversity of host species might dilute the contribution of small rodents to infect ticks with B. afzelii , a common Borrelia genospecies. However, empirical evidence for a dilution effect in Europe is largely lacking. We tested the dilution effect hypothesis in 19 Belgian forest stands of different forest types along a diversity gradient. We used empirical data and a Bayesian belief network to investigate the impact of the proportion of dilution hosts on the density of ticks infected with B. afzelii , and identified the key drivers determining the density of infected ticks, which is a measure of human infection risk. Densities of ticks and B. afzelii infection prevalence differed between forest types, but the model indicated that the density of infected ticks is hardly affected by dilution. The most important variables explaining variability in disease risk were related to the density of ticks. Combining empirical data with a model-based approach supported decision making to reduce tick-borne disease risk. We found a low probability of a dilution effect for Lyme borreliosis in a north-western European context. We emphasize that under these circumstances, Lyme borreliosis prevention should rather aim at reducing tick-human contact rate instead of attempting to increase the proportion of dilution hosts.",1928,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A field study was conducted to evaluate the abundance of Ixodes nymphs in the French region of Alsace, where Lyme borreliosis is endemic, and to determine whether environmental factors such as soil moisture and composition may be associated with nymph abundance. In the ten sites studied, ticks were collected by drag sampling from March to October in 2013 and 2014. Temperature, relative humidity, saturation deficit, soil pH, humus composition and type of vegetation were recorded at each site. The abundance of I. ricinus was highly variable from one site to another. Inter-annual variations were also observed, since the nymph abundance were higher in 2013 than in 2014. This study shows that humus type can be indicative of nymph abundance. Three types of humus were observed: (1) moder, (2) mull, and (3) mull-moder humus. One of them, moder humus, which is characterized by a thick layer of fragmented leaves, was found in multivariate analyses to be strongly associated with the nymph abundance. This study demonstrates that factors such as saturation deficit do not suffice to explain the differences in nymph abundance among sites. The composition of the soil and especially the type of humus should also be taken into consideration when assessing acarological risk.",1427,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In humans, the spirochetes disseminate from the tick bite site to multiple tissues, leading to serious clinical manifestations. The ability of spirochetes to survive in ticks during blood feeding is thought to be essential for Lyme borreliae to be transmitted to different vertebrate hosts. This ability is partly attributed to several B. burgdorferi proteins, including BBA52 and Lp6.6, which promote spirochete survival in nymphal ticks feeding on mice. One of the strategies to identify such proteins without using live animals is to feed B. burgdorferi -infected ticks on blood via artificial feeding chambers. In previous studies, ticks were only fed on bovine blood in the feeding chambers. In this study, we used this chamber model and showed that I. scapularis ticks will not only acquire bovine blood but human and quail blood as well. The latter two are the incidental host and an avian host of Lyme borreliae, respectively. We also investigated the roles that BBA52 and Lp6.6 play in promoting spirochete survival in nymphal ticks fed on human or quail blood. After feeding on human blood, spirochete burdens in ticks infected with an lp6.6 -deficient B. burgdorferi were significantly reduced, while bba52- deficient spirochete burdens in ticks remained unchanged, similar to the wild-type strain. No strain showed a change in spirochete burdens in ticks fed on quail blood. These results indicate that Lp6.6 plays a role for B. burgdorferi in nymphs fed on human but not quail blood. Such information also demonstrates that the artificial feeding chamber is a powerful tool to identify B. burgdorferi proteins that promote vertebrate host blood-specific spirochete survival in I. scapularis ticks.",1903,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Ixodes scapularis , commonly referred to as the blacklegged tick, is the primary vector of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.), in the eastern United States. Connecticut has pervasive populations of I. scapularis and remains a hotspot for Lyme disease. A primary aim of this study was to determine if passively collected data on human-biting I. scapularis ticks in Connecticut could serve as a useful proxy for Lyme disease incidence based on the cases reported by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CDPH). Data for human-biting I. scapularis ticks submitted to the Tick Testing Laboratory at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station (CAES-TTL), and tested for infection with B. burgdorferi s.l., were used to estimate the rate of submitted nymphs, nymphal infection prevalence, and the rate of submitted infected nymphs. We assessed spatiotemporal patterns in tick-based measures and Lyme disease incidence with generalized linear and spatial models. In conjunction with land cover and household income data, we used generalized linear mixed effects models to examine the association between tick-based risk estimates and Lyme disease incidence. Between 2007 and 2017, the CAES-TTL received 26,116 I. scapularis tick submissions and the CDPH reported 23,423 Lyme disease cases. The rate of submitted nymphs, nymphal infection prevalence, the rate of submitted infected nymphs, and Lyme disease incidence all decreased over time during this eleven-year period. The rate of submitted nymphs, the rate of submitted infected nymphs, and Lyme disease incidence were spatially correlated, but nymphal infection prevalence was not. Using a mixed modeling approach to predict Lyme disease incidence and account for spatiotemporal structuring of the data, we found the best fitting tested model included a strong, positive association with the rate of submitted infected nymphs and a negative association with the percent of developed land for each county. We show that within counties, submissions of B. burgdorferi s.l. infected nymphs were strongly and positively associated with inter-annual variation in reported Lyme disease cases. Tick-based passive surveillance programs may be useful in providing independent measures of entomological risk, particularly in settings where Lyme disease case reporting practices change substantially over time.",2466,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Yet <5% of Lyme borreliosis cases are reported from outside the north-central and northeastern US. Geographical differences in nymphal questing (i.e., host-seeking behavior) may be epidemiologically important in explaining this latitudinal gradient in Lyme borreliosis incidence. Using field enclosures and a ‘common garden’ experimental design at two field sites, we directly tested this hypothesis by observing above-litter questing of laboratory-raised nymphal I. scapularis whose parents were collected from 15 locations (= origins) across the species' range. Relative to southern nymphs from origins considered to be of low acarologic risk, northern nymphs from high-risk origins were eight times as likely to quest on or above the surface of the leaf litter. This regional variation in vector behavior (specifically, the propensity of southern nymphs to remain under leaf litter) was highly correlated with Lyme borreliosis incidence in nymphs’ counties of origin. We conclude that nymphal host-seeking behavior is a key factor contributing to the low incidence of Lyme borreliosis in southern states. Expansion of northern I. scapularis populations could lead to increased incidence in southern states of Lyme borreliosis and other diseases vectored by this tick, if the ‘northern’ host-seeking behavior of immigrant nymphs is retained. Systematic surveillance for I. scapularis nymphs questing above the leaf litter in southern states will help predict future geographic change in I. scapularis -borne disease risk.",1736,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Knockdown of Salp12 in the salivary glands or passive immunization against Salp12 reduces acquisition of the spirochete by ticks but acquisition is not completely prevented.

Results of the present study demonstrate that the incidence of Lyme borreliosis is increasing in Lombardy and that environmental conditions are suitable for I. ricinus ticks infected with B. burgdorferi s.l.: citizens and health systems should be aware of Lyme borreliosis to reduce tick bites with personal protective behaviors and to avoid misdiagnosis, particularly within the area including the observed high-risk cluster.

Using a nationwide prospective cohort of patients with central nervous system infections, we identified all adults (≥ 18 years of age) treated for LNB at departments of infectious diseases in Denmark from 2015 through 2017. The database contains information on baseline demographics, history of tick bite, erythema migrans, clinical presentation, laboratory results of blood samples, and cerebrospinal (CSF) biochemistry ( e.g. specific Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) antibodies in serum, B. burgdorferi s.l. intrathecal antibody index) as well as antibiotic therapy. Outcome was assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and the presence of residual symptoms at follow-up one month after discharge. We included 194 LNB patients with a median age of 59 years (range 18–85 years, interquartile range [IQR] 47–69 years). The female-to-male ratio was 0.8. A total of 177 of 191 (93 %) of patients had early (second stage) LNB. A history of tick bite or erythema migrans was registered in 75 (39 %) and 49 (25 %) patients, respectively. The median duration of neurological symptoms before first hospital contact was 21 days (range 0–600 days, IQR 10–42 days). Predominant symptoms consisted of radicular pain in 135 of 194 (70 %), cranial nerve paresis in 88 of 194 (45 %), headache in 71 of 185 (38 %), and extremity paresis in 33 of 194 (17 %) patients. Serum- B. burgdorferi s.l. IgM and/or IgG antibodies were detectable in 166 of 181 (92 %) patients at the time of first CSF investigation. Median duration of antibiotic treatment was 14 days (range 10–35 days, IQR 14–21 days) and 59 (39 %) of the patients received intravenous ceftriaxone and/or benzylpenicillin G throughout treatment. At the 1-month follow-up, GOS was unfavorable (< 5) in 54 of 193 (28 %) patients. An unfavorable GOS score was more often registered in patients with ≥ 45 days of symptom duration (20 of 45 (44 %) vs. 34 of 145 (23 %); P = 0.006). In conclusion, a European cohort of adult patients with LNB diagnosed between 2015–2017 presented with classic symptoms and CSF findings. However, a substantial diagnostic delay was still observed. In disagreement with current guidelines, a substantial part of LNB patients were treated with antibiotics longer than 14 days and/or intravenously as route of administration.",2601,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This cohort-study investigated Danish patients (n = 2791) diagnosed with LNB (defined as a positive Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) intrathecal antibody test) between 1996–2015. We calculated incidence and incidence ratios of LNB by comparing 4-yr groups of calendar-years, area of residency, sex and age, income and education groups, and the number of new LNB cases per month. The incidence of LNB was 2.2 per 100,000 individuals and year in 1996−1999, 2.7 in 2004−2007 and 1.1 per 100,000 individuals in 2012−2015. Yearly variations in LNB incidence were similar for most calendar-year groups. LNB incidence was highest in Eastern Denmark and among males and individuals who were 0–14 yrs old, who had a yearly income of >449,000 DKK, and who had a Master’s degree or higher education. The number of LNB cases was highest from July to November (p < 0.001). In conclusion, based on Danish nationwide data of patients with positive B. burgdorferi s.l. intrathecal antibody index (1996–2015) the incidence of LNB was found to increase until 2004−2007 but thereafter to decline.

Here, we studied the spatio-temporal variation in annual Lyme disease cases in Virginia from 2001-2016 and modeled the disease with a spatio-temporal hierarchical Bayesian model. Using observed ecological and environmental covariates, we constructed a predictive model for the disease spread over space and time, including spatial and temporal random effects. We considered several different models and found that the negative binomial hurdle model performs the best for such epidemiological data. Among the various ecological predictors, the North-South (V component) of winds and relative humidity significantly contributed to predicting the Lyme cases.

Human pathogenic agents spread by I. ricinus in Sweden include Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) , Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Rickettsia helvetica, the recently described Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Borrelia miyamotoi , tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), and Babesia spp. ( Babesia microti, Babesia venatorum and Babesia divergens ). Since these pathogens share the same vector, co-infections with more than one tick-borne pathogen may occur and thus complicate the diagnosis and clinical management of the patient due to possibly altered symptomatology. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., TBEV and B. miyamotoi are well-known to cause infections of the central nervous system (CNS), whereas the abilities of other tick-borne pathogens to invade the CNS are largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and clinical impact of tick-borne pathogens other than B. burgdorferi s.l. in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples of patients who were under investigation for Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) in a tick-endemic region of South-eastern Sweden. CSF and serum samples from 600 patients, recruited from the Regions of Östergötland County, Jönköping County and Kalmar County in South-eastern Sweden and investigated for LNB during the period of 2009–2013, were retrospectively collected for analysis. The samples were analysed by real-time PCR for the presence of nucleic acid from B. burgdorferi s.l., B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum, Rickettsia spp. , N. mikurensis, TBEV and Babesia spp . Serological analyses were conducted in CSF and serum samples for all patients regarding B. burgdorferi s.l., and for the patients with CSF mononuclear pleocytosis, analyses of antibodies to B. miyamotoi, A. phagocytophilum , spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae, TBEV and B. microti in serum were performed. The medical charts of all the patients with CSF mononuclear pleocytosis and patients with positive PCR findings were reviewed. Of the 600 patients, 55 (9%) presented with CSF mononuclear pleocytosis, 13 (2%) of whom had Borrelia -specific antibodies in the CSF. One patient was PCR-positive for N. mikurensis , and another one was PCR-positive for Borrelia spp. in serum. No pathogens were detected by PCR in the CSF samples. Four patients had serum antibodies to B. miyamotoi , four patients to A. phagocytophilum , five patients to SFG rickettsiae, and six patients to TBEV. One patient, with antibodies to SFG rickettsiae, had both clinical and laboratory signs suggestive of a current infection. Nine patients had serum antibodies to more than one pathogen, although none of these was assessed as a current co-infection.

The relationship of the pajahuello tick ( Ornithodoros coriaceus ) to each of these bacterial zoonotic agents has not been reported. The primary bridging vector of both bacterial zoonotic agents to humans is the western black-legged tick ( Ixodes pacificus ). Because of the spatial and temporal overlap of D. occidentalis and O. coriaceus populations with those of I. pacificus in natural foci of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum in northwestern California, we conducted field and laboratory studies to determine if the Pacific Coast tick or the pajahuello tick potentially may serve as secondary vectors of either bacterium. Our findings reconfirmed that wild-caught D. occidentalis ticks are infected infrequently with B. burgdorferi or A. phagocytophilum , but some adult ticks from dense woodlands or chaparral were found to contain two important veterinary pathogens for the first time ( Anaplasma bovis , A. ovis ). The high prevalence of A. bovis infection (4.3%, n = 185 ticks) within chaparral-derived ticks suggests that D. occidentalis could be an efficient vector of this rickettsia. Experimental attempts to transmit borreliae or Anaplasma spp. that may have been present in >100 wild-caught D. occidentalis adults to naïve rabbits were unsuccessful. Anaplasma spp. were not detected in O. coriaceus , but one (4.3%) of 23 nymphs was infected with B . bissettii . This finding and an antecedent report of a B. burgdorferi -like spirochete from the same tick species demonstrate that O. coriaceus sometimes acquires and transstadially passes Lyme disease group spirochetes. I. pacificus nymphs inhabiting a woodland nidus of B. burgdorferi and A. phagocytophilum had a 5-fold higher prevalence of borreliae than adult ticks from the same generational cohort. In contrast to the results of preceding studies carried out at the same site, none of the nymphal or adult ticks was PCR-positive for A. phagocytophilum .

Ticks were found in all vegetation types sampled, including short grass close to car parks, but highest densities were consistently found in plots with trees present. Blankets picked up the greatest number of ticks, but heel flags provided important complementary counts of the immature stages in bracken plots; they showed clearly that the decline in tick numbers on blankets in early summer was due to the seasonal growth of vegetation that lifted the blanket clear of the typical questing height, but in reality ticks remained abundant through the summer. Leggings picked up only 11% of the total nymphs and 22% of total adults counted, but this still represented a significant hazard to humans. These results should prompt a greater awareness of the fine-scale distribution of this species in relation to human activities that determines the most likely zones of contact between humans and ticks.

In experiment 1, survival of 1760 nymphs was tested at −10 °C over a short period of time to simulate very cold winter conditions. In experiment 2, survival of 1600 nymphs was tested under cold condition (−5 °C) over a long period of time to simulate common winter conditions. Ticks used for survival tests at −5 °C were screened for Borrelia by quantitative PCR, and genospecies identification was achieved by reverse line blotting. Tick age and frequency of temperature variations had a highly significant effect on I. ricinus survival while Borrelia infection was marginally significant. Hence, survival rate was higher in younger (autumn) than older (spring) nymphs and in nymphs exposed to low rather than high-frequency temperature variations. Borrelia -infected ticks tended to survive better than their uninfected counterparts. These findings suggest that in nature (i) frequent temperature changes in winter threaten tick survival more importantly than very low temperatures, (ii) older (spring) ticks are less resistant to cold than younger (autumn) individuals, and (iii) Borrelia infection plays a marginal role in I. ricinus survival during winter conditions.",1496,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Ixodes ricinus is a common tick in Europe, transmitting tick-borne encephalitis, Lyme borreliosis, anaplasmosis, or babesiosis. Immunization of hosts with recombinant tick proteins has, in theory, the potential to interfere with tick feeding and block transmission of pathogens from the tick to the host. However, the efficacy of tick antigens has, to date, not been fully sufficient to achieve this. We have focused on 11 in silico identified genes encoding proteins potentially involved in tick iron and heme metabolism. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) expression profiling was carried out to preferentially target proteins that are up-regulated during the blood meal. RNA interference (RNAi) was then used to score the relative importance of these genes in tick physiology. Finally, we performed vaccination screens to test the suitability of these proteins as vaccine candidates. These newly identified tick antigens have the potential to improve the available anti-tick vaccines.",1073,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We performed a field survey to investigate people’s knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding ticks, tick-borne diseases, and prevention strategies. The KAP were assessed using a pre-validated anonymous questionnaire consisting of 39 questions and statements. On two consecutive days in July 2016, convenience sampling was used in the cities of Parainen and Kotka, located in high-risk areas of tick-borne diseases, particularly of TBE. In attitudes and practices sections, each question was scored and analysed with ordered logistic regression model. In total, 101 individuals responded. The TBE vaccination rate among respondents was 40%. The best known preventive measures were having vaccination against TBE (88%), and wearing long sleeves and pants against ticks (81%). Two-thirds incorrectly identified the ring-like rash as a symptom of TBE. Of all respondents, 78% could not exclude that TBE can be treated with antibiotics; 55% that vaccine protects against LB; and 46% that it protects against ticks. The minority (14%) believed tick repellents to be effective. Among preventive behaviour, the quick removal of an attached tick was most frequently applied (97%). Repellents were used by 21% when visiting tick-infested areas. Significant associations were found between the vaccination status and having a correct belief that the vaccine protects against TBE (P < 0.001) but not against ticks (P < 0.05), or LB (P < 0.001). KAP is a quick and easy tool to get a rough estimation on people’s awareness regarding ticks and tick-borne diseases. We identified gaps in knowledge and misbeliefs.

A total of 1774 Ixodes ricinus (50 females, 68 males, 840 nymphs and 818 larvae) were collected with flagging between March and September 2014 in a coniferous forest patch in Niederkaina near the town of Bautzen in Saxony, Germany. To measure questing tick density a time-based density estimating method was utilized. From each month, a total of 100 adults and nymphal ticks and all larvae (pools of 10 individuals per tube/month) were selected for the molecular analyses. For simultaneous detection of B. burgdorferi s.l. and B. miyamotoi a duplex real-time PCR targeting the fla B locus was performed. Prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. was 9.4% (female: 6%, male: 2.9%, nymph: 12.2%, larva: 0%) and minimum prevalence of B. miyamotoi was 1.2% (female: 0%, male: 4.3%, nymph: 2.8%, larva: 0.1%) in the 714 samples with real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Using next generation sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we examined the influence of host blood meal on the internal bacterial community within nymphal blacklegged ticks across host-seeking, feeding, blood meal digestion, and after molting into the adult stage. Results demonstrate bacterial community structuring across host and ticks with 287 taxa found exclusively in ticks, suggesting the field environment plays a significant role in shaping the internal tick microbiome. A decrease in bacterial diversity was noted from unfed nymphs through feeding/digestion and after molting into adults, suggesting that bacterial species are lost during the corresponding physiological changes. The similarity in biochemical pathways across the different tick categories suggests that the loss of bacterial taxa does not mirror a large change in microbial function.

We previously demonstrated that single nymphs of the blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis , can transmit B. miyamotoi to experimental hosts. However, two recent epidemiological studies from the Northeastern United States indicate that human cases of hard tick-borne relapsing fever peak during late summer, after the spring peak for nymphal tick activity but coincident with the peak seasonal activity period of larval ticks in the Northeast. These epidemiological findings, together with evidence that B. miyamotoi can be passed from infected I. scapularis females to their offspring, suggest that bites by transovarially-infected larval ticks can be an important source of human infection. To demonstrate experimentally that transovarially-infected larval I. scapularis ticks can transmit B. miyamotoi , outbred Mus musculus CD1 mice were exposed to 1 or 2 potentially infected larvae. Individual fed larvae and mouse blood taken 10 d after larvae attached were tested for presence of B. miyamotoi DNA, and mice also were examined for seroreactivity to B. miyamotoi 8 wk after tick feeding.

The province of New Brunswick, which borders jurisdictions with established populations of I. scapularis , constitutes a range expansion zone for this species. To better understand the current and potential future distribution of this tick under climate change projections, this study applied occupancy modelling to distributional records of adult ticks that successfully overwintered, obtained through passive surveillance. This study indicates that I. scapularis occurs throughout the southern-most portion of the province, in close proximity to coastlines and major waterways. Milder winter conditions, as indicated by the number of degree days <0 °C, was determined to be a strong predictor of tick occurrence, as was, to a lesser degree, rising levels of annual precipitation, leading to a final model with a predictive accuracy of 0.845 (range: 0.828–0.893). Both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate projections predict that a significant proportion of the province (roughly a quarter to a third) will be highly suitable for I. scapularis by the 2080s. Comparison with cases of canine infection show good spatial agreement with baseline model predictions, but the presence of canine Borrelia infections beyond the climate envelope, defined by the highest probabilities of tick occurrence, suggest the presence of Bbss-carrying ticks distributed by long-range dispersal events. This research demonstrates that predictive statistical modelling of multi-year surveillance information is an efficient way to identify areas where I. scapularis is most likely to occur, and can be used to guide subsequent active sampling efforts in order to better understand fine scale species distributional patterns.",1831,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In contrast to Lyme borreliae, B. miyamotoi can be transmitted vertically from infected female ticks to their progeny. Therefore, in addition to nymphs and adults, larvae can vector B. miyamotoi to wildlife and human hosts. Two widely varying filial infection prevalence (FIP) estimates - 6% and 73% - have been reported previously from two vertically infected larval clutches; to our knowledge, no other estimates of FIP or transovarial transmission (TOT) rates for B. miyamotoi have been described in the literature. Thus, we investigated TOT and FIP of larval clutches derived from engorged females collected from hunter-harvested white-tailed deer in 2015 (n = 664) and 2016 (n = 599) from Maine, New Hampshire, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. After engorged females oviposited in the lab, they (n = 492) were tested for B. miyamotoi infection by PCR.

Even though the overall observed vertical transmission rate (the product of TOT and FIP; 76.7%, 95% CI; 44.6–93.3%) was high, additional horizontal transmission may be required for enzootic maintenance of B. miyamotoi based on the results of a previously published deterministic model. Further investigation of TOT and FIP variability and the underlying mechanisms, both in nature and the laboratory, will be needed to resolve this question.

Seropositive IgG titers for at least one of the Babesia spp. was significantly more common (p < 0.05) in individuals seropositive for Borrelia (16.3%) compared to the healthy control group (2.5%). Our findings suggest that Babesia infections may indeed be quite common among individuals who have been exposed to tick bites. Furthermore, the results indicate that human babesiosis should be considered in patients that show relevant symptoms; particularly for splenectomized and other immunocompromised individuals. Finally, the data challenges current blood transfusion procedures and highlights the current lack of awareness of the parasite in northern Europe.",1462,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We detected several Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) genospecies ( B. afzelii , B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii , B. lusitaniae , B. valaisiana ) in I. ricinus and skin biopsies. The most common genospecies found in I. ricinus was B. valaisiana , while it was B. lusitaniae in tissues. Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae ( Rickettsia monacensis, R. slovaca and R . raoultii ) infected I. ricinus, D. marginatus and rodent tissues. Rickettsia slovaca was the Rickettsia species most frequently found in our samples. Coinfections by B. burgdorferi s.l. and SFG rickettsiae indicate an overlap of transmission cycles and potential risk for humans to be infected by multiple pathogens, resulting in more severe symptoms. The findings of B. lusitaniae and R. slovaca in bank voles, and of B. valaisiana in small rodents, open new questions about host-pathogen interactions. In addition, our results highlight the importance of small rodents as data sources for studying tick-borne pathogens.",1369,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Brangulis', 'affiliation': 'Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre, Riga, Latvia'}]",10.1016/j.ttbdis.2019.06.009,2019.0,6,Article,"The spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato is the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis – the most common tick-borne disease in Europe and the United States. Spirochetes are transmitted from infected Ixodes ticks to the mammalian host when the ticks feed. In general, the transfer process of the borreliae is quite complicated, as the environments in the tick and the new mammalian host differs significantly. Therefore, Borrelia changes the expression profile of dozens of proteins, mainly outer surface proteins, to adapt to the new tasks and needs in the new organism. In the transfer process from the tick to the mammalian host, spirochetes that cause Lyme disease show the strongest upregulation of members of paralogous gene family 54 (PFam54). PFam54 members encode 10 proteins, and BBA69 is one of its members. Although several PFam54 members play an important role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease, the exact function has been determined only for CspA, which binds complement regulator factor H (CFH) and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1); thus, CspA is essential to resist the vertebrate host’s immune response. In the current study, we determined the crystal structure of BBA69 at a 2.25 Ǻ resolution. The BBA69 structure revealed a seven α-helical BbCRASP-1 fold previously found only in PFam54 member proteins. Among the PFam54 members, BBA69 shares the highest sequence identity (61%) and 3-D similarity with CspA. Although none of the PFam54 members besides CspA bind CFH and FHL-1, in the current study, we investigated the structural differences accounting for the divergence in the functions of these proteins. The results clearly indicated that the C-terminal α-helix is the main determinant of this functional divergence. The results provide better insight into the PFam54 proteins that play an important role in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease.",1869,0,0,0,1,en,en,

However, less is known about colonization and pathology of Lyme borreliosis spirochaetes in their natural hosts. In the present study, we assessed the colonization and manifestations during B. afzelii infection in reservoir hosts (yellow-necked mouse, Apodemus flavicollis ; bank vole, Myodes glareolus ; common shrew, Sorex araneus ) infected in the wild. The infection prevalence and bacterial load was measured in skin (ear), joints and heart by quantitative PCR, and pathology in infected joints was evaluated by histology. The prevalence of B. afzelii was higher in skin than in joints and heart, but most animals that were positive in skin were also positive in internal tissues, and there was no difference between species in tissue-specific prevalence. Thus, spirochaetes disseminated from skin to other tissues in a similar way in all species. The bacterial load varied among host species and among different tissues within the same host species. In the case of skin and joints, bank voles and common shrews had higher bacterial loads than yellow-necked mice. In hearts, voles had higher bacterial loads than shrews and mice. Histological analyses showed no inflammation in joints of infected animals when compared to controls. We conclude that B. afzelii disseminates to internal tissues in natural hosts, but that levels of colonization vary between both species and tissues. There is as yet little evidence for pathological effects in natural hosts.",1670,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In recent years, a marked increase in tick abundance has been observed in several Alpine valleys, together with more frequent reports of Lyme borreliosis. We then carried out a four-year study to assess the distribution and abundance of ticks and transmitted pathogens and determine their altitudinal limit in a natural park area in Piedmont region. Ixodes ricinus and Dermacentor marginatus were collected from both the vegetation and hunted wild ungulates. Tick abundance was significantly associated with altitude, habitat type and signs of animal presence, roe deer’s in particular. Ixodes ricinus prevailed in distribution and abundance and, although their numbers decreased with increasing altitude, we recorded the presence of all active life stages of up to around 1700 m a.s.l., with conifers as the second most infested habitat after deciduous woods. Molecular analyses demonstrated the infection of questing I. ricinus nymphs with B. burgdorferi sensu lato (15.5 %), Rickettsia helvetica and R. monacensis (20.7 %), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (1.9 %), Borrelia miyamotoi (0.5 %) and Neoehrlichia mikurensis (0.5 %). One third of the questing D. marginatus were infected with R. slovaca. We observed a spatial aggregation of study sites infested by B. burgdorferi s.l. infected ticks below 1400 m. Borrelia -infected nymphs prevailed in open areas, while SFG rickettsiae prevalence was higher in coniferous and deciduous woods. Interestingly, prevalence of SFG rickettsiae in ticks doubled above 1400 m, and R. helvetica was the only pathogen detected above 1800 m a.s.l. Tick infestation on hunted wild ungulates indicated the persistence of tick activity during winter months and, when compared to past studies, confirmed the recent spread of I. ricinus in the area. Our study provides new insights into the population dynamics of ticks in the Alps and confirms a further expansion of ticks to higher altitudes in Europe. We underline the importance of adopting a multidisciplinary approach in order to develop effective strategies for the surveillance of tick-borne diseases, and inform the public about the hazard posed by ticks, especially in recently invaded areas.",2262,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Sequencing of a DNA library constructed from circular plasmid fragments enabled assembly of a composite DNA sequence that is homologous to the cp32 plasmid family of the Lyme disease spirochete, B. burgdorferi . Analysis of another relapsing fever bacterium, B. parkeri , indicated that it contains linear homologs of the B. hermsii and B. burgdorferi cp32 plasmids. The B. hermsii cp32 plasmids encode homologs of the B. burgdorferi Mlp and Bdr antigenic proteins and BlyA/BlyB putative hemolysins, but homologs of B. burgdorferi erp genes were absent. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that relapsing fever patients produced antibodies to Mlp proteins, indicating that those proteins are synthesized by the spirochetes during human infection. Conservation of cp32-encoded genes in different Borrelia species suggests that their protein products serve functions essential to both relapsing fever and Lyme disease spirochetes.

For example, molecular mimicry between a dominant T-cell epitope of B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A and an adhesion molecule, human lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1), has been implicated in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis. Using immunohistochemical methods, we examined synovial samples for expression of adhesion molecules in 29 patients with treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis and in 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or chronic inflammatory monoarthritis. In Lyme arthritis synovia, endothelial cells showed intense expression of P-selectin and vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1). Expression of LFA-1 was also intense on infiltrating cells, particularly in lymphoid aggregates, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was markedly expressed on synovial lining and endothelial and infiltrating cells. Moderate expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) was seen on synovial lining and endothelial cells, and mild expression of its ligand, very late antigen-4, was apparent in perivascular lymphoid infiltrates. Except for lesser expression of VCAM-1 in Lyme synovia, the levels of expression of these adhesion molecules were similar in the three patient groups. We conclude that certain adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1 and LFA-1, are expressed intensely in the synovia of patients with Lyme arthritis. Upregulation of LFA-1 on lymphocytes in this lesion may be critical in the pathogenesis of treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis.",1698,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In this study, we determined the immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses to this spirochetal protein in single serum samples from 124 antibiotic-treated human patients with early or late manifestations of Lyme disease and in serial serum samples from 20 historic, untreated patients who were followed longitudinally from early infection through the period of arthritis. These 20 patients were representative of the spectrum of the severity and duration of Lyme arthritis. Among the 124 antibiotic-treated patients, 53% with culture-proven erythema migrans (EM) had IgG responses to recombinant glutathione S -transferase (GST)-Arp, as did 59% of the patients with facial palsy and 68% of those with Lyme arthritis. In addition, 75 to 80% of the 20 past, untreated patients had reactivity with this protein when EM was present, during initial episodes of joint pain, or during the maximal period of arthritis. There was no association at any of these three time points between GST-Arp antibody levels and the severity of the maximal attack of arthritis or the total duration of arthritis. Thus, after the first several weeks of infection, 60 to 80% of patients had IgG antibody responses to GST-Arp, but this response did not correlate with the severity or duration of Lyme arthritis.",1521,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A prominent difference between arthritis and carditis is the differential representation of phagocytes in these lesions: polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are more prevalent in the joint, and macrophages predominate in the heart lesion. We have previously shown differential efficiency of B. burgdorferi clearance by PMN and macrophages, and we now investigate whether these functional differences at the cellular level may contribute to the observed differences in organ-specific pathogenesis. When we infected mice lacking the neutrophil chemokine receptor (CXCR2 −/− mice) with spirochetes, we detected fewer PMN in joints and less-severe arthritis. Here we have investigated the effects of the absence of the macrophage chemokine receptor CCR2 on the development and resolution of Lyme carditis in resistant (C57BL/6J [B6]) and sensitive (C3H/HeJ [C3H]) strains of mice. In B6 CCR2 −/− mice, although inflammation in hearts is mild, we detected an increased burden of B. burgdorferi compared to that in wild-type (WT) mice, suggesting reduced clearance in the absence of macrophages. In contrast, C3H CCR2 −/− mice have severe inflammation but a decreased B. burgdorferi burden compared to that in WT C3H mice both at peak disease and during resolution. Histopathologic examination of infected hearts revealed that infected C3H CCR2 −/− animals have an increased presence of PMN, suggesting compensatory mechanisms of B. burgdorferi clearance in the hearts of infected C3H CCR2 −/− mice. The more efficient clearance of B. burgdorferi from hearts by CCR2 −/− versus WT C3H mice suggests a natural defect in the recruitment or function of macrophages in C3H mice, which may contribute to the sensitivity of this strain to B. burgdorferi infection.",1892,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Microglia, the resident macrophage cells within the central nervous system (CNS), are important in initiating an immune response to microbial products. In addition, astrocytes, the major CNS glial cell type, also can contribute to brain inflammation. TLRs (Toll-like receptors) are used by glial cells to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), mediate innate responses, and initiate an acquired immune response. Here we hypothesize that because of their PAMP specificities, TLR1, -2, -5, and -9 may be involved in the pathogenesis of Lyme neuroborreliosis. Previous reports have shown that the rhesus monkey is the only animal model to exhibit signs of Lyme neuroborreliosis. Therefore, we used primary cultures of rhesus astrocytes and microglia to determine the role of TLRs in mediating proinflammatory responses to B. burgdorferi . The results indicate that microglia and astrocytes respond to B. burgdorferi through TLR1/2 and TLR5. In addition, we observed that phagocytosis of B. burgdorferi by microglia enhances not only the expression of TLR1, -2, and -5, but also that of TLR4. Taken together, our data provide proof of the concept that astrocyte and microglial TLR1, -2, and -5 are involved in the in vivo response of primate glial cells to B. burgdorferi . The proinflammatory molecules elicited by these TLR-mediated responses could be a significant factor in the pathogenesis of Lyme neuroborreliosis.",1571,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Binding of FH/FHL-1 by the B. burgdorferi proteins CspA and the OspE-related proteins is thought to enhance resistance to serum-mediated killing. While previous reports have shown that CspA confers serum resistance in B. burgdorferi , it is unclear whether the OspE-related proteins are relevant in B. burgdorferi serum resistance when OspE is expressed on the borrelial surface. To assess the role of the OspE-related proteins, we overexpressed them in a serum-sensitive CspA mutant strain. OspE overexpression enhanced serum resistance of the CspA-deficient organisms. Furthermore, FH was more efficiently bound to the B. burgdorferi surface when OspE was overexpressed. Deposition of complement components C3 and C5b-9 (the membrane attack complex), however, was reduced on the surface of the OspE-overexpressing strain compared to that on the CspA mutant strain. These data demonstrate that OspE proteins expressed on the surface of B. burgdorferi bind FH and protect the organism from complement deposition and subsequent serum-mediated destruction.",1188,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Deletion of two such outer surface proteins, decorin-binding proteins A and B (DbpA/B), has been documented to decrease infectivity, impede early dissemination, and, possibly, prevent persistence. In this study, DbpA/B-deficient spirochetes were confirmed to exhibit an early dissemination defect in immunocompetent, but not immunodeficient, mice, and the defect was found to resolve with chronicity. Development of disease (arthritis and carditis) was attenuated only in the early stage of infection with DbpA/B-deficient spirochetes in both types of mice. Persistence of the DbpA/B-deficient spirochetes occurred in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice in a manner indistinguishable from that of wild-type spirochetes. Dissemination through the lymphatic system was evaluated as an underlying mechanism for the early dissemination defect. At 12 h, 3 days, 7 days, and 14 days postinoculation, DbpA/B-deficient spirochetes were significantly less prevalent and in lower numbers in lymph nodes than wild-type spirochetes. However, in immunodeficient mice, deficiency of DbpA/B did not significantly decrease the prevalence or spirochete numbers in lymph nodes. Complementation of DbpA/B restored a wild-type phenotype. Thus, the results indicated that deficiency of DbpA/B allows the acquired immune response to restrict early dissemination of spirochetes, which appears to be at least partially mediated through the lymphatic system.",1725,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Recent increases in the number of LD cases, in addition to the spread of the tick vector and a lack of a vaccine, highlight an urgent need for designing and developing an efficacious LD vaccine. Identification of protective epitopes that could be used to develop a second-generation (subunit) vaccine is therefore imperative. Despite the antigenicity of several lipoproteins and integral outer membrane proteins (OMPs) on the B. burgdorferi surface, the spirochetes successfully evade antibodies primarily due to the VlsE-mediated antigenic variation. VlsE is thought to sterically block antibody access to protective epitopes of B. burgdorferi . However, it is highly unlikely that VlsE shields the entire surface epitome. Thus, identification of subdominant epitope targets that induce protection when they are made dominant is necessary to generate an efficacious vaccine. Toward the identification, we repeatedly immunized immunocompetent mice with live-attenuated VlsE-deleted B. burgdorferi and then challenged the animals with the VlsE-expressing (host-adapted) wild type. Passive immunization and Western blotting data suggested that the protection of 50% of repeatedly immunized animals against the highly immune-evasive B. burgdorferi was antibody mediated. Comparison of serum antibody repertoires identified in protected and nonprotected animals permitted the identification of several putative epitopes significantly associated with the protection. Most linear putative epitopes were conserved between the main pathogenic Borrelia genospecies and found within known subdominant regions of OMPs. Currently, we are performing immunization studies to test whether the identified protection-associated epitopes are protective for mice.",1885,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Mutants lacking bb0086 had no apparent in vitro growth defect but were incapable of colonizing immunocompetent C3H/HeN or immunodeficient SCID mice. Immunoblot analysis revealed reduced levels of proteins critical for the adaptation of B. burgdorferi to the mammalian host, such as OspC, DbpA, and BBK32. Both RpoS and BosR, key regulators of gene expression in B. burgdorferi , were downregulated in the bb0086 mutants. Therefore, we designated BB0086 the B orrelia host ad aptation p rotein (BadP). Unlike badP mutants, the control strains established infection in C3H/HeN mice at 4 days postinfection, indicating an early colonization defect in mutants due to reduced levels of the lipoproteins/regulators critical for initial stages of infection. However, badP mutants survived within dialysis membrane chambers (DMCs) implanted within the rat peritoneal cavity but, unlike the control strains, did not display complete switching of OspA to OspC, suggesting incomplete adaptation to the mammalian phase of infection. These findings have opened a novel regulatory mechanism which impacts the virulence potential of B . burgdorferi .",1802,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The ability to persist and evade host immune clearance poses a challenge to effective antimicrobial treatment. A link between therapy failure and the presence of persister cells has started to emerge. There is growing experimental evidence that viable but noncultivable spirochetes persist following treatment with several different antimicrobial agents. The current study utilized the mouse model to evaluate if persistence occurs following antimicrobial treatment in disease-susceptible (C3H/HeJ [C3H]) and disease-resistant (C57BL/6 [B6]) mouse strains infected with B. burgdorferi strains N40 and B31 and to confirm the generality of this phenomenon, as well as to assess the persisters’ clinical relevance. The status of infection was evaluated at 12 and 18 months after treatment. The results demonstrated that persistent spirochetes remain viable for up to 18 months following treatment, as well as being noncultivable. The phenomenon of persistence in disease-susceptible C3H mice is equally evident in disease-resistant B6 mice and not unique to any particular B. burgdorferi strain. The results also demonstrate that, following antimicrobial treatment, both strains of B. burgdorferi , N40 and B31, lose one or more plasmids. The study demonstrated that noncultivable spirochetes can persist in a host following antimicrobial treatment for a long time but did not demonstrate their clinical relevance in a mouse model of chronic infection. The clinical relevance of persistent spirochetes beyond 18 months following antimicrobial treatment requires further studies in other animal models.",1763,0,0,1,0,en,en,

B. burgdorferi enters the skin, disseminates via the bloodstream, and infects various distal tissues, leading to inflammatory sequelae, such as Lyme arthritis and Lyme carditis. B. burgdorferi linear plasmid 36 (lp36) is critical for mammalian infectivity; however, the full complement of genes on lp36 that contribute to this process remains unknown. Through a targeted mutagenesis screen of the genes on lp36, we identified a novel infectivity gene of unknown function, bbk13 , which encodes an immunogenic, non-surface-exposed membrane protein that is important for efficient mammalian infection. Loss of bbk13 resulted in reduced spirochete loads in distal tissues in a mouse model of infection. Through a detailed analysis of B. burgdorferi infection kinetics, we discovered that bbk13 is important for promoting spirochete proliferation in the skin inoculation site. The attenuated ability of Δ bbk13 spirochetes to proliferate in the inoculation site was followed by reduced numbers of B. burgdorferi spirochetes in the bloodstream and, ultimately, consistently reduced spirochete loads in distal tissues. Together, our data indicate that bbk13 contributes to disseminated infection by promoting spirochete proliferation in the early phase of infection in the skin. This work not only increases the understanding of the contribution of the genes on lp36 to B. burgdorferi infection but also begins to define the genetic basis for B. burgdorferi expansion in the skin during localized infection and highlights the influence of the early expansion of spirochetes in the skin on the outcome of infection.",1723,0,0,1,0,en,en,

No vaccine is available for humans. Dogmatically, B. burgdorferi can establish a persistent infection in the mammalian host (e.g., mice) due to a surface antigen, VlsE. This antigenically variable protein allows the spirochete to continually evade borreliacidal antibodies. However, our recent study has shown that the B. burgdorferi spirochete is effectively cleared by anti- B. burgdorferi antibodies of New Zealand White rabbits, despite the surface expression of VlsE. Besides homologous protection, the rabbit antibodies also cross-protect against heterologous B. burgdorferi spirochetes and significantly reduce the pathology of LD arthritis in persistently infected mice. Thus, this finding that NZW rabbits develop a unique repertoire of very potent antibodies targeting the protective surface epitopes, despite abundant VlsE, prompted us to identify the specificities of the protective rabbit antibodies and their respective targets. By applying subtractive reverse vaccinology, which involved the use of random peptide phage display libraries coupled with next-generation sequencing and our computational algorithms, repertoires of nonprotective (early) and protective (late) rabbit antibodies were identified and directly compared. Consequently, putative surface epitopes that are unique to the protective rabbit sera were mapped. Importantly, the relevance of newly identified protection-associated epitopes for their surface exposure has been strongly supported by prior empirical studies. This study is significant because it now allows us to systematically test the putative epitopes for their protective efficacy with an ultimate goal of selecting the most efficacious targets for development of a long-awaited LD vaccine.",1869,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This is the first demonstration of protective immunogenicity induced by OMV. While immunization with OspA and avirulent B31 OMV provided far less protection against this challenge, rabbits with infection-derived immunity were completely protected. Protection against host-adapted B. burgdorferi was assessed by implantation of skin biopsies taken from rabbit erythema migrans (a uniquely rich source of B. burgdorferi in vertebrate tissue) containing up to 10 8 spirochetes. While all of the OMV- and OspA-immunized rabbits were fully susceptible to skin and disseminated infection, rabbits with infection-derived immunity were completely protected.

Our study revealed that the expression of each of the remaining stationary-phase-upregulated proteins, P35 included, was also influenced by culture temperature; these proteins were selectively expressed at 34°C but not at 24°C. Significantly, the expression of a majority of these proteins was also affected by culture pH, since they were abundantly expressed at pH 7.0 (resembling the tick midgut pH of 6.8 during feeding) but only sparsely at pH 8.0 (a condition closer to that of the unfed tick midgut pH of 7.4). We propose that this group of B. burgdorferi proteins, which in culture is selectively expressed under conditions of 34°C and pH 7.0, may be induced in the tick midgut during the feeding event.

An immunofluorescence assay, immunoelectron microscopy, and protease sensitivity assays indicated that P13 is surface exposed. The deduced sequence of the P13 peptide revealed a possible signal peptidase type I cleavage site, and computer analysis predicted that P13 is an integral membrane protein with three transmembrane-spanning domains. Mass spectrometry, in vitro translation, and N- and C-terminal amino acid sequencing analyses indicated that P13 was posttranslationally processed at both ends and modified by an unknown mechanism. Furthermore, p13 belongs to a gene family with five additional members in B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. The p13 gene is located on the linear chromosome of the bacterium, in contrast to five paralogous genes, which are located on extrachromosomal plasmids.

Here, we investigated conditions for site-directed mutagenesis in B31 MI, the low-passage-number, infectious B. burgdorferi strain whose genome was sequenced. We inactivated several plasmid and chromosomal genes in B31 MI and determined that clones carrying these mutations were not infectious for mice. However, we found extensive heterogeneity among clones and mutants derived from B31 MI based on colony phenotype, growth rate, plasmid content, protein profile, and transformability. Significantly, several B31 MI clones that were not subjected to mutagenesis but that lacked particular plasmids also exhibited defects at various stages in the infectious cycle. Therefore, the high degree of clonal polymorphism within B31 MI complicates the assessment of the contributions of individual genes to the observed phenotypes of the mutants. Our results indicate that B31 MI is not an appropriate strain background for genetic studies in infectious B. burgdorferi , and a well-defined isogenic clone is a prerequisite for targeted mutagenesis. To this end, we derived several wild-type clones from B31 MI that were infectious for mice, and gene inactivation was successful in one of these clones.

Thus, we tested whether cholesterol is required for E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum . Using a freeze fracture technique and biochemical analysis, these bacteria were found to contain significant levels of membrane cholesterol. These bacteria lack genes for cholesterol biosynthesis or modification. However, host cell-free bacteria had the ability to take up directly exogenous cholesterol or NBD-cholesterol, a fluorescent cholesterol derivative. Treatment of the bacteria with cholesterol extraction reagent methyl-β-cyclodextrin caused their ultrastructural changes. Furthermore, pretreatment of the bacteria with methyl-β-cyclodextrin or NBD-cholesterol deprived these bacteria of the ability to infect leukocytes, thus killing these obligate intracellular bacteria. Analysis of E. chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum genome sequences revealed that these bacteria lack all genes for the biosynthesis of lipid A and most genes for the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan, which confer structural strength to gram-negative bacteria.

The BCESM was present on a 31.7-kb low-GC-content island that encoded 35 predicted coding sequences (CDSs): an N -acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase gene ( cciI ) and corresponding transcriptional regulator ( cciR ), representing the first time cell signaling genes have been found on a genomic island; fatty acid biosynthesis genes; an IS 66 family transposase; transcriptional regulator CDSs; amino acid metabolism genes; and a group of hypothetical genes.

Vtp may be critical for successful tick transmission of B. hermsii ; however, the gene encoding this protein has been described previously in only one isolate. Here we identified and sequenced the vtp gene in 31 isolates of B. hermsii collected over 40 years from localities throughout much of its known geographic distribution. Seven major Vtp types were found. Little or no sequence variation existed within types, but between them significant variation was observed, similar to the pattern of diversity described for the outer surface protein C (OspC) gene in Lyme disease spirochetes. The pattern of sequence relatedness among the Vtp types was incongruent in two branches compared to two genomic groups identified among the isolates by multilocus sequence typing of the 16S rRNA , flaB , gyrB , and glpQ genes. Therefore, both horizontal transfer and recombination within and between the two genomic groups were responsible for some of the variation observed in the vtp gene.

Comparative transcriptional profiling of two representative clinical isolates with distinct genotypes (BL206 and B356) was undertaken. A total of 78 open reading frames (ORFs) had expression levels that differed significantly between the two isolates. A number of genes with potential involvement in nutrient uptake (BB0603, BBA74, BB0329, BB0330, and BBB29) have significantly higher expression levels in isolate B356. Moreover, nearly 25% of the differentially expressed genes are predicted to be localized on the cell surface, implying that these two isolates have cell surface properties that differ considerably. One of these genes, BBA74, encodes a protein of 257 amino acid residues that has been shown to possess porin activity. BBA74 transcript level was >20-fold higher in B356 than in BL206, and strain B356 contained three- to fivefold more BBA74 protein. BBA74 was disrupted by the insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette into the coding region. The growth rates of both wild-type and mutant strains were essentially identical, and cultures reached the same final cell densities. However, the mutant strains consistently showed prolonged lags of 2 to 5 days prior to the induction of log-phase growth compared to wild-type strains. It is tempting to speculate that the absence of BBA74 interferes with the enhanced nutrient uptake that may be required for the entry of cells into log-phase growth. These studies demonstrate the value of comparative transcriptional profiling for identifying differences in the transcriptomes of B. burgdorferi clinical isolates that may provide clues to pathogenesis.

We utilized multiple two-dimensional gel techniques combined with proteomics to reveal the full humoral immune response of mice and Lyme patients to membrane-associated proteins isolated from Borrelia burgdorferi . Our studies indicated that a subset of immunogenic membrane-associated proteins (some new and some previously identified) was recognized by mice experimentally infected with Borrelia burgdorferi either by low-dose needle inoculation or by tick infestation. Moreover, the majority of these immunogenic membrane-associated proteins were recognized by sera from patients diagnosed with early-disseminated Lyme disease. These included RevA, ErpA, ErpP, DbpA, BmpA, FtsZ, ErpB, LA7, OppA I, OppA II, OppA IV, FlhF, BBA64, BBA66, and BB0323. Some immunogens (i.e., BBI36/38) were more reactive with sera from mice than Lyme patients, while additional membrane proteins (i.e., FlaB, P66, LA7, and Hsp90) were recognized more strongly with sera from patients diagnosed with early-localized, early-disseminated, or late (chronic)-stage Lyme disease. We were able to examine the humoral response in Lyme patients in a temporal fashion and to identify the majority of immunoreactive proteins as the disease progresses from early to late stages.

The disease is divided into two forms, i.e., epidemic relapsing fever, caused by Borrelia recurrentis and transmitted by lice, and the endemic form, caused by several Borrelia species, such as B. duttonii , and transmitted by soft-bodied ticks. The spirochetes enter the bloodstream by the vector bite and live persistently in plasma even after the development of specific antibodies. This leads to fever relapses and high mortality and clearly indicates that the Borrelia organisms utilize effective immune evasion strategies. In this study, we show that the epidemic relapsing fever pathogen B. recurrentis and an endemic relapsing fever pathogen, B. duttonii , are serum resistant, i.e., resistant to complement in vitro. They acquire the host alternative complement pathway regulator factor H on their surfaces in a similar way to that of the less serum-resistant Lyme disease pathogen, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto. More importantly, the relapsing fever spirochetes specifically bind host C4b-binding protein, a major regulator of the antibody-mediated classical complement pathway. Both complement regulators retained their functional activities when bound to the surfaces of the spirochetes.

The only difference between isogenic serotypes is the variable major outer membrane lipoprotein. In the absence of specific antibody, established serotypes cause persistent infection. Studies in our laboratory indicate that another consequence of serotype switching in RF is a change in neuroinvasiveness. As the next step to elucidate this phenomenon, we studied the interaction of the neurotropic Oz1 strain of the RF agent Borrelia turicatae with the cerebral microcirculation. During persistent infection of antibody-deficient mice, we found that serotype 1 entered the brain in larger numbers and caused more severe cerebral microgliosis than isogenic serotype 2. Microscopic examination revealed binding of B. turicatae to brain microvascular endothelial cells in vivo. In vitro we found that B. turicatae associated with brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMEC) significantly more than with fibroblasts or arachnoidal cells. The binding was completely eliminated by pretreatment of BMEC with proteinase K. Using transwell chambers with BMEC barriers, we found that serotype 1 crossed into the lower compartment significantly better than serotype 2.

The specific contribution of these signaling pathways to the response of phagocytic cells to the spirochete and the molecular mechanisms underlying this response remain unresolved. We now show that p38 MAP kinase activity regulates the transcriptional activation of NF-κB in response to spirochetal lysate stimulation of phagocytic cells. The regulation occurs at the nuclear level and is independent of the translocation of the transcription factor to the nucleus or its capacity to bind to specific DNA target sequences. In RAW264.7 cells, p38α MAP kinase regulates the phosphorylation of NF-κB RelA. p38 MAP kinase phosphorylates the nuclear kinase mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 in turn phosphorylates the transcriptionally active subunit of NF-κB, RelA. The repression of MSK1 expression with small interfering RNA results in reduced RelA phosphorylation and a significant decrease in the production of TNF-α in response to B. burgdorferi lysates. Overall, these results clarify the contribution of the signaling pathways that are activated in response to the interaction of spirochetes with phagocytic cells to TNF-α production.

High levels of CXCL13 were present in the CSF of NB patients. It has not been clear, however, whether high CSF CXCL13 titers are specific for NB or are a characteristic of other spirochetal diseases as well. Furthermore, the mechanisms leading to the observed CXCL13 expression have not been identified yet. Here we describe similarly elevated CSF CXCL13 levels in patients with neurosyphilis, while pneumococcal meningitis patient CSF do not have high CXCL13 levels. In parallel, challenge of human monocytes in vitro with two of the spirochetal causative organisms, Borrelia garinii (the Borrelia species most frequently found in NB patients) and Treponema pallidum , but not challenge with pneumococci, induced CXCL13 release. This finding implies that a common spirochetal motif is a CXCL13 inducer. Accordingly, we found that the lipid moiety N -palmitoyl- S -(bis[palmitoyloxy]propyl)cystein (Pam 3 C) (three palmitoyl residues bound to N-terminal cysteine) of the spirochetal lipoproteins is critical for the CXCL13 induction in monocytes. As the Pam 3 C motif is known to signal via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and an anti-TLR2 monoclonal antibody blocked CXCL13 production of human monocytes incubated with B. garinii , this suggests that TLR2 is a major mediator of Borrelia -induced secretion of CXCL13 from human monocytes.",1527,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The lp-28-1 − isolate and a wild-type (wt) isolate bearing the complete set of plasmids were grown in dialysis membrane chambers that were implanted into rat peritoneal cavities. Analysis of mRNA and protein from these cultures showed that OspC expression levels by lp28-1 − organisms are abnormally high in vivo. A time course analysis of ospC expression in tissues following infection indicates also that temporal diminution of the dominant antigen OspC is impaired in lp28-1 − spirochetes. Finally, passive transfer of monoclonal OspC-specific antibody into SCID mice 8 days postinfection cleared lp28-1 − spirochetes, yet the wt organisms persisted in a majority of animals. These findings indicate that incomplete repression of OspC by lp28-1 − organisms renders them susceptible to immune-mediated clearance.

These experiments demonstrate that mammalian host-adapted spirochetes can infect and disseminate in mice in the absence of OspC, thereby circumventing this hallmark of tick-derived or in vitro-grown spirochetes. We propose a model in which OspC is one of a succession of functionally equivalent, essential proteins that are synthesized at different stages of mammalian infection. In this model, another protein uniquely present on host-adapted spirochetes performs the same essential function initially fulfilled by OspC.

Phagocytosis and intracellular processing of Borrelia by these cells is thus decisive for the eventual outcome of infection. Phagocytic uptake of Borrelia by macrophages proceeds preferentially through coiling phagocytosis, which is characterized by actin-rich unilateral pseudopods that capture and enwrap spirochetes. Actin-dependent growth of these pseudopods necessitates de novo nucleation of actin filaments, which is regulated by actin-nucleating factors such as Arp2/3 complex.

Conversely, a decrease of intracellular Mn 2+ by deletion of the Mn 2+ transporter gene, bmtA , resulted in elevated levels of RpoS and OspC. Mn 2+ affected RpoS through BosR, a Fur family homolog that is required for rpoS expression: elevated intracellular Mn 2+ levels greatly reduced the level of BosR protein but not the level of bosR mRNA. Thus, Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ appeared to be important in modulation of the RpoS pathway that is essential to the life cycle of the Lyme disease spirochete. This finding supports the emerging notion that transition metals such as Mn 2+ and Zn 2+ play a critical role in regulation of virulence in bacteria.",1554,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The BBA66-deficient mutant isolate, Bb ΔA66 , remained infectious in mice by needle inoculation of cultured organisms, but differences in spirochete burden and pathology in the tibiotarsal joint were observed relative to the parental wild-type (WT) strain. Ixodes scapularis larvae successfully acquired Bb ΔA66 following feeding on infected mice, and the organisms persisted in these ticks through the molt to nymphs. A series of tick transmission experiments ( n = 7) demonstrated that the ability of Bb ΔA66 -infected nymphs to infect laboratory mice was significantly impaired compared to that of mice fed upon by WT-infected ticks. trans -complementation of Bb ΔA66 with an intact copy of bba66 restored the WT infectious phenotype in mice via tick transmission.

However, the functional roles of PEP-PTS and AC in the infectious cycle of Borrelia have not been characterized previously. We examined 12 PEP-PTS transporter component mutants by needle inoculation of mice to assess their ability to cause mouse infection. Transposon mutants with mutations in the EIIBC components ( ptsG ) (BB0645, thought to be involved in glucose-specific transport) were unable to cause infection in mice, while all other tested PEP-PTS mutants retained infectivity. Infectivity was partially restored in an in trans -complemented strain of the ptsG mutant. While the ptsG mutant survived normally in unfed as well as fed ticks, it was unable to cause infection in mice by tick transmission, suggesting that the function of ptsG is essential to establish infection by either needle inoculation or tick transmission. In Gram-negative organisms, the regulatory effects of the PEP-PTS are mediated by adenylate cyclase and cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels. A recombinant protein encoded by B. burgdorferi BB0723 (a putative cyaB homolog) was shown to have adenylate cyclase activity in vitro ; however, mutants with mutations in this gene were fully infectious in the tick-mouse infection cycle, indicating that its function is not required in this process. By transcriptome analysis, we demonstrated that the ptsG gene may directly or indirectly modulate gene expression of Borrelia burgdorferi .

Successful infection relies on the ability of this extracellular pathogen to persist and colonize different tissues. B. burgdorferi encodes a large number of adhesins that are able to interact with host ligands to facilitate adherence and tissue colonization. Multiple glycosaminoglycan binding proteins present in B. burgdorferi offer a degree of redundancy of function during infection, and this highlights the importance of glycosaminoglycans as host cell receptors for spirochete adherence. Of particular interest in this study is Borrelia glycosaminoglycan binding protein (Bgp), which binds to heparin-related glycosaminoglycans. The properties of a bgp transposon mutant and a trans -complemented derivative were compared to those of the wild-type B. burgdorferi in the in vitro binding assays and in infection studies using a C3H/HeJ mouse infection model. We determined that the loss of Bgp impairs spirochete adherence, infectivity, and tissue colonization, resulting in a reduction of inflammatory manifestations of Lyme disease.

Borrelia afzelii spirochetes are present in murine skin within 1 day of tick attachment. In contrast, spirochetes were not detectable in salivary glands at any stage of tick feeding. Further experiments demonstrated that tick saliva is not essential for B. afzelii infectivity, the most important requirement for successful host colonization being a change in expression of outer surface proteins that occurs in the tick gut during feeding. Spirochetes in vertebrate mode are then able to survive within the host even in the absence of tick saliva.

The qualitative manipulation hypothesis suggests that vector-borne pathogens can resolve this conflict in their favour by manipulating the host choice behaviour of the arthropod vector. Methods. European Lyme disease is a model system for studying this conflict because Ixodes ricinus is a generalist tick species that vectors Borrelia pathogens that are specialized on different classes of vertebrate hosts. Avian specialists like B. garinii cannot survive in rodent reservoir hosts and vice versa for rodent specialists like B. afzelii . The present study tested whether Borrelia genospecies influenced the attraction of field-collected I. ricinus nymphs to rodent odours. Results.

The aim of this study was to investigate the natural cycle of B. miyamotoi and B. burgdorferi s.l. in a forest habitat with intensive hunting, forestry work and recreational activity in Southern Hungary. Methods. We collected rodents with modified Sherman-traps during 2010–2013 and questing ticks with flagging in 2012. Small mammals were euthanized, tissue samples were collected and all ectoparasites were removed and stored. Samples were screened for pathogens with multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) targeting a part of flagellin gene, then analysed with conventional PCRs and sequencing. Results. 177 spleen and 348 skin samples of six rodent species were individually analysed. Prevalence in rodent tissue samples was 0.2 % (skin) and 0.5 % (spleen) for B. miyamotoi and 6.6 % (skin) and 2.2 % (spleen) for B. burgdorferi s.l.

Transmission from the vertebrate host to the arthropod vector is a critical step in the life-cycle of any vector-borne pathogen. How the probability of host-to-vector transmission changes over the duration of the infection is an important predictor of pathogen fitness. The Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia afzelii is transmitted by Ixodes ricinus ticks and establishes a chronic infection inside rodent reservoir hosts. The present study compares the temporal pattern of host-to-tick transmission between two strains of B. afzelii . Methods. Laboratory mice were experimentally infected via tick bite with one of two strains of B. afzelii : A3 and A10. Mice were repeatedly infested with pathogen-free larval Ixodes ricinus ticks over a period of 4 months. Engorged larval ticks moulted into nymphal ticks that were tested for infection with B. afzelii using qPCR. The proportion of infected nymphs was used to characterize the pattern of host-to-tick transmission over time. Results. Both strains of B. afzelii followed a similar pattern of host-to-tick transmission. Transmission decreased from the acute to the chronic phase of the infection by 16.1 and 29.3% for strains A3 and A10, respectively. Comparison between strains found no evidence of a trade-off in transmission between the acute and chronic phase of infection. Strain A10 had higher lifetime fitness and established a consistently higher spirochete load in nymphal ticks than strain A3. Conclusion.

Forests in urban landscapes differ from their rural counterparts in ways that may alter vector-borne disease dynamics. In urban forest fragments, tick-borne pathogen prevalence is not well characterized; mitigating disease risk in densely-populated urban landscapes requires understanding ecological factors that affect pathogen prevalence. We trapped blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) nymphs in urban forest fragments on the East Coast of the United States and used multiplex real-time PCR assays to quantify the prevalence of four zoonotic, tick-borne pathogens. We used Bayesian logistic regression and WAIC model selection to understand how vegetation, habitat, and landscape features of urban forests relate to the prevalence of B. burgdorferi (the causative agent of Lyme disease) among blacklegged ticks. Results. In the 258 nymphs tested, we detected Borrelia burgdorferi (11.2% of ticks), Borrelia miyamotoi (0.8%) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (1.9%), but we did not find Babesia microti (0%). Ticks collected from forests invaded by non-native multiflora rose ( Rosa multiflora ) had greater B. burgdorferi infection rates (mean = 15.9%) than ticks collected from uninvaded forests (mean = 7.9%). Overall, B. burgdorferi prevalence among ticks was positively related to habitat features (e.g. coarse woody debris and total understory cover) favorable for competent reservoir host species. Conclusions. Understory structure provided by non-native, invasive shrubs appears to aggregate ticks and reservoir hosts, increasing opportunities for pathogen transmission. However, when we consider pathogen prevalence among nymphs in context with relative abundance of questing nymphs, invasive plants do not necessarily increase disease risk. Although pathogen prevalence is greater among ticks in invaded forests, the probability of encountering an infected tick remains greater in uninvaded forests characterized by thick litter layers, sparse understories, and relatively greater questing tick abundance in urban landscapes.",2047,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

Knowledge on ticks, their pathogens and the diseases they cause have been increasing, and resulted in the discovery of a diversity of control options, which often are not highly effective on their own. Control strategies involving concerted actions from human and animal health sectors as well as from nature managers have not been formulated, let alone implemented. Control of TBDs asks for a “health in all policies” approach, both at the (inter)national level, but also at local levels. For example, wildlife protection and creating urban green spaces are important for animal and human well-being, but may increase the risk of TBDs. In contrast, culling or fencing out deer decreases the risk for TBDs under specific conditions, but may have adverse effects on biodiversity or may be societally unacceptable. Therefore, in the end, nature and health workers together must carry out tailor-made control options for the control of TBDs for humans and animals, with minimal effects on the environment. In that regard, multidisciplinary approaches in environmental, but also medical settings are needed.

From the other side, alterations in the level of gene expression in response to antibiotic pressure leads to the establishment of a persisters subpopulation. Both subpopulations represent the cells in different physiological states. “Dormancy” and “persistence” do share some similarities, e.g. both represent cells with low metabolic activity that can exist for extended periods without replication, both constitute populations with different gene expression profiles and both differ significantly from replicating forms of spirochetes. Persisters are elusive, present in low numbers, morphologically heterogeneous, multi-drug-tolerant cells that can change with the environment. The definition of “persisters” substituted the originally-used term “survivors”, referring to the small bacterial population of Staphylococcus that survived killing by penicillin. The phenomenon of persisters is present in almost all bacterial species; however, the reasons why Borrelia persisters form are poorly understood. Persisters can adopt varying sizes and shapes, changing from well-known forms to altered morphologies. They are capable of forming round bodies, L-form bacteria, microcolonies or biofilms-like aggregates, which remarkably change the response of Borrelia to hostile environments. Persisters remain viable despite aggressive antibiotic challenge and are able to reversibly convert into motile forms in a favorable growth environment. Persisters are present in significant numbers in biofilms, which has led to the explanation of biofilm tolerance to antibiotics. Considering that biofilms are associated with numerous chronic diseases through their resilient presence in the human body, it is not surprising that interest in persisting cells has consequently accelerated. Certain diseases caused by pathogenic bacteria (e.g. tuberculosis, syphilis or leprosy) are commonly chronic in nature and often recur despite antibiotic treatment.

Recent field surveys and laboratory transmission studies indicated that certain avian species act as reservoir hosts for different Borrelia species. Nevertheless, our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms determining host tropism of Borrelia is still in its fledgling stage. Concerning the role of complement in avian-host tropism, only a few bird species and Borrelia species have been analysed so far. Here, we performed in vitro serum bactericidal assays with serum samples collected from four bird species including the European robin Erithacus rubecula , the great tit Parus major , the Eurasian blackbird Turdus merula , and the racing pigeon Columba livia , as well as four Borrelia species ( B. afzelii , B. garinii , B. valaisiana , and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). From July to September 2019, juvenile wild birds were caught using mist nets in Portugal. Racing pigeons were sampled in a loft in October 2019. Independent of the bird species analysed, all Borrelia species displayed an intermediate serum-resistant or serum-resistant phenotype except for B. afzelii challenged with serum from blackbirds. This genospecies was efficiently killed by avian complement, suggesting that blackbirds served as dead-end hosts for B. afzelii .

Ticks are vectors for a variety of viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases in human and domestic animals. To survive and reproduce ticks feed on host blood, yet our understanding of the intestinal proteolytic machinery used to derive absorbable nutrients from the blood meal is poor. Intestinal digestive processes are limiting factors for pathogen transmission since the tick gut presents the primary site of infection. Moreover, digestive enzymes may find practical application as anti-tick vaccine targets. Results. Using the hard tick, Ixodes ricinus , we performed a functional activity scan of the peptidase complement in gut tissue extracts that demonstrated the presence of five types of peptidases of the cysteine and aspartic classes. We followed up with genetic screens of gut-derived cDNA to identify and clone genes encoding the cysteine peptidases cathepsins B, L and C, an asparaginyl endopeptidase (legumain), and the aspartic peptidase, cathepsin D. By RT-PCR, expression of asparaginyl endopeptidase and cathepsins B and D was restricted to gut tissue and to those developmental stages feeding on blood. Conclusion. Overall, our results demonstrate the presence of a network of cysteine and aspartic peptidases that conceivably operates to digest host blood proteins in a concerted manner. Significantly, the peptidase components of this digestive network are orthologous to those described in other parasites, including nematodes and flatworms. Accordingly, the present data and those available for other tick species support the notion of an evolutionary conservation of a cysteine/aspartic peptidase system for digestion that includes ticks, but differs from that of insects relying on serine peptidases.",1737,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Extension to a duplex qPCR included an Ixodes spp. positive control to verify successful DNA isolation. Besides qPCR, an osp A-specific conventional PCR for species-specific identification of B. spielmanii was established. Afterwards 1000 I. ricinus flagged in the city of Hanover, Germany, were investigated for B. burgdorferi sl infections followed by species identification. Furthermore, I. hexagonus ticks were investigated to proof applicability of the PCRs. Results. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) identifying B. burgdorferi sl in ticks was able to detect 1-10 copies per reaction.

Interactions between multiple disciplines and responsible health and environmental authorities are often needed for an effective early warning, surveillance and control of vectors and the diseases they transmit. To fully appreciate this complexity, integrated knowledge about the human and the vector population is desirable. In the current paper, important parameters and terms of both public health and medical entomology are defined in order to establish a common language that facilitates collaboration between the two disciplines. Special focus is put on the different VBD contexts with respect to the current presence or absence of the disease, the pathogen and the vector in a given location. Depending on the context, whether a VBD is endemic or not, surveillance activities are required to assess disease burden or threat, respectively. Following a decision for action, surveillance activities continue to assess trends.",1000,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Hyalomma aegyptium is a hard-tick with a typical three-host life cycle. The main hosts are Palearctic tortoises of genus Testudo . However, other hosts can be used by immature ticks for feeding in natural conditions. Given this complex ecology and multiple host use, the circulation of pathogens by H. aegyptium between various hosts can be important from epidemiological point of view. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of H. aegyptium as natural carrier of four important zoonotic pathogens. Methods. From 2008 to 2011, 448 H. aegyptium ticks were collected from 45 Spur-thighed tortoises, Testudo graeca in Romania. DNA was extracted individually from each tick using a commercial kit. DNA was examined for the presence of specific sequences of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l ., Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis and Coxiella burnetii by PCR, according to previously described protocols. Results. PCR analysis of H. aegyptium revealed the presence of A. phagocytophilum (18.8%) , E. canis (14.1%) and C. burnetii (10%). 32.4% of the ticks were infected with at least one pathogen and 9.8% had co-infections. The stages most frequently infected were nymphs (50%) followed by males (33.9%) and females (27%). The number of tortoises which harboured infected ticks was 27/45 examined (60%). From all tested T. graeca , 40% harboured ticks infected with A. phagocytophilum , 46.7% had ticks infected with E. canis and 33.3% had ticks with C. burnetii . This study reports for the first time the presence of A. phagocytophilum and E. canis in H. aegyptium. Conclusions. The presence and relatively high prevalence of three important zoonotic pathogens in H. aegyptium raises the question of their epidemiologic importance in disease ecology. As tortoises are unlikely to be reservoir hosts for A. phagocytophilum and E. canis and both these pathogens are common in H. aegyptium , this is an important indication for (1) a possible increased host-switching behaviour of these ticks to competent reservoir hosts (i.e. hedgehogs) and (2) transstadial transmission. Furthermore, if we consider also the presence of C. burnetii , we conclude that T. graeca and its ticks should be evaluated more seriously when assessing the eco-epidemiology of zoonotic diseases.",2284,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

In the Eastern and Upper Midwestern regions of North America, Ixodes scapularis (L.) is the most abundant tick species encountered by humans and the primary vector of B. burgdorferi, whereas in the southeastern region Amblyomma americanum (Say) is the most abundant tick species encountered by humans but cannot transmit B. burgdorferi. Surveys of Borreliae in ticks have been conducted in the southeastern United States and often these surveys identify B. lonestari as the primary Borrelia species, surveys have not included Arkansas ticks, canines, or white-tailed deer and B. lonestari is not considered pathogenic. The objective of this study was to identify Borrelia species within Arkansas by screening ticks (n = 2123), canines (n = 173), and white-tailed deer (n = 228) to determine the identity and locations of Borreliae endemic to Arkansas using PCR amplification of the flagellin ( flaB) gene. Methods. Field collected ticks from canines and from hunter-killed white-tailed were identified to species and life stage. After which, ticks and their hosts were screened for the presence of Borrelia using PCR to amplify the flaB gene. A subset of the positive samples was confirmed with bidirectional sequencing. Results. In total 53 (21.2%) white-tailed deer, ten (6%) canines, and 583 (27.5%) Ixodid ticks (252 Ixodes scapularis , 161 A. americanum , 88 Rhipicephalus sanguineus , 50 Amblyomma maculatum, 19 Dermacentor variabilis, and 13 unidentified Amblyomma species) produced a Borrelia flaB amplicon. Of the positive ticks, 324 (22.7%) were collected from canines (151 A. americanum, 78 R. sanguineus , 43 I. scapularis, 26 A. maculatum, 18 D. variabilis , and 8 Amblyomma species) and 259 (37.2%) were collected from white-tailed deer (209 I. scapularis, 24 A. maculatum, 10 A. americanum, 10 R. sanguineus , 1 D. variabilis , and 5 Amblyomma species). None of the larvae were PCR positive. A majority of the flaB amplicons were homologous with B. lonestari sequences: 281 of the 296 sequenced ticks, 3 canines, and 27 deer. Only 22 deer, 7 canines, and 15 tick flaB amplicons (12 I. scapularis , 2 A. maculatum , and 1 Amblyomma species) were homologous with B. burgdorferi sequences. Conclusions. Data from this study identified multiple Borreliae genotypes in Arkansas ticks, canines and deer including B. burgdorferi and B. lonestari; however, B. lonestari was significantly more prevalent in the tick population than B. burgdorferi . Results from this study suggest that the majority of tick-borne diseases in Arkansas are not B. burgdorferi.",2575,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Ixodes granulatus is widely distributed in various countries of Southeast Asia and Taiwan. Although this tick species is presumed to be the vector for the enzoonotic transmission of Borrelia spirochetes in the Taiwan area, the prevalence of infection and genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes harbored by this tick species need to be further determined. Methods. DNA extraction was performed from individual tick specimens collected from Rattus losea on Kinmen Island of Taiwan. Borrelia infection in I . granulatus ticks was detected by performing a specific PCR assay based on the 5S-23S intergenic spacer amplicon gene of B. burgdorferi sensu lato. The genetic identities of detected spirochetes were identified by gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Results. Borrelia infection was detected in nymph, male, and female stages of Ixodes granulatus ticks with an infection rate of 42.9%, 36%, and 52.7%, respectively. Genospecies identification reveals that B. valaisiana is the main genotype (70.7%) as compared to the genotype of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (15.4%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these detected spirochetes were genetically affiliated to the genospecies B. valaisiana and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, with a high sequence homology within the genospecies of B. valaisiana (95.8 to 100%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (97.2 to 100%), respectively. Conclusions. This study highlights the significance of high prevalence and genetic diversity of Borrelia spirochetes in I. granulatus ticks collected from Rattus losea on Kinmen Island of Taiwan. Intraspecific analysis also revealed that B. valaisiana species detected in Kinmen Island can be easily distinguished from the European group of B. valaisiana and other genospecies of Borrelia spirochetes. This may imply an enzoonotic cycle between I. granulatus ticks and rodent hosts that maintains Borrelia spirochetes in Kinmen Island as well as Southeast Asia.",1961,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Ticks are the most important pathogen vectors in Europe. They are known to be influenced by environmental factors, but these links are usually studied at specific temporal or spatial scales. Focusing on Ixodes ricinus in Belgium, we attempt to bridge the gap between current “single-sided” studies that focus on temporal or spatial variation only. Here, spatial and temporal patterns of ticks are modelled together. Methods. A multi-level analysis of the Ixodes ricinus patterns in Belgium was performed. Joint effects of weather, habitat quality and hunting on field sampled tick abundance were examined at two levels, namely, sampling level, which is associated with temporal dynamics, and site level, which is related to spatial dynamics. Independent variables were collected from standard weather station records, game management data and remote sensing-based land cover data. Results. At sampling level, only a marginally significant effect of daily relative humidity and temperature on the abundance of questing nymphs was identified. Average wind speed of seven days prior to the sampling day was found important to both questing nymphs and adults. At site level, a group of landscape-level forest fragmentation indices were highlighted for both questing nymph and adult abundance, including the nearest-neighbour distance, the shape and the aggregation level of forest patches. No cross-level effects or spatial autocorrelation were found. Conclusions. Nymphal and adult ticks responded differently to environmental variables at different spatial and temporal scales. Our results can advise spatio-temporal extents of environment data collection for continuing empirical investigations and potential parameters for biological tick models.",1758,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Spirochete load in blood and tissue samples of infected mice were measured by minor groove binder-based real-time polymerase chain reaction. The kinetics of spirochete dissemination and disease severity were assessed in BALB/c mice. Results. The pattern of bacterial load differed between the three genospecies.

Ticks and tick-borne diseases are increasing in many areas of Europe and North America due to climate change, while land use and the increased abundances of large hosts play a more controversial role. The pattern of host selection involves a crucial component for tick abundance. While the larvae and nymphs feed on a wide range of different sized hosts, the adult female ticks require blood meal from a large host (>1 kg), typically a deer, to fulfil the life cycle. Understanding the role of different hosts for abundances of ticks is therefore important, and also the extent to which different life stages attach to large hosts. Findings. We studied attachment site selection of life stages of I. ricinus ticks on a main large host in Europe, the red deer ( Cervus elaphus ). We collected from 33 felled red deer pieces of skin from five body parts: leg, groin, neck, back and ear. We counted the number of larval, nymphal, adult male and adult female ticks. Nymphs (42.2%) and adult (48.7%) ticks dominated over larvae (9.1%). There were more larvae on the legs (40.9%), more nymphs on the ears (83.7%), while adults dominated in the groins (89.2%) and neck (94.9%). Conclusions. Large mammalian hosts are thus a diverse habitat suitable for different life stages of ticks. The attachment site selection reflected the life stages differing ability to move. The spatial separation of life stages may partly limit the role of deer in co-feeding transmission cycles.",1479,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Borrelia miyamotoi is a relapsing fever spirochete found in Ixodes ticks in North America, Europe, and Asia, and has recently been found to be invasive in humans. Cultivation of this spirochete has not yet been described, but is important for patient diagnostics and scientific purposes. Host specificity of Borrelia species is dependent on resistance to host complement (serum resistance), and since B. miyamotoi has been identified as a human pathogen we were interested whether B. miyamotoi is resistant to human complement. Methods. We inoculated B. miyamotoi strains LB-2001 and HT31 in modified-Kelly-Pettenkofer medium with 10% fetal calf serum (MKP-F), and used standard non-laborious Borrelia culture methods to culture the spirochetes. Next, we assessed serum sensitivity by a direct killing assay and a growth inhibition assay. Results. We were able to passage B. miyamotoi over 10 times using a standard culture method in MKP-F medium, and found B. miyamotoi to be resistant to human complement. In contrast to B. miyamotoi , Borrelia anserina - a relapsing fever spirochete unrelated to human infection- was serum sensitive. Conclusions. Using a variation on MKP medium we were able to culture B. miyamotoi , opening the door to in vitro research into this spirochete. In addition, we describe that B. miyamotoi is resistant to human complement, which might play an important role in pathogenesis. We have also found B. anserina to be sensitive to human complement, which might explain why it is not related to human infection. Summarizing, we describe a novel culture method for B. miyamotoi and show it is resistant to human complement.",1663,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Since 1997, human-biting ticks submitted to the Department of Defense Human Tick Test Kit Program (HTTKP) of the US Army Public Health Command have been tested for pathogens by PCR. We noted differences in the phenology and infection prevalence among Ixodes scapularis ticks submitted from military installations in different geographic regions. The aim of this study was to characterize these observed differences, comparing the phenology and pathogen infection rates of I. scapularis submitted from soldiers at two sites in the upper Midwest (Camp Ripley, MN, and Ft. McCoy, WI) and one site in the northeastern US (Ft. Indiantown Gap, PA). Methods. From 1997 through 2012, the HTTKP received 1,981 I. scapularis from the three installations and tested them for Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia microti , Borrelia burgdorferi and the Ehrlichia muris -like (EML) agent using PCR; pathogen presence was confirmed via sequencing or amplification of a second gene target. Pathogen and co-infection prevalence, tick engorgement status, and phenology were compared among installations. Results. Greater rates of A. phagocytophilum and Ba. microti infections were detected in ticks submitted from installations in Minnesota than in Wisconsin or Pennsylvania, and the EML agent was only detected in ticks from Minnesota and Wisconsin. Midwestern ticks were also more likely to be co-infected than those from Pennsylvania. Both adult and nymphal ticks showed evidence of feeding on people, although nymphs were more often submitted engorged. Adult I. scapularis were received more frequently in June from Minnesota than from either of the other sites. Minnesota adult and nymphal peaks overlapped in June, and submissions of adults exceeded nymphs in that month. Conclusions. There were clear differences in I. scapularis phenology, pathogen prevalence and rates of co-infection among the three military installations. Seasonal and temperature differences between the three sites and length of time a population had been established in each region may contribute to the observed differences. The synchrony of adults and nymphs observed in the upper Midwest has implications for pathogen infection prevalence. The EML agent was only detected in Minnesota and Wisconsin, supporting the previous assertion that this pathogen is currently limited to the upper Midwest.",2372,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Borreliosis is highly prevalent in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China. However, little is known about the presence of Borrelia pathogens in tick species in this region, in addition Borrelia pathogens have not been isolated from domestic animals. Methods. We collected adult ticks from domestic animals at 19 sampling sites in 14 counties in northern Xinjiang from 2012 to 2014. Ticks were identified to species by morphology and were molecularly analysed by sequences of mitochondrial 16S rDNA gene; 4–8 ticks of each species at every sampling site were sequenced. 112 live adult ticks were selected for each species in every county, and were used to culture Borrelia pathogens; the genotypes were then determined by sequences of the 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer and the outer surface protein A ( ospA ) gene. Results. A total of 5257 adult ticks, belonging to four genera and seven species, were collected. Compared with three decades ago, the abundance of the five common tick species during the peak ixodid tick season has changed. Certain tick species, such as Rhipicephalus turanicus ( Rh. turanicus ), was found at Jimusaer, Yining, Fukang, and Chabuchaer Counties for the first time. Additionally, the sequence analyses showed that the Hyalomma asiaticum ( Hy. asiaticum ), Haemaphysalis punctata ( Ha. punctata ), and Dermacentor marginatus ( D. marginatus ) that were collected from different sampling sites (≥3 sites) shared identical 16S rDNA sequences respectively. For the tick species that were collected from the same county, such as Hy. asiaticum from Shihezi County and Rh. turanicus from Yining County, their 16S rDNA sequences showed genetic diversity. In addition, sixteen Borrelia isolates were found in Hy. asiaticum , Ha. punctata , D. marginatus and Rh. turanicus , which infested cattle, sheep, horse and camel in Yining, Chabuchaer, Shihezi and Shawan Counties.

Persulcatusin (IP) was found in the Ixodes persulcatus midgut, and its amino acid sequence was reported. However, the complete structure of IP has not been identified. We evaluated the relation between structural features and antimicrobial activity of IP, and its potential as a new anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) agent. Methods. The structure of IP was predicted using homology modeling and molecular dynamics. IP and other tick AMPs were synthesized using a solid-phase method and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA were used for the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test and short-time killing assay of IP and other tick peptides. The influence of IP on mammalian fibroblasts and colon epithelial cells and each cell DNA and its hemolytic activity towards human erythrocytes were also examined. Results. In the predicted IP structure, the structure with an S-S bond was more stable than that without an S-S bond. The MIC after 24 h of incubation with IP was 0.156–1.25 μg/mL for MSSA and 0.625–2.5 μg/mL for MRSA. Compared with the mammalian antimicrobial peptide and other tick peptides, IP was highly effective against MRSA. Moreover, IP showed a dose-dependent bactericidal effect on both MSSA and MRSA after 1 h of incubation. IP had no observable effect on mammalian cell growth or morphology, on each cell DNA and on human erythrocytes. Conclusions. We predicted the three-dimensional structure of IP and found that the structural integrity was maintained by three S-S bonds, which were energetically important for the stability and for forming α helix and β sheet. IP has cationic and amphipathic properties, which might be related to its antimicrobial activity. Furthermore, the antimicrobial activity of IP against MRSA was stronger than that of other antimicrobial peptides without apparent damage to mammalian and human cells, demonstrating its possible application as a new anti-MRSA medicine.",2250,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Dogs in the United States are hosts to a diverse range of ticks and tick-borne pathogens, including A. phagocytophilum , an important emerging canine and human pathogen. Previously, a Companion Animal Parasite Council (CAPC)-sponsored workshop proposed factors purported to be associated with the infection risk for tick-transmitted pathogens in dogs in the United States, including climate conditions, socioeconomic characteristics, local topography, and vector distribution. Methods. Approximately four million test results from routine veterinary diagnostic tests from 2011–2013, which were collected on a county level across the contiguous United States, are statistically analyzed with the proposed factors via logistic regression and generalized estimating equations. Spatial prevalence maps of baseline Anaplasma spp. prevalence are constructed from Kriging and head-banging smoothing methods. Results. All of the examined factors, with the exception of surface water coverage, were significantly associated with Anaplasma spp. prevalence. Overall, Anaplasma spp. prevalence increases with increasing precipitation and forestation coverage and decreases with increasing temperature, population density, relative humidity, and elevation. Interestingly, socioeconomic status and deer/vehicle collisions were positively and negatively correlated with canine Anaplasma seroprevalence, respectively. A spatial map of the canine Anaplasma hazard is an auxiliary product of the analysis. Anaplasma spp. prevalence is highest in New England and the Upper Midwest. Conclusions. The results from the two posited statistical models (one that contains an endemic areas assumption and one that does not) are in general agreement, with the major difference being that the endemic areas model estimates a larger prevalence in Western Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado. As A. phagocytophilum is zoonotic, the results of this analysis could also help predict areas of high risk for human exposure to this pathogen.",2014,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

The Ehrlichia muris -like agent (EMLA) is a newly recognized human pathogen in the North Central United States. Although blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) have been identified as capable vectors, wild reservoirs have not yet been established for EMLA. As key hosts for I. scapularis , white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) are important reservoirs for various tick-borne pathogens, and potentially, for EMLA. The objective of this study was to evaluate reservoir competence in P. leucopus using a natural vector. Results. Mice acquired EMLA infection from feeding ticks and were able to transmit infection to naïve ticks. Transmission between simultaneously feeding tick life stages was also demonstrated. Infections in mice were acute and severe, with systemic dissemination. Limited host survival and clearance of infection among survivors resulted in a narrow interval where EMLA could be acquired by feeding ticks. Conclusions. Peromyscus leucopus is a competent reservoir of EMLA and likely to play a role in its enzootic transmission cycle. The duration and severity of EMLA infection in these hosts suggests that tick phenology is a critical factor determining the geographic distribution of EMLA in North America.",1243,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Understanding which factors drive population densities of disease vectors is an important step in assessing disease risk. We tested the hypothesis that the density of ticks from the Ixodes ricinus complex, which are important vectors for tick-borne diseases, is determined by the density of deer, as adults of these ticks mainly feed on deer. Methods. We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate I. ricinus density across 20 forest plots in the Netherlands that ranged widely in deer availability to ticks, and performed a deer-exclosure experiment in four pairs of 1 ha forest plots in a separate site. Results. Ixodes ricinus from all stages were more abundant in plots with deer ( n = 17) than in plots without deer ( n = 3). Where deer were present, the density of ticks did not increase with the abundance of deer. Experimental exclosure of deer reduced nymph density by 66% and adult density by 32% within a timeframe of two years. Conclusions. In this study, deer presence rather than abundance explained the density of I. ricinus . This is in contrast to previous studies and might be related to the relatively high host-species richness in Dutch forests. This means that reduction of the risk of acquiring a tick bite would require the complete elimination of deer in species rich forests. The fact that small exclosures (< 1 ha) substantially reduced I. ricinus densities suggests that fencing can be used to reduce tick-borne disease risk in areas with high recreational pressure.",1511,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Autochthonous transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi , the primary agent of Lyme disease in dogs and people in North America, commonly occurs in the northeastern United States, including the New York City metropolitan area, a region with a large human and pet population and broadly diverse demographics and habitats. Methods. We evaluated results from a specific, C6-based serologic assay performed on 234,633 canine samples to compare evidence of past or current infection with B. burgdorferi ( sensu stricto ) in dogs to county-wide social and environmental factors, as well as to reported cases of Lyme disease in people. Results. The data revealed a wide range of county level percent positive canine test results (1.2–27.3%) and human case reports (0.5–438.7 case reports/100,000 people). Dogs from highly (> 50%) forested areas and counties with lower population density had the highest percent positive test results, at 21.1% and 17.9%, respectively. Canine percent positive tests correlated with population-adjusted human case reports ( R 2 = 0.48, P < 0.0001), as well as population density, development intensity, temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, and habitat type. Subsequent multiple regression allowed an accurate prediction of infection risk in dogs ( R 2 = 0.90) but was less accurate at predicting human case reports ( R 2 = 0.74). Conclusion. In areas where Lyme disease is endemic, canine serology continues to provide insight into risk factors for transmission to both dogs and people although some differences in geographic patterns of canine infection and human disease reports are evident.",1641,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Borrelia miyamotoi is a spirochete transmitted by several ixodid tick species. It causes a relapsing fever in humans and is currently considered as an emerging pathogen. In Europe, B. miyamotoi seems to occur at low prevalence in Ixodes ricinus ticks but has a wide distribution. Here we report the first detection of B. miyamotoi in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected in two independent studies conducted in 2016 in the north-eastern and north-western Alps, Italy. Results. Three out of 405 nymphs (0.74%) tested positive for Borrelia miyamotoi . In particular, B. miyamotoi was found in 2/365 nymphs in the western and in 1/40 nymphs in the eastern alpine area. These are the first findings of B. miyamotoi in Italy. Conclusions. Exposure to B. miyamotoi and risk of human infection may occur through tick bites in northern Italy. Relapsing fever caused by Borrelia miyamotoi has not yet been reported in Italy, but misdiagnoses with tick-borne encephalitis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis or other relapsing fever can occur. Our findings suggest that B. miyamotoi should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile patients originating from Lyme borreliosis endemic regions.

Vector-borne pathogens are emerging concerns in multiple regions of Canada. Determining regional prevalence of canine vector-borne pathogens and documenting change will improve clinician awareness, enable targeted prevention, enhance diagnosis and ideally reduce the risk of disease. Study objectives were to: (i) estimate the prevalence of positive canine vector-borne test results from samples submitted in Canada; (ii) assess change in prevalence over time, from baseline (2008) to 2015; and (iii) estimate the prevalence of pathogen co-infections. Methods. This repeat cross-sectional study evaluated 753,468 test results for D. immitis antigen and B. burgdorferi , Ehrlichia canis/ewingii/muris serology, and 753,208 test results for Anaplasma phagocytophilum/platys serology using the SNAP® 4Dx®Test and SNAP 4Dx® Plus Test. Results. Based on all submitted samples from Canada (2008–2015), the period seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi , Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp. and D. immitis antigen were 2.0%, 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively. Over the 7 years (2008 compared to 2015) we observed a significant increase in seroprevalence for B. burgdorferi (144.4%) and Ehrlichia spp. (150%). Co-infections (positive for two or more pathogens on a single 4 pathogen test kit) were estimated at 5.4% (1162/21,612) of total positive tests. Conclusions.

358,parasites & vectors,Sampling scale and season influence the observed relationship between the density of deer and questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs,"['ER Dickinson', 'C Millins', 'R Biek']",10.1186/s13071-020-04369-8,2020.0,3,HTML,"Background. The relationship between environmentally transmitted tick parasites, Ixodes spp., and their main reproductive host, deer, is generally thought to be positive. However, measuring host abundance and density directly can be challenging and indirect methods are often used. The observed relationship between the parasite and host may be affected by sampling scale and season, which could lead to different inferences being made. Here, we aimed to test the effect of sampling scale and season on the relationship between density of deer and the density of questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs. Methods. The density of deer (primarily Dama dama ) was estimated using line transect distance sampling of deer dung quantified in different seasons (winter and summer) and measured at three different nested scales (site, transect and observation level). Questing nymph density was measured using blanket drag methods and estimates were calculated at the same scales as deer density estimates. General linear models were used to evaluate the relationship between questing nymphs, deer density and other environmental variables at each sampling scale and each season deer density was measured at. Results. While a positive relationship between deer density and questing nymph density was detected at the site and transect scale, no relationship was apparent at the observation level. This was likely due to increased variation and reduced precision of deer dung counts at the finest sampling scale. Seasonal changes in deer populations were observed likely reflecting seasonal shifts in habitat usage. The summer estimates of deer density explained questing nymph density whereas winter estimates did not. Conclusions. Our results show that the scale of sampling can affect the detectability of the positive association between host and vector species. Furthermore, such associations can be obscured if hosts exhibit seasonal changes in habitat use. Thus, both sampling scale and season are important to consider when investigating the relationship between host and vector species.",2075,0,1,0,0,fr,en,
359,parasites & vectors,Effect of rodent density on tick and tick-borne pathogen populations: Consequences for infectious disease risk,"['AI Krawczyk', 'GLA van Duijvendijk', '...']",10.1186/s13071-020-3902-0,2020.0,20,HTML,"Background. Rodents are considered to contribute strongly to the risk of tick-borne diseases by feeding Ixodes ricinus larvae and by acting as amplifying hosts for pathogens. Here, we tested to what extent these two processes depend on rodent density, and for which pathogen species rodents synergistically contribute to the local disease risk, i.e. the density of infected nymphs (DIN). Methods. In a natural woodland, we manipulated rodent densities in plots of 2500 m 2 by either supplementing a critical food source (acorns) or by removing rodents during two years. Untreated plots were used as controls. Collected nymphs and rodent ear biopsies were tested for the presence of seven tick-borne microorganisms. Linear models were used to capture associations between rodents, nymphs, and pathogens. Results. Investigation of data from all plots, irrespective of the treatment, revealed a strong positive association between rodent density and nymphal density, nymphal infection prevalence (NIP) with Borrelia afzelii and Neoehrlichia mikurensis , and hence DIN’s of these pathogens in the following year. The NIP, but not the DIN, of the bird-associated Borrelia garinii , decreased with increasing rodent density. The NIPs of Borrelia miyamotoi and Rickettsia helvetica were independent of rodent density, and increasing rodent density moderately increased the DINs. In addition, NIPs of Babesia microti and Spiroplasma ixodetis decreased with increasing rodent density, which had a non-linear association with DINs of these microorganisms. Conclusions. A positive density dependence for all rodent- and tick-associated tick-borne pathogens was found, despite the observation that some of them decreased in prevalence. The effects on the DINs were variable among microorganisms, more than likely due to contrasts in their biology (including transmission modes, host specificity and transmission efficiency). The strongest associations were found in rodent-associated pathogens that most heavily rely on horizontal transmission. Our results draw attention to the importance of considering transmission mode of a pathogen while developing preventative measures to successfully reduce the burden of disease.",2209,0,1,0,0,fr,en,
360,parasites & vectors,Tick infestation on medium–large-sized mammalian hosts: are all equally suitable to Ixodes ricinus adults?,"['A Mysterud', 'C Hügli', '...']",10.1186/s13071-021-04775-6,2021.0,0,HTML,"Background. In Europe, the generalist tick, Ixodes ricinus , is the main vector of several tick-borne pathogens causing diseases in humans and livestock. Understanding how different species of hosts limit the tick population is crucial for management. In general, larger ectoparasites are expected to select hosts with larger body size. Consistent with this, larval and nymphal I. ricinus can feed on a wide range of different-sized vertebrates, while the adult female stage is expected to rely on a medium–large-sized host for reproduction. However, we still have a limited understanding of whether medium-sized hosts other than roe deer can serve as hosts to adult ticks, and other factors than size may also affect host selection. Methods. To increase our understanding of the suitability of the different species of medium-sized hosts for adult ticks, we sampled mainly roadkill mammals from within the questing season of ticks. We counted life stages of ticks on roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) ( n = 29), red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) ( n = 6), badger ( Meles meles ) ( n = 14) and red squirrel ( Sciurus vulgaris ) ( n = 17) from spatially overlapping populations in Norway, and analysed variation between species across different body parts with a mixed-effects negative binomial model (with and without zero-inflation). Results. Red squirrel hosted a high density of larval and nymphal I. ricinus , but only one individual had adult female ticks. Roe deer hosted by far the largest number of adult ticks. Badgers had very few ticks, possibly due to their thick skin. Red foxes had intermediate numbers, but a high proportion of subcutaneous, dead ticks (69.3%), suggesting they are not very suitable hosts. Body mass predicted the presence of adult I. ricinus ticks. However, species was a better predictor than body mass for number of ticks, suggesting there was species variation in host suitability beyond body mass per se. Conclusions. Our study provides evidence that roe deer are indeed the main suitable reproduction host to adult I. ricinus ticks, and are likely a key to host limitation of the tick population in this northern ecosystem.

The universal nature of the human–companion animal relationship and their shared ticks and tick-borne pathogens offers an opportunity for improving public and veterinary health surveillance. With this in mind, we describe the spatiotemporal trends for blacklegged tick ( Ixodes scapularis ) submissions from humans and companion animals in Ontario, along with pathogen prevalence. Methods. We tested tick samples submitted through passive surveillance (2011–2017) from humans and companion animals for Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti . We describe pathogen prevalence in ticks from humans and from companion animals and constructed univariable Poisson and negative binomial regression models to explore the spatiotemporal relationship between the rates of tick submissions by host type. Results. During the study, there were 17,230 blacklegged tick samples submitted from humans and 4375 from companion animals. Tick submission rates from companion animals were higher than expected in several public health units (PHUs) lacking established tick populations, potentially indicating newly emerging populations. Pathogen prevalence in ticks was higher in PHUs where established blacklegged tick populations exist. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in ticks collected from humans (maximum likelihood estimate, MLE = 17.5%; 95% confidence interval, CI 16.97–18.09%) than from companion animals (9.9%, 95% CI 9.15–10.78%). There was no difference in pathogen prevalence in ticks by host type for the remaining pathogens, which were found in less than 1% of tested ticks. The most common co-infection B. burgdorferi + B. miyamotoi occurred in 0.11% of blacklegged ticks from humans and animals combined. Borrelia burgdorferi prevalence was higher in unengorged (21.9%, 95% CI 21.12–22.65%) than engorged ticks (10.0%, 95% CI 9.45–10.56%). There were no consistent and significant spatiotemporal relationships detected via regression models between the annual rates of submission of each host type. Conclusions. While B. burgdorferi has been present in blacklegged ticks in Ontario for several decades, other tick-borne pathogens are also present at low prevalence. Blacklegged tick and pathogen surveillance data can be used to monitor risk in human and companion animal populations, and efforts are under consideration to unite surveillance efforts for the different target populations.

We evaluated the efficiency of an ex vivo feeding technique using a silicone membrane-based feeding chamber to (i) assess the anti-feeding and acaricidal efficacy of a spot-on combination of dinotefuran, pyriproxyfen and permethrin (DPP, Vectra® 3D) against adult Ixodes scapularis and Ixodes ricinus ticks, and to (ii) explore its effect on blocking the acquisition of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Methods. Eight purpose-bred dogs were randomly allocated to two equal-size groups based on body weight assessed on day 2. DPP was administered topically, as spot-on, to four dogs on day 0. Hair from the eight dogs was collected individually by brushing the whole body on days 2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. On each day of hair collection, 0.05 g of sampled hair was applied on the membrane corresponding to each feeding unit (FU). Seventy-two FU were each seeded with 30 adults of I. scapularis ( n = 24 FU) or I. ricinus ticks ( n = 48 FU). Bovine blood spiked with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (strain B31) was added into each unit and changed every 12 h for 4 days. Tick mortality was assessed 1 h after seeding. One additional hour of incubation was added for live/moribund specimens and reassessed for viability. All remaining live/moribund ticks were left in the feeders and tick engorgement status was recorded at 96 h after seeding, and the uptake of B. burgdorferi s.s. was examined in the collected ticks by applying quantitative real-time PCR. Results. Exposure to DPP-treated hair was 100% effective in blocking B. burgdorferi s.s. acquisition. The anti-feeding efficacy remained stable (100%) against both Ixodes species throughout the study. The acaricidal efficacy of DPP evaluated at 1 and 2 h after exposure was 100% throughout the study for I. ricinus , except the 1-h assessment on day 28 (95.9%) and day 35 (95.3%). The 1-h assessment of acaricidal efficacy was 100% at all time points for I. scapularis . Conclusions.

The first cases of human infection with B. miyamotoi were identified in 2011. In the eastern USA, blacklegged ticks ( Ixodes scapularis ) become infected by feeding on an infected vertebrate host, or through transovarial transmission. We surveyed B. miyamotoi prevalence in ticks within forested habitats in Dutchess County, New York, and identified possible reservoir hosts. To assess spatial variation in infection, we collected questing nymphal ticks at > 150 sites. To assess temporal variation in infection, we collected questing nymphs for 8 years at a single study site. We collected questing larval ticks from nine plots to estimate the amount of transovarial transmission. To evaluate potential reservoir hosts, we captured 14 species of mammal and bird hosts naturally infested with larval blacklegged ticks and held these hosts in the laboratory until ticks fed to repletion and molted to nymphs. We determined infection for all ticks using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The overall infection prevalence of questing nymphal ticks across all sites was ~ 1%, but prevalence at individual sites was as high as 9.1%. We detected no significant increase in infection through time. Only 0.4% of questing larval ticks were infected. Ticks having fed as larvae from short-tailed shrews, red squirrels, and opossums tended to have higher infection prevalence than did ticks having fed on other hosts. Further studies of the role of hosts in transmission are warranted. The locally high prevalence of B. miyamotoi in the New York/New England landscape suggests the importance of vigilance by health practitioners and the public. Graphical abstract.",1782,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Invasive arthropod vectors and the range expansions of native vectors can lead to public and veterinary health concerns, as these vectors may introduce novel pathogens or spread endemic pathogens to new locations. Recent tick invasions and range expansion in the USA has been attributed to climate and land use change, an increase in global travel, and importations of exotic animals. Methods. A 10-year surveillance study was conducted on Block Island, Rhode Island, from 2010 to 2020 including sampling ticks from small mammal and avian hosts. Results. We report the discovery and establishment of the red sheep tick ( Haemaphysalis punctata ) for the first time in the western hemisphere and in the US.

Gaining insight into the risk perceptions and the knowledge evolution of the public about emerging or changing health risks is vital for the improvement of health promotion activities. Currently, scientific evidence regarding the attitudes of the Romanian public towards ticks is scanty. This study aimed to identify how the lockdown enforced by the COVID-19 pandemic in Romania impacted the recreational behaviour, risk perceptions, and protective practices of the Romanian population regarding ticks. Methods. A cross-sectional, nationwide web-based questionnaire was designed and distributed via social media to evaluate if, and how, the COVID-19 lockdown impacted the behaviour of the Romanian public concerning ticks. The survey was available online from 6 May until 15 May 2020, which marked the last day of the travel ban in Romania. The collected data were processed by applying both uni- and multivariate methods. Results. Respondents reported a higher frequency of finding ticks on themselves and their dogs during the lockdown. Bathing/showering and checking the body for ticks were the two most used protective behaviours both before and during the lockdown. Nevertheless, an overall lower usage rate of protective measures was registered during the lockdown. Almost all dog owners used a form of ectoparasite control for their dogs, and only three stopped due to lockdown-associated reasons. Respondent characteristics that were found to be positively associated with risk perceptions were being female and living in peri-urban/suburban/rural environments. Conclusions. Despite spending less time outdoors during the lockdown, more respondents reported finding ticks on themselves or their dogs. Changes in the preferences for recreational locations, rates of protective practices usage, amount of time spent in specific areas, or tick seasonal activity might have contributed to this outcome. Concerning risk groups, men of all ages, senior citizens, and rural inhabitants should be targeted by the relevant Romanian authorities when promoting local or nationwide tick awareness campaigns.

Six synthetic peptides (C 1 to C 6 ), which reproduced the six IR sequences were used as peptide-based, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Two IRs, IR 2 and IR 6 , were found to be immunodominant. Studies with serially collected serum samples from experimentally infected dogs revealed that the antibody response to IR 6 appears earlier and is stronger than that to IR 2 . Thus, the IR 6 sequence alone appeared to be sufficient for serodiagnosis. When C 6 alone was used as antigen, the peptide-based ELISA was positive in 7 of 23 dogs (30%) as early as 3 weeks postinfection. All dogs ( n = 33) became strongly positive 1 or 2 weeks later, and this response persisted for the entire study, which lasted for 69 weeks. Of 55 sera submitted by veterinarians from dogs suspected of having Lyme disease, 19 were also positive by the C 6 ELISA, compared to 20 positives detected by immunoblot analysis using cultured B. burgdorferi lysates as antigen. The sensitivity of using C 2 and C 6 together for detecting specific antibody in both experimentally infected and clinically diagnosed dogs was not better than sensitivity with C 6 alone, confirming that C 6 suffices as a diagnostic probe. Moreover, the C 6 ELISA yielded 100% specificity with serum samples collected from 70 healthy dogs, 14 dogs with infections other than B. burgdorferi , and 15 animals vaccinated with either outer surface protein A, whole-spirochete vaccines, or the common puppy-vaccines.

Borrelia burgdorferi releases large quantities of proteins, suggesting that specific antibodies in serum might be trapped in immune complexes (ICs), rendering the antibodies undetectable by standard assays using unmodified serum. Production of ICs requires ongoing antigen production, so persistence of IC might be a marker of ongoing or persisting infection. We developed an immunoglobulin M (IgM) capture assay (EMIBA) measuring IC-derived IgM antibodies and tested it using three well-defined LD populations (from an academic LD referral center, a well-described Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) serum bank, and a group of erythema migrans patients from whose skin lesions B. burgdorferi was grown) and controls (non-Lyme arthritis inflammatory joint disease, syphilis, multiple sclerosis, and nondisease subjects from a region where LD is endemic, perhaps the most relevant comparison group of all). Previous studies demonstrated that specific antigen-antibody complexes in the sera of patients with LD could be precipitated by polyethylene glycol and could then be disrupted with maintenance of the immunoreactivity of the released antibodies, that specific anti- B. burgdorferi IgM was concentrated in ICs, and that occasionally IgM to specific B. burgdorferi antigens was found in the IC but not in unprocessed serum. EMIBA compared favorably with commercial and CDC flagellin-enhanced enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and other assays in confirming the diagnosis of LD. EMIBA confirmed early B. burgdorferi infection more accurately than the comparator assays. In addition, EMIBA more accurately differentiated seropositivity in patients with active ongoing infection from seroreactivity persisting long after clinically successful antibiotic therapy; i.e., EMIBA identified seroreactivity indicating a clinical circumstance requiring antibiotic therapy. Thus, EMIBA is a promising new assay for accurate serologic confirmation of early and/or active LD.",2123,0,0,1,0,en,en,

We applied high-volume blood culture, skin biopsy culture, PCR, and serodiagnosis to a cohort of patients with suspected Lyme disease acquired in Maryland and southern Pennsylvania. The study was performed to confirm the relative utility of culture and to identify laboratory testing algorithms that will supplement clinical diagnosis. Overall, 30 of 86 patients (35%) were culture positive, whereas an additional 15 of 84 (18%) were seropositive only (51% total sero- and culture positive), and PCR on skin biopsy identified 4 additional patients who were neither culture nor seropositive.

We examined the role of Nod2 in responses to B. burgdorferi . In vitro stimulation of Nod2 deficient bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) resulted in decreased induction of multiple cytokines, interferons and interferon regulated genes compared with wild-type cells. However, B. burgdorferi infection of Nod2 deficient mice resulted in increased rather than decreased arthritis and carditis compared to control mice. We explored multiple potential mechanisms for the paradoxical response in in vivo versus in vitro systems and found that prolonged stimulation with a Nod2 ligand, muramyl dipeptide (MDP), resulted in tolerance to stimulation by B. burgdorferi . This tolerance was lost with stimulation of Nod2 deficient cells that cannot respond to MDP. Cytokine patterns in the tolerance model closely paralleled cytokine profiles in infected Nod2 deficient mice.

Individual patient and healthy control CSF samples were analyzed directly employing a MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics approach. We found that both groups, and individuals within the groups, could be distinguished from each other and normals based on their specific CSF proteins (p<0.01).

In order to understand the molecular pathogenesis, natural diversity, population structure and epizootic spread of the North American Lyme agent, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, a much better understanding of the natural diversity of its genome will be required. Towards this end we present a comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the numerous plasmids of B. burgdorferi isolates B31, N40, JD1 and 297. These strains were chosen because they include the three most commonly studied laboratory strains, and because they represent different major genetic lineages and so are informative regarding the genetic diversity and evolution of this organism. A unique feature of Borrelia genomes is that they carry a large number of linear and circular plasmids, and this work shows that strains N40, JD1, 297 and B31 carry related but non-identical sets of 16, 20, 19 and 21 plasmids, respectively, that comprise 33–40% of their genomes. We deduce that there are at least 28 plasmid compatibility types among the four strains. The B. burgdorferi ∼900 Kbp linear chromosomes are evolutionarily exceptionally stable, except for a short ≤20 Kbp plasmid-like section at the right end. A few of the plasmids, including the linear lp54 and circular cp26, are also very stable. We show here that the other plasmids, especially the linear ones, are considerably more variable. Nearly all of the linear plasmids have undergone one or more substantial inter-plasmid rearrangements since their last common ancestor.

A key mechanism for immune evasion and persistent infection by the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi , is antigenic variation of the VlsE surface protein. Recombination results in changes in the VlsE surface protein that prevent recognition by VlsE-specific antibodies in the infected host. Despite the presence of a substantial number of additional proteins residing on the bacterial surface, VlsE is the only known antigen that exhibits ongoing variation of its surface epitopes. This suggests that B. burgdorferi may utilize a VlsE-mediated system for immune avoidance of its surface antigens. To address this, the requirement of VlsE for host reinfection by the Lyme disease pathogen was investigated. Host-adapted wild type and VlsE mutant spirochetes were used to reinfect immunocompetent mice that had naturally cleared an infection with a VlsE-deficient clone. Our results demonstrate that variable VlsE is necessary for reinfection by B. burgdorferi , and this ability is directly related to evasion of the host antibody response. Moreover, the data presented here raise the possibility that VlsE prevents recognition of B. burgdorferi surface antigens from host antibodies.

The Lyme disease spirochete encodes such a system that is required for persistent infection. The vls locus, carried on a 29 kb linear plasmid (lp28-1) in the type strain B31, carries 15 silent cassettes from which information is unidirectionally transferred into the expression locus, vlsE. Recent studies have surprisingly shown that, with the exception of the RuvAB branch migrase, no other known recombination/repair proteins appear to play a role in the recombinational switching process. In the work presented here we show that G4 DNA can be formed by sequences within the B31 vlsE locus, prompting us to investigate the presence of potential G4-forming DNA throughout the vls locus of several Lyme spirochete strains and species. We found that runs of G, three nucleotides and longer occur at a very high density, with a greater than 100-fold strand-specific distribution in the vls locus of three B. burgdorferi strains as well as in B. afzelii and B. garinii, in spite of the bias for the use of A-T rich codons in Borrelia species.

It is transmitted by the bite of hard ticks, especially Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Previous studies showed that the Siberian chipmunk, Tamias sibiricus barberi , an introduced ground squirrel in the Forest of Sénart (near Paris, France) was highly infested by I. ricinus , and consequently infected by B. burgdorferi sl. An index of the contribution of chipmunks to the density of infected questing nymphs on the vegetation (i.e., the acarological risk for humans) was compared to that of bank voles ( Myodes glareolus ) and of wood mice ( Apodemus sylvaticus ), two known native and sympatric competent reservoir hosts. Chipmunks produced nearly 8.5 times more infected questing nymphs than voles and mice. Furthermore, they contribute to a higher diversity of B. burgdorferi sl genospecies ( B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii ). The contribution of chipmunks varied between years and seasons, according to tick availability.

Although the proportion that was female in the LNB group was greater than that of patients with Lyme arthritis, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10). Although older individuals are more likely to be female in the general Slovenian population, the age of patients with cutaneous versus non-cutaneous manifestations was not the explanation for the observed differences in gender. In conclusion, patients with cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis were predominantly female, whereas those with non-cutaneous manifestations were predominantly male. This provocative finding is unexplained but may have direct relevance to the pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis.",1621,0,0,1,0,es,en,

We conducted a prospective study in which blood culture was used to detect HGA infection in patients with a compatible clinical illness. Early Lyme disease was defined by the presence of erythema migrans. The epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory features of 44 patients with culture-confirmed HGA were compared with those of a convenience sample of 62 patients with early Lyme disease. Coinfected patients were excluded. Patients with HGA had more symptoms ( P = 0.003) and had a higher body temperature on presentation ( P < 0.001) than patients with early Lyme disease. HGA patients were also more likely to have a headache, dizziness, myalgias, abdominal pain, anorexia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, or elevated liver enzymes. A direct correlation between the number of symptoms and the duration of illness at time of presentation (rho = 0.389, P = 0.009) was observed for HGA patients but not for patients with Lyme disease.

Thus, there is a need to improve diagnostics for Lyme disease at the early stage, when antibiotic treatment is highly efficacious. We examined novel and established antigen markers to develop a multiplex panel that identifies early infection using the combined sensitivity of multiple markers while simultaneously maintaining high specificity by requiring positive results for two markers to designate a positive test. Ten markers were selected from our initial analysis of 62 B. burgdorferi surface proteins and synthetic peptides by assessing binding of IgG and IgM to each in a training set of Lyme disease patient samples and controls. In a validation set, this 10-antigen panel identified a higher proportion of early-Lyme-disease patients as positive at the baseline or posttreatment visit than two-tiered testing (87.5% and 67.5%, respectively; P < 0.05). Equivalent specificities of 100% were observed in 26 healthy controls. Upon further analysis, positivity on the novel 10-antigen panel was associated with longer illness duration and multiple erythema migrans. The improved sensitivity and comparable specificity of our 10-antigen panel compared to two-tiered testing in detecting early B. burgdorferi infection indicates that multiplex analysis, featuring the next generation of markers, could advance diagnostic technology to better aid clinicians in diagnosing and treating early Lyme disease.",1728,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Despite severe disease in humans, TBFV infection of natural rodent hosts has little noticeable effect. Currently, the basis for resistance to disease is not known. We hypothesize that the coevolution of flaviviruses with their respective hosts has shaped the evolution of potent antiviral factors that suppress virus replication and protect the host from lethal infection. In the current study, we compared virus infection between reservoir host cells and related susceptible species. Infection of primary fibroblasts from the white-footed mouse ( Peromyscus leucopus , a representative host) with a panel of vector-borne flaviviruses showed up to a 10,000-fold reduction in virus titer compared to control Mus musculus cells. Replication of vesicular stomatitis virus was equivalent in P . leucopus and M . musculus cells suggesting that restriction was flavivirus-specific. Step-wise comparison of the virus infection cycle revealed a significant block to viral RNA replication, but not virus entry, in P . leucopus cells. To understand the role of the type I interferon (IFN) response in virus restriction, we knocked down signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) by RNA interference. Loss of IFNAR1 or STAT1 significantly relieved the block in virus replication in P . leucopus cells. The major IFN antagonist encoded by TBFV, nonstructural protein 5, was functional in P . leucopus cells, thus ruling out ineffective viral antagonism of the host IFN response. Collectively, this work demonstrates that the IFN response of P . leucopus imparts a strong and virus-specific barrier to flavivirus replication. Future identification of the IFN-stimulated genes responsible for virus restriction specifically in P . leucopus will yield mechanistic insight into efficient control of virus replication and may inform the development of antiviral therapeutics.",2098,0,0,1,0,es,en,

In this study, we evaluated a novel assay for the direct detection of three species of Borrelia spirochetes in whole blood. The T2 magnetic resonance (T2MR) assay platform was used to amplify Borrelia DNA released from intact spirochetes and to detect amplicon. Analytical sensitivity was determined from blood spiked with known concentrations of spirochetes, and the assay's limit of detection was found to be in the single-cell-per-milliliter range: 5 cells/ml for B. afzelii and 8 cells/ml for Borrelia burgdorferi and Borrelia garinii . Clinical samples ( n = 66) from confirmed or suspected early LD patients were also analyzed. B. burgdorferi was detected using T2MR in 2/2 (100%) of blood samples from patients with confirmed early LD, based on the presence of erythema migrans and documentation of seroconversion or a positive real-time blood PCR. T2MR detected B. burgdorferi in blood samples from 17/54 (31%) of patients with probable LD, based on the presence of erythema migrans without documented seroconversion or of documented seroconversion in patients with a compatible clinical syndrome but without erythema migrans. Out of 21 clinical samples tested by real-time PCR, only 1 was positive and 13 were negative with agreement with T2MR. An additional 7 samples that were negative by real-time PCR were positive with T2MR.

If not treated with antibiotics during the early stages of infection, disseminated infection can spread to the central nervous system (CNS). In non-human primates (NHPs) it has been demonstrated that the leptomeninges are among the tissues colonized by B . burgdorferi spirochetes. Although the NHP model parallels aspects of human borreliosis, a small rodent model would be ideal to study the trafficking of spirochetes and immune cells into the CNS. Here we show that during early and late disseminated infection, B . burgdorferi infects the meninges of intradermally infected mice, and is associated with concurrent increases in meningeal T cells. We found that the dura mater was consistently culture positive for spirochetes in transcardially perfused mice, independent of the strain of B . burgdorferi used. Within the dura mater, spirochetes were preferentially located in vascular regions, but were also present in perivascular, and extravascular regions, as late as 75 days post-infection. At the same end-point, we observed significant increases in the number of CD3+ T cells within the pia and dura mater, as compared to controls. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes isolated from the dura mater revealed that CD3+ cell populations were comprised of both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Overall, our data demonstrate that similarly to infection in peripheral tissues, spirochetes adhere to the dura mater during disseminated infection, and are associated with increases in the number of meningeal T cells. Collectively, our results demonstrate that there are aspects of B . burgdorferi meningeal infection that can be modelled in laboratory mice, suggesting that mice may be useful for elucidating mechanisms of meningeal pathogenesis by B . burgdorferi .",1914,0,0,1,0,es,en,

The STT algorithm has low sensitivity in early infection, and there are drawbacks associated with the WB use in practice. Modified two-tiered (MTT) algorithms have been shown to improve the sensitivity of the testing in early disease while maintaining high specificity.

Methods This prospective economic evaluation, adhering a societal perspective, was performed alongside the PLEASE study, a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind 1:1:1 randomized clinical trial in which all patients received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for two weeks before the 12-week randomized blinded oral antibiotic regimen (doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo). Between 2010 and 2013, patients (n = 271) with borreliosis-attributed persistent symptoms were enrolled and followed for one year. Main outcomes were costs, quality-adjusted life years, and incremental net monetary benefit of longer-term versus shorter-term antibiotic therapy. Results Mean quality-adjusted life years (95% CI) were not significantly different (p = 0.96): 0.82 (0.77–0.88) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline (n = 82), 0.81 (0.76–0.88) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine (n = 93), and 0.81 (0.76–0.86) for ceftriaxone/placebo (n = 96). Total societal costs per patient (95% CI) were not significantly different either (p = 0.35): €11,995 (€8,823-€15,670) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline, €12,202 (€9,572-€15,253) for ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine, and €15,249 (€11,294-€19,781) for ceftriaxone/placebo. Incremental net monetary benefit (95% CI) for ceftriaxone/doxycycline compared to ceftriaxone/placebo varied from €3,317 (-€2,199-€8,998) to €4,285 (-€6,085-€14,524) over the willingness-to-pay range, and that of ceftriaxone/clarithromycin-hydroxychloroquine compared to ceftriaxone/placebo from €3,098 (-€888-€7,172) to €3,710 (-€4,254-€11,651).

The objective of this review was to characterize the body of literature on the economic burden of Lyme disease (LD) and the cost-effectiveness of LD interventions, such as antibiotic treatment and vaccination. Methods We followed Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodologies. We systematically searched terms related to LD, economic evaluations, costs, and cost-effectiveness in Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane Library, and the grey literature up to November 2017. We included primary economic evaluations conducted in North America and Europe, reporting LD-related costs or cost-effectiveness of human interventions. Two reviewers screened articles and charted data independently. Costs were standardized to 2017 United States dollars (USD). Results We screened 923 articles, and included 10 cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) and 11 cost analyses (CA). Three CEAs concluded LD vaccination was likely cost-effective only in endemic areas (probability of infection ≥1%). However, LD vaccination is not currently available as an intervention in the US or Europe. Six studies assessed economic burden from a societal perspective and estimated significant annual national economic impact of: 735,550 USD for Scotland (0.14 USD per capita, population = 5.40M), 142,562 USD in Sweden (0.014 USD per capita, 9.96M), 40.88M USD in Germany (0.51 USD per capita, 80.59M), 23.12M USD in the Netherlands (1.36 USD per capita, 17.08M), and up to 786M USD in the US (2.41 USD per capita, 326.63M). Conclusions Lyme disease imposes an economic burden that could be considered significant in the US and other developed countries to justify further research efforts in disease control and management. Societal costs for Lyme disease can be equally impactful as healthcare costs, but are not fully understood. Economic literature from countries with historically high incidence rates or increasing rates of Lyme disease are limited, and can be useful for future justification of resource allocation.",2148,0,0,1,0,es,en,

Passive tick surveillance programs that encourage members of the public to submit ticks they have encountered can provide a relatively low-cost means of collecting such data. We report the results of 11 years of tick submissions (2006–2016) collected in Monmouth County, New Jersey, an Atlantic coastal county long endemic for Lyme disease. A total of 8,608 ticks acquired in 22 U.S. states were submitted, 89.7% of which were acquired in Monmouth County, from 52 of the County’s 53 municipalities. Seasonal submission rates reflected known phenology of common human-biting ticks, but annual submissions of both Amblyomma americanum and Dermacentor variabilis increased significantly over time while numbers of Ixodes scapularis remained static. By 2016, A . americanum had expanded northward in the county and now accounted for nearly half (48.1%) of submissions, far outpacing encounters with I . scapularis (28.2% of submissions). Across all tick species and stages the greatest number of ticks were removed from children (ages 0–9, 40.8%) and older adults (ages 50+, 23.8%) and these age groups were also more likely to submit partially or fully engorged ticks, suggesting increased risk of tick-borne disease transmission to these vulnerable age groups. Significantly more people (43.2%) reported acquiring ticks at their place of residence than in a park or natural area (17.9%). This pattern was more pronounced for residents over 60 years of age (72.7% acquired at home). Education that stresses frequent tick checks should target older age groups engaged in activity around the home. Our results strongly suggest that encounter rates with ticks other than I . scapularis are substantial and increasing and that their role in causing human illness should be carefully investigated.",1952,0,0,1,0,es,en,

Nevertheless, Australian patients exist, some of whom have not left the country, who have symptoms consistent with so-called “chronic Lyme disease”. Blood specimens from these individuals may be tested in Australian laboratories and in specialist laboratories outside Australia and sometimes conflicting results are obtained. Such discrepancies cause the patients to question the results from the Australian laboratories and seek assistance from the Australian Government in clarifying why the discrepancies occur. The aim of this study was to determine the level of agreement in results between commonly used B . burgdorferi serology assays in specimens of known status, and between results reported by different laboratories when they use the same serology assay. Five immunoassays and five immunoblots used in Australia and elsewhere were examined for the detection of IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Predominantly, archived specimens previously tested for Lyme disease were used for the study and included 639 contributed by seven clinical laboratories located either in Australia or in areas endemic for Lyme disease. Also included were 308 prospectively collected Australian blood donor specimens. All clinical specimens were tested in all 10 assays whereas blood donor specimens were tested in all immunoassays and a subset was tested on immunoblots. With the exception of one immunoblot, the results between the assays agreed with each other in a known positive specimen population ≥ 77% of the time and in a known negative population, 88% of the time or greater. The test results obtained during the study were different from the participating laboratory’s less than 2% of the time when the same assay was used. These findings suggest that discordance in results between laboratories is more likely due to variation in algorithms or in the use of assays with different sensitivities or specificities rather than conflicting results being reported from the same assay in different laboratories. In the known negative population, specificities of the immunoassays ranged between 87.7% and 99.7%. In Australia’s low prevalence population, this would translate to a positive predictive value of < 4%.",2370,0,0,1,0,es,en,

Recently, the northward range expansion of I . scapularis ticks, in south-eastern Canada, has resulted in a dramatic increase in the incidence of human Lyme disease. Detecting emerging areas of Lyme disease risk allows public health to target disease prevention efforts. We analysed passive tick surveillance data from Ontario and Manitoba to i) assess the relationship between the total numbers of I . scapularis submissions in passive surveillance from humans, and the number of human Lyme disease cases, and ii) develop province-specific acarological indicators of risk that can be used to generate surveillance-based risk maps. We also assessed associations between numbers of nymphal I . scapularis tick submissions only and Lyme disease case incidence. Using General Estimating Equation regression, the relationship between I . scapularis submissions (total numbers and numbers of nymphs only) in each census sub-division (CSD) and the number of reported Lyme disease cases was positively correlated and highly significant in the two provinces ( P ≤ 0.001). The numbers of I . scapularis submissions over five years discriminated CSDs with ≥ 3 Lyme disease cases from those with < 3 cases with high accuracy when using total numbers of tick submission (Receiver Operating Characteristics area under the curve [AUC] = 0.89) and moderate accuracy (AUC = 0.78) when using nymphal tick submissions only. In Ontario the optimal cut-off point was a total 12 tick submissions from a CSD over five years (Sensitivity = 0.82, Specificity = 0.84), while in Manitoba the cut-off point was five ticks (Sensitivity = 0.71, Specificity = 0.79) suggesting regional variability of the risk of acquiring Lyme disease from an I . scapularis bite. The performances of the acarological indicators developed in this study for Ontario and Manitoba support the ability of passive tick surveillance to provide an early signal of the existence Lyme disease risk areas in regions where ticks and the pathogens they transmit are expanding their range.",2274,0,0,1,0,es,en,

In most cases, the presence of intrathecally produced Borrelia -specific antibodies is determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The edge effect is a known phenomenon in ELISAs and can negatively influence the assay reproducibility and repeatability, as well as index calculations of sample pairs which are tested in the same run. For LNB diagnostics, an index calculation is used for which the relative amounts of Borrelia -specific antibodies in CSF and serum are measured to calculate a CSF/serum quotient, which is needed to calculate the Borrelia -specific antibody index (AI). The presence of an edge effect in an ELISA used for LNB diagnostics may thus have implications. In this study, we investigated the intra-assay variation of the commercial Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG ELISA used for LNB diagnostics and showed the presence of an edge effect. Minor adaptations in the ELISA protocol decreased this effect. The adapted protocol was subsequently used to test 149 CSF-serum pairs of consecutive patients received in a routine diagnostic laboratory. By simulation, we showed that, if the standard protocol would have been used, then the edge effect for this study population could have resulted in 15 (10.1%) false-pathological and two (1.3%) false-normal Borrelia -specific IgG AIs. Thus, the observed edge effect can lead to inaccurate LNB diagnoses. Our study underlines that the edge effect should be investigated when ELISAs are implemented in routine diagnostics, as this phenomenon can occur in any ELISA.",1723,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The scale of such use in the U.S. and associated side effects are unknown. Methods and Findings We surveyed attendees at annual CAM Conferences in 2006 and 2008, and determined sales of intravenous vitamin C by major U.S. manufacturers/distributors. We also queried practitioners for side effects, compiled published cases, and analyzed FDA's Adverse Events Database. Of 199 survey respondents (out of 550), 172 practitioners administered IV vitamin C to 11,233 patients in 2006 and 8876 patients in 2008. Average dose was 28 grams every 4 days, with 22 total treatments per patient. Estimated yearly doses used (as 25g/50ml vials) were 318,539 in 2006 and 354,647 in 2008. Manufacturers' yearly sales were 750,000 and 855,000 vials, respectively. Common reasons for treatment included infection, cancer, and fatigue. Of 9,328 patients for whom data is available, 101 had side effects, mostly minor, including lethargy/fatigue in 59 patients, change in mental status in 21 patients and vein irritation/phlebitis in 6 patients. Publications documented serious adverse events, including 2 deaths in patients known to be at risk for IV vitamin C. Due to confounding causes, the FDA Adverse Events Database was uninformative. Total numbers of patients treated in the US with high dose vitamin C cannot be accurately estimated from this study. Conclusions High dose IV vitamin C is in unexpectedly wide use by CAM practitioners. Other than the known complications of IV vitamin C in those with renal impairment or glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, high dose intravenous vitamin C appears to be remarkably safe. Physicians should inquire about IV vitamin C use in patients with cancer, chronic, untreatable, or intractable conditions and be observant of unexpected harm, drug interactions, or benefit.",1976,0,0,0,1,es,en,

It is sufficient for one of the classes to have a scale-free degree distribution with a slow enough decay for the network to have asymptotically vanishing epidemic threshold. Data on the distribution of Ixodes ricinus ticks on mice and lizards from two independent studies are well described by a scale-free distribution compatible with an asymptotically vanishing epidemic threshold. The commonly used negative binomial, instead, cannot describe the right tail of the empirical distribution.

During the borrelial tick-to-mammal life cycle, B. burgdorferi must adapt to many environmental changes by regulating several genes, including bba64 . Our laboratory recently demonstrated that the bba64 gene product is necessary for mouse infectivity when B. burgdorferi is transmitted by an infected tick bite, but not via needle inoculation. In this study we investigated the phenotypic properties of a bba64 mutant strain, including 1) replication during tick engorgement, 2) migration into the nymphal salivary glands, 3) host transmission, and 4) susceptibility to the MyD88-dependent innate immune response. Results revealed that the bba64 mutant's attenuated infectivity by tick bite was not due to a growth defect inside an actively feeding nymphal tick, or failure to invade the salivary glands. These findings suggested there was either a lack of spirochete transmission to the host dermis or increased susceptibility to the host's innate immune response. Further experiments showed the bba64 mutant was not culturable from mouse skin taken at the nymphal bite site and was unable to establish infection in MyD88-deficient mice via tick infestation. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that BBA64 functions at the salivary gland-to-host delivery interface of vector transmission and is not involved in resistance to MyD88-mediated innate immunity.",1495,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Several factors may affect the clinical outcome of EM, e.g. the early interaction between Borrelia ( B. ) burgdorferi and the host immune response, the B. burgdorferi genotype, antibiotic treatment as well as other clinical circumstances. Our study was designed to determine whether early cytokine expression in the skin and in peripheral blood in patients with EM is associated with the clinical outcome. Methods A prospective follow-up study of 109 patients with EM was conducted at the Åland Islands, Finland. Symptoms were evaluated at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months post-treatment. Skin biopsies from the EM and healthy skin were immunohistochemically analysed for expression of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12p70 and interferon (IFN)-γ, as well as for B. burgdorferi DNA. Blood samples were analysed for B. burgdorferi antibodies, allergic predisposition and levels of systemic cytokines. Findings None of the patients developed late manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. However, at the 6-month follow-up, 7 of 88 patients reported persisting symptoms of diverse character. Compared to asymptomatic patients, these 7 patients showed decreased expression of the Th1-associated cytokine IFN-γ in the EM biopsies (p = 0.003). B. afzelii DNA was found in 48%, B. garinii in 15% and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto in 1% of the EM biopsies, and species distribution was the same in patients with and without post-treatment symptoms. The two groups did not differ regarding baseline patient characteristics, B. burgdorferi antibodies, allergic predisposition or systemic cytokine levels. Conclusion Patients with persisting symptoms following an EM show a decreased Th1-type inflammatory response in infected skin early during the infection, which might reflect a dysregulation of the early immune response.

Although accumulating research has proposed a trade-off between life-history strategies and immune defences, only a few studies extended this to host species' reservoir competence. Using a phylogenetic comparative approach, we studied the relationships between some species' life-history traits and reservoir competence in three emerging infectious vector-borne disease systems, namely Lyme disease, West Nile Encephalitis (WNE) and Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE). The results showed that interspecific variation in reservoir competence could be partly explained by the species' life histories. Species with larger body mass (for hosts of Lyme disease and WNE) or smaller clutch size (for hosts of EEE) had a higher reservoir competence. Given that both larger body mass and smaller clutch size were linked to higher extinction risk of local populations, our study suggests that with decreasing biodiversity, species with a higher reservoir competence are more likely to remain in the community, and thereby increase the risk of transmitting these pathogens, which might be a possible mechanism underlying the dilution effect.",1328,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Reliable methods to identify the infectious diseases of humans and animals and that are most likely to be influenced by climate are therefore required. Since different priorities will affect the decision to address a particular pathogen threat, decision makers need a standardised method of prioritisation. Ranking methods and Multi-Criteria Decision approaches provide such a standardised method and were employed here to design two different pathogen prioritisation tools. The opinion of 64 experts was elicited to assess the importance of 40 criteria that could be used to prioritise emerging infectious diseases of humans and animals in Canada. A weight was calculated for each criterion according to the expert opinion. Attributes were defined for each criterion as a transparent and repeatable method of measurement. Two different Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis tools were tested, both of which used an additive aggregation approach. These were an Excel spreadsheet tool and a tool developed in software ‘M-MACBETH’. The tools were trialed on nine ‘test’ pathogens. Two different methods of criteria weighting were compared, one using fixed weighting values, the other using probability distributions to account for uncertainty and variation in expert opinion. The ranking of the nine pathogens varied according to the weighting method that was used. In both tools, using both weighting methods, the diseases that tended to rank the highest were West Nile virus, Giardiasis and Chagas, while Coccidioidomycosis tended to rank the lowest. Both tools are a simple and user friendly approach to prioritising pathogens according to climate change by including explicit scoring of 40 criteria and incorporating weighting methods based on expert opinion. They provide a dynamic interactive method that can help to identify pathogens for which a full risk assessment should be pursued.",1989,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Aiming to quantify the infection risk at point of care by physicians, we explored risk factors such as tick testing for Borrelia and assessment of the duration of the tick's blood meal. Methods and Findings Questionnaires, blood samples and ticks from patients who consulted one of 307 general practitioners for tick bites (n = 327) or EM (n = 283) in 2007 and 2008, were collected at enrolment and three months later at follow-up. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato DNA was detected in 29.3% of 314 ticks, using PCR/reverse line blot and real-time PCR on the OspA gene. Seroconversion in C6 ELISA, IgM or IgG immunoblots for Borrelia -specific antibodies was observed in 3.2% of tick bite cases. Fourteen tick bite cases had evidence of early Borrelia infection, of which EM developed among seven cases. The risk of developing EM after tick bites was 2.6% (95%CI: 1.1%–5.0%), and the risk of either EM or seroconversion was 5.1% (95%CI: 2.9%–8.2%). Participants with Borrelia -positive ticks had a significantly higher risk of either EM or seroconversion (odds ratio 4.8, 95%CI: 1.1–20.4), and of seroconversion alone (odds ratio 11.1, 95%CI: 1.1–108.9). A third (34%) of the cases enrolled with EM did not recall preceding tick bites. Three EM cases (1%) reported persisting symptoms, three months after standard antibiotic treatment for EM.

The objective of this study was to characterize the structure and regulation of subolesin in Ixodes scapularis. I. scapularis is a vector of emerging pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia microti that cause in humans Lyme disease, anaplasmosis and babesiosis, respectively. The genome of I. scapularis was recently sequenced, and this tick serves as a model organism for the study of vector-host-pathogen interactions. However, basic biological questions such as gene organization and regulation are largely unknown in ticks and other arthropod vectors. Principal Findings The results presented here provide evidence that subolesin / akirin are evolutionarily conserved at several levels (primary sequence, gene organization and function), thus supporting their crucial biological function in metazoans. These results showed that NF-kB (Relish) is involved in the regulation of subolesin expression in ticks, suggesting that as in other organisms, different NF-kB integral subunits and/or unknown interacting proteins regulate the specificity of the NF-kB-mediated gene expression. These results suggested a regulatory network involving cross-regulation between NF-kB (Relish) and Subolesin and Subolesin auto-regulation with possible implications in tick immune response to bacterial infection. Significance These results advance our understanding of gene organization and regulation in I. scapularis and have important implications for arthropod vectors genetics and immunology highlighting the possible role of NF-kB and Subolesin/Akirin in vector-pathogen interactions and for designing new strategies for the control of vector infestations and pathogen transmission.",2101,0,0,0,1,es,en,

We have developed an internally controlled duplex quantitative real time PCR assay targeting the Borrelia 16S rRNA and the human RNAseP genes. This assay is well-suited for laboratory confirmation of suspected cases of LB and will be used to assess the efficacy of a vaccine against LB in clinical trials. The assay is highly specific, successfully detecting DNA extracted from 83 diverse B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains representing all major species causing LB, while 21 unrelated microbial species and human genomic DNA tested negative. The assay was highly reproducible and sensitive, with a lower limit of detection of 6 copies per PCR reaction. Together with culture, the assay was used to evaluate paired 3 mm skin biopsy samples taken from 121 patients presenting with solitary erythema migrans (EM) lesion. PCR testing identified more positive biopsy samples than culture (77.7% PCR positive versus 55.1% culture positive) and correctly identified all specimens scored as culture positive. OspA-based typing identified the majority of isolates as B. afzelii (96.8%) and the bacterial load was significantly higher in culture positive biopsies than in culture negative biopsies ( P <0.001). The quantitative data also enabled relationships between Borrelia burden and patient symptoms to be evaluated. The bacterial load was significantly higher among patients with systemic symptoms than without ( P = 0.02) and was significantly higher for biopsies retrieved from patients with EM lesions with central clearing ( P <0.001). 16S copy numbers were moderately lower in samples from patients reporting a history of LB ( P = 0.10).

Since OCB tests are based on non-quantitative and difficult to standardise techniques, measurement of immunoglobulin kappa free light chains (KFLC) may represent an easier to use quantitative test. Methods KFLC were measured in CSF and serum of 211 patients using ELISA. These include patients without any inflammatory central nervous system reaction (NIND, n = 77), MS (n = 20), viral CNS infections (V-CNS-I, n = 10), neuroborreliosis (NB, n = 17) and other bacterial CNS infections (B-CNS-I, n = 10).

These features make the Borrelia burgdorferi species complex an attractive biological model that can be used to study the diversification and the epidemiology of endemic bacterial pathogens. We investigated the potential of population genomic approaches to study these processes. Sixty-three strains belonging to three species within the Borrelia burgdorferi complex were isolated from questing ticks in Alsace (France), a region where Lyme disease is highly endemic. We first aimed to characterize the degree of genetic isolation among the species sampled. Phylogenetic and coalescent-based analyses revealed clear delineations: there was a ∼50 fold difference between intra-specific and inter-specific recombination rates. We then investigated whether the population genomic data contained information of epidemiological relevance. In phylogenies inferred using most of the genome, conspecific strains did not cluster in clades. These results raise questions about the relevance of different strategies when investigating pathogen epidemiology. For instance, here, both classical analytic approaches and phylodynamic simulations suggested that population sizes and migration rates were higher in B. garinii populations, which are normally associated with birds, than in B. burgdorferi s.s. populations. The phylogenetic analyses of the infection-related ospC gene and its flanking region provided additional support for this finding. Traces of recombination among the B. burgdorferi s.s. lineages and lineages associated with small mammals were found, suggesting that they shared the same hosts.

We found that the majority of sequencing reads were removed during host subtraction, thus there was very low microbial RNA content in the plasma. The effects of sample batching and contamination during sample processing proved to outweigh the effects of study group on microbial RNA content, as the few differences in bacterial or viral RNA abundance we did observe between study groups were most likely caused by contamination and batch effects. Our results highlight the importance of including negative controls in all metagenomic analyses, since there was considerable overlap between bacterial content identified in study samples and control samples.

However, no MS profile change was found when paired body part comparison between non-infected and B . afzelii infected specimens was made. Statistical analyses did not succeed to discover, per body part, specific MS peaks distinguishing Borrelia -infected from non-infected ticks whatever their origins, laboratory reared or field collected. Despite the unsuccessful of MALDI-TOF MS to classify tick specimens according to their B . afzelii infectious status, this proteomic tool remains a promising method for rapid, economic and accurate identification of tick species. Moreover, the singularity of MS spectra between legs and half-idiosome of I . ricinus could be used to reinforce this proteomic identification by submission of both these compartments to MS.",2063,0,0,0,1,es,en,

The diagnosis of LB today is based on the patient´s medical history, clinical presentation and laboratory findings. The laboratory diagnostics are mainly based on antibody detection, but in certain conditions molecular detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may serve as a complement. Aim The purpose of this study was to evaluate the analytical sensitivity, analytical specificity and concordance of eight different real-time PCR methods at five laboratories in Sweden, Norway and Denmark. Method Each participating laboratory was asked to analyse three different sets of samples (reference panels; all blinded) i) cDNA extracted and transcribed from water spiked with cultured Borrelia strains, ii) cerebrospinal fluid spiked with cultured Borrelia strains, and iii) DNA dilution series extracted from cultured Borrelia and relapsing fever strains. The results and the method descriptions of each laboratory were systematically evaluated. Results and conclusions The analytical sensitivities and the concordance between the eight protocols were in general high. The concordance was especially high between the protocols using 16S rRNA as the target gene, however, this concordance was mainly related to cDNA as the type of template. When comparing cDNA and DNA as the type of template the analytical sensitivity was in general higher for the protocols using DNA as template regardless of the use of target gene. The analytical specificity for all eight protocols was high. However, some protocols were not able to detect Borrelia spielmanii , Borrelia lusitaniae or Borrelia japonica .",1683,0,0,0,1,es,en,

We use data from a national survey in Sweden with respondents in geographical areas with substantial differences in both abundance of ticks and incidence of LB and TBE. We find that the share of respondents who frequently use protective clothing (64%), perform tick checks (63%) or avoid tall grass while in areas with ticks (48%) is relatively high. However, the use of protective measures is uneven and a considerably lower share tuck their trousers into their socks (18%), use repellent against ticks (16%) or use a combination of protective measures. Thirty-one per cent of the respondents report one or more tick bites in the last year and 68% report one or more lifetime tick bites, indicating that it is difficult to protect oneself from tick bites. There is a strong positive association between exposure and checking the skin for ticks, but exposure is only weakly associated with other protective measures. Tick bites are perceived as a serious health risk by as many as 43% of the respondents. The perception that a single tick bite is serious is negatively associated with actual exposure to ticks, while the opposite is true for the perception that tick bites constitute a serious lifetime health risk. This indicates a learning effect in relation to risk perceptions and the performance of tick checks, but not in relation to other protective measures. Recommendations include informing people of the risks associated with tick bites, the efficacy of various protective measures and the importance of combining multiple types of protection. Given the high exposure to tick bites, the growing incidence of TBE and LB, and the difficulties in preventing tick bites, other preventive measures should be further discussed, including vaccination programmes.",2017,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Despite the numerous species of tick vectors in the heavily populated North American West Coast, all but Ixodes pacificus , the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete, is poorly characterized with regard to seasonal activity patterns and fine scale drivers of distribution and abundance, particularly in heavily populated regions of southern California. This lack of knowledge inhibits both scientific understanding and public health efforts to minimize vector exposure and risk of pathogen transmission to humans. Here we address this gap by characterizing the abiotic and habitat drivers of the distribution, abundance, and diversity of the vector tick community using fine scale temporal surveys over two seasons (2014 and 2015) across coastal and inland regions of Santa Barbara County, CA. We also characterize patterns of seasonal activity of the more common vector species to understand seasonality in risk of vector exposure, and specifically focus on human encounter risk using standardized tick drags as our method of collection. Leveraging plot-level habitat and abiotic variables in partial least squares regression analysis, we find the seven different vector species collected in this study have divergent drivers of activity and abundance. For example, I . pacificus is strongly associated with dense forest habitats and cool and moist microclimates, while Dermacentor occidentalis and Dermacentor variabilis , competent vectors of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, were found to be more tolerant of higher average temperatures and more open habitats. These results suggest that I . pacificus may be expected to experience reductions in geographic distribution and seasonal activity under projected land cover and climate change in coastal southern California, while D . occidentalis may experience more limited effects. We discuss implications for changing tick-borne disease risk associated with pathogens transmitted by Ixodes as well as Dermacentor species ticks in the western US, and contrast these predictions with eastern North America.",2275,0,0,0,1,es,en,

B . burgdorferi is a spirochetal bacterium that causes Lyme disease while protozoan pathogens belonging to Babesia species are responsible for babesiosis. Currently used serological tests do not always detect acute Lyme disease or babesiosis, and fail to differentiate cured patients from those who get re-infected. This is a major problem for proper diagnosis particularly in regions endemic for tick-borne diseases. Microscopy based evaluation of babesiosis is confirmatory but is labor intensive and insensitive such that many asymptomatic patients remain undetected and donate blood resulting in transfusion transmitted babesiosis. Results We conducted multiplex qPCR for simultaneous diagnosis of active Lyme disease and babesiosis in 192 blood samples collected from a region endemic for both diseases. We document qPCR results obtained from testing of each sample three times to detect infection with each pathogen separately or together. Results for Lyme disease by qPCR were also compared with serological tests currently used for Lyme disease when available. Considering at least two out of three test results for consistency, 18.2% of patients tested positive for Lyme disease, 18.7% for co-infection with B . burgdorferi and B . microti and 6.3% showed only babesiosis. Conclusions With an 80% sensitivity for detection of Lyme disease, and ability to detect co-infection with B . microti , multiplex qPCR can be employed for diagnosis of these diseases to start appropriate treatment in a timely manner.",1708,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Both passive and active surveillance approaches have been employed by public health professionals (i.e., government employees) to monitor for the range expansion of this tick. Field surveillance using drag sampling for questing ticks is a recognized and effective method to identify reproducing tick populations. The degree of effort (i.e., number of visits per site) can enhance the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance, but increased effort conflicts with the cost to public health for field surveillance. Here we developed an indicator to determine the likelihood of I . scapularis establishment based on field sampling results. Field data from two established populations of I . scapularis in Ontario were incorporated with previous analyses of surveillance data to create the indicator, which is in the form of a scoring system. The life stage(s) collected, overall abundance and past surveillance findings from a site are all considered and a level is assigned for the likelihood of I . scapularis establishment based on current field sampling results. The likelihood levels are non-zero (i.e., no I . scapularis detected, but risk still present due to adventitious ticks), low, medium or high, and recommendations for future surveillance and public health measures are provided. The indicator was validated against field sampling results from five other established sites in the province and correctly categorized all five areas as high likelihood of establishment. The indicator was also applied to field sampling results from 36 sites of unknown status that were visited twice during the period of 2014–2016.

TBRF spirochetes are related to Borrelia burgdorferi , the agent of Lyme borreliosis. Dogs are routinely screened for B. burgdorferi , but it is unknown if infection with TBRF agents produces antibodies cross-reactive with B. burgdorferi assays. These data are critical for accurate surveillance of TBRF and Lyme borreliosis in dogs. In this study, B. burgdorferi -negative dogs were inoculated with B. turicatae , and seroconversion was confirmed by the rBipA (recombinant Borrelia immunogenic protein A) Western blot.

For epidemiological studies, accurate identification of ticks is crucial to define their potential role as vectors and to develop control and prevention strategies. Although morphological and molecular methods are widely used to identify ticks, an innovative approach using MALDI-TOF MS technology recently emerged as an alternative tool. Previous works showed that MALDI-TOF MS was highly effective in identifying ticks, but these works mainly tested tick specimens of different genera. To confirm the accuracy of this new tool for tick identification, nine closely related tick species belonging to the Ixodes genus were analysed, specimens of the Dermacentor reticulatus species were also included in the analysis as an outer group. Three of the species used for the present study belonged to the I . ricinus species complex, which are known to transmit Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme borreliosis. A total of 246 tick specimens were submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis, and two body parts (half-idiosoma and four legs) were individually investigated. For each body part, intraspecies reproducibility and interspecies specificity of the MS profiles were determined. The profile analysis revealed that the main determinant for spectra clustering was the tick species for both legs and half-idiosoma. For each body part, a reference database of spectra was set up including 2 to 5 specimens per species randomly selected, and genotyped using 16s rDNA and COI genes to confirm their morphological identification. Both created spectral databases were individually blind tested with their respective body part using the remaining specimens, which were correctly identified in 98.5% of the cases. MALDI-TOF MS is a reliable tool for tick identification, including specimens belonging to closely related species and hardly distinguishable using morphology. The 4-legs as well as the half-idiosoma of ticks can now be applied for specimen identification using two different databases. The combined use of these two body parts improves the rate of tick identification and their confidence level.",2212,0,0,0,1,es,en,

Patients with an erythema migrans lesion and epidemiologic risk can receive a diagnosis without laboratory testing. For all other patients, laboratory testing is necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but proper interpretation depends on symptoms and timing of illness. The recommended laboratory test in the United States is 2-tiered serologic analysis consisting of an enzyme-linked immunoassay or immunofluorescence assay, followed by reflexive immunoblotting. Sensitivity of 2-tiered testing is low (30%–40%) during early infection while the antibody response is developing (window period). For disseminated Lyme disease, sensitivity is 70%–100%. Specificity is high (>95%) during all stages of disease. Use of other diagnostic tests for Lyme disease is limited. We review the rationale behind current US testing guidelines, appropriate use and interpretation of tests, and recent developments in Lyme disease diagnostics.",1050,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Methods We conducted two randomized trials: one in 78 patients who were seropositive for IgG antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi at the time of enrollment and the other in 51 patients who were seronegative. The patients received either intravenous ceftriaxone, 2 g daily for 30 days, followed by oral doxycycline, 200 mg daily for 60 days, or matching intravenous and oral placebos. Each patient had well-documented, previously treated Lyme disease but had persistent musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms, or dysesthesia, often associated with fatigue. The primary outcome measures were improvement on the physical- and mental-health–component summary scales of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) — a scale measuring the health-related quality of life — on day 180 of the study. Results After a planned interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended that the studies be discontinued because data from the first 107 patients indicated that it was highly unlikely that a significant difference in treatment efficacy between the groups would be observed with the planned full enrollment of 260 patients. Base-line assessments documented severe impairment in the patients' health-related quality of life. In intention-to-treat analyses, there were no significant differences in the outcomes with prolonged antibiotic treatment as compared with placebo among either the seropositive or the seronegative patients. Conclusions There is considerable impairment of health-related quality of life among patients with persistent symptoms despite previous antibiotic treatment for acute Lyme disease. However, in these two trials, treatment with intravenous and oral antibiotics for 90 days did not improve symptoms more than placebo. Introduction Antibiotic treatment is highly effective for the acute and late septic manifestations of Lyme disease, which is caused by the tick-borne bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi . 1 However, some patients have persistent fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias without arthritis, dysesthesias or paresthesias, or mood and memory disturbances after the standard courses of antibiotics. 2,3 Persistent symptoms have been reported both in patients who are seropositive for antibodies against B. burgdorferi and in patients who are seronegative. Although the cause of persistent symptoms has not been determined, their temporal association with B. burgdorferi infection has led some physicians to treat patients with prolonged courses of antibiotics. Case reports and uncontrolled trials describe success with prolonged antibiotic therapy, often with a recurrence of the symptoms after the discontinuation of therapy. 4 In view of the substantial morbidity and even death 5 associated with prolonged parenteral antibiotic treatment of Lyme disease, it is important to determine the efficacy of such therapy. We report results from randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials of antibiotic therapy in seropositive and seronegative patients who had chronic symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease. Methods Patients Patients were recruited by means of advertisements and referrals from physicians. Between July 24, 1997, and November 14, 2000, eligible patients were enrolled in two double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, each conducted at three sites. Patients with a positive Western blot for IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens 6 were enrolled in a study of seropositive patients, and patients who were seronegative were enrolled in a separate study. Seronegative patients were required to have documentation of an erythema migrans skin lesion provided by an experienced physician. We initially planned to enroll 260 patients in the studies (194 seropositive and 66 seronegative patients). Patients were eligible if they were at least 18 years old, had a history of acute Lyme disease acquired in the United States, and had at least one of the following: a history of single or multiple erythema migrans skin lesions, early neurologic or cardiac symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, radiculoneuropathy, or Lyme arthritis. Documentation by a physician of previous treatment of acute Lyme disease with a recommended antibiotic regimen was also required. At the time of enrollment, all patients had one or more of the following symptoms that interfered with their functioning: widespread musculoskeletal pain, cognitive impairment, radicular pain, paresthesias, or dysesthesias. Profound fatigue often accompanied one or more of these symptoms. The chronic symptoms had to have begun within 6 months after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi and had to have persisted for at least 6 months but less than 12 years. Patients were excluded if they had hypersensitivity to the study medications, had previously received parenteral antibiotic therapy for 60 days or more for their current symptoms, had active inflammatory synovitis, had a coexisting condition that could have accounted for their symptoms, or were unable to discontinue medications that could interfere with the evaluation of their response to the treatment regimen (e.g., narcotic analgesics or prednisone in a dose of 10 mg per day or more). Patients with a positive polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) test for B. burgdorferi DNA in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid at base line were also excluded. Study Protocols The study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards for human investigations at the participating centers, and each patient gave written informed consent. A data and safety monitoring board planned an interim analysis after at least 110 subjects had been enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either antibiotics or placebo. The antibiotic treatment regimen consisted of intravenous ceftriaxone for 30 consecutive days (2 g per day), followed by oral doxycycline for 60 consecutive days (100 mg twice daily). The patients in the placebo group received an intravenous dextrose solution that was the same color as the ceftriaxone solution and oral placebo capsules identical in appearance to the doxycycline, both for the same lengths of time as the antibiotics were administered. Compliance and safety were monitored by home visits by study nurses every other day during the intravenous-treatment phase and twice (on days 45 and 75) during the oral-treatment phase. Clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed at screening, at base line, and on days 3, 5, 13, 21, 30, 45, 75, 90, and 180. The base-line evaluation included a complete medical history taking, a detailed physical examination, neuropsychological testing, a lumbar puncture, and sampling of peripheral blood. Clinical Response The primary outcome was an improvement in the patients' health-related quality of life, which was measured by means of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36). 7,8 Additional measures of the health-related quality of life included the MOS scales for pain, cognition, and role functioning (the ability to participate in usual daily activities) 9-11 and a modified version of the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). 12,13 Each of the instruments used to measure the health-related quality of life was administered to study participants at base line and at 30, 90, and 180 days. The SF-36 includes eight multiple-item scales that measure physical functioning, physical limitations on usual role-related activities, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional limitations on usual role-related activities, and mental health. These scales provide the basis for calculating the summary scores on the physical component and the mental component of the SF-36. 7,8 The scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). For each of the scales, the mean (±SD) score for members of the general population of the United States without chronic conditions was considered to be 50±10. To assess changes in the health-related quality of life over time, a change score for each SF-36 summary scale was calculated by subtracting the base-line score from the scores at 30, 90, and 180 days. With the use of 2 SE as the criterion, 8,14 individual patients were classified into three categories of change: those whose follow-up scores did not change more than would be expected by chance (unchanged group); those whose follow-up scores improved by more than 2 SE (improved group); and those whose follow-up scores declined by more than 2 SE (worse group). According to previous studies, a change of 2 SE is 6.5 points on the SF-36 physical-health summary scale and 7.9 points on the SF-36 mental-health summary scale. 8,14 The overall change in health status was calculated for each patient. Patients were categorized as having improved health status if they had better scores on both scales or had a better score on one scale and a score on the other scale that was not worse. Patients were categorized as having worsened health status if they had worse scores on one or both of the scales and as having the same health status if their scores on both the physical- and mental-component scales were unchanged. Three additional multiple-item scales from the MOS were used as secondary measures of cognitive functioning, pain, and functioning in role-related activities. 9-11,15 Clinical response was also measured with the use of the modified version of the FIQ, for which the scores range from 0 (best) to 110 (worst). This version of the FIQ has been validated for patients who have persistent symptoms after treatment for Lyme disease. 13 In a control population without chronic illness, the mean total score on the modified FIQ was 14.0, whereas the mean for patients with chronic Lyme disease after treatment was 50.2. 13 Previous studies have indicated that a change of 16.0 points is clinically meaningful. 16-19 Laboratory Studies Western blotting for IgG antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens was performed with the IgG MarBlot (MarDx Diagnostics, Carlsbad, Calif.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 6 The intrathecal production of antibodies against B. burgdorferi was measured as previously described. 20 Base-line specimens of cerebrospinal fluid and plasma specimens obtained at base line and on days 3, 5, 21, and 45 were tested by PCR for the presence of B. burgdorferi DNA, as previously described. 21 All samples of cerebrospinal fluid were cultured in Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly II medium to detect B. burgdorferi and were monitored by dark-field microscopy for six weeks. 22 Some blood samples were cultured for B. burgdorferi in hypertonic medium. 23 Adverse Events Adverse events and changes in laboratory values were evaluated and graded with the use of scales derived from the Common Toxicity Criteria of the National Cancer Institute. Compliance Compliance with the regimen of medications was assessed by counts of both the number of doses of the intravenous medication the patients received and the pills they had remaining. The actual pill counts were compared with the number of pills that the patient should have had remaining at the time of the home visit by a nurse on day 75. Statistical Analysis The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of all the patients enrolled in the studies. The primary clinical end point was the proportion of patients whose condition was categorized as improved, unchanged, and worse on the basis of the summary scores for the mental and physical components of the SF-36 at 180 days. Patients who withdrew from the study were categorized as having worsened health status on both of these scales. The study of seropositive patients was designed to have a power of 90 percent, with a 5 percent level of significance in a two-sided test and a sample size of 194, to detect a difference of 25 percent between the antibiotic group and the placebo group in the proportion of patients with improved health status. 24 With the enrollment of 66 patients, the study of seronegative patients would have 80 percent power, with a 5 percent level of significance in a two-sided test, to detect a 35 percent difference between the antibiotic group and the placebo group. 24 In the interim analysis of the primary outcome, the O'Brien–Fleming adjustment for multiple testing and the B-value stochastic curtailment method were used. 25 The primary outcome for each trial was analyzed by the chi-square test with individual type I error rates of 0.05. The efficacy of the treatment in each trial was estimated as the difference in risk (with 95 percent confidence interval). Secondary outcomes included improvement or worsening as measured by the SF-36 at 30 and 90 days, the total FIQ score, and the MOS pain, cognition, and role-functioning scores at 30, 90, and 180 days. Results Characteristics of the Patients Table 1. Table 1. Base-Line Characteristics of the Patients. A total of 129 patients were enrolled in the studies (78 seropositive and 51 seronegative). The base-line characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 1 . A total of 42 (33 percent) of the patients had previously received intravenous antibiotic treatment for a mean (±SD) of 30±12 days. All other previous treatment consisted of oral antibiotics. There were no significant differences between the seropositive patients and the seronegative patients other than the presence or absence of serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi . All cultures of cerebrospinal fluid in standard Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly II medium and of blood in hypertonic medium were negative for B. burgdorferi . B. burgdorferi DNA was not detected in any base-line sample of cerebrospinal fluid or blood, nor was it detected in any of the blood samples obtained during the treatment phase (on days 3, 5, 21, and 45). Given a cutoff of 1.2 for the ratio of antibody against B. burgdorferi in cerebrospinal fluid to antibody in serum, the intrathecal production of antibody was detected in eight patients (five in the combined antibiotic groups and three in the combined placebo groups). Treatment was discontinued in 14 patients (8 seropositive and 6 seronegative). The reasons for the discontinuation of treatment were similar across the groups of patients. An adverse event was the reason for the discontinuation of treatment in three of the patients in the combined antibiotic groups (5 percent) and three of those in the combined placebo groups (5 percent). Treatment was discontinued in the other eight patients for reasons other than an adverse event. In the combined population of both studies, the mean base-line summary score for the physical component of the SF-36 was approximately 1.5 SD below that of age-matched members of the general population of the United States who did not have a chronic illness, and the mean base-line summary score for the mental component was approximately 0.5 SD below that of such a control group. Similarly, the base-line FIQ scores were markedly abnormal. Compliance All patients who completed 180 days in one of the trials took at least 75 percent of the prescribed medications. There were no differences between the treatment groups in either the seropositive or the seronegative study in patients' compliance with medication. Efficacy The interim analysis was performed with the use of data on 107 patients who had completed 180 days in one of the trials. This analysis indicated that there was a 1.4 percent chance in the seropositive study and a 4.0 percent chance in the seronegative study that a significant difference in the efficacy of treatment between the antibiotic group and the placebo group would be observed when the full projected enrollment was reached. An analysis that included the patients in both studies indicated that there was a 3.9 percent chance of observing a significant difference at full enrollment. Because of the lack of efficacy of the antibiotic treatment at the time of the interim analysis, the data and safety monitoring board recommended discontinuation of the active treatment of enrolled patients and of further enrollment in the treatment phase of the studies. Table 2. Table 2. Clinical Responses at 180 Days. Figure 1. Figure 1. Change or Lack of Change from Base Line in the Health-Related Quality of Life as Measured by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36). Results are shown for the overall outcome (Panel A, all patients; Panel D, seropositive patients; Panel G, seronegative patients); the physical component (Panel B, all patients; Panel E, seropositive patients; Panel H, seronegative patients); and the mental component (Panel C, all patients; Panel F, seropositive patients; Panel I, seronegative patients). The scores of patients in the antibiotic group are compared with those of patients in the placebo group at the end of intravenous treatment (day 30), at the end of oral treatment (day 90), and 3 months after the completion of treatment (day 180). Statistical tests comparing the scores in the antibiotic group with those in the placebo group showed no statistically significant difference at any of the time points. The responses of the 115 patients who were enrolled in the studies at least 180 days before enrollment was stopped are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 . Intention-to-treat analyses at 30, 90, and 180 days showed no significant differences in the measures of the health-related quality of life between the patients in the antibiotic groups and those in the placebo groups in the seropositive study, the seronegative study, or both studies combined. In the combined study populations, changes in the score on the modified FIQ at 180 days also revealed no significant differences between the antibiotic groups and the placebo groups. We defined a decrease of 25 percent from the base-line score on the modified FIQ as indicative of clinical improvement and an increase of 25 percent as indicative of clinical worsening. Given these definitions, 28 of the 51 patients in the combined antibiotic groups (55 percent) had improved health status as measured by the FIQ at 180 days, as compared with 22 of the 53 patients in the combined placebo groups (42 percent) (P=0.17). Conversely, 14 percent of the patients in the antibiotic groups (7 of 51) had worsened health status as measured by the FIQ at 180 days, as compared with 19 percent (10 of 53) in the placebo groups (P=0.48). Separate comparisons of the FIQ scores in the antibiotic group and the placebo group of the seropositive study and of those in the two treatment groups in the seronegative study found no statistically significant differences according to treatment. Adverse Events At least one study-related adverse event occurred in 16 of the 64 patients in the combined antibiotic groups (25 percent) and 11 of the 65 patients in the combined placebo groups (17 percent). Most of the adverse events were minor and resolved without intervention or sequelae. However, the two patients in whom a study-related serious adverse event occurred were both in the antibiotic group. During intravenous treatment, one had a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and the other had fever, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Although the overall rate of adverse events was not significantly different in the two treatment groups, rash, diarrhea, and vaginal pruritus occurred more frequently among the patients in the antibiotic groups (9 of 64 patients) than among those in the placebo groups (2 of 65 patients). There were no infections associated with the intravenous catheter, and there were no deaths. Discussion The primary goals of these studies in patients with symptoms that persist after recommended antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease were to characterize the impairment in health-related quality of life among such patients and to determine the efficacy of prolonged treatment with antibiotics. The effect of chronic Lyme disease on the health-related quality of life was substantial in both seropositive and seronegative patients. The deficits in physical health status as measured by the SF-36 were equivalent to those observed in patients with congestive heart failure or osteoarthritis and were more than 0.5 SD greater than the impairment observed in patients with type 2 diabetes or a recent myocardial infarction. 7,8 Chronic pain was an important contributor to the impairment of physical health and was similar to that reported by patients with osteoarthritis. 7,8 The impairment of mental health status was similar to that observed in patients with subthreshold lifetime depression (a depressive disorder that does not meet all of the criteria for major depression of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition). 7,8,26 The study patients also had some impairment in cognitive functioning. Their base-line FIQ scores reflected the impairments in health status that were evident in the SF-36 scores and were similar to those in previous studies of patients with fibromyalgia or those with chronic Lyme disease after treatment. 8-13 The administration of placebo and treatment with a regimen of parenteral ceftriaxone for 30 days, followed by oral doxycycline for 60 days, had similar effects on the patients' health-related quality of life. This antibiotic-treatment regimen was selected because of the in vitro and in vivo activity of both of these antibiotics against B. burgdorferi and because they are effective for the treatment of neuroborreliosis. 1 Experience with other chronic infectious diseases caused by persistent bacteria (e.g., syphilis, tuberculosis, and helicobacter infection) suggests that it is unlikely that more prolonged antibiotic therapy or a different combination of antibiotics would result in greater improvement than was observed in this study. Although we used both conventional and hypertonic culture mediums to isolate B. burgdorferi in base-line samples of cerebrospinal fluid and blood and used PCR to detect B. burgdorferi DNA in base-line samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid as well as samples of blood collected during treatment, we did not find evidence of persistent infection with B. burgdorferi in these patients. There was no evidence of B. burgdorferi in a total of more than 700 different blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples from the 129 patients in these studies. The placebo groups in these studies provide a view of the natural history of symptoms among patients with chronic Lyme disease after treatment. During the six-month evaluation period, we observed improvement in health status in 36 percent of patients, worsening health status in 39 percent, and no significant change in 25 percent. A similar relation between the administration of placebo and health-related quality of life has been reported previously among patients with other rheumatologic diseases that do not appear to be related to persistent infection. For example, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with mild-to-moderate rheumatoid arthritis found an improved clinical response after 48 weeks of placebo treatment in 39 to 41 percent of patients, as compared with 54 to 56 percent of patients treated with minocycline. 27 In summary, patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive symptoms, or both that persist after antibiotic treatment for well-documented Lyme disease have considerable impairment in their health-related quality of life. The patients enrolled in these studies did not have evidence of persistent infection by B. burgdorferi, as judged on the basis of the available microbiologic and molecular methods of detection. There were no significant differences between clinical responses of patients who received intravenous and oral antibiotics for 90 days and those of patients who received placebo.

Methods In an area of New York where Lyme disease is hyperendemic, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in 482 subjects who had removed attached I. scapularis ticks from their bodies within the previous 72 hours. At base line, three weeks, and six weeks, subjects were interviewed and examined, and serum antibody tests were performed, along with blood cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi . Results Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite in a significantly smaller proportion of the subjects in the doxycycline group than of those in the placebo group (1 of 235 subjects [0.4 percent] vs. 8 of 247 subjects [3.2 percent], P<0.04). The efficacy of treatment was 87 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 25 to 98 percent). Objective extracutaneous signs of Lyme disease did not develop in any subject, and there were no asymptomatic seroconversions. Treatment with doxycycline was associated with more frequent adverse effects (in 30.1 percent of subjects, as compared with 11.1 percent of those assigned to placebo; P<0.001), primarily nausea (15.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent). Erythema migrans developed more frequently after untreated bites from nymphal ticks than after bites from adult female ticks (8 of 142 bites [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 bites [0 percent], P=0.02). Conclusions A single 200-mg dose of doxycycline given within 72 hours after an I. scapularis tick bite can prevent the development of Lyme disease. Introduction Lyme disease is transmitted by the bite of an Ixodes scapularis tick and is the most common vector-borne disease in the United States. 1 This infection may be prevented by vaccination. 2,3 However, the vaccine's general acceptance is likely to be limited by its cost (a cost to the pharmacist of $61.25 per dose) and the need for multiple doses to achieve and maintain protection. 2,3 In addition, the vaccine is less than 100 percent effective and is currently approved only for persons 15 to 70 years of age. 3 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for persons with I. scapularis tick bites may be a way to prevent Lyme disease. However, it is not known whether antimicrobial agents can effectively cure incubating Borrelia burgdorferi infection. In an animal model of another tick-borne disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, antibiotic prophylaxis appeared to delay but not prevent infection. 4 Antimicrobial therapy for the prevention of Lyme disease after I. scapularis tick bites has not been shown to be effective in controlled treatment trials. 5-9 In these studies, as well as in a model of cost effectiveness, 10 the drug regimens consisted of courses of antibiotics lasting 10 to 14 days, similar to those typically recommended for the treatment of clinically evident early Lyme disease. On the basis of the experience with syphilis 11 and leptospirosis, 12 it might be anticipated, however, that a much shorter course of antimicrobial therapy would be effective in treating an incubating (but inapparent) spirochetal infection. We studied the efficacy and safety of a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline in preventing Lyme disease after an I. scapularis tick bite. Methods Subjects Between May 1987 and December 1996, we recruited subjects who had removed an attached I. scapularis tick from their bodies within the preceding 72 hours and had been bitten in Westchester County, New York, where Lyme disease is hyperendemic. 13 Eligible subjects 12 years old or older were enrolled after they had given written informed consent. Parental consent was obtained for those who were younger than 18 years old. Subjects were excluded if they had clinical signs of Lyme disease (e.g., erythema migrans) at the time of enrollment, were taking or had just completed a course of antibiotics effective against B. burgdorferi, were pregnant or lactating, had been vaccinated against Lyme disease, or did not submit to study personnel the tick that bit them. Enrolled subjects whose ticks were later identified as something other than I. scapularis were included only in the analysis of safety. Subjects were evaluated at Westchester Medical Center, a university medical center (461 of the 506 subjects [91.1 percent]), or at a nearby community hospital (45 subjects [8.9 percent]). Ticks The species, sex, and stage of the ticks were determined by a medical entomologist. Ticks were initially classified as unfed (flat) or partly fed (partially engorged) on the basis of a visual inspection. When possible, the duration of the tick's attachment to the subject was estimated on the basis of a measurement of the tick scutal index. This determination (the ratio of tick body length to scutal width) was calculated as reported previously. 14 Clinical Evaluation At enrollment, at three weeks, and at six weeks, participants were examined and interviewed with the use of a written questionnaire. During the course of the study, specific questions regarding adverse effects of the study medication were added to the questionnaire. The analysis of adverse events was therefore restricted to the 309 subjects for whom this information was available. Subjects were encouraged to contact study personnel if clinical symptoms occurred between the scheduled visits or in the period immediately after the final visit. They were also counseled on ways to prevent tick bites. Blood was collected at each visit for antibody testing and for culture for B. burgdorferi . Study Medication After clinical evaluation and phlebotomy, subjects were given two pills from a vial that contained either two 100-mg capsules of doxycycline or two identical-appearing placebo pills containing lactose. Capsules were prepared by the hospital pharmacy and distributed according to a randomization list that maintained a 1:1 ratio between subjects in the doxycycline group and those in the placebo group. Both subjects and study personnel were unaware of the contents of the vials. Subjects swallowed the pills under direct observation by study personnel. Laboratory Tests Urine pregnancy tests (Clearview HCG II, Wampole Laboratories, Cranbury, N.J.) were performed at the initial encounter for all women of childbearing potential. Serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi were measured by polyvalent fluorescence immunoassay (FIAX, Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, Md.) from 1987 through 1990, and by polyvalent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (WhittakerStat, Whittaker Bioproducts) after 1990. Specimens with equivocal or positive assay results were retested by separate immunoblot assays for IgM and IgG antibodies to B. burgdorferi (MarDx Diagnostics, Carlsbad, Calif.). All tests were performed and interpreted according to the manufacturers' instructions. Assays on specimens from the same patient were run in parallel. Heparinized whole blood (0.3 ml) or, in some cases, serum (0.3 ml) was cultured for B. burgdorferi in modified Barbour–Stoenner–Kelly medium by means of previously described techniques. 15 Primary End Point The primary end point was the development of erythema migrans at the site of the tick bite. Erythema migrans occurring at a different site from that of the identified tick bite and laboratory evidence of B. burgdorferi infection in the absence of erythema migrans were analyzed as secondary end points. Seroconversion was defined as a change from a negative result on ELISA to an equivocal or positive result in association with the presence of IgM bands on immunoblotting that met the recommended criteria for seropositivity. 16 Sample Size The frequency of Lyme disease (characterized by erythema migrans) among untreated subjects who had been bitten by an I. scapularis tick in Westchester County was initially estimated to be approximately 5 percent. The smallest clinically important reduction in this rate was considered to be a reduction from 5 percent to 1 percent. Since it was expected that doxycycline would be at least as effective as placebo in preventing the occurrence of disease, the hypothesis was considered one-tailed. Because the frequency (incidence) in each group was expected to be quite small, an arc-sine transformation was performed in conjunction with the binomial test for two independent samples to derive the required sample sizes. On the basis of an alpha level of 0.05 and a power of 80 percent, the planned sample size was 129 subjects in each treatment group. At the time the projected number of subjects had been enrolled, it appeared that the risk of erythema migrans was limited to subjects who had been bitten by nymphal I. scapularis ticks. Thus, it became important to continue to enroll subjects until sufficient statistical power could be achieved in the subgroup of subjects bitten by nymphal ticks. Statistical Analysis Categorical variables were compared by means of the two-tailed Fisher's exact test or the two-tailed chi-square test. The final analysis for the primary end point was also two-tailed, in order to be more conservative. Student's t-test was used for continuous variables. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SAS software (version 6.12, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Because an interim analysis was performed in September 1992, the determination of the alpha level was based on the O'Brien–Fleming criteria. 17 A P value of 0.0475 or lower was considered to indicate statistical significance in the final analysis. The efficacy of prophylaxis was calculated as follows: (1 – [the risk of infection among the doxycycline-treated subjects ÷ the risk among subjects receiving placebo]) × 100 percent. 8 A 95 percent confidence interval was computed around the efficacy rate with the use of the test-based method. 18 Results Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of 482 Subjects Who Had Removed Ixodes scapularis Ticks from Their Bodies after Bites. A total of 506 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline or placebo; this total included 6 persons who were enrolled twice in different years. The primary (intention-to-treat) analysis was restricted to the 482 subjects who had removed identifiable I. scapularis ticks from their bodies ( Table 1 ). Of those subjects, 28 had removed multiple ticks at the time of the bite that led to enrollment, including 23 who had removed at least two ticks of the same stage, 3 who had removed both a nymphal and a larval I. scapularis tick, and 2 who had removed both a nymphal and an adult I. scapularis tick. (For certain analyses, the latter five subjects were included in the subgroup of subjects who had removed only nymphal ticks.) The demographic characteristics of the 235 subjects in the doxycycline group were similar to those of the 247 subjects in the placebo group ( Table 1 ). A total of 431 subjects (89.4 percent) completed all three visits (enrollment, three weeks, and six weeks). Erythema migrans occurred at the site of the tick bite in 8 of the 247 subjects in the placebo group (3.2 percent), as compared with 1 of the 235 subjects in the doxycycline group (0.4 percent, P<0.04). Seven of these nine subjects also had laboratory evidence of Lyme disease, including skin cultures positive for B. burgdorferi in all four subjects who underwent a skin biopsy. Seroconversion determined by ELISA occurred in seven subjects. An additional subject (in the doxycycline group) who remained seronegative by ELISA was positive for IgM antibody on immunoblotting. The last of the nine subjects with erythema migrans had an equivocal result on ELISA and negative results for IgM and IgG antibodies on immunoblotting and did not return for serologic testing during the convalescent phase. Table 2. Table 2. Erythema Migrans at the Site of an Ixodes scapularis Tick Bite in 482 Subjects. Erythema migrans developed at the site of the tick bite a median of 12 days (range, 4 to 17) after the removal of nymphal I. scapularis ticks that showed visual evidence of partial engorgement with blood ( Table 2 ). In untreated subjects, bites from nymphal ticks were significantly more likely than bites from adult ticks to be associated with erythema migrans (8 of 142 [5.6 percent] vs. 0 of 97 [0 percent], P=0.02). In the two groups combined, nymphal ticks were nearly twice as likely as adult ticks to be partially engorged (159 of 266 ticks [59.8 percent] vs. 64 of 197 ticks [32.5 percent], P<0.001). The estimated median duration of attachment, based on the tick scutal index for the 115 nymphal ticks that were measured, was 30 hours (range, 4 to 125), as compared with 10 hours (range, 0 to 148) for 76 adult ticks (P<0.001). Untreated bites from nymphal ticks that had been attached to subjects for an estimated 72 hours or longer were more likely to result in erythema migrans than were untreated bites from nymphal ticks that had been feeding for less than 72 hours (3 of 12 bites [25 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 7 to 57 percent] vs. 0 of 48, P=0.006). Table 3. Table 3. Other Clinical Events after a Bite from an Ixodes scapularis Tick. Objective extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme disease (e.g., facial-nerve palsy, meningitis, heart block, and oligoarthritis) were not observed during the study period, nor was asymptomatic seroconversion (the development of antibody to B. burgdorferi) . However, in addition to the nine subjects in whom erythema migrans developed at the identified site of the tick bite, solitary erythema migrans lesions developed in two subjects (one in each group) at other sites. In three other subjects (one in the doxycycline group and two in the placebo group), transient viral-like illnesses developed, with laboratory evidence of B. burgdorferi infection ( Table 3 ). Nine additional subjects (five in the doxycycline group and four in the placebo group) reported febrile episodes after removing I. scapularis ticks during the six-week study period but had no laboratory evidence of B. burgdorferi infection. A total of 59 of the 325 subjects questioned (18.2 percent) recognized additional tick bites after enrollment but during the six-week study period. Table 4. Table 4. Adverse Events. Adverse events (primarily nausea and vomiting) were more frequent in the doxycycline group than in the placebo group (P<0.001) ( Table 4 ). However, these events were not serious and were self-limited. No subject reported photosensitivity or a rash attributable to the study medication. Discussion This randomized, controlled trial shows that antimicrobial prophylaxis with a single 200-mg dose of doxycycline, given after a recognized bite from an I. scapularis tick, is highly effective in preventing the development of Lyme disease. Prophylaxis with doxycycline had an efficacy of 87 percent, which compares favorably with the 95 percent efficacy rate of doxycycline given once weekly to prevent leptospirosis. 12 The efficacy rate found in our study should be interpreted cautiously, however, because of the relatively small number of subjects in whom Lyme disease developed and the resultant wide 95 percent confidence interval (25 to 98 percent). Our results contrast with those of previous studies, 6-8 which showed no clear protection attributable to antimicrobial prophylaxis given after a tick bite. We observed a beneficial effect of prophylactic doxycycline despite a fairly low infection rate in the placebo group (3.2 percent) — a rate similar to that in other studies (range, 1.1 to 3.4 percent). The fact that our study demonstrated the efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis is probably related to its size (482 subjects, as compared with 56 subjects, 6 184 subjects, 7 and 387 subjects 8 in the other randomized studies), which provided the study with greater statistical power to show relatively small differences. Our use of a restrictive primary end point (erythema migrans at the site of the tick bite) could have resulted in underestimation of the actual incidence of B. burgdorferi infection attributable to the bite of an identified I. scapularis tick. However, this end point was chosen deliberately. Erythema migrans at the site of the bite is the most common clinical manifestation associated with B. burgdorferi infection and is the only reliable marker of infection caused by that specific bite. As shown in our study, subsequent tick bites are common (reported by 59 of the 325 subjects we questioned [18.2 percent]), even over a period as short as six weeks. Indeed, solitary erythema migrans developed in two of the study subjects at a site other than that of the initial tick bite, suggesting the occurrence of an additional, unrecognized bite. The follow-up was limited to six weeks in order to reduce confounding associated with illnesses that might result from subsequent tick bites. A theoretical risk associated with prophylactic antimicrobial treatment is that it might alter the disease presentation so that the characteristic erythema migrans rash might not be manifested in treated subjects, in whom a more subtle, nonspecific illness might develop or asymptomatic seroconversion might occur. In such circumstances, an unrecognized latent infection might eventually result in arthritis or neurologic disease. We believe that this is unlikely for several reasons. First, nonspecific febrile illnesses were not disproportionately common in the doxycycline group. Furthermore, there was no asymptomatic seroconversion (suggesting the occurrence of subclinical infection) in subjects in the doxycycline group (or in the placebo group). In addition, there was no delayed onset of erythema migrans at the original site of the tick bite in any subject during the six weeks of observation — a period four times the average incubation period for this rash. 19 Finally, objective extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme disease did not develop in any of the subjects in our study or in the three other prospective trials of antimicrobial prophylaxis (with follow-up lasting between six months and three years). 6-8 Our finding that only ticks that are partially engorged with blood are associated with the development of erythema migrans at the site of the bite is consistent with studies in animals, which have demonstrated that B. burgdorferi is infrequently transmitted before the tick has been attached for 48 hours. 20 Our results also confirm those of Sood et al., 21 who found a significantly increased risk of B. burgdorferi infection in humans after tick bites involving an estimated duration of attachment of 72 hours or longer. In addition, our findings support those of previous epidemiologic studies that have shown a temporal association between the development of erythema migrans and exposure to nymphal rather than adult ticks. 13 One possible explanation for this is that adult ticks (which are considerably larger than nymphal ticks) are detected and removed earlier in the feeding process than nymphal ticks; in our study, the estimated median duration of attachment for adult ticks in both groups (10 hours) was one third as long as that for nymphal ticks (30 hours). Although no serious adverse events were noted, 30.1 percent of those who received doxycycline had medication-related problems, as compared with 11.1 percent with placebo. The events reported were primarily nausea (15.4 percent with doxycycline vs. 2.6 percent with placebo, P<0.001) and vomiting (5.8 percent vs. 1.3 percent, P=0.06). Taking doxycycline with food may improve its tolerability, with only a minimal decrease in peak serum levels. 12 The ticks in our study were identified by medical entomologists. Patients and clinicians may have difficulty in distinguishing I. scapularis from other ticks and arthropods, and even from scabs or debris. 22 Furthermore, the efficacy of doxycycline in the prevention of other infections transmitted by I. scapularis ticks (e.g., babesiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) is unknown and should not be assumed. Nor can it be assumed that other antimicrobial agents that are effective for the treatment of Lyme disease (e.g., amoxicillin) or even other regimens of doxycycline (e.g., 100 mg twice daily) would have similar efficacy when used for short-term prophylaxis.

We assessed whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease leads to better outcomes than does shorter-term treatment. Methods In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in Europe, we assigned patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease — either related temporally to proven Lyme disease or accompanied by a positive IgG or IgM immunoblot assay for Borrelia burgdorferi — to receive a 12-week oral course of doxycycline, clarithromycin plus hydroxychloroquine, or placebo. All study groups received open-label intravenous ceftriaxone for 2 weeks before initiating the randomized regimen. The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life, as assessed by the physical-component summary score of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (RAND SF-36) (range, 15 to 61, with higher scores indicating better quality of life), at the end of the treatment period at week 14, after the 2-week course of ceftriaxone and the 12-week course of the randomized study drug or placebo had been completed. Results Of the 281 patients who underwent randomization, 280 were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (86 patients in the doxycycline group, 96 in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group, and 98 in the placebo group). The SF-36 physical-component summary score did not differ significantly among the three study groups at the end of the treatment period, with mean scores of 35.0 (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.5 to 36.5) in the doxycycline group, 35.6 (95% CI, 34.2 to 37.1) in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group, and 34.8 (95% CI, 33.4 to 36.2) in the placebo group (P=0.69; a difference of 0.2 [95% CI, –2.4 to 2.8] in the doxycycline group vs. the placebo group and a difference of 0.9 [95% CI, –1.6 to 3.3] in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group vs. the placebo group); the score also did not differ significantly among the groups at subsequent study visits (P=0.35). In all study groups, the SF-36 physical-component summary score increased significantly from baseline to the end of the treatment period (P<0.001). The rates of adverse events were similar among the study groups. Four serious adverse events thought to be related to drug use occurred during the 2-week open-label ceftriaxone phase, and no serious drug-related adverse event occurred during the 12-week randomized phase. Conclusions In patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment.

Introduction QUICK TAKE Longer-Term Therapy for Lyme Disease 01:37 Patients with Lyme disease, which is caused by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex (including B. afzelii and B. garinii in Europe), often report persistent symptoms. 1 These symptoms are also referred to as the post–Lyme disease syndrome or chronic Lyme disease and may occur after resolution of an erythema migrans rash or after other — possibly unnoticed — manifestations of early Lyme disease, regardless of whether a patient received initial appropriate antibiotic treatment. Patients present mainly with pain, fatigue, and neurologic or cognitive disturbances. 2,3 Previous randomized, clinical trials have not shown convincingly that prolonged antibiotic treatment has beneficial effects in patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease. 4-6 Nonetheless, the debate about this issue has continued. 7 Although most guidelines do not recommend antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 to 4 weeks, 8,9 other guidelines recommend prolonged antibiotic therapy. 10 We performed a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial (Persistent Lyme Empiric Antibiotic Study Europe [PLEASE]) that included three study groups to compare shorter-term treatment (ceftriaxone followed by placebo [placebo group]) with longer-term treatment (ceftriaxone followed by doxycycline [doxycycline group] or ceftriaxone followed by the combination of clarithromycin and hydroxychloroquine [clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group]). Methods Study Oversight The trial was approved by the medical ethics review committee Commissie Mensgebonden Onderzoek regio Arnhem–Nijmegen. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines on Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was provided by all the participants. All the authors take responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the reported data and vouch for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol (available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org) and statistical analysis plan (which is included in the protocol). Details of the protocol and study design have been published previously. 11 The trial was performed at two sites in the Netherlands (Radboud University Medical Center and Sint Maartenskliniek) and was overseen by an independent external data and safety monitoring board. Study Population Patients were recruited from October 2010 through June 2013. Eligibility was assessed according to previously described inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org). 11 In short, patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease (musculoskeletal pain, arthritis, arthralgia, neuralgia, sensory disturbances, dysesthesia, neuropsychological disorders, or cognitive disorders, with or without persistent fatigue) were eligible if these symptoms either were temporally related to an erythema migrans rash or an otherwise proven case of symptomatic Lyme disease or were accompanied by B. burgdorferi IgG or IgM antibodies, as confirmed by means of immunoblot assay. Randomization and Blinding Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio. Randomization was computerized and balanced by minimization for age (<40 or ≥40 years), sex, duration of symptoms (<1 or ≥1 year), and baseline Global Health Composite score of the RAND-36 Health Status Inventory (RAND SF-36). 12 The randomization list consisted of consecutive medication numbers entered into a secured Web-based database by an independent Web manager. All personnel involved in the study (except the Web manager and study pharmacist) and all participants were unaware of the study-group assignments. Intervention All the patients received treatment with 2000 mg of open-label intravenous ceftriaxone daily for 14 days. Patients were admitted at the study site for ceftriaxone administration during days 1 and 2; subsequent doses were given intravenously by specialized home-care nurses. After the 2-week course of ceftriaxone treatment was completed, the patients received a 12-week oral course of doxycycline (100 mg of doxycycline twice daily combined with a placebo twice daily), clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine (500 mg of clarithromycin twice daily combined with 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine twice daily), or placebo (two different placebo capsules twice daily), as randomly assigned in a blinded manner. The study drugs and placebo were prepared as capsules with an identical appearance. Active drugs were purchased as standard tablets through the hospital pharmacy department and were placed inside size 000 capsules; placebos were prepared by filling color-matched size 000 capsules with inactive microcrystalline cellulose. Adherence was verified by means of pill counts, patient diaries, and the Medication Event Monitoring System (AARDEX Group), in which microprocessors in the cap of a medication bottle electronically record each time a bottle is opened. 13 The use of specific concomitant medications was prohibited during the entire study period, as described previously. 11 Outcome Measures Outcomes were assessed with the use of self-completed questionnaires at baseline, at the end of the treatment period at 14 weeks (i.e., when the 2-week course of ceftriaxone and the 12-week randomized phase had been completed), at 26 weeks (12 weeks after the end of the treatment period), at 40 weeks (the end of the trial, 26 weeks after the end of the treatment period), and at 52 weeks after the start of the treatment period. Study visits to evaluate safety were scheduled at weeks 2, 8, and 14 and included a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory investigations. The primary outcome measure was health-related quality of life at the end of the treatment period, as assessed by the physical-component summary score of the RAND SF-36. 12,14 This score is based on the weighted T-scores of the four physical scales of the RAND SF-36 (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, pain, and general health perceptions). The raw SF-36 physical-component summary score was transformed into a norm-based T-score (range, 15 to 61), with a mean (±SD) score of 50±10 in the general population (higher scores indicate a better physical quality of life). Table 1. Table 1. Baseline Characteristics in the Modified Intention-to-Treat Population. Main secondary outcomes were physical and mental aspects of health-related quality of life, as assessed with the use of the RAND SF-36, 11 and fatigue, as assessed with the use of the fatigue-severity scale of the Checklist Individual Strength, on which scores range from 8 to 56, with higher scores indicating more fatigue 15 ( Table 1 ). Statistical Analysis The primary analyses were performed in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomly assigned to a study group and received at least one dose of ceftriaxone. In the primary analysis, the three study groups were compared at end of the treatment period by means of analysis of covariance, with sex and baseline SF-36 physical-component summary score as covariates. Missing data were imputed according to the baseline-value-carried-forward method. In secondary analyses, linear mixed models were used to evaluate the duration of the treatment effect in an explorative way, and missing data were imputed with the nearest available observation. All models included the baseline value of the dependent variable, sex, time, study-group assignment, and time-by-treatment interaction. No interim efficacy analysis was performed. Sensitivity analyses included a prespecified per-protocol analysis and alternative imputation techniques. Patients who had major protocol violations, such as receipt of less than 75% of a study drug or placebo, as recorded by microprocessors in the Medication Event Monitoring System caps, or use of prohibited concomitant medication, were excluded from the per-protocol analysis. 11 A two-sided alpha level of 5% was used to indicate statistical significance, and confidence intervals, when calculated, were 95% confidence intervals. Bonferroni correction was used for pairwise comparisons among the three study groups. Statistical analyses were performed with the use of SPSS software, version 20 (SPSS). The calculation of power was based on a pilot study that included 80 patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease. 11 Patients were classified as having a poor or reasonable clinical condition, as assessed during the first clinical consultation at the outpatient clinic. The difference in SF-36 physical-component summary score between patients with a poor clinical condition and those with a reasonable clinical condition was a mean of 3±8 points, which corresponds to the minimal clinically important difference of 2 to 5 points that has been proposed for the SF-36 physical-component summary score. 14 We calculated that a minimum of 75 patients would need to be assigned to each group (225 patients in total) for the study to have 90% power to detect a difference of 3 points at a two-sided alpha level of 5% and a reliability coefficient (correlation between consecutive measurements) of 0.7. 16 To compensate for possible loss to follow-up, a study population of at least 255 patients was targeted. Results Study Population and Baseline Characteristics Figure 1. Figure 1. Enrollment, Randomization, and Analysis. Some patients were excluded from the per-protocol analysis because of two or more reasons. Premature discontinuation was defined as discontinuation of the study drug or placebo 7 days or more before the scheduled end of the treatment period, as recorded by microprocessors in the Medication Event Monitoring System caps that were used to track adherence. Week 14 was the end of the treatment period, after the 2-week course of ceftriaxone and the 12-week course of the randomized study drug or placebo had been completed. SF-36 denotes RAND-36 Health Status Inventory. Approximately 1200 patients were screened. The most frequent reasons for ineligibility were negative serologic findings combined with Lyme disease that was either unproven or temporally unrelated to symptoms, a coexisting condition that could account for the patient’s symptoms, or known unacceptable side effects from the active study drugs. Of all eligible patients, fewer than 10% declined to participate. A total of 281 patients underwent randomization, and 280 started the oral course of the study drug or placebo ( Figure 1 ). Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of patients included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis; there were no significant baseline differences among the study groups. The randomized oral regimen (active study drug or placebo) was completed by 252 patients (90.0%): 76 of 86 patients (88.4%) in the doxycycline group, 84 of 96 patients (87.5%) in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group, and 92 of 98 patients (93.9%) in the placebo group (P=0.28) ( Figure 1 ). No differences in adherence were recorded among the study groups (P=0.50); 75 patients (87.2%) in the doxycycline group, 78 (81.3%) in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group, and 84 (85.7%) in the placebo group took at least 75% of the assigned study medication or placebo, as recorded by the microprocessors on the Medication Event Monitoring System caps ( Figure 1 ). Outcomes Table 2. Table 2. Treatment Effect at the End of the Treatment Period in the Modified Intention-to-Treat Population. Figure 2. Figure 2. Physical-Component Summary Scores. Shown is the mean SF-36 physical-component summary score for each study group at baseline and at subsequent study visits (nonimputed values). The SF-36 physical-component summary score is based on the weighted T-scores of the four physical RAND SF-36 scales (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health problems, pain, and general health perceptions). The raw SF-36 physical-component summary score was transformed into a norm-based T-score (range, 15 to 61), with a mean (±SD) score of 50±10 in the general population (higher scores indicate a better physical quality of life). The P value was derived by means of analysis of covariance at the end of the treatment period at 14 weeks, with adjustment for sex and baseline SF-36 physical-component summary score. The primary outcome in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (i.e., the mean health-related quality of life at the end of the treatment period, as indicated by the SF-36 physical-component summary score, corrected for baseline SF-36 physical-component summary score and sex) did not differ significantly among the study groups (P=0.69) ( Table 2 ). With respect to the secondary outcomes, the mean SF-36 physical-component summary score among all patients in the modified intention-to-treat analysis increased from 31.8 at baseline to 36.4 at the end of the treatment period (difference, 4.6 points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6 to 5.5; P<0.001). At weeks 26, 40, and 52, the SF-36 physical-component summary score remained higher than the baseline score but did not change significantly from the score at the end of the treatment period in any of the study groups ( Figure 2 ). None of the secondary outcome measures at the end of the treatment period differed significantly among the study groups ( Table 2 ). Mixed-model analyses did not show any additional longer-term treatment effect with respect to the SF-36 physical-component summary score or any of the secondary outcomes; P values for time-by-treatment interaction ranged from 0.14 to 0.90, and there was no significant difference among the study groups in the SF-36 physical-component summary score (P=0.35) or any other secondary outcome measure at any time point during follow-up. All sensitivity analyses yielded results similar to those of the main analyses. Specifically, the results were not quantitatively different when alternate imputation techniques were used for missing data (Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix ). The per-protocol analysis, which included 212 patients ( Figure 1 ), yielded similar results to the modified intention-to-treat analysis at the end of the treatment period and during follow-up across the three study groups. Safety Table 3. Table 3. Adverse Events in the Modified Intention-to-Treat Population. Overall, 205 patients (73.2%) reported at least one adverse event, 9 patients (3.2%) had a serious adverse event, and 19 patients (6.8%) had an adverse event that led to discontinuation of the study drug ( Table 3 ). Most adverse events were grade 1 or 2 according to the criteria of the AIDS Clinical Trials Group for grading the severity of adverse events among adults (Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix ). During the 2-week open-label ceftriaxone phase, 131 patients (46.8%) reported at least one adverse event. Most of these adverse events were judged to be drug-related, and rash and diarrhea were the most common events. No catheter-associated infections were reported. In 6 patients, an allergic adverse event led to the discontinuation of ceftriaxone. Five serious adverse events were reported, four of which were allergic reactions related to ceftriaxone use. During the 12-week randomized phase, 134 patients (47.9%) had at least one adverse event ( Table 3 ), most of which were judged to be drug-related. The percentage of patients with adverse events from any cause and with drug-related adverse events did not differ significantly among the study groups (P=0.27 and P=0.14, respectively). Photosensitivity and nausea were the most common events in the doxycycline group. Nausea and diarrhea were the most common events in the clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine group, and rash was significantly more prevalent in that group than in either of the other two groups (P=0.01). Fourteen patients (5.0%) discontinued the randomized active drug or placebo because of an adverse event; the number of patients who discontinued their assigned regimen did not differ significantly among the three study groups (P=0.49). Four serious adverse events were reported, none of which were drug-related. Discussion In this randomized, double-blind trial involving patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, prolonged antibiotic treatment (ceftriaxone followed by 12 weeks of either doxycycline or clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine) did not lead to a better health-related quality of life than that with shorter-term treatment (ceftriaxone followed by placebo). Patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease have a poor quality of life, as has been reported in previous studies 5,6,17,18 ; the low baseline RAND SF-36 scores of the patients in our trial also reflect the poor quality of life among these patients. At the 14-week visit at the end of the treatment period, the mean SF-36 physical-component summary score had improved significantly from baseline regardless of the study-group assignment, but quality of life remained below that of the general population. Similar improvements over time, regardless of study-group assignment, were reported by Kaplan et al., who compared placebo with ceftriaxone followed by doxycycline for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease. 19 Whether improvement in the SF-36 physical-component summary score at the end of the treatment period is a beneficial effect of shorter-term antibiotic therapy or a nonspecific effect caused by the low level of baseline functioning, expectations associated with treatment, or placebo effects remains unclear, because all the patients had received 2 weeks of open-label antibiotics before entering into the longer-term randomized study-drug or placebo phase. No significant differences among the study groups were found for any of the secondary outcomes at the end of the treatment period. In addition, no significant changes over time were observed during the 26-week follow-up after the end of the treatment period in any of the study groups. Although we did not find a significant benefit of longer-term antibiotic therapy, we did find that there were side effects from the use of antibiotics; however, these side effects were similar among the study groups. The majority of patients (68.6%) reported a drug-related adverse event. During the open-label ceftriaxone phase, the incidence of serious adverse events was low; no patient had a serious adverse event related to the use of catheters, and 4 of 280 patients (1.4%) had allergic reactions. During the randomized phase, photosensitivity related to doxycycline use and rash related to clarithromycin–hydroxychloroquine use were the most common adverse events, and no serious adverse event was thought to be related to the randomized study drugs or placebo. Specific efforts were made to ensure that the patients adhered to the study regimens. Using the Medication Event Monitoring System caps, we recorded that 22 patients (7.9%) discontinued treatment 7 days or more before the end of the treatment period at week 14. In a sensitivity analysis that included the 212 patients who were more than 75% adherent to the study regimen, as determined by electronic medication bottle caps, and had no major protocol violations, no significant difference was shown among the study groups. The findings of the current trial contribute to the findings of prior work. 4-6,18 Our results are consistent with those from the randomized, placebo-controlled trials by Klempner et al., 5 who did not identify a benefit from treatment with ceftriaxone followed by doxycycline for a total of 90 days. However, these trials had been performed in North America, and Lyme disease in Europe is caused by different borrelia species. 20 The trials by Klempner et al. 5 have been the subject of divergent opinions because they were discontinued prematurely after an interim analysis had indicated that a significant difference in efficacy was unlikely to be reached. Therefore, although the results are statistically valid, the value of prolonged antibiotic therapy for patients with Lyme disease has been based on a study population of approximately 115 patients. Others have suggested that the trials by Klempner et al. were underpowered as a result of an optimistic estimate of the size of the treatment effect. 7 In a pilot study, we determined that the clinically relevant treatment effect on the SF-36 physical-component summary score was 3 points, as was recommended by the SF-36 Health Survey. 14 None of the differences among the study groups were found to exceed the minimal clinically relevant difference for each of the RAND SF-36 scales, which varies between 2 and 4 across scales. 14 Whereas earlier trials might have been influenced by baseline differences, we included baseline health-related quality of life as a covariate. Three other small, placebo-controlled trials have addressed prolonged treatment for persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease and showed positive effects for some outcomes only. 4,6,18 Krupp et al. 4 reported a significant treatment effect of ceftriaxone on fatigue, but not on cognitive function, at follow-up. Fallon et al. found a beneficial effect of ceftriaxone on neurocognitive performance at week 12, but the effect was not sustained to week 24. 18 Cameron et al. reported beneficial effects of amoxicillin on mental-health scores, but not on physical health, in a subgroup of patients. 6 Although several noncomparative, open-label studies have shown beneficial effects of prolonged antimicrobial treatment, including the regimens used in the current study, 21-24 randomized, controlled trials of prolonged antimicrobial treatment have not confirmed those effects. The current trial has several limitations. First, patients received open-label antibiotics for 2 weeks before the randomized phase. Consequently, the study was designed to compare longer-term therapy with shorter-term therapy, rather than with placebo as was done in previous trials. 4,5,18 Although we did not identify any benefit of longer-term therapy, the question of whether a 2-week regimen of antibiotics is superior to withholding any therapy in our patient population remains unanswered. We chose not to include a study group that received only placebo because it was judged to be unethical to withhold treatment from patients who might have an infection at baseline that had not yet been treated. We selected ceftriaxone because it is considered the treatment of choice for disseminated Lyme disease. 5,8 Thus, although 14 weeks of antimicrobial therapy did not provide a clinical benefit for patients with persistent symptoms attributed to Lyme disease, our results cannot show whether our study may have included patients with undiagnosed active B. burgdorferi infection, who have benefited from ceftriaxone treatment. This trial, as well as previous trials, 4-6,18 was aimed at the treatment of patients with persistent, notably distressing or impairing symptoms that emerged after well-documented Lyme disease. We acknowledge that the cause of these persistent symptoms is unclear and that these patients may be heterogeneous with respect to the pathogenesis or the duration and severity of the symptoms — which reflects the heterogeneity of the population seen in clinical practice. We prevented an imbalance in baseline characteristics among the study groups by performing a randomization balanced for duration of symptoms (<1 or ≥1 year) and baseline RAND SF-36 score. Finally, it may be argued that 14 weeks of treatment is insufficient to show a beneficial treatment effect. However, whereas prolonged antimicrobial treatment is not uncommon for various infectious diseases, 25,26 the purpose of prolonged therapy for such diseases is for the prevention of microbiologic relapse rather than for a delayed onset of clinical alleviation of signs or symptoms. We are not aware of any infectious disease in which the initial effect on signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings is delayed beyond the first 3 months of effective therapy. In conclusion, the current trial suggests that 14 weeks of antimicrobial therapy does not provide clinical benefit beyond that with shorter-term treatment among patients who present with fatigue or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive disorders that are temporally related to prior Lyme disease or accompanied by positive B. burgdorferi serologic findings.

This practice is likely to limit therapeutic benefits. Methods In this one-year trial, we randomly assigned 224 obese adults to receive 15 mg of sibutramine per day alone, delivered by a primary care provider in eight visits of 10 to 15 minutes each; lifestyle-modification counseling alone, delivered in 30 group sessions; sibutramine plus 30 group sessions of lifestyle-modification counseling (i.e., combined therapy); or sibutramine plus brief lifestyle-modification counseling delivered by a primary care provider in eight visits of 10 to 15 minutes each. All subjects were prescribed a diet of 1200 to 1500 kcal per day and the same exercise regimen. Results At one year, subjects who received combined therapy lost a mean (±SD) of 12.1±9.8 kg, whereas those receiving sibutramine alone lost 5.0±7.4 kg, those treated by lifestyle modification alone lost 6.7±7.9 kg, and those receiving sibutramine plus brief therapy lost 7.5±8.0 kg (P<0.001). Those in the combined-therapy group who frequently recorded their food intake lost more weight than those who did so infrequently (18.1±9.8 kg vs. 7.7±7.5 kg, P=0.04). Conclusions The combination of medication and group lifestyle modification resulted in more weight loss than either medication or lifestyle modification alone. The results underscore the importance of prescribing weight-loss medications in combination with, rather than in lieu of, lifestyle modification. Introduction Two medications, sibutramine (Meridia, Abbott Laboratories) and orlistat (Xenical, Roche), are currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the induction and maintenance of weight loss. 1-5 These agents are recommended as an adjunct to a comprehensive program of diet, exercise, and behavior therapy, 2,3,6 which is known as lifestyle modification and is delivered in weekly group or individual sessions. 7-9 Industry-sponsored trials of weight-loss medications typically have included limited programs of lifestyle modification. 5,10,11 This randomized trial compared the efficacy of sibutramine alone (as typically prescribed in primary care practice), group sessions of lifestyle modification alone, and the combination of the two therapies. We expected that the combined treatment would result in significantly greater weight loss than either therapy alone because of the potentially complementary mechanisms of action of the two approaches. 11 Sibutramine, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, appears to modify internal signals that control hunger (the drive to eat) and satiation (fullness). 4,12 In contrast, lifestyle modification teaches patients to control the external environment involving food — for example, by grocery shopping from a list or recording food intake. 7-9 Two studies 13,14 of fenfluramine (which was withdrawn from the market in 1997 because of its association with valvular heart disease 15 ) suggested that the effects of lifestyle modification and medication would be additive. Our study included a fourth treatment group that assessed the efficacy of sibutramine combined with brief lifestyle-modification counseling delivered by primary care providers. We anticipated that this intervention would result in significantly greater weight loss than medication alone and could potentially provide a model for delivering lifestyle-modification counseling in primary care practice. 16,17 Methods Subjects The study involved 180 women and 44 men, 18 to 65 years of age, each of whom had a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 30 to 45. Eligible subjects were free of uncontrolled hypertension (defined by a blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg); cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, renal, or hepatic disease; and type 1 or 2 diabetes. Women were ineligible if they were pregnant or breast-feeding. The use of medications known to affect body weight, a weight loss of 5 kg or greater in the preceding six months, and the use of selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors were exclusion criteria. Psychosocial contraindications included bulimia nervosa, substance abuse, clinically significant depression, or current psychiatric care. Figure 1. Figure 1. Enrollment and Retention. Table 1. Table 1. Baseline Characteristics of the Subjects. Initially, 404 persons responded to advertisements for the study, completed a telephone interview, and appeared to meet eligibility requirements. They met with a psychologist, who described the study's requirements, obtained written informed consent, and assessed their psychosocial status. Also, height, weight, and blood pressure were measured. As shown in Figure 1 , a total of 77 applicants elected not to participate and 65 were excluded because of various contraindications. The remaining 262 persons were referred to their family physicians, who obtained a history and performed a physical examination and electrocardiography to determine whether applicants were free of the physical complications described previously; 38 were deemed by their physicians to have contraindications to participation. The family physicians forwarded their findings to the project physician. The 224 persons who passed the medical-screening tests comprised the final sample ( Table 1 ). Treatment Groups Subjects were randomly assigned to receive one of the four treatments described below. At week 0 (baseline), all subjects were instructed to maintain their usual eating and activity habits. Thereafter, all subjects were prescribed a balanced-deficit diet of 1200 to 1500 kcal per day, with approximately 15 percent of energy derived from proteins, 30 percent or less from fats, and the remainder from carbohydrates. All were encouraged to exercise (walk) 30 minutes a day most days of the week. Sibutramine Alone Fifty-five subjects were assigned to receive sibutramine alone. They had eight brief visits (10 to 15 minutes each) with a primary care provider at weeks 1, 3, 6, 10, 18, 26, 40, and 52. During week 1, subjects were given a daily dose of 5 mg of sibutramine (provided by Abbott Laboratories, which otherwise had no involvement in the study), and the dose was increased to 10 mg at week 3 and to 15 mg at week 6. Subjects received a copy of “On Your Way to Fitness,” 19 a pamphlet that provides tips for healthy eating and activity. They were not instructed to keep records of food intake or activity, and the primary care providers gave only general encouragement. Weight and vital signs were measured at all visits. The primary care providers included three internists and one nurse practitioner, none of whom specialized in obesity management. Lifestyle Modification Alone A total of 55 subjects were assigned to receive lifestyle modification alone. They attended weekly group meetings from weeks 1 through 18, sessions conducted every other week from weeks 20 through 40, and a follow-up visit at week 52. Meetings included 7 to 10 subjects, lasted 90 minutes, and were led by trained psychologists. For the first 18 weeks, sessions followed the LEARN (Lifestyle, Exercise, Attitudes, Relationships, and Nutrition) Program for Weight Control, 20 which instructed subjects to complete weekly homework assignments that included keeping daily records of food and calorie intake and physical activity. Records were reviewed at weekly meetings. From weeks 20 through 40, sessions were conducted with the use of the Weight Maintenance Survival Guide . 21 Combined Therapy Sixty subjects were assigned to combined therapy. They were given the same two treatments as those in the first two groups, but with a slight modification. They received sibutramine, attended medical visits, and attended group sessions of lifestyle counseling that followed a version of the LEARN Program for Weight Control 22 that was adapted to include sibutramine. Sibutramine plus Brief Therapy A total of 54 subjects received sibutramine and met with a primary care provider (10 to 15 minutes per session) on the same schedule as subjects in the group given sibutramine alone. They also were given the two treatment manuals 21,22 and were instructed to complete homework assignments, including daily food-intake and activity records, which they reviewed during visits with the primary care providers. (Additional details about treatment implementation are provided in the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org.) Outcomes A digital scale (model 6800A, Detecto) was used at all treatment visits to measure subjects' weight while they were dressed in light clothing. Behavioral adherence during the first 18 weeks was assessed in the three groups receiving lifestyle-modification therapy by counting the number of food-intake records completed. For each week, subjects received a score of 0 to 7, reflecting the number of days they completed a record. Completion of food-intake records has been shown to correlate positively with weight loss. 16,23,24 Levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, glucose, and insulin were measured at baseline and at weeks 18, 40, and 52 after an overnight fast (Quest Diagnostics). Insulin sensitivity was estimated with the use of the homeostasis model of insulin sensitivity. 24 Blood pressure and pulse were measured by research assistants with an automated monitor (Dinamap, model 9300, Johnson & Johnson) on the same schedule as the visits to primary care providers. On each occasion, two readings were taken at one-minute intervals after subjects had been seated for at least five minutes. Attrition Thirty-nine subjects (17 percent) did not complete the one-year study. This number includes anyone who attended the first treatment visit but did not return. There were no significant differences in attrition among the four groups ( Figure 1 ). Most of those who dropped out did so because they were dissatisfied with treatment (22 subjects) or had scheduling conflicts (5 subjects). Twelve withdrew because of medical complications. The complications included two pregnancies reported at week 6 of the program; the data on these two women were excluded from the analysis because of the likelihood that they were pregnant at the start of the study. Statistical Analysis The sample size was selected to provide the study with a statistical power of 80 percent to detect a 4-kg difference in weight loss at week 52 among those receiving combined therapy as compared with both those receiving sibutramine alone and those receiving lifestyle modification alone. Similar statistical power was available to detect a 4-kg difference between those in the group given drug plus brief therapy and those given sibutramine alone. Preliminary analysis revealed no significant differences among the four groups in baseline characteristics ( Table 1 ). Differences in weight and other outcomes among groups at weeks 18, 40, and 52 were compared with the use of analysis of variance with repeated measures. In cases of a significant treatment effect, Tukey's honestly significant difference test 25 was used to identify differences among the four groups. Data were examined for the 222 subjects who began treatment (excluding the 2 women who were thought to be pregnant before the study began) with the use of the last-observation-carried-forward analysis, a more conservative method than examining only those who completed treatment. An even more conservative intention-to-treat analysis was used for weight change; subjects who discontinued treatment were assumed to have regained 0.3 kg per month after leaving the study. 24 Chi-square tests were performed to compare percentages of subjects in each group who lost 5 percent or more of their initial weight. Partial-correlation analysis, which controlled for the effect of treatment group, was used to examine predictors and correlates of weight loss. Data were analyzed with the use of SPSS software (version 11). 25 This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania and was conducted from January 2000 to August 2003. The authors were solely responsible for designing the study, securing funding, treating subjects, collecting and analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript. Results Weight Loss Figure 2. Figure 2. Mean (±SE) Weight Loss in the Four Groups, as Determined by an Intention-to-Treat Analysis (Panel A) and a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward Analysis (Panel B). Subjects who received combined therapy lost significantly more weight at all times than subjects in the other three groups. Subjects treated with lifestyle modification alone and those treated with sibutramine plus brief therapy lost significantly more weight at week 18 than those who received sibutramine alone, with no other significant differences at any other time. Panel B shows that a last-observation-carried-forward analysis yielded the same statistical conclusions. At one year, subjects who received combined therapy lost a mean (±SD) of 12.1±9.8 kg, whereas those receiving sibutramine alone lost 5.0±7.4 kg, those treated by lifestyle modification alone lost 6.7±7.9 kg, and those receiving sibutramine plus brief therapy lost 7.5±8.0 kg. Subjects in the group receiving combined therapy lost significantly more weight at 1 year, as well as at weeks 18 and 40, than those in the other three groups (P<0.001 by the intention-to-treat analysis) ( Figure 2A ). In addition, subjects in the group treated by lifestyle modification alone and those in the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy lost significantly (P=0.05) more weight at week 18 than those in the group given sibutramine alone; there were no other significant differences among these three groups at week 40 or 52. Results of the last-observation-carried-forward analysis yielded the same statistical conclusions ( Figure 2B ). An analysis of covariance that controlled for the effects of initial weight, age, sex, and race or ethnicity also yielded the same statistical conclusions, with one exception; at week 18, the weight losses in the group treated by lifestyle modification alone and the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy were superior (P=0.05) to those in the group given sibutramine alone in the last-observation-carried-forward analysis but not in the intention-to-treat analysis. At one year, significantly more subjects in the combined-therapy group (73 percent) lost 5 percent or more of their initial weight than did those in the group given sibutramine alone (42 percent), the group treated by lifestyle modification alone (53 percent), and the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy (56 percent) (P=0.05). More subjects in the combined-therapy group (52 percent) also lost 10 percent or more of their initial weight than did those in the three other groups (26 percent, 29 percent, and 26 percent, respectively; P=0.004). Behavioral Adherence The mean (±SD) number of food-intake records completed during the first 18 weeks (126 days) of the study was 88.4±32.7 in the group treated by lifestyle modification alone, 91.5±35.9 in the combined-therapy group, and 61.0±40.0 in the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy. Subjects in the first two groups completed significantly more records than did those in the third group (P<0.001). Partial-correlation analysis that controlled for treatment group showed that the more records subjects completed, the more weight they lost at week 18 (r=0.29, P<0.001), week 40 (r=0.22, P=0.01), and week 52 (r=0.31, P<0.001). Figure 3. Figure 3. Mean (±SE) Weight Loss at One Year in the Combined-Therapy Group and the Group Treated by Lifestyle Modification Alone among Subjects in the Lowest and Highest Thirds of Adherence for Completing Food-Intake Records during the First 18 Weeks. In the combined-therapy group and the group treated by lifestyle modification alone, the 24 and 15 subjects in the lowest third of adherence completed 54.5±21.9 and 40.5±27.4 food-intake records, respectively, whereas the 17 and 21 subjects in the highest third of adherence completed 122.3±4.2 and 120.1±3.6 records, respectively (of a possible 126 daily records). Within each treatment group, differences in weight loss between subjects in the lowest third of adherence as compared with those in the highest third of adherence were significant as determined by Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. In the combined-therapy group, the 19 subjects in the middle third of adherence completed 100.7±9.6 records and lost 12.2±9.8 kg, whereas in the group treated by lifestyle modification alone, the 19 subjects in the middle third of compliance completed 100.3±8.5 records and lost 8.7±7.2 kg. The importance of recording food intake was further revealed by examining those in the highest and lowest thirds of adherence in the combined-therapy group and the group treated by lifestyle modification alone. In both groups, subjects in the highest third of adherence lost more than twice as much weight as those in the lowest third of adherence ( Figure 3 ). Those, for example, in the combined-therapy group who recorded food intake frequently lost more weight than those who did so infrequently (18.1±9.8 kg vs. 7.7±7.5 kg, P=0.04). Serum Chemistry Table 2. Table 2. Changes in Cardiovascular Risk Factors at Week 52 in the Four Groups, as Determined by a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward Analysis. No significant differences in changes in cardiovascular risk factors were observed among the four groups at any time. Table 2 shows the results for week 52. Combining the four groups, significant reductions were observed in levels of triglycerides (P=0.003), glucose (P<0.001), and insulin and in insulin resistance (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Levels of total cholesterol also declined (P=0.02), whereas HDL cholesterol increased (P=0.003). Partial-correlation analysis that controlled for treatment group showed that weight loss at week 52 was correlated with decreases in triglyceride levels (r=0.31, P<0.001), insulin levels (r=0.28, P<0.001), and insulin resistance (r=0.24, P=0.006) and with increases in HDL cholesterol levels (r=0.26, P=0.004). Blood Pressure and Pulse Table 3. Table 3. Changes in Blood Pressure and Pulse during One Year of Treatment in the Four Groups, as Determined by a Last-Observation-Carried-Forward Analysis. At week 18, systolic and diastolic blood pressure both decreased more in the group treated by lifestyle modification alone than in the group given sibutramine alone or the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy (P<0.001 for both comparisons) ( Table 3 ). Diastolic blood pressure increased by approximately 3 mm Hg in the group given sibutramine alone and the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy. At one year, there were no significant differences among groups in the changes in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Changes in pulse paralleled changes in blood pressure ( Table 3 ). Partial-correlation analysis that controlled for the treatment group indicated that weight loss at week 52 was correlated with decreases in systolic blood pressure (r=0.33, P<0.001), diastolic blood pressure (r=0.22, P=0.004), and pulse rate (r=0.15, P=0.05). Medication Reduction on the Basis of Cardiovascular Status Thirty-four subjects taking sibutramine (14 in the group given sibutramine alone, 12 in the combined-therapy group, and 8 in the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy) received reduced doses in response to an increase in systolic or diastolic blood pressure of 10 mm Hg or more above baseline or an increase in the pulse rate of 15 percent or more. These criteria were selected a priori to minimize increases in blood pressure and pulse reported previously with the use of sibutramine. 4 Reducing the daily dose from 15 mg to 10 mg typically caused the elevated values to return to baseline. Adverse Events Twelve subjects discontinued treatment because of adverse events that included breast cancer, chronic inflammatory polyneuropathy, preexisting attention-deficit disorder treated with bupropion at week 12, hepatitis C, Lyme disease, back injury (in two), heart palpitations, facial rash, and pregnancy (in three, which includes the two women who were excluded from the data analysis). The only adverse events judged to be potentially related to the use of sibutramine were the heart palpitations and facial rash, both of which remitted after withdrawal of the medication. The three full-term pregnancies yielded healthy infants with normal Apgar scores. There were no significant differences among the groups in the rate of adverse events. Discussion We found that the combination of group lifestyle-modification counseling and pharmacotherapy resulted in an average loss of 12.1 kg at one year — a loss approximately double that of the groups receiving either sibutramine alone (5.0 kg) or lifestyle-modification counseling alone (6.7 kg). Nearly twice as many subjects in the combined-therapy group as in the monotherapy groups lost 10 percent or more of their initial weight, a prespecified benchmark for success. 6 These findings, which are based on all enrollees (not just those who completed treatment), provide strong support for recommendations that weight-loss medications be used only as an adjunct to a comprehensive program of diet, exercise, and behavior therapy. 6 These results also confirm previous reports of the benefits of lifestyle modification used alone for inducing clinically and statistically significant weight loss. 9,26 Subjects treated by lifestyle modification alone had significantly greater weight loss than those who received sibutramine alone during the first 18 weeks. We cannot identify the components of group lifestyle modification that contributed most to the increased weight loss when combined with sibutramine therapy. However, keeping daily food-intake records during the first 18 weeks correlated positively with weight loss at all assessments. A secondary analysis showed that subjects in the combined-therapy group who were in the top third of record-keeping lost 18.1 kg, as compared with only 7.7 kg for those in the bottom third. These observations underscore the importance of patients' efforts to modify their eating behavior, rather than relying solely on medication. 11,16,23,24 The group given sibutramine plus brief therapy was included to determine whether practitioners might provide effective lifestyle counseling during a limited number of visits of 10 to 15 minutes each, intended to simulate patterns of primary care practice. Subjects in this group lost significantly more weight at week 18 than did those who received sibutramine alone. Thus, it appears that practitioners may be able to provide brief, effective weight-loss counseling. However, the superiority of this approach faded after week 18, when the frequency of visits was reduced. Treatment with sibutramine plus brief therapy appeared to be as effective in inducing and maintaining weight loss as lifestyle modification alone, which required participation in 30 group sessions of 90 minutes each. Future studies comparing these two therapeutic strategies should include an economic analysis to weigh savings in patients' time and travel against the costs of medication and physicians' visits. 27 Studies also must include a thorough evaluation of the status of the patients' general health. At both weeks 18 and 40, we found significant differences between these two groups in changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The difference in diastolic blood pressure was attributable, in part, to a slight rise in blood pressure, as reported previously, 4,28,29 in subjects in the group given sibutramine plus brief therapy. These increases were minimized by selectively reducing the dose of sibutramine in 34 subjects from the three groups that included drug therapy. Analysis of other cardiovascular risk factors revealed clinically significant improvements in triglyceride levels and insulin resistance, as estimated by the homeostasis model of insulin sensitivity. 30 Our goal was to compare the efficacy of two well-established therapies for obesity — lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy — and to determine whether the two in combination would be more effective than either treatment alone. We intentionally did not conduct a placebo-controlled trial, since the efficacy of sibutramine has been established in more than a dozen such trials. 28 We wished to assess the efficacy of group lifestyle modification alone as customarily delivered. The inclusion of a placebo with this treatment could potentially have undermined subjects' efforts to adhere to diet and exercise recommendations and, thus, limited their weight loss. 11,31,32 Our findings strongly suggest that the best weight-loss results will be obtained when medication is used as an adjunct to a comprehensive program of diet, exercise, and behavior therapy. Further research is needed to identify effective methods of providing lifestyle counseling in primary care and community settings. 33 Funding and Disclosures Supported by grants (DK56124 and DK065018) from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

The development of warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (also known as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [WAHA]) in patients with babesiosis has not previously been well described. Methods After the observation of sporadic cases of WAHA that occurred after treatment of patients for babesiosis, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all the patients with babesiosis who were cared for at our center from January 2009 through June 2016. Data on covariates of interest were extracted from the medical records, including any hematologic complications that occurred within 3 months after the diagnosis and treatment of babesiosis. Results A total of 86 patients received a diagnosis of babesiosis during the 7.5-year study period; 18 of these patients were asplenic. WAHA developed in 6 patients 2 to 4 weeks after the diagnosis of babesiosis, by which time all the patients had had clinical and laboratory responses to antimicrobial treatment of babesiosis, including clearance of Babesia microti parasitemia. All 6 patients were asplenic (P<0.001) and had positive direct antiglobulin tests for IgG and complement component 3; warm autoantibodies were identified in all these patients. No alternative explanation for clinical hemolysis was found. WAHA required immunosuppressive treatment in 4 of the 6 patients. Conclusions We documented post-babesiosis WAHA in patients who did not have a history of autoimmunity; asplenic patients appeared to be particularly at risk. Introduction Babesiosis is a tickborne zoonotic disease that is caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus babesia. In the northeastern and upper midwestern regions of the United States, where Babesia microti is endemic, the incidence of babesiosis has increased dramatically in the past 10 years, particularly in New England. 1,2 The severity of babesiosis varies from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening disease. The most common clinical presentation is a viral-like illness with fever and laboratory abnormalities including anemia. 3 Risk factors for the development of severe babesiosis include older age, asplenia, immunodeficiency due to malignant or nonmalignant disease, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, and immunosuppressive therapy, such as B-cell depletion caused by rituximab. 4-8 Patients with babesiosis frequently have clinical hemolysis. Intraerythrocytic protozoa replicate asexually and leave red cells to invade other erythrocytes by disrupting the cell membrane and lysing the cell. 1 Non–immune-mediated hemolysis associated with babesiosis resolves with appropriate antimicrobial treatment and clearing of the parasitemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia, on the other hand, is caused by autoantibodies produced against the patient’s own erythrocytes, which leads to premature elimination of these cells from the circulation. Warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia (also known as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia [WAHA]) is a type of anemia that is frequently seen in patients who have lymphoproliferative disorders or autoimmune conditions or who use certain medications. 9 Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is associated with certain infections, including HIV 8 and malaria. 10 There have been sporadic cases reported of immune hemolysis complicating babesiosis in patients with ongoing parasitemia or a history of autoimmune hemolysis. 11-14 We present six cases of asplenic patients without previous autoimmune hemolytic anemia in whom WAHA developed 2 to 4 weeks after diagnosis of babesiosis despite antimicrobial treatment and resolution of B. microti parasitemia. Methods Study Cohort All the patients with a diagnosis of babesiosis who received care at Brigham and Women’s Hospital between January 1, 2009, and June 30, 2016, were identified through the hospital Research Patient Data Registry and a review of parasitology laboratory records. The Partners HealthCare Human Research Committee approved this study and waived the requirement for written informed consent. Data on covariates of interest were extracted from the medical records, including patient demographic characteristics, underlying disease and coexisting conditions, level of B. microti parasitemia, antimicrobial treatment, transfusions of blood products, blood counts, and the results of blood-bank testing, including antibody screening, Coombs’ test (direct antiglobulin test), and antibody identification. We collected data on all hematologic complications and treatments that occurred in the ensuing 3 months after the diagnosis of babesiosis. Laboratory Assessments A warm autoantibody was identified if the following standard criteria were met: antibody screening was positive; all cells on the red-cell panel were reactive with patient plasma, including autologous red cells; the direct antiglobulin test was positive; and eluate from patient red cells reacted with all cells tested. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recommendations were followed for assessment of parasitemia: thick and thin blood smears were evaluated by examination of a minimum of 300 oil-immersion fields per blood film to determine the presence of babesia parasites. Results Babesiosis Cohort Figure 1. Figure 1. Peripheral-Blood Smear from Patient 6 with Post-Babesiosis Warm-Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia. Panel A (Wright–Giemsa stain) shows Babesia microti ring forms (arrowheads) from the day of diagnosis of babesiosis. Panel B (Wright–Giemsa stain) shows evidence of warm-antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia including polychromasia, nucleated red cells (arrow), and erythrophagocytosis (inset). In both panels, Howell–Jolly bodies (asterisks) are indicative of asplenia. Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of Patients with Babesiosis Treated at Brigham and Women’s Hospital from January 1, 2009, through June 30, 2016. A total of 86 patients had a diagnosis of babesiosis during the 7.5-year period, with confirmation by blood smear ( Figure 1A ) or polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay ( Table 1 ). Of the 86 patients, 18 were asplenic. Blood-bank testing was performed in 20 patients (23%) after the diagnosis of babesiosis, and 12 (14%) had direct antiglobulin tests performed. Nine of 12 direct antiglobulin tests were positive. Seven asplenic patients had warm autoantibodies identified, 6 of whom had clinical post-babesiosis WAHA and no alternative or additional explanations for clinical hemolysis. Sentinel Case The sentinel case involved a 43-year-old woman who had undergone splenectomy for Hodgkin’s lymphoma 15 years before the onset of babesiosis. She was hospitalized in 2009 with low-grade fevers and fatigue 2 weeks after receiving a tick bite. The level of B. microti parasitemia was 11%, and the hematocrit was 33%. Serologic tests for anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, and Lyme borreliosis were negative at that time. She was treated with azithromycin, atovaquone, and clindamycin. At discharge, the parasitemia level was 0.2% and the hematocrit was 34%. Four weeks after the diagnosis of babesiosis, the hematocrit declined to 25%, although no parasites were detected on smears. She had evidence of hemolysis with a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 773 U per liter, a reticulocyte count of 11%, and undetectable haptoglobin. Blood-bank testing was notable for a positive direct antiglobulin test for both IgG and complement component 3 (C3). A warm autoimmune antibody was identified. She received 4 weeks of prednisone treatment for WAHA, and antiparasitic treatment was continued for a total of 12 weeks because of uncertainty about the cause of her recrudescent hemolysis. The hemolysis resolved within 2 weeks after the initiation of prednisone. Cases of Post-Babesiosis WAHA Table 2. Table 2. Clinical Characteristics of Patients with Babesiosis in Whom WAHA Developed. Characteristics of the six cases of post-babesiosis WAHA are summarized in Table 2 . Patients had various underlying medical conditions but no history of autoimmunity. All had undergone splenectomy, five at least 1 year before presentation. B. microti was confirmed by PCR assay, and the parasitemia level ranged from 2.5% to 11.8%. All the patients had clinical and laboratory responses to antimicrobial treatment. All six patients were hospitalized for the initial management of babesiosis, and one required intensive care for the acute respiratory distress syndrome and intracranial hemorrhage. None of the six patients had evidence of coinfection with anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, or Lyme borreliosis. At 2 to 4 weeks after diagnosis, acute anemia, characterized by an elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV), reticulocytosis, an undetectable haptoglobin level, and an increased LDH level, developed in all six patients ( Figure 1B ). Although B. microti PCR tests remained positive in five of the six cases, parasitemia was undetectable on smears in all the cases. Direct antiglobulin tests for IgG and C3 were positive, eluates were panreactive (panagglutinins) without any antigen specificity, and a warm autoantibody was present. Only one patient had received a blood transfusion within 2 months before the development of WAHA. In one patient, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura developed in addition to WAHA (the Evans syndrome). The other five patients did not have additional autoimmune phenomena other than WAHA. The severity of WAHA varied, as did the medical management of the condition. Four of the six patients required immunosuppressive treatment. Three patients received glucocorticoids alone for 3 to 6 weeks, and one patient received prednisone for 5 months and cyclophosphamide for 8 months. WAHA resolved within a few weeks without intervention in two patients. In the three cases in which blood-bank testing was repeated, the time to a negative direct antiglobulin test ranged from 10 days to 5.5 months. An additional patient with a history of thalassemia major, previous splenectomy, and erythrocyte transfusions every 2 weeks had a weakly positive direct antiglobulin test result starting 4 weeks after the diagnosis of babesiosis, after the resolution of parasitemia on blood smear. A warm autoantibody was not identified until 11 weeks after babesiosis was diagnosed. Given the confounding factors of chronic hemolytic anemia and frequent transfusion requirements, the contribution of the warm autoantibody to her underlying clinical hemolysis could not be assessed; therefore, her case was not included among the cases of post-babesiosis WAHA. Risk Factors for Post-Babesiosis WAHA All the case patients had undergone splenectomy, as compared with 12 of the 80 patients in whom the syndrome did not develop (P<0.001 by Fisher’s exact test). No patient with post-babesiosis WAHA underwent exchange transfusion for the treatment of babesiosis, whereas 6 of the other 80 patients in the cohort did undergo transfusion (P=1.0); only 2 of the 18 splenectomized patients underwent exchange transfusion (P=0.74). Discussion Persons who have undergone splenectomy are at higher risk for severe and relapsing babesiosis and, like other immunocompromised persons, typically receive longer courses of antiparasitic medications than otherwise healthy persons. 7 Although prolonged antimicrobial treatment may prevent relapsing babesiosis, the cases presented here show a unique syndrome of recrudescent clinical hemolysis 2 to 4 weeks after the initiation of antiparasitic treatment, in the absence of parasitemia on peripheral-blood smear. The post-babesiosis WAHA syndrome occurred in 7% of all the patients with babesiosis during the study period and in one third of asplenic patients. Although four patients required immunosuppressive treatment owing to the severity of their clinical hemolysis, there were no deaths as may occur in severe cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, especially when there are delays in the administration of immunosuppressive treatment or the transfusion of blood products. 15 We have described here a clinical syndrome of post-babesiosis WAHA in patients without a history of immune-mediated hemolysis. Although the development of autoimmunity to red cells in asplenic patients with babesiosis has been noted previously in seven cases, there was ongoing parasitemia in five of these cases at the time of positivity on direct antiglobulin tests. 11-14 In one of these cases, immune hemolysis developed in the context of transfusion-related alloantibodies. 11 Two of the seven patients had a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia before acquiring babesiosis and subsequently had the Evans syndrome. 14 The cases in the current report are distinct in that WAHA developed despite the clearance of B. microti parasitemia, and none of the patients had a history of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. An asplenic patient recently received a diagnosis of post-babesiosis WAHA at Nantucket Cottage Hospital, Massachusetts, and has required immunosuppression with glucocorticoids and rituximab (Pearl D: personal communication). The infrequency of asplenia in the general population may explain why post-babesiosis WAHA had not been recognized previously in endemic areas. We considered alternative explanations for WAHA in our patients, but none seemed plausible. Although Hodgkin’s lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia are rarely associated with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, our two patients with these cancers were in remission at the time of presentation. The one patient in whom the syndrome developed 3 years after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation had a self-limited course without the need for immunosuppression, making a graft-versus-host disease–like phenomenon unlikely. Only one patient with the syndrome had received a transfusion in the 3 months before presentation, and no alloantibodies were detected. Drug-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia is unlikely, because only one patient received quinine, 16 and autoimmune hemolytic anemia has not been associated with atovaquone, azithromycin, or clindamycin. 17 Although PCR testing for B. microti remained positive in five of the six cases at the time of the diagnosis of WAHA, there was no evidence of parasitemia on peripheral-blood smears. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood smears has a detection limit of 10 to 100 parasites per microliter (0.0002 to 0.002% parasitemia), whereas PCR testing for B. microti lowers the limit of detection to 5 parasites per microliter (approximately 0.0001% parasitemia). 18 Such a low parasite burden cannot clinically explain the degree of hemolytic anemia that developed in these patients at the time of the diagnosis of WAHA. A plausible mechanism for post-babesiosis WAHA in asplenic patients is immune-complex–mediated, or type III, hypersensitivity. In type III hypersensitivity, the antibody response to foreign antigens leads to the overproduction of immunoglobulins and increased amounts of insoluble immune complexes. These immune complexes are removed inefficiently by phagocytosis, particularly in asplenic patients, and can trigger the classical complement cascade and intense release of inflammatory mediators and subsequent lysis of red cells. 19 In the absence of a spleen to maintain red-cell surfaces free of immune complexes, accumulation of these complexes may occur to a critical threshold, leading to clinically significant red-cell phagocytic clearance and complement-mediated destruction. 19 An alternative explanation for the development of post-babesiosis WAHA is antibody-mediated, or type II, hypersensitivity, in which cross-reacting antibodies initially elicited against B. microti antigens that have been adsorbed onto red cells are subsequently elicited against similar human antigens. Splenectomy would facilitate the persistence of these erythrocytic surface antigens, which otherwise would be removed rapidly by the spleen, and the subsequent development of autoreactive antibodies. The time needed to stimulate and accumulate autoreactive antibodies may account for the delay of a few weeks that we observed for the development of WAHA after the initial diagnosis of babesiosis. A postinfectious delayed autoimmune hemolytic anemia has also been described with malaria, 20 including in a few cases that occurred 1 to 4 weeks after the treatment of severe malaria with parenteral artesunate, by which time the patients had clinical improvement and resolution of parasitemia. 21,22 The pathogenesis of post-babesiosis WAHA seems distinct from that of autoimmune hemolytic anemia in general. Splenectomy is a treatment for autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas in this syndrome, asplenia is a risk factor. In addition, in typical autoimmune hemolytic anemia, direct binding of antibody or complement to red-cell membranes leads to clearance by reticuloendothelial system cells rather than immune-complex deposition on the surface of red cells. 23 In summary, the post-babesiosis WAHA syndrome can be a hematologic complication of babesiosis, and asplenic patients appear to be particularly at risk. Immune-mediated hemolysis and screening for WAHA should be considered in patients with worsening or recrudescent hemolytic anemia after treatment of babesiosis, especially in asplenic patients. Post-babesiosis WAHA responds to immunosuppressive treatment rather than antiparasitic treatment. Understanding the activation of the immune response to babesiosis may elucidate the mechanisms of other causes of autoimmune hemolytic anemias.

A course of clindamycin and quinine is the standard treatment, but this regimen frequently causes adverse reactions and occasionally fails. A promising alternative treatment is atovaquone plus azithromycin. Methods We conducted a prospective, nonblinded, randomized trial of the two regimens in 58 subjects with non–life-threatening babesiosis on Nantucket, Massachusetts; on Block Island, Rhode Island; and in southern Connecticut. The subjects were assigned to receive either atovaquone (750 mg every 12 hours) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg per day thereafter) for seven days (40 subjects) or clindamycin (600 mg every 8 hours) and quinine (650 mg every 8 hours) for seven days (18 subjects). Results Adverse effects were reported by 15 percent of the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin, as compared with 72 percent of those who received clindamycin and quinine (P<0.001). The most common adverse effects with atovaquone and azithromycin were diarrhea and rash (each in 8 percent of the subjects); with clindamycin and quinine the most common adverse effects were tinnitus (39 percent), diarrhea (33 percent), and decreased hearing (28 percent). Symptoms had resolved three months after the start of therapy in 65 percent of those who received atovaquone and azithromycin and 73 percent of those who received clindamycin and quinine (P=0.66), and after six months no patient in either group had symptoms. Three months after the completion of the assigned regimen, no parasites could be seen on microscopy, and no Babesia microti DNA was detected in the blood of any subject. Conclusions For the treatment of babesiosis, a regimen of atovaquone and azithromycin is as effective as a regimen of clindamycin and quinine and is associated with fewer adverse reactions. Introduction Human babesiosis due to Babesia microti is a tick-borne, malaria-like infection that may cause severe illness and death. It is enzootic mainly in southern New England, southern New York, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. 1-6 Occasional infections in humans due to such piroplasms as Bab. divergens, an isolate from Washington state (WA1), and an isolate from Missouri (MO1) have been described elsewhere in North America, in Europe, and in Asia. 7-10 Although a course of clindamycin and quinine is generally prescribed for patients with babesiosis, this regimen frequently causes adverse reactions (including tinnitus and gastroenteritis) and occasionally fails. 11-13 A course of atovaquone and azithromycin is a promising alternative for the treatment of this zoonosis; this combination effectively eliminates babesial infection in hamsters, and adverse reactions are rare when these drugs are used to treat malaria in humans. 14-16 We conducted a prospective, nonblinded, randomized trial in southern New England to compare the safety and efficacy of a regimen of atovaquone and azithromycin with those of a conventional regimen of clindamycin and quinine in people with babesiosis. Methods Study Population Subjects with symptomatic babesiosis were enrolled in this prospective, nonblinded, randomized study conducted at clinics on Nantucket, Massachusetts; on Block Island, Rhode Island; and in southern Connecticut. Enrollment took place during the period of peak transmission (May to September) each year from 1995 through 1998. After written informed consent was obtained from the patients, a medical history was obtained and a physical examination performed. A standardized questionnaire was used to obtain information on symptoms. 17 Laboratory studies were performed at the University of Connecticut Health Center and included microscopical examination of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears, attempted amplification of Bab. microti DNA, and evaluation of serologic reactivity against Bab. microti, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Ehrlichia equi antigens. Tests for the latter two microorganisms, which are the agents of Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, respectively, were included because these infections are transmitted by the same tick that transmits Bab. microti infection ( Ixodes dammini, also known as I. scapularis ) and because coinfection with these microorganisms may occur in both ticks and humans. Random assignment of consecutive eligible subjects to one of the treatment regimens was performed at each study site without blocking and with the use of a table of random numbers ensuring that about two thirds of the subjects at each study site received atovaquone (Mepron, Glaxo Wellcome, Research Triangle Park, N.C.) at a dose of 750 mg every 12 hours and azithromycin (Zithromax, Pfizer, New York) at a dose of 500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg per day thereafter and about one third received clindamycin (Cleocin, Pharmacia & Upjohn, Bridgewater, N.J.) at a dose of 600 mg every 8 hours and quinine at a dose of 650 mg every 8 hours. All the antibiotics were given by mouth for seven days. The subjects were asked to complete a standardized daily diary of symptoms, including any possible adverse reactions to the study drugs. Follow-up visits were scheduled to take place one week, two weeks, and one, three, and six months after the completion of therapy and monthly thereafter until symptoms were gone and parasitemia resolved (as documented by staining of blood smears and amplification of DNA). Subjects were enrolled in the study if they had the following: symptoms consistent with the presence of babesiosis; positive serologic reactivity against Bab. microti antigen (an elevation by a factor of four in the Bab. microti antibody titer, according to an indirect fluorescence antibody assay, in serum samples obtained during the acute and convalescent phases, or an antibody titer greater than 1:1024); and evidence of Bab. microti parasites on a Giemsa-stained thin blood smear or detection of Bab. microti DNA in a blood sample (by polymerase-chain-reaction [PCR] amplification). Subjects were excluded from the study if they had a babesial illness that was life-threatening (characterized by encephalopathy, shock, congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema, diffuse intravascular coagulation, or renal failure), required an exchange transfusion or assisted ventilation, had an allergy to one of the study drugs, or were 18 years of age or younger. A diagnosis of acute Lyme disease required either a physician's diagnosis of erythema migrans (defined as an expanding, ringlike erythematous rash ≥5 cm in diameter) or symptoms consistent with the presence of Lyme disease, accompanied by an elevation by a factor of four in the Borr. burgdorferi antibody titer. 18 Concurrent infection with Lyme disease or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was diagnosed in subjects who had characteristic symptoms and in whom laboratory findings suggested infection by the agent of one of these diseases. Diagnostic Studies Microscopical Evaluation Thin blood smears were prepared from blood samples that were treated with EDTA as an anticoagulant, fixed in absolute methanol, and placed for one hour in 5 percent Giemsa at a pH of 7.0. 17 The slides were then washed and dried and a coverslip added. Each slide was viewed at a magnification of 400. At least 100 microscopical fields had to be examined before a sample could be considered free of piroplasms. When evidence of piroplasms was seen, their presence was confirmed and the diagnosis of babesiosis established by viewing the slide with an oil-immersion objective that provided a magnification of 1000. Thin blood smears were prepared at each site and analyzed at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Serologic Evaluation Babesial infection was diagnosed serologically by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. 19 Serum samples were diluted 1:32 in phosphate-buffered saline, and the titers of all reactive serum samples were determined to their end point. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate–labeled goat antihuman IgG or IgM (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, Md.) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline and Evans blue to a final concentration of 0.0005 percent. Slides were examined at a magnification of 630 under epifluorescence. For comparison, each series of tests included serum from a subject who had babesial infection (a positive control), serum from an adult who appeared never to have been infected with babesia (a negative control), and phosphate-buffered saline. A positive specimen was defined as one that reacted at a dilution of 1:32 or greater. Molecular Evaluation Samples of whole blood were analyzed and processed by personnel who were unaware of the clinical status of the subjects. A 238-bp portion of the Bab. microti nuclear small-subunit ribosomal gene was targeted for amplification with a PCR protocol as described previously, 20,21 except that the volume of blood analyzed was 0.5 ml rather than 0.2 ml. Assays for Coinfecting Agents Serologic evidence of exposure to the spirochete that causes Lyme disease was assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as previously described. 17 A positive serum sample was defined as one that reacted at a dilution equal to or greater than 1:320 for IgG and equal to or greater than 1:160 for IgM. Evidence of exposure to the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis was defined as the presence of morulae in thin blood smears, amplification of a DNA sequence characteristic of this pathogen in subjects' blood, or detection of seroreactivity by indirect immunofluorescence with use of fluorescein-labeled polyvalent antihuman IgG as previously described. 22,23 Statistical Analysis An appropriate sample size was estimated before the start of our study on the basis of a previous study in which parasitemia resolved 12 weeks after the start of treatment in 73 percent of patients treated with clindamycin and quinine. 6 Half or double that rate of clearance after therapy with atovaquone and azithromycin was assumed to represent a clinically significant difference between the two treatment groups. We estimated that 60 subjects would be needed to provide the study with 80 percent power to detect a statistically significant difference, with an error rate of 5 percent. Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables; continuous variables were summarized as means and standard deviations, and categorical variables were summarized as frequencies. Subjects treated with atovaquone and azithromycin and those treated with clindamycin and quinine were compared in terms of age, sex, symptoms, and adverse reactions with use of Student's t-test or Fisher's exact test. The rate of persistence of babesial infection in the two treatment groups, as indicated by findings on Giemsa-stained thin blood smears and by amplification of DNA, was evaluated with use of product-limit (Kaplan–Meier) survival estimates, without censoring, on the basis of the last time at which Bab. microti DNA could be amplified from each subject. All reported P values are two-sided. Results Study Population Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of the Subjects at the Start of Treatment for Babesia microti Infection and Frequency of Adverse Reactions to the Study Drugs. Table 2. Table 2. Symptoms of Acute Illness in Subjects with Babesia microti Infection. Of the 59 subjects who were enrolled in the study, 41 were randomly assigned to receive atovaquone and azithromycin, and 18 were randomly assigned to receive clindamycin and quinine. Forty-three of the enrolled subjects were from Nantucket, 12 were from Connecticut, and 4 were from Block Island. One of the subjects assigned to receive atovaquone and azithromycin was excluded from all analyses because he became severely ill and required assisted ventilation two days after enrollment. The subjects in the two treatment groups had similar age and sex distributions, had a similar array of symptoms, and had a similar degree of parasitemia when therapy commenced ( Table 1 and Table 2 ). Parasites were visualized on the thin blood smear in 82 percent of the subjects assigned to receive atovaquone and azithromycin and 89 percent of those assigned to receive clindamycin and quinine; Bab. microti DNA was amplified from whole-blood samples from the other subjects. One subject who was assigned to atovaquone and azithromycin and two who were assigned to clindamycin and quinine were asplenic, and one subject in each treatment group was receiving maintenance therapy with corticosteroids. None of the subjects were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or were pregnant. The two groups were similar with respect to the frequency of coinfection with the agent of Lyme disease (22 percent in the atovaquone-and-azithromycin group and 17 percent in the clindamycin-and-quinine group) or with the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (none of the subjects in either group). Fever occurred in 92 percent of those assigned to atovaquone and azithromycin and in 94 percent of those assigned to clindamycin and quinine. The distribution of oral temperatures recorded by study physicians just before the start of antibiotic therapy in the atovaquone-and-azithromycin group was similar to that in the clindamycin-and-quinine group (<37.2°C in 33 percent and 27 percent, respectively; 37.2°C to 38.2°C in 33 percent and 28 percent; 38.3°C to 39.4°C in 31 percent and 39 percent; and 39.5°C to 40.6°C in 3 percent and 6 percent). The median hematocrit in the atovaquone-and-azithromycin group (37.7 percent [range, 29.9 to 43.7]) was similar to that in the clindamycin-and-quinine group (33.2 percent [range, 20.0 to 45.2]). All of the subjects who were coinfected with the agents of babesiosis and Lyme disease received appropriate therapy for Lyme disease. The subjects assigned to atovaquone and azithromycin had an array of symptoms and tick-associated infections similar to that in subjects assigned to clindamycin and quinine. Frequency and Severity of Adverse Drug Reactions We next distinguished the symptoms that could be attributed to babesiosis from those that appeared to be caused by the study drugs. Of the 18 subjects who received clindamycin and quinine, 13 (72 percent) reported symptoms that are known to be adverse effects of quinine, including decreased hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, and diarrhea ( Table 2 ). In six of these subjects, the apparent drug reactions were severe enough that the drugs were discontinued or the dosages decreased. In contrast, only 6 (15 percent) of the 40 subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin reported symptoms consistent with adverse drug reactions, and in 1 of them treatment was discontinued on the sixth day because of a hive-like rash (relative risk of an adverse reaction with clindamycin and quinine, 4.81; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.18 to 10.62; P<0.001). Overall, adverse reactions were fewer and less severe in the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin than in those who received clindamycin and quinine. Resolution of Symptoms To compare the effects of atovaquone and azithromycin with those of clindamycin and quinine on the duration of symptoms, we determined the proportion of subjects in each treatment group whose symptoms resolved completely within one week and one, three, and six months after the beginning of treatment. Fever resolved within eight days after the start of treatment in all the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin and within seven days in all the subjects who received clindamycin and quinine. In more than half the subjects in each group, symptoms had resolved at three months (65 percent of the subjects in the atovaquone-and-azithromycin group and 73 percent of those in the clindamycin-and-quinine group, P=0.66). In none of the subjects in either group did symptoms persist six months after the start of treatment. Persistent symptoms of babesiosis were severe enough in 4 of the 18 subjects who received clindamycin and quinine that they were admitted to the hospital after one or two days of treatment. Each then received a seven-day course of intravenous clindamycin and oral quinine. None of the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin were hospitalized after treatment was initiated. In general, symptoms of babesiosis resolved at least as rapidly in the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin as in those who received clindamycin and quinine. Duration of Bab. microti Infection Figure 1. Figure 1. Persistence of DNA Detectable by PCR Amplification in the Blood of Patients with Babesia microti Infection Who Received a Seven-Day Regimen of Clindamycin and Quinine or Atovaquone and Azithromycin. There was no significant difference in the duration of parasitemia between the 18 subjects treated with clindamycin and quinine and the 40 subjects treated with atovaquone and azithromycin (P=0.14 by the log-rank test). We also analyzed the duration of Bab. microti infection in the subjects according to their assigned treatment. Regardless of the regimen, no piroplasms were discovered on microscopical examination more than 3 weeks after the start of therapy, and no Bab. microti DNA was identified after 12 weeks ( Figure 1 ). Because parasitemia may have persisted after the last positive findings on microscopical examination or PCR analysis, we also determined the amount of time that passed between the start of therapy and an examination at which no evidence of parasitemia could be detected. Again, parasitemia persisted for as long in the subjects who received atovaquone and azithromycin as in those who received clindamycin and quinine; no evidence of infection was detected 19 months after the start of therapy. Thus, babesial infection was cleared as rapidly with an antibiotic regimen consisting of atovaquone and azithromycin as it was with a standard regimen of clindamycin and quinine. Discussion Combined therapy with clindamycin and quinine, the current treatment of choice for human babesiosis, was first used in 1982 to treat a newborn infant who had become infected with Bab. microti from a blood transfusion. 11 Although this regimen is generally successful, adverse drug-related reactions are frequent, and infection occasionally persists. 7,12,13 Of patients who receive clindamycin and quinine, about half have adverse effects, 6 most frequently tinnitus, vertigo, or gastrointestinal upset. 24 In this study, ethical considerations required us to exclude subjects who had a babesial illness that was life-threatening, or who were 18 years of age or younger, and we limited the study to people with symptoms attributable to Bab. microti infection. These restrictions therefore limit the scope of any clinical recommendations that we can make on the basis of our results. The accepted standard of care should, of course, remain the treatment of choice for any groups of patients in whom a new regimen has not been evaluated. Hence, conventional therapy with clindamycin and quinine and exchange transfusion, when necessary, should be administered to patients with babesiosis that is life-threatening. The use of atovaquone in combination with azithromycin as treatment for human babesiosis is based on the demonstrated efficacy of these drugs in treating malaria. 15,16 This drug combination effectively eliminated Bab. microti parasitemia in hamsters, 14 and it has been used successfully to treat a patient with human babesiosis after traditional therapy with clindamycin and quinine failed. 25 In hamsters, both atovaquone (a hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) alone and azithromycin (an azalide macrolide) alone appeared to be effective. Neither should be used alone, however, because the combination of the two drugs was more effective than either one alone. 14 Neither the regimen of atovaquone and azithromycin nor the regimen of clindamycin and quinine clears Bab. microti merozoites from the human blood as rapidly as might be desired. Clearance tends to be delayed and inconsistent, and in some cases blood-borne parasites may be present several months after treatment is completed. In the absence of therapy, however, Bab. microti parasitemia may persist for more than two years. 7 In clinical practice, the duration of parasitemia may be difficult to monitor, because few patients are willing to submit to repeated blood sampling. Delayed clearance is consistent with previously reported data, thereby confirming the common observations that even with the use of specific therapy parasitic pathogens persist longer than do bacteria and that babesial parasitemia appears to be particularly resistant to antimicrobial therapy. With persistent infection, symptoms may be prolonged, the possibility of relapse remains, and a subsequent blood transfusion from the infected person may endanger the recipient. The price paid by pharmacies for atovaquone and azithromycin is greater than that paid for clindamycin and quinine. However, institutions may find it economically favorable to choose atovaquone and azithromycin, because for many patients the regimen of clindamycin and quinine must be abandoned, with unused medication wasted as a result. In the long run, the issue of cost should not influence the choice between treatment with clindamycin and quinine and treatment with atovaquone and azithromycin. Our observations indicate that an antibiotic regimen based on a combination of atovaquone and azithromycin is generally superior to one based on a combination of clindamycin and quinine for treatment of babesiosis, mainly because the former is better tolerated by patients. We therefore recommend that physicians consider the use of atovaquone and azithromycin for the treatment of non–life-threatening babesiosis in immunocompetent adult patients and in others who cannot tolerate clindamycin and quinine.

Methods Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, we examined the relation between characteristics of neighborhoods and the incidence of coronary heart disease. Participants were 45 to 64 years of age at base line and were sampled from four study sites in the United States: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; the northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis; and Washington County, Maryland. As proxies for neighborhoods, we used block groups containing an average of 1000 people, as defined by the U.S. Census. We constructed a summary score for the socioeconomic environment of each neighborhood that included information about wealth and income, education, and occupation. Results During a median of 9.1 years of follow-up, 615 coronary events occurred in 13,009 participants. Residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods (those with lower summary scores) had a higher risk of disease than residents of advantaged neighborhoods, even after we controlled for personal income, education, and occupation. Hazard ratios for coronary heart disease among low-income persons living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, as compared with high-income persons in the most advantaged neighborhoods, were 3.1 among whites (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 4.8) and 2.5 among blacks (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.5). These associations remained unchanged after adjustment for established risk factors for coronary heart disease. Conclusions Even after controlling for personal income, education, and occupation, we found that living in a disadvantaged neighborhood is associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease. Introduction Today, where a person lives is not usually thought of as an important predictor of his or her health. Lifestyle and genetic explanations for the causes of disease predominate. Nevertheless, the neighborhoods where people live may differ in many aspects potentially related to health. 1-3 The socioeconomic environment of neighborhoods has been shown to be related to health status and mortality 4-9 as well as to health-related behavior such as smoking, dietary habits, and physical activity. 10-14 The relation between the characteristics of a neighborhood and health outcomes appears to be independent of the socioeconomic position of individual persons. 4-14 This suggests that attributes of neighborhoods themselves may be important to health. A variety of characteristics of neighborhoods, including the availability of resources and services to promote or maintain healthy lifestyles as well as the physical and social environment, may be related to cardiovascular risk. Although studies have suggested that neighborhood characteristics may be related to the prevalence of, risk factors for, and mortality due to coronary heart disease, 8,9,13-15 the extent to which neighborhood characteristics are related to the incidence of coronary heart disease has not been established. We examined the relation of neighborhood characteristics to the incidence of coronary heart disease (indicated by the occurrence of coronary events) among men and women in four diverse regions of the United States. Methods Study Population and Study Variables The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study is a prospective investigation of atherosclerosis in four U.S. communities: Forsyth County, North Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; the northwestern suburbs of Minneapolis; and Washington County, Maryland. The cohort was composed of 15,792 persons 45 to 64 years of age at base line who were selected by probability sampling. 16 Virtually all of the subjects from Washington County and the suburbs of Minneapolis were white. Eighty-five percent of the subjects from Forsyth County were white. All of the subjects from Jackson were black. The base-line examination took place between 1987 and 1989. Follow-up examinations were carried out every three years, and participants were contacted annually by telephone between visits to the clinic. Participants were linked to their neighborhood of residence by their home address at base line. Census-block groups, which are subdivisions of U.S. Census tracts containing an average of 1000 people, 17 were used as proxies for neighborhoods. A summary neighborhood score was used as the main indicator of the socioeconomic environment of the neighborhood. The variables used in the construction of the neighborhood score were selected on the basis of factor analyses of data from census-block groups. Factor analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to determine which variables out of a large set (for example, out of a large set of socioeconomic indicators obtained from the Census) can be meaningfully combined into a summary score. Six variables representing the dimensions of wealth and income (log of the median household income; log of the median value of housing units; and the percentage of households receiving interest, dividend, or net rental income), education (the percentage of adults 25 years of age or older who had completed high school and the percentage of adults 25 years of age or older who had completed college), and occupation (the percentage of employed persons 16 years of age or older in executive, managerial, or professional specialty occupations) were combined into the neighborhood summary score. For each variable, a z score for each block group was estimated by subtracting the overall mean (across all block groups in the sample) and dividing by the standard deviation. The z score reflects the deviation of the value from the mean. For example, a score of 2.0 for the log of the median household income for a given block group means that the value for that block group is 2 SD above the overall mean; a value of –2.0 is 2 SD below the mean. The neighborhood summary score was constructed by summing the z scores for each of the six variables. For example, if z scores for the six variables for a given block group were 1.0, 1.5, 1.8, 2.0, 1.9, and 1.8, then the neighborhood score for that block group would be 10.0. Neighborhood scores for block groups in the sample ranged from –11.3 to 14.4, with an increasing score signifying an increasing neighborhood socioeconomic advantage. Table 1. Table 1. Neighborhood Characteristics in 1990 According to Race-Specific Groups of Neighborhoods Defined According to Summary Socioeconomic Scores. Subjects of each race were divided into three roughly equal groups according to the summary socioeconomic scores for their neighborhoods. Neighborhood characteristics for these groups are shown in Table 1 . Over 80 percent of the members of the cohort continued to live in the same block group six years after base line. For those who had moved, correlations between base-line and follow-up measures of the neighborhood score and its components were in the range of 0.4 to 0.6. Information on personal income, education, and occupation was obtained from each member of the cohort during the base-line interview. Participants selected their total combined family income from eight categories (under $5,000; $5,000 to $7,999; $8,000 to $11,999; $12,000 to $15,999; $16,000 to $24,999; $25,000 to $34,999; $35,000 to $49,999; and $50,000 or more). Approximately 6 percent of study participants did not provide information on income, and their data were coded as a separate category. The level of education attained was classified as high school not completed, high school or general equivalency diploma completed, one to three years of college, four years of college completed, and some graduate or professional school. Information on the current or most recent occupation was collected for employed, unemployed, and retired participants. Occupations were coded according to the criteria of the 1980 U.S. Census and categorized according to six occupational groups: executive, managerial, and professional; technical, sales, and administrative support; service; farming, forestry, and fishing and precision production, craft, and repair; operators, fabricators, and laborers; and homemakers. 18 Information on income was updated at the six-year follow-up examination. Coronary events were ascertained by contacting participants annually by telephone, by conducting follow-up examinations, and by surveying discharge lists from local hospitals and death certificates from state vital-statistics offices. 16,19,20 Data from all hospitalizations were abstracted according to standard criteria. Death certificates were obtained, and for most deaths that did not occur in a hospital, additional information was obtained from the next of kin and from the physician. Coroners' and autopsy reports, when available, were used for validation. A coronary event was defined as a validated definite or probable myocardial infarction for which the patient was hospitalized, a death due to coronary heart disease, or an unrecognized new myocardial infarction. The criteria for definite or probable myocardial infarction were based on combinations of chest pain, electrocardiographic changes, and levels of cardiac enzymes. 19,20 The criteria for definite fatal coronary heart disease were based on chest pain, the underlying cause of death on the death certificate, and other associated information from medical records. 19,20 Unrecognized new myocardial infarction was defined by the appearance, between the first and subsequent examinations, of a major Q wave or a minor Q wave with ischemic ST-T changes or an infarction, as detected by computerized Novacode 21 and confirmed by side-by-side visual comparison of electrocardiograms. Persons who determined the occurrence of an event were unaware of the hypothesis being investigated. Events that occurred through December 31, 1997, were included in these analyses. The median follow-up was 9.1 years, and the maximal follow-up was 11.1 years. For each participant, information on cardiovascular risk factors (smoking status, the level of physical activity, diet, plasma levels of low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the presence or absence of hypertension, body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], and the presence or absence of diabetes) was obtained from the base-line examination as described elsewhere. 16 The level of physical activity was summarized in three indexes corresponding to leisure, sport, and work. 22 The dietary intake of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and cholesterol was summarized with the use of the Keys score. 23 Persons were classified as having diabetes if they had fasting plasma glucose levels of 126 mg per deciliter or more, if they had nonfasting plasma glucose levels of 200 mg per deciliter or more, or if they reported having diabetes. Persons were classified as having hypertension if they had a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, if they had a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more, or if they were taking antihypertensive medication. Information on smoking, blood lipids, body-mass index, hypertension, and diabetes was also obtained at the three-year and six-year follow-up examinations. Information on diet and physical activity was updated at the six-year follow-up examination. Of the 15,792 participants at base line, 14,158 were linked to block-group data. Ninety-eight participants who were neither white nor black or who were black and living in the suburbs of Minneapolis or in Washington County were excluded, because small numbers made analyses for these groups unreliable. Fifty-seven participants were excluded because information on education, information on occupation, or follow-up information was unavailable. After the exclusion of 994 participants with preexisting coronary heart disease (electrocardiographic signs of a previous myocardial infarction or a history of physician-diagnosed myocardial infarction, coronary heart surgery, or balloon angioplasty) or unknown disease status at base line, 13,009 participants in 595 block groups (with a median of 16 participants per block group) were available for analysis. Adjusted analyses of risk factors at base line were limited to 12,243 participants because of missing data on risk factors. The study was approved by the institutional review board at each site. All participants gave written informed consent. Statistical Analysis Because of large differences in the distribution of neighborhood characteristics, analyses were performed separately for blacks in Jackson and Forsyth County and for whites in Washington County, Forsyth County, and the suburbs of Minneapolis. Base-line values for neighborhood characteristics and personal socioeconomic indicators were compared with the use of linear and logistic regression for participants in whom coronary heart disease did and did not develop. 24 Incidence rates were calculated by dividing the number of events by the person-years of follow-up within race-specific groups of participants defined according to the neighborhood score. Incidence rates were adjusted for age at base line and for study site with the use of Poisson regression. 25 Patterns were consistent across all components of the neighborhood score, so only results for the summary score are reported. Proportional-hazards regression 26 was used to obtain hazard ratios for coronary heart disease according to the three groups of neighborhood scores after adjustment for personal indicators of social position (income, education, and occupation) and after additional adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. We performed tests for trend by introducing neighborhood groups defined according to summary scores (lowest, intermediate, and highest) as ordinal variables in regressions. 25 The combined effects of neighborhood characteristics and personal socioeconomic status were examined by estimating incidence rates (and hazard ratios) for nine cross-classified categories of neighborhood score and personal income. For these analyses, annual income in each racial group was categorized as less than $25,000 (25 percent of the sample), $25,000 to $49,999 (43 percent), and $50,000 or more (32 percent) for whites and as less than $8,000 (26 percent), $8,000 to $24,999 (43 percent), and $25,000 or more (31 percent) for blacks. In order to account for potential within-neighborhood correlations in outcomes, models were run with the use of SUDAAN statistical software. 27 All reported P values are two-tailed. Results Table 2. Table 2. Base-Line Characteristics of Study Participants in Whom Coronary Heart Disease Did and Did Not Develop. A total of 615 coronary events occurred during the follow-up period in the 13,009 participants. Age-adjusted incidence rates of coronary heart disease were 7.3 per 1000 person-years among white men, 2.8 per 1000 among white women, 8.0 per 1000 among black men, and 4.5 per 1000 among black women. Participants in whom disease developed were generally more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods (those with lower summary scores) than those in whom disease did not develop ( Table 2 ). Persons in whom coronary disease developed also tended to have lower levels of income and education and were less likely to have executive, managerial, or professional occupations than those in whom coronary disease did not develop ( Table 2 ). All risk factors investigated, such as smoking and hypertension, were generally associated with an increased incidence of coronary heart disease (data not shown). Table 3. Table 3. Incidence of Coronary Events in Whites and Blacks. Table 4. Table 4. Hazard Ratios for Coronary Heart Disease According to Race-Specific Groups of Neighborhood Scores before and after Adjustment for Personal Socioeconomic Indicators and Base-Line Risk Factors. The incidence of coronary heart disease generally decreased with increasing neighborhood scores ( Table 3 ). Although associations of the neighborhood score with incidence were reduced after adjustment for personal socioeconomic indicators ( Table 4 ), differences between the most disadvantaged and the most advantaged neighborhood categories remained. Living in the most disadvantaged group of neighborhoods, as compared with the most advantaged group, was associated with a 70 to 90 percent higher risk of coronary disease in whites and a 30 to 50 percent higher risk in blacks. Persons living in disadvantaged neighborhoods often had more unfavorable risk-factor profiles for coronary heart disease than those in more advantaged neighborhoods (data not shown). However, the differences were often small (and sometimes absent) after we controlled for personal socioeconomic indicators (which were also generally inversely associated with cardiovascular risk-factor levels). We observed more unfavorable risk profiles in more advantaged neighborhoods with respect to plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in black men and for the work component of the physical-activity index in white men in both unadjusted analyses and those that controlled for personal socioeconomic indicators. The addition of cardiovascular risk factors to regression models already containing personal socioeconomic indicators had little effect on the relation between neighborhood characteristics and the incidence of coronary heart disease ( Table 4 ). We obtained similar results when we included risk factors and personal income as time-dependent covariates (data not shown). Figure 1. Figure 1. Incidence Rates of Coronary Heart Disease, Adjusted for Age, Study Site, and Sex According to Race-Specific Groups of Neighborhoods, Defined According to Summary Socioeconomic Scores, and According to Personal Income in Whites and Blacks. Group 1 (scores in the lowest third) corresponds to the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, and group 3 (scores in the highest third) corresponds to the most advantaged neighborhoods. Both neighborhood characteristics and personal income were independently associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease ( Figure 1 ). Overall, in whites, the neighborhood score was inversely associated with the risk of disease in all categories of personal income, and income was inversely associated with risk in all three neighborhood groups. Similar patterns were observed in blacks, but analyses were limited by small samples. Hazard ratios for coronary events for low-income persons in the group of neighborhoods with the lowest scores as compared with high-income persons in the group of neighborhoods with the highest scores were 3.1 in whites (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 4.8) and 2.5 in blacks (95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.5). These patterns were similar after adjustment for changes in income between base line and the six-year follow-up examination (data not shown). Discussion The relation between the incidence of coronary heart disease and socioeconomic factors has been documented repeatedly. 28 Our findings demonstrate the additional contribution of the neighborhood of residence to the risk of coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease was more likely to develop in persons living in the most disadvantaged group of neighborhoods than those living in the most advantaged group, even after we controlled for personal socioeconomic indicators. We minimized the possibility of residual confounding by socioeconomic position by simultaneously adjusting for income, education, and occupation, each divided into multiple categories. Previous studies have documented geographic variations in mortality due to coronary heart disease, 29-32 but the areas examined have often been large. In addition, because areas rather than individual persons were the units of analysis in these studies, it is difficult to determine whether geographic variations are due to differences among the residents of various areas or to characteristics of the areas themselves. The availability of Census data linked to personal data allowed us to examine directly whether the characteristics of smaller areas (akin to neighborhoods) are related to the risk of disease independently of the attributes of individual persons. Neighborhood characteristics could contribute to the development and persistence of established risk factors. Thus, risk factors may be thought of as mediators (rather than confounders) of the effects of neighborhoods. Neighborhoods may differ in the amount of tobacco advertising 33,34 and in the availability and cost of healthful foods. 35-37 Individual behavior may, in turn, influence the neighborhood, making both factors mutually reinforcing. 38 Differences among neighborhoods in the physical environment, in the availability and quality of public spaces and recreational facilities, and in perceived safety may affect patterns of physical activity. 39,40 Social norms may emerge and exert their effects in neighborhoods, influencing health-related behavior. Living in various types of neighborhoods may be associated with exposure to sources of chronic stress (such as noise, violence, and poverty itself) and to sources of social support, both of which may be linked to the risk of cardiovascular disease. 41,42 We did document some differences (albeit often small) among neighborhoods in established risk factors for cardiovascular disease after controlling for personal socioeconomic status. However, additional adjustment for these risk factors did not substantially alter our estimates of differences in the incidence of coronary heart disease among neighborhoods. The failure of risk factors to explain differences in the risk of cardiovascular disease among socioeconomic groups is a common finding, even in studies focusing on traditional measures of personal income, education, and occupation (which are often strongly associated with risk factors). 28 Errors in the measurement of risk factors remain a possibility. Unaccounted-for interactions between risk factors (or between risk factors and unmeasured characteristics, such as psychosocial factors related to neighborhood characteristics) may play a part. Alternatively, mediating mechanisms that do not involve established risk factors may be involved. However, the method of investigating whether a set of factors mediates an observed effect by comparing estimates before and after adjustment has limitations. 43 Therefore, we caution against concluding that the risk factors we investigated (or the interactions involving these risk factors) do not mediate any part of the differences among neighborhoods that we observed. The causal chains involved are likely to be complex. Effects of neighborhoods were observed in both racial groups, despite the fact that blacks were drawn from significantly more disadvantaged neighborhoods than whites — a fact that limited the range of neighborhood environments that could be examined. In previous cross-sectional analyses, we documented an unexpectedly low prevalence of coronary heart disease among black men living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. 13 This pattern was not apparent for the incidence of coronary heart disease, although associations with the neighborhood score were weaker and less consistent in blacks than in whites. These differences should be interpreted with caution, given the differences in sample size and in the range of neighborhood scores (and personal socioeconomic indicators) investigated in both groups. Important strengths of our study include its population-based nature and the availability of detailed and validated information on coronary outcomes and risk factors. However, nearly 90 percent of the sample of black subjects was drawn from a single southern city, which may limit the generalizability of our results to blacks in other areas. Whites were drawn from three diverse regions, but the sample did not include persons living in large urban areas. Thus, our findings need to be confirmed in samples from other geographic regions. Differences in the geographic areas from which blacks and whites were drawn also limit the comparisons between races. Another limitation of our study is the use of block groups as proxies for neighborhoods. The neighborhood socioeconomic score was used as an indirect marker of a variety of specific attributes of neighborhoods that may affect the risk of cardiovascular disease. It is striking that we observed associations even with these crude proxies. Changes over time in the neighborhood of residence may have hampered our ability to estimate the effects of neighborhoods. However, the areas of residence of the members of our cohort were relatively stable. Only 18 percent of our subjects had moved six years after the base-line examination, and for those who had moved, correlations between the base-line and follow-up measures of the neighborhood score were relatively high. The finding that neighborhood characteristics are related to the incidence of coronary heart disease suggests that strategies for disease prevention may need to combine person-centered approaches with approaches aimed at changing residential environments. More generally, our findings point to the role of the broader social and economic forces that generate differences among neighborhoods in shaping the distribution of health outcomes. At a time of growing economic segregation of residential areas, 44,45 differences among places may become even more relevant to explanations of disparities in health.

It is not known whether the mesenchymal cells that participate in remodeling originate locally or from circulating precursor cells. Methods We obtained biopsy specimens of renal allografts from six male recipients of an allograft from a female donor, four female recipients of an allograft from a male donor, two male recipients of an allograft from a male donor, and two female recipients of an allograft from a female donor. All the allografts were undergoing chronic rejection. We used immunohistochemical methods to identify mesenchymal cells with smooth-muscle α-actin and in situ hybridization to identify mesenchymal cells with Y-chromosome DNA. Results No Y-chromosome bodies were identified in the case of the two renal-allograft specimens in which both the donor and the recipient were female. In the case of the two renal-allograft specimens in which both the donor and the recipient were male, approximately 40 percent of mesenchymal cells contained a Y-chromosome body. In the case of the six specimens in which the donor was female and the recipient was male, a mean (±SD) of 34±16 percent of mesenchymal cells in the neointima, 38±12 percent of such cells in the adventitia, and 30±7 percent of such cells in the interstitium contained the Y-chromosomal marker, indicating that they originated from the recipient rather than the donor. In the case of the four renal-allograft specimens in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, the respective values were 24±15 percent, 33±9 percent, and 23±8 percent, indicating a persistent population of donor mesenchymal cells. Conclusions The presence of mesenchymal cells of host origin in the vascular and interstitial compartments of renal allografts undergoing chronic rejection provides evidence that a circulating mesenchymal precursor cell has the potential to migrate to areas of inflammation. Introduction Tissue remodeling is central to the pathogenesis of many chronic illnesses. In the vascular narrowing of atherosclerosis, 1 the proliferation of smooth-muscle cells and the synthesis of matrix lead to the formation of a neointima. The same events in the adventitia 2 cause a constrictive fibrosis that prevents the vessel from dilating in response to the encroachment of the neointima into the vascular lumen. 1 Tissue remodeling is also important in chronic allograft rejection, which is the chief limitation to the long-term success of organ transplantation. The principal lesions in chronic rejection are vascular fibrointimal hyperplasia and interstitial fibrosis. 3 The mesenchymal cells that synthesize matrix in the vascular neointima are smooth-muscle cells, whereas in the interstitium they are myofibroblasts. 4-6 It is commonly accepted that in allograft rejection the mononuclear inflammatory cells derive from the recipient, 7 whereas the mesenchymal cells that participate in remodeling originate in the graft itself. However, it has been shown that collagen vascular grafts are rapidly infiltrated and remodeled by smooth-muscle cells into physiologically responsive neovessels, suggesting that circulating smooth-muscle cells (or their mesenchymal precursors) migrate to areas of tissue remodeling and take part in the process. 8 Moreover, studies in animal models 9-11 indicate that mesenchymal cells involved in chronic rejection may originate from the recipient. To investigate the origin of mesenchymal cells in tissue remodeling, we studied the infiltrating mesenchymal cells in sex-mismatched renal allografts that were undergoing chronic rejection. We used combined immunohistochemical techniques to identify mesenchymal cells with smooth-muscle α-actin and in situ hybridization to determine whether Y-chromosome DNA was present in biopsy specimens of renal allografts. Methods Patients and Biopsies Our group routinely performs renal-allograft biopsies 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after transplantation; the characteristics of 76 patients who were studied under this protocol have been described previously. 12,13 All patients received cyclosporine, azathioprine, and prednisone for immunosuppression after renal transplantation and were in clinically stable condition at the time of biopsy. The biopsy protocol was approved by the faculty committee on the use of human subjects in research at the University of Manitoba, and all patients gave written informed consent to participate. Changes in the tubules, interstitium, glomeruli, and vessels were assessed by a pathologist who was unaware of the clinical condition of the patients. The pathologist assigned semiquantitative scores for these changes using the standardized Banff classification. 14 The Banff criteria have accepted validity and reproducibility and are widely used in the histologic analysis of transplants. We scanned our data base of renal biopsies and selected samples from all sex-mismatched grafts with a Banff grade of CV2 (indicating the presence of chronic rejection with a moderately vascular neointima) or CV3 (indicating the presence of chronic rejection with severe vascular changes, including narrowing of the vascular lumen by more than 50 percent) and adequate tissue available for study. We identified such biopsy specimens from six male recipients who had received an allograft from a female donor and four female recipients who had received an allograft from a male donor. We then selected biopsy specimens from two female recipients of an allograft from a female donor as a negative control and biopsy specimens from two male recipients of an allograft from a male donor as a positive control. As an additional control, we studied nine sex-mismatched biopsy specimens with no evidence of rejection (from five male recipients of an allograft from a female donor and four female recipients of an allograft from a male donor). In no case did we study biopsy specimens that had been obtained from a single patient at more than one time. Combined Immunohistochemical Analysis and in Situ Hybridization We performed all immunohistochemical procedures using the Microprobe apparatus (Fisher Scientific) with semiautomated capillary staining to ensure that the results of staining were consistent and reproducible. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were cut into sections that were 4 μm thick, and the sections were placed on microscope slides (ProbeOn Plus, Fisher Scientific) and incubated. Immunohistochemical analysis with use of an antibody against smooth-muscle α-actin (M0851, Dako) as a marker for smooth-muscle cells 15 was performed essentially as described previously. 16 DNA in situ hybridization for the human Y chromosome was immediately performed with use of pHY2.1, a Y-chromosome repeat marker labeled with digoxigenin (1558196, Boehringer Mannheim). The pHY2.1 fragment hybridizes with a 2000-copy tandem repeat on the long arm of the Y chromosome. 17 The slides were dehydrated in ethanol, air dried, then incubated with hybridization solution containing 2× saline sodium citrate (1× saline sodium citrate is 0.15 M sodium chloride and 0.015 M sodium citrate), 50 percent formamide, 10 percent dextran sulfate, 1 mg of salmon-sperm DNA per milliliter, and 1 μg of digoxigenin-labeled probe per milliliter. Denaturation for 10 minutes at 72°C was followed by incubation overnight at 37°C. The following morning, unbound probe was washed off with 2× saline sodium citrate at 37°C. Subsequent detection steps were performed as described previously. 18 Nuclei were counterstained with methyl green, then the slides were cover-slipped with light mineral oil in order to preserve both solvent-soluble and water-soluble components. Statistical Analysis Each blue-stained nucleus was interpreted as indicating a mesenchymal cell (myofibroblast or smooth-muscle cell) if it was surrounded by red-stained smooth-muscle α-actin. Staining for the Y chromosome was considered to be positive if a clear dark blue–black signal in the nucleus could be detected. The analysis was performed by an observer who was unaware of the patients' histories. The presence or absence of smooth-muscle α-actin and the Y chromosome was recorded for each nucleus counted in the neointima, perivascular adventitia, and peritubular interstitium, for a total of up to 1000 cells. Differences between groups were analyzed with use of a two-tailed unpaired t-test. Results We studied 14 renal-biopsy specimens with the typical vascular and interstitial changes of chronic rejection. Two specimens each were from female recipients of an allograft from a female donor and from male recipients of an allograft from a male donor, four specimens were from female recipients of an allograft from a male donor, and six specimens from male recipients of an allograft from a female donor. The underlying reason or reasons for transplantation were diabetes mellitus in six patients, glomerulonephritis in six, polycystic kidney disease in four, hypertensive nephrosclerosis in three, chronic pyelonephritis in two, obstructive uropathy in one, and unknown disease in one. Table 1. Table 1. Percentage of Mesenchymal Cells That Were Positive for the Y-Chromosome Body. The results are summarized in Table 1 . In renal-allograft specimens from the four female patients with male donors, we found clear evidence of infiltration of the neointima, adventitia, and interstitium by mesenchymal cells of donor (male) origin. These allografts also demonstrated a population of male mesenchymal cells. Figure 1. Figure 1. Results of Combined Immunostaining for Smooth-Muscle α-Actin (Red Cytoplasm) and in Situ Hybridization for the Y-Chromosome Body (Black Nuclear Signal) (×325). In Panel A, a renal-allograft specimen in which both the donor and the recipient were male shows the Y-chromosome signal in tubular cells (black arrow) and interstitium (white arrows). Some cells did not show Y-chromosome staining because the Y-chromosome body was not included in the section. In Panel B, a renal-allograft specimen in which both the donor and the recipient were female shows no Y-chromosome signal. In Panel C, a renal-allograft specimen in which the donor was female and the recipient was male shows neointimal smooth-muscle cells (stained red), expressing a Y-chromosome signal of host origin (arrows). In Panel D, a renal-allograft specimen in which the donor was male and the recipient was female shows neointimal smooth-muscle cells (stained red), a few of which express a Y-chromosome signal (stained black, arrow). The Y-chromosome body was clearly distinguishable in approximately 40 percent of the tubular, interstitial, and neointimal mesenchymal cells in the grafts from male donors that had been transplanted into male recipients ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ). Although the analysis was performed in a blinded fashion, a kidney-biopsy specimen from a male donor was immediately obvious on cursory inspection of the tubular-cell nuclei. In renal-allograft specimens in which both the donor and the recipient were female, the Y-chromosome body was always absent ( Figure 1B and Table 1 ). In cases in which the donor was female and the recipient was male, the presence of Y-chromosome bodies in cells infiltrating the renal-allograft specimen was also obvious. In such cases, a mean (±SD) of 34±16 percent of the neointimal smooth-muscle cells in the renal-allograft specimens clearly expressed the Y-chromosomal signal ( Figure 1C and Table 1 ). In cases in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, a mean of 24±15 percent of neointimal smooth-muscle cells in the renal-allograft specimens were of male origin ( Figure 1D and Table 1 ). Figure 2. Figure 2. Results of Combined Immunostaining for Smooth-Muscle α-Actin and in Situ Hybridization for the Y-Chromosome Body in Tubulointerstitium (×400). In Panel A, a renal-allograft specimen in which the donor was female and the recipient was male shows many mesenchymal cells (stained red) expressing a Y-chromosome signal (black arrows) of host origin. In Panel B, a renal-allograft specimen in which the donor was male and the recipient was female shows a few interstitial mesenchymal cells (stained red) expressing a Y-chromosome signal (black arrow). In cases in which the donor was female and the recipient was male, a mean of 38±12 percent of perivascular interstitial smooth-muscle cells in the renal-allograft specimens were of male origin, whereas in cases in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, a mean of 33±9 percent were of male origin ( Table 1 ). In specimens from male recipients of allografts from female donors, the Y-chromosome body was present in a mean of 30±7 percent of the smooth-muscle cells in the renal interstitium ( Figure 2A and Table 1 ). In cases in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, a mean of 23±8 percent of mesenchymal cells in the interstitium of the renal-allograft specimens showed the Y-chromosomal signal ( Figure 2B ). In cases in which both the donor and the recipient were male or were female and in cases in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, the tubular cells in the renal-allograft specimens reflected the sex of the donor. In cases in which the donor was female and the recipient was male, a small number of male cells (4±2 percent) were seen within the confines of the tubular basement membrane in the renal-allograft specimens. These cells were not positive for smooth-muscle α-actin and resembled mononuclear inflammatory cells morphologically. This result probably represents invasion of the tubule by the recipient's immune cells (tubulitis). In biopsy specimens obtained from patients without chronic rejection, there was no vascular neointima to examine. In cases in which the donor was male and the recipient was female, 30 percent of smooth-muscle cells in the interstitium of the renal-allograft specimens demonstrated a Y-chromosome body. In cases in which the donor was female and the recipient was male, 10 percent of the smooth-muscle cells in the interstitium of the renal-allograft specimens demonstrated a Y-chromosome body; this value was significantly less than the value found in the corresponding group with chronic rejection (10 percent vs. 30 percent, P<0.001). Discussion We found that recipient-derived mesenchymal cells infiltrated the neointima, adventitia, and tubulointerstitial compartments of renal transplants undergoing chronic rejection. These results provide evidence that a circulating mesenchymal cell has the potential to colonize an allograft. This information may lead to the development of ways to prevent and treat chronic rejection. In chronic renal-allograft rejection, the vascular neointima consists of an infiltrate of lymphoid and mesenchymal (smooth-muscle) cells. As is the case in atherosclerosis in native organs, medial smooth-muscle cells are thought to migrate through breaks in the internal elastic lamina to the neointima. 19 In animal models of aortic and femoral-artery transplants, the neointimal smooth-muscle cells found during chronic rejection of these grafts are of host origin. 10,11 Our study shows that in humans with chronic rejection, smooth-muscle cells of host origin are also present in the vascular neointima of the renal allograft. Whether these cells derive from precursors that migrate directly into the neointima or initially colonize the adventitia or perivascular interstitium before they migrate through the media to the neointima is unknown. Another critical lesion in chronic rejection is interstitial fibrosis, the development and progression of which require smooth muscle thought to derive from local sources. 5,20 Our data show that mesenchymal cells of host origin infiltrate not only the neointima but also the perivascular and interstitial components of an allograft undergoing chronic rejection. Whether the mesenchymal cells of the donor are entirely replaced by those of the recipient over time, as has been shown in untreated animal allografts, 21 is unknown. We found that a large proportion of the mesenchymal cells in allografts undergoing chronic rejection were of donor origin. The persistence of donor mesenchymal cells may be due to immunosuppression with cyclosporine. 21 In our study, all but two of the biopsy specimens were obtained within six months after transplantation, at which time cyclosporine levels are relatively high. Alternatively, the persistence of donor cells in the vessels and interstitium may be related to the short interval between transplantation and the biopsy. Our findings suggest the existence of a circulating mesenchymal precursor cell. Indeed, Bucala et al. have provided evidence of the existence of a circulating fibroblastic stem cell. 22 In their study, subcutaneous wound-viewing chambers became colonized with a circulating population of CD34+ fibrocytes. Moreover, other investigators have shown that smooth-muscle cells can be generated by human stromal cell lines derived from bone marrow, 23 and human mesenchymal progenitor cells have been transferred by bone marrow transplantation. 24 Myofibroblasts that appear soon after the onset of an episode of asthma are thought to originate from a circulating pool 25 or to be the result of the activation or proliferation of a local precursor cell. 26 Our study raises the question whether controlling the migration of smooth-muscle cells may prevent or ameliorate chronic rejection. An interesting possibility in this regard is the inhibition of local signaling of hyaluronan to smooth-muscle cells. These signals control proliferation and motility mediated through CD44 and the receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility in smooth-muscle cells. 27,28 This receptor is widely expressed in renal allografts undergoing chronic rejection, and in these allografts, the sequestration of hyaluronan alters the fibrotic response that follows tissue injury. 29,30 These mesenchymal signaling molecules may represent targets for the blockade of smooth-muscle–dependent remodeling processes.

The patients are predisposed to bacterial and fungal infections. Prophylactic antibiotics and interferon gamma have reduced bacterial infections, but there is also the danger of life-threatening fungal infections. We assessed the efficacy of itraconazole as prophylaxis against serious fungal infections in chronic granulomatous disease. Methods Thirty-nine patients at least 5 years old (6 female and 33 male; mean age, 14.9 years) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. After the initially assigned treatment, each patient alternated between itraconazole and placebo annually. Patients 13 years of age or older and all patients weighing at least 50 kg received a single dose of 200 mg of itraconazole per day; those less than 13 years old or weighing less than 50 kg received a single dose of 100 mg per day. The primary end point was severe fungal infection, as determined by histologic results or culture. Results One patient (who had not been compliant with the treatment) had a serious fungal infection while receiving itraconazole, as compared with seven who had a serious fungal infection while receiving placebo (P=0.10). No patient receiving itraconazole but five patients receiving placebo had a superficial fungal infection. No serious toxic effects were noted, although one patient had a rash and another had elevated results on liver-function tests; both of these effects resolved with the discontinuation of itraconazole. Conclusions Itraconazole prophylaxis appears to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment that reduces the frequency of fungal infections in chronic granulomatous disease, but monitoring for long-term toxic effects is warranted. Introduction Chronic granulomatous disease of childhood is a rare group of inherited disorders of phagocytic cells characterized clinically by recurrent life-threatening infections and excessive granuloma formation. 1 Phagocyte migration and phagocytosis are normal, but killing of microorganisms is impaired because of defective production of hydrogen peroxide and related products of oxygen metabolism. A variety of biochemical defects lead to the disorder. The current mortality rate is 2 to 5 percent per year. 2 In the absence of prophylaxis with antibiotics or interferon gamma, patients with chronic granulomatous disease have severe infections due to catalase-positive bacteria and fungi about once a year. Prophylaxis with the combination antibiotic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole has reduced the incidence of serious bacterial infections to about one every four years. 3,4 Interferon gamma prophylaxis has reduced bacterial infections by an additional 70 percent. 5 Despite these reductions in the incidence of bacterial infections with antibiotics and interferon gamma, fungal infections remain a difficult problem, with an incidence of approximately 0.1 infection per patient per year. 2,6 We performed a study of the use of prophylactic oral itraconazole to reduce the incidence of fungal infections in chronic granulomatous disease. Methods Patients Patients with chronic granulomatous disease were followed at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center from 1991 through 2001. All patients or their parents gave written informed consent, and written assent was obtained from minors. The diagnosis of chronic granulomatous disease was based on an abnormal nitroblue tetrazolium reduction test on phagocytes from the patient, less than 10 percent of normal neutrophil and macrophage oxidative metabolism (abnormal superoxide or hydrogen peroxide production), or both. The patients were at least five years old and had not been taking itraconazole or other systemic antifungal agents for three months before entry into the study. The patients had no evidence of active infection at the time of enrollment. They had normal blood counts, normal or stable results on chest radiography, normal liver-function results and urinalysis, and no signs of infection on physical examination. Patients with confirmed fungal infection within the preceding 12 months were ineligible. The patients could elect to receive interferon gamma, but those just initiating interferon gamma were required to wait 30 days before they became eligible for randomization. No patients began to take interferon gamma during the study. Patients with long-term granulomatous complications of chronic granulomatous disease who were taking low-dose corticosteroids (up to 5 mg of prednisone every other day) at the time of enrollment continued to take them throughout the study; patients receiving higher doses of corticosteroids were excluded. Study Medication Itraconazole and placebo were provided by Janssen Pharmaceutica under investigational-new-drug application 36148; the company had no other involvement in the study. The elimination half-life of itraconazole in healthy adult volunteers is approximately 20 hours after a single dose and 30 hours after multiple doses. 7,8 For patients younger than 13 years and weighing less than 50 kg, a single daily dose of 100 mg was given with food or a carbonated beverage. For all other patients, a single daily dose of 200 mg was given. Before this study was initiated, the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of itraconazole in children with chronic granulomatous disease were assessed in five boys with chronic granulomatous disease who were between five and eight years of age and weighed 20 to 35 kg. Itraconazole was administered orally as a 100-mg capsule (3 to 5 mg per kilogram per dose) once per day for two weeks. Each daily dose was given with food to maximize absorption. 8-10 The mean plasma level of itraconazole plus its biologically active metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole, in the children was 0.373 μg per milliliter after 14 days. No toxic effects were noted. On the basis of these studies, a single daily dose of 100 mg was used for children less than 13 years of age and weighing less than 50 kg. Once the study was initiated, plasma drug levels were determined on samples obtained two to four hours after the dose at periodic study evaluations and frozen at –80°C in 1-ml aliquots until use. The levels of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured after completion of the study by commercial high-performance liquid chromatography (Mayo Medical Laboratories). The limit of detection with this assay was 0.3 μg per milliliter. For the purposes of plotting and computing means and standard deviations, values below the detectable level of 0.3 μg per milliliter were considered to be 0.15 μg per milliliter. Study Design This was a double-blind study with sequential monitoring, and only the pharmacy department held the code. The patients were randomly assigned at the time of enrollment to receive either itraconazole or placebo. The patients were switched to the other therapy at annual clinic visits. The randomization was stratified according to whether the patient also received interferon gamma; at the time of randomization, 34 patients were taking interferon gamma. All patients received antibacterial prophylaxis with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, or with trimethoprim alone or dicloxacillin alone if they could not tolerate sulfa drugs. 11 The patients were evaluated at entry and at week 1 and week 2. They were then monitored for any problems or any signs of hepatotoxicity. Thorough evaluations were conducted at the National Institutes of Health every three to six months, and all infections were recorded. Toxic effects and other adverse events were scored according to protocol-specified criteria. Monitoring of Efficacy A serious fungal infection was defined as an invasive infection of the lung, bone, blood, or soft tissue, with clear evidence of a fungal cause from histologic studies or culture. Symptomatic superficial dermatophyte infections involving only the skin or nails that were not serious enough to warrant systemic therapy with amphotericin B were identified clinically by inspection. These infections were not included in the primary analysis but were considered separately at the conclusion of the study to determine the difference in their incidence between the drug and placebo groups. When a serious fungal infection was diagnosed by histopathological or microbiologic techniques, the treatment was recorded as a failure. The patient's participation in the study then ended, and the patient received all appropriate therapy, including amphotericin B, surgery, or both, as clinically indicated. If the study physicians determined that in order to provide optimal care, it was necessary to know whether a patient with a confirmed fungal infection had received itraconazole or placebo, this information was provided by the data monitor, and the patient's participation in the study ended. Otherwise, neither the patient nor the study physician knew when a patient received active drug until the end of the study. Statistical Analysis A power calculation in the protocol specified that the study would require approximately 100 patient-years of follow-up. This was based on a historical rate of serious fungal infection in patients with chronic granulomatous disease of approximately 0.1 infection per patient per year, which would suggest approximately five treatment failures in the placebo group. At approximately one-year intervals, each patient whose treatment had not yet failed was switched to the other study treatment (multiple crossover study). The sequential stopping and analysis rule, mandated by the protocol and originally described by Frank et al., 12 stated that if the first five, or seven of the first eight, serious fungal infections were found in patients who received placebo, it would have been shown that significantly fewer serious fungal infections occurred in the itraconazole group, and the study would be terminated. Conversely, should two serious fungal infections be found in the itraconazole-treated patients, no conclusion concerning efficacy would be possible, and the study would be terminated. 12 For this sequential design, the calculated exact one-sided P value, if itraconazole were demonstrated to be superior, would be 0.051. In conformity with the Journal 's practice of reporting two-sided P values, this has been converted to a two-sided P value of 0.102. A critical assumption in the design and analytic approach was that the exposure of patients in the placebo and itraconazole groups to possible fungal infection was approximately equal. Two approaches were used to ensure that this criterion was met. First, Efron's biased-coin design was used to keep the randomization tightly balanced. 13 Using Efron's approach helped ensure that the number of patients whose first course of study treatment was itraconazole was very close to the number of patients whose first course was placebo, while making it difficult for either selection bias or accidental bias to affect the validity of the trial results adversely. Second, the difference between treatment groups in the rate of patient dropout was assessed throughout the study by the data-monitoring statistician. Results Characteristics of the Study Population Thirty-nine patients with chronic granulomatous disease were enrolled in the study. Accrual lasted from October 1991 to March 2000. There were 6 female patients (15 percent) and 33 male patients (85 percent). The mean (±SD) age at the time of enrollment was 14.9±10.4 years (range, 5.0 to 56.7), with a median of 11.5 years. The disease was autosomally inherited in 13 patients (33 percent) and X-linked in 26 patients (67 percent). Plasma Levels of Itraconazole Thirty blood samples obtained from 11 courses of treatment in patients receiving 100 mg of itraconazole per day and 65 samples obtained from 32 courses of treatment in patients receiving 200 mg per day were available for study. Of the 95 samples, 50 had no detectable levels of itraconazole (less than 0.3 μg per milliliter), and 39 had no detectable levels of the principal metabolite, hydroxyitraconazole (less than 0.3 μg per milliliter), a result consistent with the findings in previous studies of patients receiving these doses. 14 The plasma levels of itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were higher when the subjects were taking the drug than when they were taking placebo (the median total drug levels were 0.7 μg per milliliter [interquartile range, 0.3 to 1.3] for those taking 200 mg of itraconazole per day, 0.4 μg per milliliter [interquartile range, 0.3 to 0.8] for those taking 100 mg of itraconazole per day, and less than 0.3 μg per milliliter for those taking placebo). Fifty-six of 95 samples obtained while patients were taking the drug (59 percent) had detectable levels of itraconazole, hydroxyitraconazole, or both, as compared with only 2 (from one patient) of the 102 samples from patients taking placebo (2 percent); the 2 samples with low levels of itraconazole (0.6 μg and 0.5 μg per milliliter) from one patient taking placebo were probably due to either carryover drug from a prior cycle or lack of adherence to the treatment regimen. There was no significant difference in the plasma levels of itraconazole or hydroxyitraconazole between patients taking 200 mg of itraconazole per day and those taking 100 mg per day. Table 1. Table 1. Serious Fungal Infections. Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Events. Table 3. Table 3. Serious Bacterial Infections. The 39 patients enrolled in the study received 61 courses of itraconazole and 63 courses of placebo. Eight patients (seven receiving placebo and one receiving itraconazole) were withdrawn from the study because of serious fungal infections ( Table 1 ), and three were withdrawn because of adverse events ( Table 2 ). Other patients were withdrawn because of death from a bacterial infection ( Table 3 ), transition to another protocol, pregnancy, or noncompliance (8 receiving placebo and 10 receiving itraconazole). No patients were lost to follow-up or unaccounted for at the termination of the study. The study reached a prespecified termination point for a one-sided type I error of 0.05 when the eighth therapy failure due to serious fungal infection occurred; seven of the eight fungal infections occurred in patients receiving placebo. Thus, at the termination of the study there had been one serious fungal infection for 61 courses of itraconazole and seven serious fungal infections for 63 courses of placebo ( Table 1 ) (P=0.10). Seven patients had serious fungal infections in the lungs, and one patient had a serious fungal infection in the soft tissue ( Table 1 ). Of the seven patients in the placebo group who had a serious fungal infection, only one was over 18 years old. There was no significant difference in the number of fungal infections between patients receiving interferon gamma and those not receiving it (six infections in 34 patients receiving interferon gamma, and two infections in 5 patients not receiving interferon gamma). The itraconazole group also had fewer clinically diagnosed superficial fungal infections. No such infections were observed in 61 courses of itraconazole, as compared with five infections in 63 courses of placebo (P=0.06). To assess whether the results could have been substantially affected by any difference between the itraconazole and placebo groups in exposure to possible fungal infection, the total number of patient-days for itraconazole and placebo was calculated from actual drug-dispensing information from the pharmacy department of the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center. Patient exposure in the two courses was in close balance, with 20,000 days for patients receiving itraconazole and 21,253 days for those receiving placebo (an overall difference of 6 percent). Thus, whereas the power analysis at study design anticipated 100 patient-years, the total patient follow-up under both treatment regimens at completion of the study was approximately 113 patient-years. Adverse Events Few major toxic effects were attributed to itraconazole ( Table 2 ). A rash in one patient receiving itraconazole required discontinuation of the drug and removal of the patient from the study; the rash cleared when the drug was stopped. One patient receiving itraconazole had increased liver-function values (133 IU of alanine aminotransferase per liter, 155 IU of aspartate aminotransferase per liter, 247 IU of alkaline phosphatase per liter, and 690 IU of lactate dehydrogenase per liter), requiring discontinuation of the drug and removal from the study; the values returned to normal eight weeks after discontinuation of the drug. In one patient receiving itraconazole, the drug was discontinued because of headache, which resolved after discontinuation. There was no relation between high plasma drug levels and toxicity in the three patients with itraconazole-related adverse events. In addition, there was no apparent association between granulomata and fungal infection; in the three patients who had granulomatous complications requiring corticosteroids, one had an associated fungal infection and two did not. Itraconazole had no effect on serious bacterial infections. There were 10 serious bacterial infections in seven patients receiving itraconazole and 9 serious bacterial infections in eight patients receiving placebo (P=0.94) ( Table 3 ). One patient receiving placebo died from disseminated Chromobacterium violaceum infection. Discussion Although prophylactic trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole reduces the incidence of life-threatening bacterial infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease from about one per year to about one every four years, 3,4 and interferon gamma further reduces the incidence of such infections by about 70 percent, 5 fungal infections remain a major problem for these patients. 2 The well-tolerated oral antifungal agent itraconazole has been shown to be useful in treating superficial fungal infections 15 and in treating invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients with hematologic cancers, chronic granulomatous disease, and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 16-18 Prophylactic itraconazole also reduces the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in high-risk patients with neutropenia. 19 The findings in our double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled study suggest that itraconazole is highly effective in preventing both serious and superficial fungal infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease and that its long-term use is well tolerated, with minimal side effects. Indeed, the only serious fungal infection in patients taking itraconazole occurred in a patient who had probably stopped taking the medication, as judged by the return of unused medication and by careful review of his adherence to the treatment regimen. This case was included as a treatment failure in the intention-to-treat analysis, but if the patient had adhered to the regimen, it is possible that there would have been no serious fungal infections in patients taking itraconazole. Despite the inclusion of this patient in the final analysis, the study's one-sided stopping criterion to show that itraconazole significantly reduces fungal infections in chronic granulomatous disease was just met (P=0.051). The minor toxic effects of rash, increased liver-function values, and headache (each in one patient) were reversed on discontinuation of the drug. Congestive heart failure has occurred in patients taking itraconazole, 20 but it did not occur in any of the patients in this study. As expected, itraconazole prophylaxis had no benefit in reducing bacterial infections in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Although 50 of 95 plasma samples had no detectable levels of itraconazole and 39 had no detectable levels of hydroxyitraconazole, a clinical benefit was still demonstrated. A similar beneficial effect, despite low plasma levels, was observed in patients with neutropenia and acute leukemia who were treated with itraconazole to prevent invasive gingival aspergillosis. 14 The clinical efficacy of itraconazole, despite the absence of detectable plasma levels in many patients, is not surprising, since the high lipophilicity of itraconazole results in extensive tissue distribution, with levels many times higher in the tissues than in plasma. 8 The strong clinical efficacy, with no detectable plasma levels in nearly half the patients, suggests that monitoring of plasma drug levels is not routinely indicated. This prospective trial of antifungal prophylaxis in patients with a primary immunodeficiency shows that itraconazole therapy is effective and safe in children and adults and does not result in the development of clinically significant resistance when used for a prolonged period. When added to antibiotics and interferon gamma, itraconazole should markedly reduce the greatest remaining cause of mortality in chronic granulomatous disease. We suggest that itraconazole prophylaxis should be added to the treatment regimens for all patients over five years of age who have chronic granulomatous disease. However, since our study patients received itraconazole continuously for only one year, rigorous monitoring for itraconazole toxicity is warranted for patients receiving long-term, continuous therapy.

Methods From 1993 to 1998, 1201 eligible patients 15 to 65 years of age who had newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease in unfavorable stage IIB or IIIA or stage IIIB or IV were randomly assigned to receive eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone alternating with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (COPP-ABVD); bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP); or increased-dose BEACOPP, each followed by local radiotherapy when indicated. Enrollment in the COPP-ABVD group was stopped in 1996 owing to inferior results. Results For the final analysis, 1195 of 1201 patients could be evaluated: 260 in the COPP-ABVD group, 469 in the BEACOPP group, and 466 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group; the median follow-up was 72, 54, and 51 months, respectively. The rate of freedom from treatment failure at five years was 69 percent in the COPP-ABVD group, 76 percent in the BEACOPP group, and 87 percent in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (P=0.04 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the BEACOPP group and P<0.001 for the comparison of the increased-dose BEACOPP group with the COPP-ABVD group and with the BEACOPP group), and the five-year rates of overall survival were 83 percent, 88 percent, and 91 percent, respectively (P=0.16 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the BEACOPP group, P=0.06 for the comparison of the BEACOPP group with the increased-dose BEACOPP group, and P=0.002 for the comparison of the COPP-ABVD group with the increased-dose BEACOPP group). Rates of early progression were significantly lower with increased-dose BEACOPP than with COPP-ABVD or standard BEACOPP. Conclusions Increased-dose BEACOPP resulted in better tumor control and overall survival than did COPP-ABVD. Introduction The standard chemotherapy combinations for advanced Hodgkin's disease are mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD), 1-5 yet 30 to 40 percent of cases progress or relapse and respond poorly to salvage treatment. 6,7 In 1990 the German Hodgkin's Lymphoma Study Group planned a sequence of clinical trials on the basis of results of experiments in animals, retrospective analyses of clinical data, and mathematical models 8,9 suggesting that more rapid administration could improve the disease-free survival rate by 3 percent and that a moderate dose escalation could improve this rate by an additional 10 percent. 10,11 Our trial compared three regimens: COPP-ABVD (with cyclophosphamide instead of mechlorethamine); a combination of bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) in standard doses; and BEACOPP in increased doses. Pilot and dose-finding studies confirmed the feasibility of BEACOPP and of the escalation of the doses of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and doxorubicin to 192, 200, and 140 percent of the standard doses, respectively. 12,13 The phase 3 trial aimed to assess the efficacy and toxicity of standard and increased-dose BEACOPP. Interim analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of BEACOPP. 14,15 We present the results of the final data analysis as of August 2001. Methods Patients Eligible patients were 15 to 65 years old with newly diagnosed, untreated Hodgkin's disease in Ann Arbor clinical stage IIB or IIIA with a large mediastinal mass (more than one third of the maximal thoracic diameter) alone or in combination with extranodal lesions or massive splenic involvement (with diffuse infiltration or more than five focal lesions, as determined by computed tomography and sonography) or both; stage IIIA with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (more than 50 mm per hour in asymptomatic patients and more than 30 mm per hour in patients with B symptoms) or three or more involved nodal areas, or both; or Stage IIIB or IV. Patients had to have a Karnofsky index above 70 percent, to be negative for the human immunodeficiency virus, to be free of concurrent disease that might hinder treatment, and to give written informed consent. Patients were registered and treated in 219 hospitals and practices in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Czech Republic (listed in the Appendix). Review of biopsy specimens by a panel of lymphoma pathologists was an obligatory part of the protocol. Study Design Table 1. Table 1. Planned Regimens of Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Procarbazine, Prednisone, Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, and Dacarbazine (COPP-ABVD) and Bleomycin, Etoposide, Doxorubicin, Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Procarbazine, and Prednisone (BEACOPP). After clinical staging had been conducted according to previously reported methods, 14 patients were randomly assigned (in a centralized, open fashion by telephone and by computer) to one of three chemotherapy regimens: eight cycles of COPP alternating with ABVD; eight cycles of standard-dose BEACOPP; or eight cycles of increased-dose BEACOPP, with the administration of filgrastim from day 8 of each cycle until the leukocyte count returned to normal ( Table 1 ). Randomization was stratified (i.e., balance among the groups was maintained) according to the participating center, tumor stage (IIB or IIIA vs. IIIB or IV), and the presence or absence of a large mediastinal mass. For the increased-dose BEACOPP group, the dose could be reduced in subsequent cycles if predefined toxic effects — World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4 (life-threatening) leukopenia for more than four days; WHO grade 4 thrombocytopenia, infection, or mucositis; or an adverse effect that required a two-week delay in treatment — occurred in a given cycle. 13 After each such event, the doses of cyclophosphamide and etoposide were reduced by one level on a five-level scale ranging from standard to escalated doses; if toxic effects occurred in two successive cycles, standard doses were used for all subsequent cycles. The tumor stage was reevaluated after four and eight cycles by means of a clinical examination and imaging or biopsy methods appropriate to the site of initial involvement (computed tomography, sonography, bone scintigraphy, bone marrow biopsy, or liver biopsy). After the completion of chemotherapy, sites of initial bulky disease (those at least 5 cm in diameter) received 30 Gy of irradiation and any residual tumor received 40 Gy. Inactive sites that were apparently treatment-related artifacts were considered to be part of a complete remission and were not irradiated. The outcome of treatment was assessed three months after the completion of the protocol. Statistical Analysis The primary end point of the trial was freedom from treatment failure, with progression during treatment, lack of complete remission at the end of protocol treatment, relapse, and death from any cause counted as adverse events. The rate of overall survival and the outcome of treatment (complete remission or early progression) were secondary end points. The rates of freedom from treatment failure and overall survival were compared between groups with use of the Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test, whereas outcomes were compared with use of the chi-square test (all methods were prespecified). The trial was designed to test the hypotheses that BEACOPP (irrespective of the dose) results in a higher rate of freedom from treatment failure than COPP-ABVD and that increased-dose BEACOPP results in a higher rate of freedom from treatment failure than standard BEACOPP. For the study to have a statistical power of 80 percent to detect an absolute difference of 9 to 10 percent in either of these comparisons, we determined that 900 patients would have to be enrolled. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle, with the proviso that patients for whom an exclusion criterion was discovered after randomization, on the basis of a clinical examination or examination of biopsy material obtained before randomization, would be excluded as ineligible. The study design called for interim analyses after 2, 3, 4, and 5 years and a final analysis after 7 1/2 years. We used a truncated sequential probability ratio strategy as proposed by Whitehead (nominal alpha of 0.1, with 80 percent power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.7 for both BEACOPP groups together as compared with the COPP-ABVD group) to determine whether the trial should be stopped early. 16 All tests were two-sided, and P values were not adjusted for sequential analysis. Results Recruitment began in February 1993 and ended in March 1998. Random assignment to the increased-dose BEACOPP group began after the completion of the dose-finding study in 1994; subsequently, unequal randomization probabilities were used to equalize the numbers in each group. At the first interim analysis in September 1996, the early stopping boundary was crossed, with the demonstration that both BEACOPP groups together were significantly superior to COPP-ABVD in terms of the rate of freedom from treatment failure (P=0.03, adjusted for Whitehead sequential analysis). 14 Therefore, assignment to the COPP-ABVD group was stopped. Assignments to the other two groups were increased so that each group would include 500 patients, thus permitting a more precise comparison of the groups. We then used a group sequential design according to the method of Peto to determine whether early-stopping criteria were met in the BEACOPP groups. Figure 1. Figure 1. Treatment Assignments and Numbers of Patients Included in the Analysis. After randomization, 81 patients were found to be ineligible and were excluded, because the pathological-review panel decided that the patient did not have Hodgkin's disease, the patient met clinical exclusion criteria that were known but not considered at the time of randomization, or the patient had not given consent. Patients were included in the analysis according to the intention-to-treat principle. Six patients were excluded because they had insufficient follow-up information to determine the treatment outcome. Patients were deemed to have received the full course of allocated chemotherapy if the dose received was at least 85 percent of the intended, unreduced dose, averaged over all drugs, and to have received a partial course if they had received 15 to 85 percent of the intended, unreduced dose. COPP-ABVD denotes cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, and BEACOPP bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone. Table 2. Table 2. Characteristics of the Patients. The final analysis was completed in August 2001. Of the 1282 patients we enrolled, 81 were subsequently found to be ineligible, because of the wrong diagnosis in 46, concurrent disease in 8, incorrect staging in 10, other clinical exclusion criteria in 16, and lack of informed consent from 1 ( Figure 1 ). All but 6 of the 1201 eligible patients had sufficient data to determine the outcome of treatment. There were 260 patients in the COPP-ABVD group (assignment to this group was stopped early), 469 in the standard BEACOPP group, and 466 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group. The characteristics of the patients were balanced among the three groups ( Table 2 ). Table 3. Table 3. Acute Adverse Effects of Chemotherapy. The incidence of acute hematologic effects was similar in the COPP-ABVD and standard BEACOPP groups but was greatly increased in the increased-dose BEACOPP group ( Table 3 ). In this group, grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was common in all eight cycles, whereas the frequency of thrombocytopenia and anemia increased during the last four cycles. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 16 percent of patients in the standard BEACOPP group and 22 percent of those in the increased-dose BEACOPP group. The incidence of fatal acute treatment-related effects was similar (less than 2 percent) among the groups. A detailed report of the acute hematologic effects and administered doses has been published previously. 18 Between 73 percent and 99 percent of patients received at least 80 percent of the planned total dose. In the increased-dose BEACOPP group, the doses of cyclophosphamide gradually decreased, from 192 percent of the planned standard dose in the first cycle to 148 percent of this dose in the eighth cycle; similar trends were observed for etoposide (from 198 percent initially to 152 percent) and doxorubicin (from 139 percent initially to 126 percent). The median duration of chemotherapy from the first to the last day of drug administration was 46.3 weeks in the COPP-ABVD group (planned, 30 weeks), 24.4 weeks in the BEACOPP group (planned, 23 weeks), and 24.7 weeks in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (planned, 23 weeks). The percentage of patients who received radiotherapy was 64 percent in the COPP-ABVD group and 71 percent in the other two groups. Table 4. Table 4. Outcome of Treatment and Five-Year Survival Rates. Figure 2. Figure 2. Kaplan–Meier Analysis of the Probability of Freedom from Treatment Failure (Panel A) and Overall Survival (Panel B). P values were calculated with use of the log-rank test for all three pairwise differences between groups. Numbers in parentheses are the numbers of patients. COPP-ABVD denotes cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine, and BEACOPP bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone. Tick marks indicate censored survival data. Progression occurred in 27 of 260 patients in the COPP-ABVD group (10 percent) during or up to three months after treatment, 36 of 469 in the BEACOPP group (8 percent), and 9 of 466 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (2 percent); the difference between the two BEACOPP groups was significant (P<0.001), as was that between increased-dose BEACOPP and COPP-ABVD (P<0.001). The rate of complete remission was higher in the the two BEACOPP groups than in the COPP-ABVD group ( Table 4 ). The median follow-up was 72 months in the COPP-ABVD group, 54 months in the standard BEACOPP group, and 51 months in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (follow-up was longer in the COPP-ABVD group because enrollment was stopped early). The rate of freedom from treatment failure was significantly higher at five years in the standard BEACOPP group than in the COPP-ABVD group (76 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 80 percent] vs. 69 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 63 to 75 percent], P=0.04) and was highest in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (87 percent [95 percent confidence interval, 83 to 91 percent], P<0.001 for the comparison with the COPP-ABVD group and with the standard BEACOPP group) ( Figure 2A and Table 4 ). The deaths of 150 patients have been reported to us: 49 in the COPP/ABVD group, 61 in the standard BEACOPP group, and 40 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group. The overall survival rate ( Figure 2B and Table 4 ) was higher in the standard BEACOPP group than in the COPP-ABVD group at five years (88 percent vs. 83 percent, P=0.16) and was highest in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (91 percent, P=0.06 for the comparison with the standard BEACOPP group and P=0.002 for the comparison with the COPP-ABVD group). The causes of death were recorded as Hodgkin's disease in 68 patients, complications of first-line treatment in 20, complications of salvage treatment in 14, a second neoplasm in 22, cardiorespiratory disease in 5, pulmonary disease in 4, other causes in 9, and unknown causes in 8. Fatal acute treatment-related adverse effects included sepsis in 11 patients (including 2 with the acute respiratory distress syndrome), pneumonia in 5, and thrombosis in 1; no details were available in the case of 3 patients. Table 5. Table 5. Rates of Early Progression and Five-Year Kaplan–Meier Estimates of the Rates of Freedom from Treatment Failure, According to the International Prognostic Index. To assess the efficacy of the three treatments according to the prognosis, the patients were divided into three subgroups on the basis of the international prognostic index. 17 Owing to missing data, the score was unavailable for 56 patients in the COPP-ABVD group, 100 in the BEACOPP group, and 99 in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (21 percent of all patients). The rates of early progression, five-year freedom from treatment failure, and overall survival at five years for the three subgroups are shown in Table 5 . Within each of the three groups, the score for the international prognostic index consistently correlated with the rates of early progression and five-year freedom from treatment failure. Within each prognostic subgroup, standard and increased-dose BEACOPP resulted in lower rates of early progression and higher rates of freedom from treatment failure and overall survival than did COPP-ABVD. There was no indication of a statistical interaction between the treatment group and the prognostic group (P=0.91 for the interaction term in a Cox regression model). Furthermore, all age groups seemed to benefit from standard and increased-dose BEACOPP, with the possible exception of those who were 60 to 65 years of age (data not shown). In this group of 64 patients, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups (P=0.93). Cases of secondary acute leukemia including the myelodysplastic syndrome occurred in one patient in the COPP-ABVD group, four in the standard BEACOPP group, and nine in the increased-dose BEACOPP group. The actuarial rate of secondary acute leukemias five years after the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (according to a Kaplan–Meier analysis) was 0.4 percent in the COPP-ABVD group, 0.6 percent in the BEACOPP group, and 2.5 percent in the increased-dose BEACOPP group (P=0.03). Solid tumors were recorded in three, eight, and two patients, respectively, and second non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in seven, four, and five patients, respectively. Discussion Our results indicate that in patients with newly diagnosed advanced Hodgkin's lymphoma, increased-dose BEACOPP is superior to COPP-ABVD with respect to failure-free survival (18 percentage points better at five years) and overall survival (8 percentage points better). The rate of early progression was 10 percent in the COPP-ABVD group and 2 percent in the increased-dose BEACOPP group. The difference in efficacy between increased-dose and standard BEACOPP appears to be larger than the difference between standard BEACOPP and COPP-ABVD. In terms of overall survival, by contrast, the results of pairwise group comparisons were not significantly different. However, projections based on observed rates of progression, relapse, toxic effects, and second cancers suggest that increased-dose BEACOPP confers a small, long-term survival benefit. 19 The incidence of acute toxicity increased with increased-dose BEACOPP; grade 4 leukopenia occurred in one or more cycles in 90 percent of patients. However, these events were manageable, as indicated by the numbers of deaths, the duration of chemotherapy, and the drug doses administered. 18 The multicenter setting of the trial, which included local hospitals and private practices, indicates that a regimen of increased-dose BEACOPP is generally feasible. All prognostic groups seemed to benefit from BEACOPP and from dose escalation. Since the recruitment periods for the three treatment groups were not identical, a shift in the characteristics of the patients during the trial could have resulted in bias. We compared these characteristics among the three groups in each recruitment year but found no relevant differences or consistent trends over time. We repeated all group comparisons for the period from February 1994 through October 1996, during which patients were recruited for all three groups, and obtained results similar to those reported above. Other randomized trials have demonstrated that the efficacy of MOPP-ABVD; hybrid MOPP plus doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPP-ABV); and ABVD is similar, with long-term (5 to 10 years) progression-free survival rates of 61 to 71 percent. 1,2 Numerous variants of these regimens have been tested, 3-5 but none have improved treatment efficacy. In contrast, the estimated rate of freedom from treatment failure with increased-dose BEACOPP is currently estimated as 89 percent at three years and 87 percent at five years. Three reports of interim results, however, compare favorably with our results for increased-dose BEACOPP. A five-year progression-free survival rate of 89 percent was achieved with the Stanford V regimen (mechlorethamine, doxorubicin, etoposide, vincristine, vinblastine, bleomycin, and prednisone), 20 an event-free survival rate of 82 percent was obtained at five years by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer with the MOPP-ABV regimen, 21 and a progression-free survival rate of 82 percent at five years was reported with a hybrid regimen consisting of six courses of chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, prednisone, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin followed by local irradiation. 22 That the proportion of our patients who received radiotherapy was greater in the two BEACOPP groups (71 percent) than in the COPP-ABVD group (64 percent) can largely be attributed to the greater incidence of initial bulky disease in these groups (68 percent in the BEACOPP group and 67 percent in the increased-dose BEACOPP group, as compared with 58 percent in the COPP-ABVD group), which itself was presumably due to chance. Furthermore, the shorter planned duration of BEACOPP therapy (24 weeks, as compared with 32 weeks for COPP-ABVD) allows less time for residual tumor to shrink. The occurrence of nine cases of acute leukemia after increased-dose BEACOPP seems alarming, especially as compared with the low leukemogenicity of the ABVD regimen. 23,24 However, this complication must be weighed against the lower rate of early progression and higher rates of failure-free survival and overall survival rates at five years, 25 and with the fact that secondary leukemias are likely to be induced in later years as a result of treatment for early progression or relapse. 26,27 Further study is needed before a reliable assessment of the long-term risks of standard and increased-dose BEACOPP can be made. Reliable data on the long-term gonadal toxicity of BEACOPP are not available, but it should be assumed that, as is the case with COPP-ABVD and similar regimens, a high proportion of patients, male and female, will become infertile. 28 This disadvantage is shared by MOPP-containing regimens but not by those that include ABVD, since such regimens largely preserve male fertility. 29 The importance of this aspect must be weighed against the avoidance of progression and relapse of advanced disease in each patient. Infertility after therapy may be compensated for by the use of cryopreservation techniques before therapy. 30 Increased-dose BEACOPP therapy is more expensive than COPP-ABVD, given the direct medical costs of inpatient stays, chemotherapy drugs, and filgrastim. Nevertheless, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio with respect to the gain in overall survival appears to be favorable. 31 In conclusion, our results suggest that both BEACOPP and the principle of a moderate filgrastim-supported escalation in the dose are promising treatment strategies for advanced Hodgkin's disease. Increased-dose BEACOPP is an attractive treatment option for adults up to about 60 years of age. The need for consolidation radiotherapy, which was administered to 71 percent of patients after BEACOPP, remains unproved 32 and is being investigated. 33 Funding and Disclosures Supported by a grant from the Deutsche Krebshilfe and by the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research.

In Israel, TBRF is caused by Borrelia persica and is transmitted by Ornithodoros tholozani ticks. We examined the safety and efficacy of postexposure treatment to prevent TBRF. Methods In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 93 healthy subjects with suspected tick exposure (52 with signs of tick bites and 41 close contacts — those without signs but with a similar risk of contact with ticks) were randomly assigned to receive either doxycycline (Dexxon, in a dose of 200 mg the first day and then 100 mg per day for four days) or placebo after presumed exposure to TBRF. Cases of TBRF were defined by fever and a positive blood smear. Serologic analysis for cross-reactivity to Borrelia burgdorferi and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the borrelia glpQ gene were also performed. Results After randomization, 47 subjects (26 with signs of tick bites and 21 close contacts) received doxycycline. Forty-six other subjects (26 with signs of tick bites and 20 close contacts) received placebo. All 10 cases of TBRF identified by a positive blood smear were in the placebo group of subjects with signs of a tick bite (P<0.001). These findings suggested a 100 percent efficacy of preemptive treatment (95 percent confidence interval, 46 to 100 percent). PCR for the borrelia glpQ gene was negative at baseline for all subjects and subsequently positive in all subjects with fever and a positive blood smear. Seroconversion was detected in eight of nine cases of TBRF. PCR and serum samples were negative for all of the other subjects tested. No major treatment-associated adverse effects were identified. Conclusions Treatment with doxycycline is safe and efficacious in preventing TBRF after suspected exposure to ticks in a high-risk environment. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00237016 .) Introduction Tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF), an acute febrile illness characterized by a pattern of remissions and relapses, is transmitted by several types of soft ticks. 1 TBRF in Israel is caused by Borrelia persica associated with Ornithodoros tholozani ticks. 2-4 Humans are infected during the blood meal of an infected tick. In contrast to bites from hard ticks, bites from soft ticks are usually unnoticed by humans during the tick's blood meal. The estimated rate of transmission of infection from a tick bite is 50 percent, with an incubation period of 2 to 18 days. 1,5,6 Borrelia are typically found in the person's bloodstream during his or her febrile periods. 5,7 People with infection typically present with high temperatures, dizziness, headaches, and muscle and joint pain. 4-6 In the absence of treatment, fever can recur up to 15 times. Myocarditis accompanied by arrhythmia, cerebral bleeding, and liver dysfunction are rare fatal complications. 3,8 Direct visualization of borrelia spirochetes in a blood smear is the gold standard for the diagnosis of TBRF. 1 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serologic analysis have occasionally been used as additional diagnostic tools. 9-11 Borrelia are sensitive to a wide range of antibiotics 5,6,12 ; however, therapy with antimicrobial agents can trigger a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction with sudden fever, rigors, and hemodynamic instability. 5,6,13-15 Antimicrobial prophylaxis for persons with tick bites or persons who have stayed in areas (such as caves) where there is risk of infection may prevent TBRF. Short courses of treatment with doxycycline have been shown to be effective in postexposure prevention of other spirochetal infections such as Lyme disease. 16,17 Observations from uncontrolled studies suggest that prophylactic treatment after exposure to ticks may be effective for TBRF, 18 but to our knowledge a controlled study has not been published. 19 In this study, we examined the efficacy of a short course of doxycycline in preventing TBRF after high-risk activities in an area where TBRF is endemic. PCR and serologic analysis were used for the diagnosis in addition to evaluation of blood smears. Methods Subjects As part of special military training, subjects underwent a five-day camouflage and survival exercise in an area where TBRF is endemic. During the exercise, subjects remained hidden in small niches and caves, in close proximity to the ground during the day. Subjects conducted the exercise in pairs. After all subjects completed the exercise, a physician examined them meticulously for signs of tick bites. A typical sign of a tick bite is a central erythematous area surrounded by a bluish–purple area. Subjects with signs of tick bites and their close contacts (the other subjects who were paired with them) were eligible for recruitment for the study. Subjects with fever, those with known sensitivity to doxycycline, and those with suspected TBRF in the three weeks before randomization were not recruited. Written informed consent was obtained, and subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or doxycycline. All subjects with a tick bite were treated. Subjects who declined to participate in the study were treated with doxycycline according to current Israel Defense Force (IDF) policy. Treatment Protocol Subjects received either placebo pills or 200 mg of doxycycline immediately after randomization and 100 mg per day for the subsequent four consecutive days in a double-blind fashion. The rationale for a five-day treatment was based on the common treatment practice in the IDF and a previous report on postexposure treatment. 18 The randomization was stratified for subjects with signs of tick bites and for their contacts (for a detailed randomization protocol, see the Supplementary Appendix , available with the full text of this article at www.nejm.org). Subjects were given the pills under direct observation. Subjects with suspected illness stopped the blinded medication and were treated by their attending physician. The research protocol was approved by the IDF ethics committee. Clinical Evaluation Before undergoing randomization, subjects completed a questionnaire that included personal data and information about prior episodes of TBRF as well as details regarding previous and current potential exposures and preventive measures adopted. During the first week after randomization, an appointed supervisor monitored subjects daily for fever. He or she also completed written questionnaires concerning subjects' symptoms and possible adverse effects including nausea, vomiting, heartburn, dysphagia, photophobia, headache, diarrhea, and rash. A member of the study personnel also examined and interviewed subjects one week and three weeks after randomization. A written questionnaire concerning compliance with treatment, adverse effects, and symptoms of TBRF was completed during an interview by the study physician. Subjects were not in a setting where they could be exposed to TBRF again during the three-week intensive follow-up period. Passive surveillance of subjects continued for the duration of their remaining military service (details regarding the passive surveillance are available in the Supplementary Appendix ). During randomization, blood samples were collected for blood smear, PCR, and serologic analysis. An additional blood sample was obtained from the study subjects 15 to 21 days later. Subjects were instructed to contact the study personnel immediately if symptoms of TBRF (such as high fever, headache, and malaise) occurred. Subjects with suspected illness consistent with TBRF were interviewed and examined, and blood was drawn for diagnosis (blood smear), PCR, and serologic analysis. Subjects with fever were treated with doxycycline by their attending physician and monitored for the occurrence of a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction (sudden fever, rigors, and hemodynamic instability). Serum samples from these patients were obtained two weeks later. A case of TBRF was defined by fever and a positive blood smear. The interval from the suspected tick encounter to onset of fever was defined as the incubation period. Blood Smears Thick and thin blood smears were prepared from tubes containing EDTA and from fresh blood. Blood smears were stained with rapid Giemsa's stain. A laboratory technician examined all blood smears according to a previously described method. 20,21 Detection of B. persica by blood smear is highly specific, because to our knowledge there is no evidence of other tick-borne spirochete diseases in Israel. PCR A new PCR assay for the glpQ gene was developed and established in our laboratory for the detection of TBRF. 22 The glpQ gene, encoding the enzyme glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, is conserved among spirochetes that cause relapsing fever. These spirochetes include B. persica, B. hermsii, B. recurrentis, and B. crocidurae , but the glpQ gene is absent from B. burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. 22,23 Detailed information about the PCR protocol is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Serologic Analysis A commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit for detection of human IgM antibodies against B. burgdorferi (Euroimmun) was used. The antigen in the kit consisted of a mixture of antigen extracts of B. burgdorferi and B. afzelii . It is thought that an appreciable cross-reacting antigen homology exists between B. burgdorferi and B. persica . The tests were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Detailed information about the method of serologic analysis is provided in the Supplementary Appendix . Ticks An effort was made to trace suspected locations of exposure by a detailed interview of infected subjects. Ticks were collected from the indicated locations with the use of dig-in plastic traps containing dry ice. These ticks were identified by entomologists from the Israeli Ministry of Health. Statistical Analysis The sample size was determined according to the primary end point: efficacy of doxycycline as preventive treatment for TBRF. Assuming an α (two tailed) value of 0.05, a statistical power of 90 percent, a ratio of doxycycline treatment to placebo of 1:1, a proportion of disease in the treated group of 1 percent, and a proportion of disease in the placebo group of 15 percent, we determined that 140 subjects would need to be enrolled: 70 in the treatment group and 70 in the placebo group. An interim analysis by an external inspector was planned after 10 subjects received a diagnosis of TBRF. According to a prespecified stopping rule, the external inspector was to examine the distribution of TBRF cases between the study groups and order the trial to be stopped if there was a treatment advantage of more than eight to two. The results were conclusive in favor of treatment, so the study was stopped after 93 subjects underwent randomization. The t-test was used to compare continuous variables between the treatment and placebo groups. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to examine the statistical significance of differences between the treatment and placebo groups. These differences included categorical variables such as the presence of TBRF and occurrence of adverse events after treatment. All tests used were two-tailed, and a P value of <0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Results Figure 1. Figure 1. Study Population. During the study period (April 2002 to April 2003), 582 subjects in 17 cohorts were screened after returning from field exercises ( Figure 1 ). Among them, 81 subjects (14 percent) had typical signs of tick bites and 44 subjects (8 percent) were close contacts of subjects who had tick bites. A total of 125 subjects (21 percent) were eligible to receive postexposure prophylaxis. In all, 93 subjects (16 percent) volunteered to be included in the study; this number included 52 of 81 (64 percent) with signs of tick bites and 41 of 44 (93 percent) close contacts. Table 1. Table 1. Characteristics of the Two Groups. The characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . There were no significant differences between the doxycycline and placebo groups in sex, age, prior exposure, prior antibiotic treatment, prior reported illness with TBRF, personal preventive behavior, or number of visible signs of tick bites. In view of the lower recruitment rate among subjects with tick bites, we compared the characteristics of the subjects who participated in the study with those of the subjects who declined; these characteristics included the number of visible signs of tick bite. No statistically significant differences between these groups were observed. We evaluated the number of signs of tick bites in 47 of the 52 subjects with signs of bites, 22 of 26 subjects in the placebo group, and 8 of 10 subjects with TBRF diagnosed by a positive blood smear. The discrimination of individual tick bites among subjects with many signs of bites was of limited accuracy, so comparisons were made between subjects with TBRF and healthy subjects. These comparisons categorized the number of bites in two groups: one to three bite signs and four or more bite signs. We did not find an association between the number of signs of tick bites and disease for all subjects (P=0.69) or for the subjects in the placebo group (P=1.00 by Fisher's exact test). Of the 81 subjects with signs of tick bites, only 46 (57 percent) saw ticks during the exposure period and 53 (65 percent) noticed the signs of bites after finishing the field exercise. There was no appreciable difference in personal preventive behavior between subjects with tick bites and their close contacts. Subjects who remembered a tick bite were recruited a mean (±SD) of 1.93±1.08 days after being bitten. None of the subjects were ill or had fever at recruitment into the study. Subjects received a mean of 4.9±0.4 days of the 5-day treatment. Only 1 subject (1.1 percent) received three doses, and 10 (10.4 percent) received four doses. None of the subjects reported stopping medication because of adverse effects. There was no significant difference in compliance between groups. No other antimicrobial agents were used by the subjects during the three-week follow-up period. Table 2. Table 2. Adverse Effects in the Study Groups during the First Week of Treatment. There were no significant differences between the treatment and placebo groups in the rate of adverse effects on any of the three occasions when data were collected. Data on adverse effects recorded during the first week are shown in Table 2 . None of the adverse effects were considered serious by the treating physician. Adverse effects such as fever, diaphoresis, and hemodynamic changes consistent with the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction were not observed in subjects who received prophylactic treatment. Table 3. Table 3. Characteristics of Subjects with TBRF. Ten subjects who had high fever and a positive blood smear for borrelia were categorized as having TBRF. All 10 were in the placebo group (10 of 46 cases), and none were in the doxycycline group (0 of 47). This difference was significant (P<0.001) and yielded a 100 percent efficacy rate of doxycycline prophylaxis (95 percent confidence interval, 46 to 100 percent). The characteristics of the 10 subjects with TBRF are shown in Table 3 . Two more subjects with tick bites in the placebo group had a disease consistent with TBRF, but they were treated before blood samples could be obtained and thus were not confirmed as having TBRF. These two illnesses were not included in the statistical analysis. The incubation period ranged from 5 to 10 days. All subjects with TBRF reported headache and malaise, and all had signs of tick bites. Subjects received doxycycline treatment under medical supervision and two subjects required hospitalization. After treatment, eight subjects had high fever, diaphoresis, and rigors typical of the Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction. After randomization, blood smears were performed from the blood samples of three subjects in whom TBRF subsequently developed and from the sample of a subject in whom a disease that was consistent with TBRF but not laboratory-proven by blood smear developed. All four blood smears were negative. Blood smears were performed from the blood samples of only three subjects after randomization because our acquisition of blood samples for this purpose was incomplete. All subjects with TBRF confirmed by positive blood smear had a positive PCR for glpQ . No other subjects from the placebo group or the treatment group had a positive PCR result. The serum samples of eight of nine of the subjects with positive smears (89 percent) showed seroconversion. Findings were negative in all serum samples of subjects in the placebo group with signs of tick bites in whom fever did not develop (15 subjects) and in subjects with bite signs who received doxycycline (17 subjects). The baseline reactivity of the serologic test used was determined by the results of 10 serum samples from subjects who had no known previous exposure to borrelia and were paired with subjects who had signs of tick bites. Data on their remaining military service (for long-term surveillance) were available for 91 of 93 subjects. A total of 87 of 91 subjects (96 percent) were under surveillance for more than half a year, whereas 4 of 91 subjects (4 percent) were under surveillance for zero to three months. Long-term surveillance did not reveal latent cases of TBRF. The estimated rate of TBRF infection among subjects with tick bites in our group was 39 percent (10 of 26 subjects with signs of tick bites in the control group). This finding, which is consistent with a previous report of a 50 percent infection rate from infected ticks, 6 suggests that ticks in the studied zone were highly infected with borrelia. A few dozen to hundreds of ticks were collected in each of four of six field sites in which infection was recognized. All ticks were identified as O. tholozani . Discussion This study demonstrates that postexposure prophylaxis with a five-day course of the antimicrobial agent doxycycline is both safe and efficacious in preventing TBRF in a population at high risk of exposure to B. persica . These data support previous observations 18 but were obtained from a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Since the rate of compliance with the five-day treatment was high, the efficacy of shorter treatment after exposure to ticks could not be assessed. Adverse effects of prophylactic treatment were minor and did not differ significantly between the placebo and doxycyline groups. An important observation is that doxycycline prophylaxis did not cause a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction in any of the subjects treated preemptively. In contrast, such a reaction was noted in 80 percent of the subjects treated after the onset of TBRF. We suspect that the prophylactic treatment given to the study subjects early after the presumed infection, before an appreciable bacterial load had accumulated, was the reason for the absence of a Jarisch–Herxheimer reaction after the preemptive treatment. We did not find an association between the number of tick bites and illness. This may be the result of the small number of subjects in this analysis. Another explanation is that the main determinant of infectivity was the number of infectious locations the subject was exposed to (this assumes that most ticks in a specific location are infected because of vertical transmission to offspring ticks 2 and have a high rate of infectivity). In contrast to transmission of other spirochete pathogens such as B. burgdorferi, transmission of TBRF requires only a brief tick attachment. Many subjects probably failed to notice the tick bite. Neither PCR nor serologic analysis yielded additional cases among the “healthy” subjects in the treatment and placebo groups, so these tests may not be more sensitive than the blood smear for detection of infection with B. persica . Another explanation is that the pathogenicity of TBRF is high and there were no subjects with subclinical infection in the placebo group or among the subjects receiving the doxycycline prophylactic treatment. In an environment with less frequent exposure to B. persica, a larger group of people (all with suspected exposure) may need to be treated. This treatment, for a limited benefit, would increase the risk of medication-associated adverse events. By meticulously examining people for signs of tick bites, this treatment group can be limited to those with the greatest likelihood of infection. Examination and treatment should be performed within a small window of opportunity, because the estimated incubation period among the subjects with TBRF in our study was 5 to 10 days (mean, 7.7±1.9); our findings were similar to those in previous reports. 8 Self-examination by subjects would reduce and better target the group to be treated. However, in this study only 65 percent of subjects with tick bites noted them before examination. Another approach is to use sensitive laboratory tests such as PCR to try to identify infection during the incubation period. However, none of the blood samples obtained from subjects after exposure but before the onset of disease yielded positive results by either PCR or blood smear. A theoretical risk of antibiotic prophylaxis might be a late relapse of TBRF or the alteration of the disease presentation. Relapses that occurred after treatment have been reported after a single dose 24 or 10 days of treatment with doxycycline. 25 In our study, no cases of late relapse were identified.

In addition, the reactivity to each of the recombinant proteins in the immunoblot was examined in order to evaluate their diagnostic value. Generally, the immunoblot (93.2%) and the ELISA (90.5%) were significantly more sensitive than the IFA (64.9%; df = 1; p ≤ 0.001). Correlation between results of the ELISA, IFA, and immunoblot for IgM or IgG, when two tests were always compared, one to the other, ranged from r s = 0.673 to r s = 0.905. In the immunoblot, the highest sensitivity was observed in DbpA and VlsE proteins (76.9% and 84.6%, respectively) in IgG testing of the sera from the patient group of Lyme arthritis. VlsE proteins, together with OspC proteins, were also shown to be useful for IgM antibody detection in erythema migrans patients (up to 44.4% and 53.7% sensitivity, respectively). Our results indicate that both the ELISA and the recombinant immunoblot test were more satisfactory for seroconfirmation of Lyme disease than IFA. Moreover, the reseach confirmed diagnostic value of the in-vivo expressed proteins (VlsE and DbpA), which might have the potential to play an important role in improving whole-cell antigen-based testing.",1458,0,0,1,0,en,en,

As part of a 5-year project from 1997 to 2002, 21–24 of the 4-Posters were distributed at residential sites in Old Lyme, CT, in a core treatment area of ≈5.2 km 2 in fall 1997. The 4-Posters were active October to mid-December and March into May, corresponding to the peak periods of activity for adult Ixodes scapularis in this particular area. Corn consumption ranged from 361 to 4789 kg/month for October and November and 696–3130 kg/month during April. Usage of 4-Posters by deer generally was high (>90%), except during acorn masts in fall 1998 and 2001. Amitraz was applied by rollers at the estimated rate of 1.3 g active ingredient/ha/year. The abundance of host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs declined significantly ( p < 0.001) in the core treatment area, as compared to a control community in Old Saybrook, CT, through 2004, over the project period from 1998 to 2003, from 9.3/100m 2 to 0.97/100m 2 , rising to 1.90/100m 2 in 2004. From 1999 through 2003, there were 46.1%, 49.6%, 63.4%, 64.6%, and 70.2% reductions, respectively, in the nymphal tick population in comparison with the untreated community and initial tick abundance in 1998. Control of I. scapularis adults declined to only 19.1% in 2004; 2 years after the treatment of deer was discontinued. Differences in nymphal tick abundance between the control and core treatment area were significant in 1999 ( p = 0.042) and highly significant in 2001 ( p < 0.001) and 2002 ( p = 0.002).

Twenty-four 4-Poster feeders were placed in a 5.2 km 2 treatment area in Bedford, NY, while a site in Lewisboro, NY, 4.8 km distant, served as control. Treatment periods ran from 15 September to 15 December each fall from 1997 to 2001, and from 15 March to 15 May each spring from 1998 to 2002. Corn consumption averaged 15,779 kg in fall sessions and 9054 kg in spring sessions, and a mean of 89.6% of deer in the study area showed evidence of using the feeders. Deer densities, estimated by aerial snow counts, averaged 22 and 28 deer per km 2 in Bedford and Lewisboro, respectively, over a 3-year period. Significant reductions in tick numbers on deer captured in the treatment area were noted in fall 1999 compared to deer captured at the control site. Drag sampling for nymphal host-seeking ticks indicated 63.6% control in 2001, which dropped to 54.8% the following year, but reached 80% in 2003. Higher-than-normal acorn production in 2001 that likely caused a drop in deer visitation to the feeders may have reduced efficacy against larval ticks in 2002. The 4-Poster effectively reduced the density of Ixodes scapularis , though the level of control is dependent on environmental factors that affect feeding behavior of white-tailed deer.",1396,0,0,1,0,en,en,

An alternative approach by some physicians consists of prolonged antibiotic treatment for >2 months because they believe that Lyme disease often results in persistent Borrelia burgdorferi infection. Understanding how patients perceive the disease is important for effective doctor–patient communication. We conducted interviews and surveys on Block Island, Rhode Island, and Storrs, Connecticut, to explore the public perception of persistent symptoms following Lyme disease and the need for long-term treatment. Most of our participants believed that symptoms and the Lyme disease bacteria can persist after antimicrobial therapy for Lyme disease. When asked about the value of continuing antibiotic treatment for >2 months, about half thought that it was sometimes useful and about a quarter thought it was always useful. Almost all of the respondents stated that they knew people who had experienced Lyme disease, and these personal observations were more frequently cited as an important source of Lyme disease information than official sources such as medical professionals. We conclude that healthcare workers should review the scientific literature regarding appropriate therapy for Lyme disease, discuss such information with their patients, and identify sources of information that their patients can review. Medical societies, private foundations, and State and Federal Health agencies should increase efforts to educate physicians and the general public about the standard diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease and provide additional funding to determine why some people experience persistent symptoms following this infection.",1861,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This spirochetal infection is first characterized by a local cutaneous inflammation, the erythema migrans. The skin constitutes a key interface in the development of the disease. During Borrelia inoculation, tick saliva affects the innate and adaptive immunity of the vertebrate host skin. Some key mediators of innate immunity such as antimicrobial peptides (cathelicidin and defensin families) have been identified as important initiators of skin inflammation. We analyzed the role of tick saliva on integumental innate immunity using different protocols of Borrelia infection, via syringe or direct tick transmission. When syringe inoculation was used, Borrelia triggered skin inflammation with induction of CRAMP, the mouse cathelicidin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, when Borrelia was transmitted directly via the tick, we observed a significant repression of inflammatory genes, suggesting a critical role of tick saliva in skin innate immunity. For all the protocols tested, a peak of intense Borrelia multiplication occurred in the skin between days 5 and 15, before bacterial dissemination to target organs. We conclude that Borrelia pathogens specifically use the tick saliva to facilitate their transmission to the host and that the skin constitutes an essential interface in the development of Lyme disease.",1410,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Clinically diagnosed cases have been registered in the National Database of Epidemiological Surveillance System (NDESS). All reported TBE cases are confirmed by laboratory serological and, if necessary, PCR tests, whereas the registered cases of LD are mainly based on the appearance of erythema migrans concurring with possible exposure of tick bite. Our work is the first comparative epidemiological and geographical information analysis of these 2 diseases together. The following demographic data from each individual case (703 TBE and 13,606 LD) recorded in the NDESS were used: Sex, age, the starting date and place of the onset of disease, and a short report from the affected person. The descriptive epidemiological analysis of incidence was carried out using directly standardized rates, and smoothed indirectly standardized incidence ratios were calculated by hierarchical Bayesian methods at the municipality level using a Rapid Inquiry Facility (RIF). The average yearly incidence rate of TBE was 0.64 per 100,000 inhabitants (range, 0.46–0.84) and of LD was 12.37 per 100,000 inhabitants (range, 9.9–18.1), with the highest incidence rates in 1998 for TBE and 2008 for LD. The most affected age groups were men between 15 and 59 years of age for TBE, and women between 45 and 64 years of age for LD. Seasonality, based on the starting date of the illness, was also characterized. Extended areas of high risk were identified in western and northern Hungary, illustrated on high-resolution (municipality level) maps.

To successfully limit human disease risk, vaccines targeting the wildlife reservoirs of B. burgdorferi must be easily distributable and must effectively reduce pathogen transmission from infected animals, given that many animals in nature will be infected prior to vaccination. We assessed the efficacy of an easily distributable oral bait vaccine based on the immunogenic outer surface protein A (OspA) to protect uninfected mice from infection and to reduce transmission from previously infected white-footed mice, an important reservoir host of B. burgdorferi . Oral vaccination of white-footed mice effectively reduces transmission of B. burgdorferi at both critical stages of the Lyme disease transmission cycle. First, oral vaccination of uninfected white-footed mice elicits an immune response that protects mice from B. burgdorferi infection. Second, oral vaccination of previously infected mice significantly reduces the transmission of B. burgdorferi to feeding ticks despite a statistically nonsignificant immune response. We used the estimates of pathogen transmission to and from vaccinated and unvaccinated mice to model the efficacy of an oral vaccination campaign targeting wild white-footed mice. Projection models suggest that the effects of the vaccine on both critical stages of the transmission cycle of B. burgdorferi act synergistically in a positive feedback loop to reduce the nymphal infection prevalence, and thus human Lyme disease risk, well below what would be expected from either effect alone. This study suggests that oral immunization of wildlife with an OspA-based vaccine can be a promising long-term strategy to reduce human Lyme disease risk.",1856,0,0,1,0,en,en,

It is an emerging disease in Canada due to the expanding range of its tick vector. Environmental risk maps for LD, based on the distribution of the black-legged tick, have focused on coarse determinants such as climate. However, climatic factors vary little within individual health units, the level at which local public health decision-making takes place. We hypothesize that high-resolution environmental data and routinely collected passive surveillance data can be used to develop valid models for tick occurrence and provide insight into ecological processes affecting tick presence at fine scales. Methods: We used a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) to build a habitat suitability model for I. scapularis in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada using georeferenced occurrence points from passive surveillance data collected between 2013 and 2016 and high-resolution land cover and elevation data. We evaluated our model using an independent tick presence/absence dataset collected through active surveillance at 17 field sites during the summer of 2017. Results: Our model showed a good ability to discriminate positive sites from negative sites for tick presence (AUC = 0.878 ± 0.019, classification accuracy = 0.835 ± 0.020). Heavily forested suburban and rural areas in the west and southwest of Ottawa had higher predicted suitability than the more agricultural eastern areas. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the value of passive surveillance data to model local-scale environmental risk for the tick vector of LD at sites of interest to public health. Given the rising incidence of LD and other emerging vector-borne diseases in Canada, our findings support the ongoing collection of these data and collaboration with researchers to provide a timely and accurate portrait of evolving public health risk.",1949,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The principal aim of the study was to identify the differences in Borreliella spp. reservoir competence between two widespread and showing similar behavior thrush species. A total of 157 Ixodes ricinus ticks (19 larvae, 138 nymphs) were collected from 26 blackbirds ( Turdus merula ) and 20 song thrushes ( Turdus philomelos ) living in the same forest habitat (northeastern Poland).

No significant difference of tick prevalence was found, with 88.5% blackbirds and 70% of song thrushes infested. Screening for Borreliella spp. in ticks revealed that both tick infection prevalence (49.2% vs. 18.9%) and mean number of infected individuals engorging on birds (2.27 vs. 0.35) were higher in blackbirds. Both the investigated thrush species presumably could participate in the pathogen circulation, although with different efficiencies.

In order to investigate the role of chitobiose transport in the infectious cycle, we constructed isogenic chbC mutant and wild-type strains in an infectious B. burgdorferi background and confirmed that the mutants were defective in chitobiose utilization. The defect in the  mutants was shown to be in chitobiose transport, consistent with the predicted function of the ChbC protein as the membrane component of a phosphotransferase transporter for chitobiose. We then tested whether this locus is also required for any stage of the experimental mouse-tick infectious cycle.

We show that engorged I. ricinus express salp15 and we have identified three Salp15 homologues within these ticks by reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). One of the predicted proteins showed 80% similarity to I. scapularis Salp15, evenly distributed over the entire amino acid sequence, whereas the two other predicted proteins showed approximately 60% similarity, mainly confined to the signal sequence and C-terminus. Comparison of the DNA and protein sequences with those deposited in several databases indicates that these proteins are part of a Salp15 family of which members are conserved among different Ixodes species, all capable of transmitting B. burgdorferi sensu lato. This suggests that these Salp15 homologues could also play a role in the transmission of diverse Borrelia species and in inhibition of T-cell activation.",1237,0,0,0,1,en,en,

During 2002 to 2004, treatments were suspended, and tick population recovery rates were assayed. Subsequently, the major factors that influenced variations in efficacy were extrapolated to better understand and improve this technology. Treatments resulted in significant reductions in free-living populations of nymphal blacklegged ticks at six of the seven sites, and lone star ticks were significantly reduced at all three sites where they were present.

Skin biopsies of BALB/c mice infested for the first time by I. scapularis nymphs revealed vascular dilatation and an accumulation of inflammatory cells adjacent to the bite site but absent at the site of tick attachment. Such changes would enhance tick-borne pathogen transmission. Mice reexposed to I. scapularis nymphs experienced a decrease in vascular dilatation and a marked increase in inflammatory cells at the site of tick attachment. Skin biopsies of people with attached I. scapularis nymphs revealed similar histologic patterns.

Patients infected with B. burgdorferi , however, more often had systemic symptoms (68.9% vs. 37.1%; p <0.0001), including fatigue ( p <0.0001), arthralgia ( p =0.0003), myalgia ( p <0.0001), headache ( p =0.0008), fever and/or chills ( p <0.0001), and stiff neck ( p <0.0001), and more often had abnormal physical findings (57.1% compared with 11.2%; p <0.0001), such as fever ( p =0.0002) or regional lymphadenopathy ( p <0.0001). There was a trend for more patients with B. burgdorferi infection to have multiple erythema migrans skin lesions (13.4% compared with 5.2%; p =0.051), and among patients with multiple erythema migrans the number of lesions was greater in B. burgdorferi -infected patients (median: 5.5 compared with 2.0; p =0.006). Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that in patients with erythema migrans the clinical features vary according to whether infection is caused by B. garinii or B. burgdorferi .",1550,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The effect of several factors potentially affecting seroreactivity (location, age, gender, occupation, and vector exposition risk) was evaluated using Fisher's exact test (R 2.12.0). The overall prevalence of anti- Borrelia antibodies was 6.52% (18/276) in dogs, with a significantly higher positivity (46.15%, 6/13, p =0.0005) recorded in a midcountry region. Seroreactivity was correlated with occupation, with working dogs being more exposed. The results may indicate that Lyme borreliosis foci are restricted to small areas, but further studies on Borrelia prevalence in tick populations are needed to confirm this hypothesis. In horses, a global seroprevalence of 11.92% (31/260) was observed. No correlations were found between positive results and age, sex, county, or occupation.

Ticks of the species Ixodes ricinus are the main vectors of Lyme Borreliosis and Tick-borne Encephalitis – two rapidly emerging diseases in Europe. Repellents provide a practical means of protection against tick bites and can therefore minimize the transmission of tick-borne diseases. We developed and tested seven different dodecanoic acid (DDA)-formulations for their efficacy in repelling host-seeking nymphs of I. ricinus by laboratory screening. The ultimately selected formulation was then used for comparative investigations of commercially available tick repellents in humans. Methods. Laboratory screening tests were performed using the Moving-object (MO) bioassay. All test formulations contained 10% of the naturally occurring active substance DDA and differed only in terms of the quantitative and qualitative composition of inactive ingredients and fragrances. The test procedure used in the human bioassays is a modification of an assay described by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and recommended for regulatory affairs. Repellency was computed using the equation: R = 100 - N R /N × 100, where N R is the number of non-repelled ticks, and N is the respective number of control ticks. All investigations were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment offering standardized test conditions. Results. All test formulations strongly repelled nymphs of I. ricinus (100-81% protection) as shown by the MO-bioassay. The majority of ticks dropped off the treated surface of the heated rotating drum that served as the attractant (1 mg/cm 2 repellent applied). The 10% DDA-based formulation, that produced the best results in laboratory screening, was as effective as the coconut oil-based reference product. The mean protection time of both preparations was generally similar and averaged 8 hours. Repellency investigations in humans showed that the most effective 10% DDA-based formulation (~1.67 mg/cm 2 applied) strongly avoided the attachment of I. ricinus nymphs and adults for at least 6 hours. The test repellent always provided protection (83-63%) against I. ricinus nymphs equivalent to the natural coconut oil based reference product and a better protection (88-75%) against adult ticks than the synthetic Icaridin-containing reference repellent. Conclusion. We found that the 10% DDA-based formulation (ContraZeck ® ) is an easily applied and very effective natural repellent against I. ricinus ticks.

There is increasing evidence for a latitudinal and altitudinal shift in the distribution range of Ixodes ricinus . The reported incidence of tick-borne disease in humans is on the rise in many European countries and has raised political concern and attracted media attention. It is disputed which factors are responsible for these trends, though many ascribe shifts in distribution range to climate changes. Any possible climate effect would be most easily noticeable close to the tick's geographical distribution limits. In Norway- being the northern limit of this species in Europe- no documentation of changes in range has been published. The objectives of this study were to describe the distribution of I. ricinus in Norway and to evaluate if any range shifts have occurred relative to historical descriptions. Methods. Multiple data sources - such as tick-sighting reports from veterinarians, hunters, and the general public - and surveillance of human and animal tick-borne diseases were compared to describe the present distribution of I. ricinus in Norway. Correlation between data sources and visual comparison of maps revealed spatial consistency. In order to identify the main spatial pattern of tick abundance, a principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a weighted mean of four data sources. The weighted mean explained 67% of the variation of the data sources covering Norway's 430 municipalities and was used to depict the present distribution of I. ricinus . To evaluate if any geographical range shift has occurred in recent decades, the present distribution was compared to historical data from 1943 and 1983. Results. Tick-borne disease and/or observations of I. ricinus was reported in municipalities up to an altitude of 583 metres above sea level (MASL) and is now present in coastal municipalities north to approximately 69°N.

The present study aimed at assessing the seroprevalence of infection with or exposure to Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma spp. and Leishmania infantum in dogs in Portugal. Methods. Based on 120 veterinary medical centres from all the regions of mainland and insular Portugal, 557 apparently healthy and 628 CVBD-suspect dogs were sampled. Serum, plasma or whole blood was tested for qualitative detection of D. immitis antigen and antibodies to E. canis, B. burgdorferi s. l., Anaplasma spp. and L. infantum with two commercial in-clinic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression analysis to identify independent risk factors of exposure to the vector-borne agents. Results. Total positivity levels to D. immitis, E. canis, B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., L. infantum , one or more agents and mixed agents were 3.6%, 4.1%, 0.2%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 14.0% and 2.0% in the healthy group, and 8.9%, 16.4%, 0.5%, 9.2%, 25.2%, 46.3% and 11.6% in the clinically suspect group, respectively. Non-use of ectoparasiticides was a risk factor for positivity to one or more agents both in the apparently healthy (OR = 2.1) and CVBD-suspect (OR = 1.5) dogs. Seropositivity to L. infantum (OR = 7.6), E. canis (OR = 4.1) and D. immitis (OR = 2.4) were identified as risk factors for the presence of clinical signs compatible with CVBDs. Positivity to mixed agents was not found to be a risk factor for disease. Conclusions. Dogs in Portugal are at risk of becoming infected with vector-borne pathogens, some of which are of zoonotic concern. CVBDs should be considered by practitioners and prophylactic measures must be put in place to protect dogs and limit the risk of transmission of vector-borne agents to humans.

The prevalences of infection assessed using the three alternative strategies were in accordance with the initial results, with 13, 11, and 10 out of 14 sites showing occurrence of at least one pathogen, respectively. The strategies A, B, and C proposed herein would allow to reduce the original costs of sampling and laboratory analyses by one third, half, and two thirds, respectively. Strategy B was demonstrated to represent the most cost-effective choice, offering a substantial reduction of costs, as well as reliable results. Conclusions. Monitoring of tick-borne diseases is expensive, particularly in areas where several zoonotic pathogens co-occur. Cost-effectiveness studies can support the choice of the best monitoring strategy, which should take into account the ecology of the area under investigation, as well as the available budget.",2813,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Porretta', 'affiliation': 'Sapienza Università di Roma, Rome, Italy'}]",10.1186/1756-3305-6-271,2013.0,80,Article,"Background. Global climate change can seriously impact on the epidemiological dynamics of vector-borne diseases. In this study we investigated how future climatic changes could affect the climatic niche of Ixodes ricinus (Acari, Ixodida), among the most important vectors of pathogens of medical and veterinary concern in Europe. Methods. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) was used to reconstruct the climatic niche of I. ricinus , and to project it into the future conditions for 2050 and 2080, under two scenarios: a continuous human demographic growth and a severe increase of gas emissions (scenario A2), and a scenario that proposes lower human demographic growth than A2, and a more sustainable gas emissions (scenario B2). Models were reconstructed using the algorithm of “maximum entropy”, as implemented in the software Maxent 3.3.3e; 4,544 occurrence points and 15 bioclimatic variables were used. Results. In both scenarios an increase of climatic niche of about two times greater than the current area was predicted as well as a higher climatic suitability under the scenario B2 than A2. Such an increase occurred both in a latitudinal and longitudinal way, including northern Eurasian regions (e.g. Sweden and Russia), that were previously unsuitable for the species. Conclusions. Our models are congruent with the predictions of range expansion already observed in I. ricinus at a regional scale and provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the future climatically suitable areas for I. ricinus at a continental scale. Although the use of SDM at a higher resolution should be integrated by a more refined analysis of further abiotic and biotic data, the results presented here suggest that under future climatic scenarios most of the current distribution area of I. ricinus could remain suitable and significantly increase at a continental geographic scale. Therefore disease outbreaks of pathogens transmitted by this tick species could emerge in previous non-endemic geographic areas. Further studies will implement and refine present data toward a better understanding of the risk represented by I. ricinus to human health.",2155,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Controlling canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD) is a major concern, since some of these diseases are serious zoonoses. This study was designed to determine seropositivity rates in Spain for agents causing the following five CVBD: leishmaniosis ( Leishmania infantum : Li), heartworm ( Dirofilaria immitis : Di), ehrlichiosis ( Ehrlichia canis : Ec), anaplasmosis ( Anaplasma phagocytophilum/Anaplasma platys : An) and Lyme disease ( Borrelia burgdorferi : Bb). Methods. Anti-An, -Bb, and -Ec antibodies and the Di antigen were determined using the 4DX SNAP® Test (IDEXX Laboratories) and anti- L. infantum (Li) antibodies using the Leishmania SNAP® Test (IDEXX Laboratories) in blood and/or serum samples. Results. Among 1100 dogs examined, overall seropositivity rates were: Li (15.7%), Ec (5%), An (3.1%), Di (1.25%) and Bb (0.4%). While seropositivity towards Bb and Di was similar in all geographic regions, rates were significantly higher in the east of Spain (8.3%) for An, significantly higher in the north (20%) for Ec, and significantly higher in the Southeast (46.6%) and South (27.4%), and significantly lower in the north (0%) for Li. No statistical associations were observed between sex and the CVBD analyzed ( p ≥ 0.05 ) while the following associations with other variables were detected: a higher seropositivity to Ec (40%) and Bb (6.7%) in dogs under one year of age compared with adults ( p < 0.05 ); and a higher seropositivity to An and Li in dogs that lived outdoors versus indoors ( p = 0.01 ; p < 0.001 , respectively). Seropositivity rates of 2.1%, 0%, 1.7%, 0.5% and 4.2% were recorded respectively for An, Bb, Ec, Di and Li in dogs with no clinical signs (n = 556) versus 3.8%, 0.6%, 7.5%, 1.8% and 25.9% for those with signs (n = 507) suggestive of a CVBD. Conclusion. The data obtained indicate a risk for dogs in Spain of acquiring any of the five CVBD examined. Veterinarians in the different regions should include these diseases in their differential diagnoses and recommend the use of repellents and other prophylactic measures to prevent disease transmission by arthropod vectors. Public health authorities also need to become more involved in the problem, since some of the CVBD examined here also affect humans.",2260,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Raising abundance of ticks and tick-borne diseases in Europe is the result of multiple factors including climate changes and human activities. Herein, we investigated the presence and seasonal activity of Ixodes ricinus ticks from 10 urban and suburban sites in two different geographical areas of southeastern and northeastern Slovakia during 2008–2010. Our aim was to study the abundance of ticks in correlation with the environmental factors and their infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Neoehrlichia mikurensis . Methods. Questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from ten urban and suburban sites in Eastern Slovakia. A total of 670 ticks were further analysed for the presence of B. burgdorferi s.l., A. phagocytophilum and N. mikurensis by molecular methods. Tick site and environmental relations were analysed using General Linear Models (LM). The differences between the number of Lyme borreliosis cases between the Košice and Bardejov regions during a ten-year period were tested by Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Results. In total, 2921 (1913 nymphs, 1008 adults) I. ricinus ticks were collected from 10 study sites during the main questing season. Tick activity and relative abundance differed between locations and months. Temperature and humidity were the main factors affecting the tick abundance and questing activity. Out of 670 examined ticks, 10.15% were infected with spirochetes from B. burgdorferi s.l. complex (represented by B. afzelii , B. garinii , B.valaisiana and B. burgdorferi s.s.), 2.69% with the A. phagocytophilum and 2.39% with N. mikurensis . The number of Lyme borreliosis cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the Bardejov region was significantly higher than in the Košice region. Conclusions. Our data indicate that the risk of infection with tick-borne pathogens in Eastern Slovakia is common since 15.2% of ticks were infected at least with one of the tested microorganisms. Even though the abundance of ticks was affected by the microclimatic conditions and the prevalence of pathogens differed between the habitats, the infection risk for humans is also affected by human activities leading to an increased contact with infected ticks.",2225,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in Europe. Ixodes ricinus also carries other pathogenic bacteria, but corresponding human diseases are rarely reported. Here, we compared the exposure to Rickettsia helvetica and Rickettsia monacensis with that to Lyme borreliosis spirochetes . We assumed that their exposure corresponds to their infection rate in questing I. ricinus . Findings. Three Rickettsia species were detected in ticks with a total prevalence of 7.9%, of which the majority was R. helvetica (78%) and R. monacensis (21%). From the same geographic area, skin biopsies of erythema migrans patients were investigated for possible co-infections with Rickettsia spp.. Forty-seven out of 67 skin biopsies were PCR positive for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. and one sample was positive for R. monacensis. The Borrelia genospecies from the R. monacensis positive patient was identified as Borrelia afzelii . The patient did not show any symptoms associated with rickettsiosis. Conclusions. Co-infections of I. ricinus with Rickettsia spp. and B. burgdorferi s.l. were as high as expected from the individual prevalence of both pathogens. Co-infection rate in erythema migrans patients corresponded well with tick infection rates. To our knowledge, this is the first reported co-infection of B. afzelii and R. monacensis.",1354,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Mysterud', 'affiliation': 'Universitetet i Oslo, Oslo, Norway'}]",10.1186/1756-3305-6-187,2013.0,31,Article,"Background. Understanding the variation in prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Lyme Borreliosis Spirochaetes, LBS) and Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causing tick-borne fever in ruminants and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis) in ticks is vital from both a human and an animal disease perspective to target the most effective mitigation measures. From the host competence hypothesis, we predicted that prevalence of LBS would decrease with red deer density, while prevalence of A . phagocytophilum would increase. Methods. Based on a sample of 112 adult and 686 nymphal Ixodes ricinus ticks collected with flagging during questing from 31 transects (4–500 m long) corresponding to individual seasonal home ranges of 41 red deer along the west coast of Norway, we tested whether there were spatial and seasonal variations in prevalence with a special emphasis on the population density of the most common large host in this area, the red deer ( Cervus elaphus ). We used a multiplex real-time PCR assay for detection of A . phagocytophilum and LBS. Results. Prevalence of LBS was higher in adult female ticks (21.6%) compared to adult male ticks (11.5%) and nymphs (10.9%), while prevalence was similar among stages for prevalence of A . phagocytophilum (8.8%). Only partly consistent with predictions, we found a lower prevalence of LBS in areas of high red deer density, while there was no relationship between red deer density and prevalence of A . phagocytophilum in ticks. Prevalence of both bacteria was much higher in ticks questing in May compared to August. Conclusions. Our study provides support to the notion that spatial variation in host composition forms a role for prevalence of LBS in ticks also in a northern European ecosystem, while no such association was found for A . phagocytophilum . Further studies are needed to fully understand the similar seasonal pattern of prevalence of the two pathogens.",1924,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Lyme borreliosis is a tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. The variety of characteristic and non-specific clinical manifestations is partially explained by its genetic diversity. We investigated the ability of B . burgdorferi sl isolates to cause erythema migrans. Methods. The genetic constellation of isolates from ticks was compared to isolates found in erythema migrans. PCR and sequence analysis was performed on the plasmid-encoded ospC and the chromosomal 5S-23S rDNA spacer region (IGS). Results. Seven different B . burgdorferi sl genospecies were identified in 152 borrelia isolates from ticks and erythema migrans biopsies. B afzelii (51%) and B . garinii (27%) were the most common in ticks. From the 44 sequences obtained from erythema migrans samples 42 were B . afzelii , one B . garinii and one B . bavariensis . Significant associations with erythema migrans formation were found for four IGS and two ospC types. Five from 45 ospC types were associated with more than one genospecies. Conclusions. B . burgdorferi sl isolates differ in their propensity to cause erythema migrans. These differences were also found within genospecies. In other words, although B . afzelii was mostly associated with erythema migrans, some B . afzelii isolates had a low ability to cause erythema migrans.

Estonia is located in a unique area of co-distribution of Ixodes ricinus and I . persulcatus , which are the main tick vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In the last decade, the incidence rate of Lyme borreliosis in Estonia has increased dramatically up to 115.4 per 100,000 in 2012. Here we present the first survey of the presence, the prevalence and genetic characteristics of B . burgdorferi s.l. complex spirochetes in the tick population in Estonia. Methods. During the years 2006–2009, 2833 unfed Ixodes ricinus and I . persulcatus were collected from 43 sites in 7 counties in mainland Estonia as well as in 10 sites on the Saaremaa Island. DNA samples from ticks were analyzed individually using nested PCR of the ribosomal 5S-23S spacer region followed by bidirectional sequencing. Results. The overall estimated prevalence of B . burgdorferi s.l was 9.7% and varied from 4.9% to 24.2% on the mainland and to 10.7% in Saaremaa Island. Ixodes persulcatus ticks showed significantly higher prevalence rates compared to that in I . ricinus -16.3% and 8.2%, respectively. The most prevalent genospecies was B . afzelii which was detected in 53.5% of Borrelia -positive ticks, followed by B . garinii and B . valaisiana with 26.2% and 5.5%, respectively. Also, B . bavariensis and B . burgdorferi s.s. DNA in single I . ricinus ticks were detected. Borrelia afzelii , B . garinii and B . valaisiana were detected in both tick species. Two genetic subgroups of B . garinii (NT29 and 20047) and two genetic subgroups of B . afzelii (NT28 and VS461) were found to be circulating in all studied regions as well as in both tick species, except B . garinii subgroup NT29, which was found only in I . persulcatus ticks. Conclusions. In the current study we detected the circulation of five B . burgdorferi s.l. genospecies and estimated the prevalence in ticks in different regions of Estonia. Detection and genetic characterization of Borrelia genospecies, especially those of public health importance, in the natural foci may help assessing high risk areas of human exposure to B . burgdorferi s.l.",2119,0,0,0,1,en,it,

The so-called canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD) are caused by a wide range of pathogens transmitted by arthropods. In addition to their veterinary importance, many of these canine vector-borne pathogens can also affect the human population due to their zoonotic potential, a situation that requires a One Health approach. As the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in cats from southern Portugal has been recently evaluated, the aim of the present study was to assess if the same agents were present in dogs living in the same area, and to assess positivity-associated risk factors. Methods. One thousand and ten dogs (521 domestic and 489 stray) from veterinary medical centres and animal shelters in southern Portugal were enrolled. Anaplasma spp./ Ehrlichia spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp. and Leishmania infantum infections were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in blood samples. Results. Sixty-eight (6.7%) dogs were PCR-positive to at least one of the tested CVBD agent species, genera or complex, including one dog found positive to two different genera. Nineteen (1.9%) dogs were positive to Anaplasma spp./ Ehrlichia spp., eight (0.8%) to B. burgdorferi s.l., 31 (3.1%) to Hepatozoon spp. and 11 (1.1%) to L. infantum. Anaplasma platys , Ehrlichia canis , B. burgdorferi s.l. and Hepatozoon canis were identified by DNA sequencing, including one animal confirmed with both A. platys and H. canis . Furthermore, Wolbachia spp. was amplified in blood from four dogs. None of the tested dogs was positive by PCR for Bartonella spp. or Babesia spp. Conclusions. The molecular identification of CVBD agents in southern Portugal, some of them with zoonotic concern, reinforces the importance to alert the veterinary community, owners and public health authorities to prevent the risk of transmission of vector-borne pathogens among dogs and to other vertebrate hosts including humans. The prevalence of the selected pathogens was lower than that previously found in cats from the same region, probably because veterinarians and owners are more aware of them in the canine population and control measures are used more often.",2215,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In the present study, we set out to screen I. ricinus collected from Danish domestic dogs for Babesia , in order to identify whether humans in Denmark are exposed to the parasite. Findings. A total of 661 ticks ( Ixodes spp.) were collected from 345 Danish domestic dogs during April-September 2011 and pooled, one sample per dog. DNA was extracted from each sample and examined by PCR and sequencing for Rickettsia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Bartonella spp., Francisella tularensis , Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis , and Babesia spp. In total, 34% of the samples were positive for tick-borne microorganisms potentially pathogenic to humans: Rickettsia spp. were detected in 16% of the pools, with 79% being R. helvetica.

Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes persulcatus are the main vectors of Lyme borreliosis spirochetes and several other zoonotic bacteria in northern Europe and Russia. However, few studies screening bacterial pathogens in Finnish ticks have been conducted. Therefore, reports on the occurrence and prevalence of several bacterial pathogens detected from ticks elsewhere in Europe and Russia are altogether missing from Finland. The main aim of the current study was to produce novel data on the occurrence and prevalence of several tick-borne bacterial pathogens in ticks collected from southwestern Finland. Methods. Ticks were collected in 2013–2014 by blanket dragging from 25 localities around southwestern Finland, and additionally from a dog in Lempäälä. Collected ticks were molecularly identified and screened for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., Borrelia miyamotoi, Rickettsia , Bartonella and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis using quantitative PCR. Furthermore, detected Rickettsia spp. were sequenced using conventional PCR to determine species. Results. A total of 3169 ticks in 1174 DNA samples were screened for the listed pathogens. The most common bacteria detected was B. burgdorferi ( s.l .) (18.5 % nymphal and 23.5 % adult ticks), followed by Rickettsia spp. (1.1 %; 5.1 %) and B. miyamotoi (0.51 %; 1.02 %). B. miyamotoi and Rickettsia spp. were also detected in larval samples (minimum infection rates 0.31 % and 0.21 %, respectively). Detected Rickettsia spp. were identified by sequencing as R. helvetica and R. monacensis . All screened samples were negative for Bartonella spp. and Ca. N. mikurensis. Conclusions. In the current study we report for the first time the presence of Rickettsia in Finnish ticks. Furthermore, Rickettsia spp. and B. miyamotoi were found from larval tick samples, emphasizing the importance they may have as vectors of these pathogens. Comparisons of tick density estimates and B. burgdorferi ( s.l .) prevalence made between the current study and a previous study conducted in 2000 in ten out of the 25 study localities suggest that an increase in tick abundance and B. burgdorferi ( s.l .) prevalence has occurred in at least some of the study localities.",2210,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The genus Bartonella is comprised of a rapidly increasing number of pathogenic species that induce a seemingly diverse spectrum of neurological symptoms. During the 12 year period that followed the initial onset of neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms, an 11 year-old girl experienced a spectrum of neurological complaints including frequent headaches, visual and auditory hallucinations, anxiety, vision loss involving the lower left quadrant of both eyes, episodic bouts of generalized paralysis, facial palsy, chronic insomnia, seizures, dizziness, cognitive dysfunction, and memory loss. PCR assays targeting Bartonella spp. were used to test formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded brain tissue, patient blood specimens and Bartonella alpha Proteobacteria growth medium (BAPGM) enrichment blood cultures. PCR positive amplicons were sequenced directly and compared to GenBank sequences. Bartonella spp. serology was performed by indirect fluorescent antibody testing and confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to visualize B. henselae organisms in resected brain. Results. Bartonella henselae DNA was independently PCR amplified and sequenced from the girl’s right parietal lobe, surgically resected in 2000 and from a blood specimen collected in 2012. Although causation cannot be established by a case report, prior diagnostic testing resulted in findings that were either inconclusive or within normal reference ranges and no etiological diagnosis had been obtained to explain the patient’s initial or progressive neurological symptoms. Conclusions. As intravascular, intra-erythrocytic and endotheliotropic bacteria, it is possible that B. henselae initially induced a vasculitis, resulting in secondary cerebral infarction, tissue necrosis and surgical resection. Bartonella bacteremia, potentially spanning a 12-year time frame, in conjunction with the therapeutic administration of immunosuppressive drugs may have resulted in a progression and potentiation of the neurological disease that was partially reversible following antibiotic administration.",2081,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In northern Spain, LB is considered endemic; recently, a significant increase of the annual incidence of LB was reported in the northwestern (NW) region. Methods. In order to provide information on the prevalence of Borrelia spp., pooled and individually free-living I. ricinus from NW Spain were molecularly analyzed. Positive samples were characterized at the fla and Glpq genes and the rrfA-rrlB intergenic spacer region to identify Borrelia species/genospecies. Results. Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) ( s.l. ) individual prevalence and MIR were significantly higher in adult females (32.3 and 16%) than in nymphs (18.8 and 6.2%) and adult males (15.6 and 8.4%). Five Borrelia genospecies belonging to the B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) group were identified: B. garinii was predominant, followed by B. valaisiana , B. lusitaniae , B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi ( sensu stricto ) ( s.s. ) . One species belonging to the tick-borne relapsing fever group ( B. miyamotoi ) was also found, showing low individual prevalence (1%), positive pool (0.7%) and MIR (0.1%) values. To our knowledge, this is the first citation of B. miyamotoi in free-living ticks from Spain. Conclusions. The significant prevalences of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) genospecies detected in questing ticks from NW Spain are similar to those detected in northern and central European countries and higher to those previously found in Spain. These results together with the high incidence of LB in humans and the high seroprevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) in roe deer shown in other studies reveal that the northwest area is one of the most risky regions for acquiring LB in Spain.",1845,0,0,0,1,en,en,

A higher overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens was observed in I. ricinus than in I. persulcatus : 30.0% (604/2014) versus 24.0% (348/1451), respectively. In addition, I. ricinus were more frequently co-infected than I. persulcatus : 2.4% (49/2014) versus 0.8% (12/1451), respectively. Causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, i.e. bacterial genospecies in Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) group, were the most prevalent pathogens (overall 17%). “ Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae” was found for the first time in I. ricinus ticks and in Finnish ticks in general. Moreover, Babesia divergens , B. venatorum and “ Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” were reported for the first time from the Finnish mainland. Conclusions. The present study provides valuable information on the prevalence and geographical distribution of various tick-borne pathogens in I. ricinus and I. persulcatus ticks in Finland. Moreover, this comprehensive subset of ticks revealed the presence of rare and potentially dangerous pathogens. The highest prevalence of infected ticks was in the I. ricinus -dominated area in southern Finland, while the prevalence was essentially equal in sympatric and I. persulcatus- dominated areas. However, the highest infection rates for both species were in areas of their dominance, either in south or north Finland.",2007,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Ehrmann', 'affiliation': 'Universität Freiburg im Breisgau, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany'}]",10.1186/s13071-017-2590-x,2018.0,20,Article,"Background. The tick Ixodes ricinus has considerable impact on the health of humans and other terrestrial animals because it transmits several tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) such as B. burgdorferi ( sensu lato ), which causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). Small forest patches of agricultural landscapes provide many ecosystem services and also the disservice of LB risk. Biotic interactions and environmental filtering shape tick host communities distinctively between specific regions of Europe, which makes evaluating the dilution effect hypothesis and its influence across various scales challenging. Latitude, macroclimate, landscape and habitat properties drive both hosts and ticks and are comparable metrics across Europe. Therefore, we instead assess these environmental drivers as indicators and determine their respective roles for the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in I. ricinus . Methods. We sampled I. ricinus and measured environmental properties of macroclimate, landscape and habitat quality of forest patches in agricultural landscapes along a European macroclimatic gradient. We used linear mixed models to determine significant drivers and their relative importance for nymphal and adult B. burgdorferi prevalence. We suggest a new prevalence index, which is pool-size independent. Results. During summer months, our prevalence index varied between 0 and 0.4 per forest patch, indicating a low to moderate disservice. Habitat properties exerted a fourfold larger influence on B. burgdorferi prevalence than macroclimate and landscape properties combined. Increasingly available ecotone habitat of focal forest patches diluted and edge density at landscape scale amplified B. burgdorferi prevalence. Indicators of habitat attractiveness for tick hosts (food resources and shelter) were the most important predictors within habitat patches. More diverse and abundant macro- and microhabitat had a diluting effect, as it presumably diversifies the niches for tick-hosts and decreases the probability of contact between ticks and their hosts and hence the transmission likelihood. Conclusions. Diluting effects of more diverse habitat patches would pose another reason to maintain or restore high biodiversity in forest patches of rural landscapes. We suggest classifying habitat patches by their regulating services as dilution and amplification habitat, which predominantly either decrease or increase B. burgdorferi prevalence at local and landscape scale and hence LB risk. Particular emphasis on promoting LB-diluting properties should be put on the management of those habitats that are frequently used by humans. In the light of these findings, climate change may be of little concern for LB risk at local scales, but this should be evaluated further.",2763,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Emergence of tick-borne diseases is impacting humans and livestock across the Northern Hemisphere. There are, however, large regional variations in number of cases of tick-borne diseases. Some areas have surprisingly few cases of disease compared to other regions. The aim here is to provide a first step towards a better understanding of such contrasting regional patterns of disease emergences at the northern distribution range of Ixodes ricinus in Europe. Methods. We compare disease incidence, vector abundance and pathogen prevalence in eastern and western Norway differing in the number of tick-borne disease cases. First, we analysed the incidence of Lyme borreliosis in humans, tick-borne fever (anaplasmosis) in sheep and anaplasmosis and babesiosis in cattle to verify if incidence differed. Secondly, we analysed extensive field data on questing tick density, pathogen prevalence, as well as the broad spatial pattern of human and livestock distribution as it may relate to tick exposure. Results. The incidences of all diseases were lower in eastern, compared to western, Norway, but this was most marked for the livestock diseases. While the prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) in ticks was similar in the two regions, the prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum was markedly lower in eastern, compared to western, Norway. We found overall a lower abundance of questing nymphs in the east. In the east, there were cases of babesiosis in cattle where anaplasmosis was absent, suggesting absence of the pathogen rather than differences in exposure to ticks as part of the explanation for the much lower incidence of anaplasmosis in eastern Norway. Conclusions. Many factors contribute to different disease incidence across ecosystems. We found that regional variation in tick-borne disease incidence may be partly linked to vector abundance and pathogen prevalence, but differently for human and livestock diseases. Further studies are needed to determine if there is also regional variation in specific genospecies and strain frequencies differing in pathogenicity.",2104,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Species of Canidae in Russia can be infested with up to 24 different tick species; however, the frequency of different tick species infesting domestic dogs across Russia is not known. In addition, tick-borne disease risks for domestic dogs in Russia are not well quantified. The goal of this study was to conduct a nationwide survey of ticks collected from infested dogs admitted to veterinary clinics in Russian cities and to identify pathogens found in these ticks. Methods. Ticks feeding on dogs admitted to 32 veterinary clinics in 27 major cities across Russia were preserved in ethanol and submitted to a central facility for examination. After identification, each tick was evaluated for infection with known tick-borne pathogens using PCR. Results. There were 990 individual ticks collected from 636 dogs. All collected ticks belonged to the Ixodidae (hard ticks) and represented 11 species of four genera, Dermacentor , Ixodes , Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis . Four most common tick species were D. reticulatus , followed by I. persulcatus , I. ricinus and R. sanguineus . Ixodes persulcatus ticks were found to be infected with 10 different pathogens, and ticks of this species were more frequently infected than either D. reticulatus or I. ricinus . Ixodes persulcatus females were also more frequently co-infected with two or more pathogens than any other tick. Pathogenic species of five genera were detected in ticks: Anaplasma centrale , A . phagocytophilum and A . marginale ; Babesia canis , B. microti , B. venatorum , B. divergens , B. crassa and B. vogeli ; Borrelia miyamotoi , B. afzelii and B . garinii ; Ehrlichia muris , E. canis and E . ruminantum ; and Theileria cervi . Anaplasma marginale , E. canis , B. crassa , B. vogeli and T. cervi were detected in I. persulcatus , and Babesia canis in D. marginatum , for the first time in Russia. Conclusions. Multiple ticks from four genera and 11 species of the family Ixodidae were collected from domestic dogs across Russia. These ticks commonly carry pathogens and act as disease vectors.

Blazejak', 'affiliation': 'Tierärztliche Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany'}]",10.1186/s13071-018-2882-9,2018.0,12,Article,"Background. Lyme borreliosis caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) complex is still the most common tick-borne disease in Europe, posing a considerable threat to public health. The predominant vector in Europe is the widespread hard tick Ixodes ricinus , which also transmits the relapsing fever spirochete B. miyamotoi as well as pathogenic Rickettsiales ( Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Rickettsia spp.). To assess the public health risk, a long-term monitoring of tick infection rates with the named pathogens is indispensable. Methods. The present study is the first German 10-year follow-up monitoring of tick infections with Borrelia spp. and co-infections with Rickettsiales. Furthermore, a specific Reverse Line Blot (RLB) protocol for detection of B. miyamotoi and simultaneous differentiation of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) geno-species was established. Results. Overall, 24.0% (505/2100) of ticks collected in the city of Hanover were infected with Borrelia . In detail, 35.4% (203/573) of adult ticks [38.5% females (111/288) and 32.3% males (92/285)] and 19.8% nymphs (302/1527) were infected, representing consistent infection rates over the 10-year monitoring period. Geno-species differentiation using RLB determined B. miyamotoi in 8.9% (45/505) of positive ticks. Furthermore, a significant decrease in B. afzelii and B. spielmanii infection rates from 2010 to 2015 was observed. Co-infections with Rickettsia spp. and A. phagocytophilum increased between 2010 and 2015 (7.3 vs 10.9% and 0.3 vs 1.1%, respectively). Conclusions. Long-term monitoring is an essential part of public health risk assessment to capture data on pathogen occurrence over time. Such data will reveal shifts in pathogen geno-species distribution and help to answer the question whether or not climate change influences tick-borne pathogens.",1853,0,0,0,1,en,en,

As forest is the preferred environment for ticks, forestry workers are exposed to tick bites and tick-borne diseases. We assessed the seroprevalence of anti- Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ) antibodies and investigated, using an integrated landscape approach, the individual and environmental factors associated with the seroprevalence of Bb in Belgian forestry workers, a high-risk group in Belgium. Methods. A group of 310 Belgian forest workers was examined to assess the seroprevalence of anti- Borrelia IgG antibodies. Using principal component analysis and binary logistic regression, the joint effects of individual characteristics and environmental characteristics were examined. Results. Sixty-seven of the 310 workers were seropositive for Lyme disease (LD), leading to a seroprevalence of 21.6%. The seroprevalence was higher among forest workers visiting forests more frequently ( P = 0.003) or who reported over 100 tick bites ( P -value < 0.001). The intensity of tick bites and the use of protection measures against tick bites have a positive impact on LD seroprevalence while the quantity of shadow from trees at ground level had a negative one. Conclusions. This study showed that forest workers are a population at risk for LD and, by extension, at risk for various tick-borne diseases. In addition to the role of the environment, our results also showed the importance of considering exposure when predicting the risk of infection by Bb .",1465,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Hauser', 'affiliation': 'Université de Neuchâtel, Neuchatel, Switzerland'}]",10.1186/s13071-018-2876-7,2018.0,9,Article,"Background. One of the major public health challenges in the field of communicable diseases consists of being able to predict where and when a population is at risk of being infected by a pathogen. In the case of vector-borne diseases, such predictions often require strong ecological knowledge of the vector life-cycle and the environmental conditions promoting or preventing its establishment and maintenance. In this study, we analyse how climatic factors influence the abundance and phenology of the Lyme borreliosis vector Ixodes ricinus in a Swiss temperate forest , based on a long-term monthly observation over a period of 15 years (2000 and 2014). Results. Our results show that questing nymph density significantly decreased during the study period in the sampling area. Although the analyses of climatic variables point out the relative importance of air temperature, relative humidity and saturation deficit on nymph questing activity, the global trends followed by these variables over the study period failed to fully explain the observed decline. However, nymph phenology was additionally explained by the presence of climatic thresholds that limit the questing behaviours of ticks. Most notably, we found that the presumed upper threshold of air saturation deficit, which strongly limits the increase of questing nymph density and is typically reached in the middle of spring, was reached significantly earlier and earlier over years. Conclusions. In addition to phenology per se , the use of climatic thresholds may help to predict the presence and abundance of questing ticks in Lyme borreliosis endemic areas. Tick sensitivity to temperature or saturation deficit thresholds also suggests that extreme climatic events more than global trends may affect tick population dynamics. These two points may be of high importance in epidemiological short-term as well as long-term predictions. However, the highly unexplained variability in nymph density underlines the need for further studies that include other factors such as tick host abundance or tick microhabitats, two potentially influent factors that were not assessed in the present study.",2161,0,0,0,1,en,en,

To date, there are many studies about ticks and tick-borne pathogens (TBP), but only a few were carried out in Bulgaria. The present study intends to detect the prevalence of tick-borne bacteria and parasites occurring at the Black Sea in Bulgaria to evaluate the zoonotic potential of the tick-borne pathogens transmitted by ticks in this area. Methods. In total, cDNA from 1541 ticks ( Dermacentor spp., Haemaphysalis spp., Hyalomma spp., Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus spp.) collected in Bulgaria by flagging method or from hosts was tested in pools of ten individuals each for Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi ( s . l .), Rickettsia spp. and “ Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis” via conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. Subsequently, samples from positive pools were tested individually and a randomized selection of positive PCR samples was purified, sequenced, and analyzed. Results. Altogether, 23.2% of ticks were infected with at least one of the tested pathogens. The highest infection levels were noted in nymphs (32.3%) and females (27.5%). Very high prevalence was detected for Rickettsia spp. (48.3%), followed by A. phagocytophilum (6.2%), Borrelia burgdorferi ( s . l .) (1.7%), Babesia spp. (0.4%) and “ Ca .

Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) represent a wide group of diseases of major significance for canine health. In addition to their veterinary importance, many of these diseases are of great zoonotic concern, posing a risk of potential transmission to humans. To date, there has been scant knowledge regarding the prevalence, distribution and risk factors of CVBDs in Greece. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to update the current knowledge on the seroprevalence of Dirofilaria immitis , Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp. and Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ) in dogs in Greece and, furthermore, to assess possible environmental and any other risk factors associated with these infections. A total of 1000 apparently healthy and randomly selected dogs, presented in veterinary clinics, were involved at the national level ( n = 66 municipalities). Serum samples were obtained from each individual dog and were tested using the SNAP ® 4Dx ® Plus kit from IDEXX Laboratories. Possible risk factors were assessed using binary regression models, including dogs’ lifestyle, climatological parameters and the altitude of the region. Results. Overall, 21.8% (95% CI: 19.4–24.5%) of the sampled dogs were found to be seropositive to at least one of the four pathogens examined. The most prevalent pathogen was Ehrlichia spp. (12.5%, 95% CI: 10.6–14.7) followed by D. immitis (9.0%, 95% CI: 7.8–11.5) and Anaplasma spp. (6.2%, 95% CI: 4.9–7.9). The lowest prevalence (0.1%) was recorded for B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) where only one dog was found to be positive. Among the examined risk factors, low mean temperature was found to increase the prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. ( P ≤ 0.001) and Anaplasma spp. ( P ≤ 0.001), while low minimum temperature increased the prevalence of D. immitis ( P ≤ 0.001). In addition, low total annual rainfall had an effect of the prevalence of Ehrlichia spp. ( P ≤ 0.01). Altitude also had a significant effect on the prevalence of D. immitis ( P ≤ 0.05) and Anaplasma spp. ( P ≤ 0.01). Conclusions.

In order to evaluate the risk of human exposure to tick-borne pathogens in Belgium, a study on the prevalence of several pathogens was conducted on feeding ticks removed from humans in 2017. Methods. Using a citizen science approach based on an existing notification tool for tick bites, a sample of ticks was collected across the country. Collected ticks were screened by PCR for the presence of the following pathogens: Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Babesia spp., Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ), Borrelia miyamotoi , Neoehrlichia mikurensis , Rickettsia helvetica and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Results. In total, 1599 ticks were included in the sample. The great majority of ticks belonged to Ixodes ricinus (99%); other tick species were identified as Ixodes hexagonus (0.7%) and Dermacentor reticulatus (0.3%). Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) was detected in 14% of nymphs and adult ticks. Adult ticks (20%) were more likely to be infected than nymphs (12%). The most common genospecies were B. afzelii (52%) and B. garinii (21%). Except for TBEV, the other tick-borne pathogens studied were all detected in the tick sample, although at a lower prevalence: 1.5% for Babesia spp.; 1.8% for A. phagocytophilum ; 2.4% for B. miyamotoi ; 2.8% for N. mikurensis ; and 6.8% for R. helvetica .

Ixodes ricinus is the predominant tick species in Europe and the primary pathogen vector for both humans and animals. These ticks are frequently involved in the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi ( sensu lato ), the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis. While much more is known about I. ricinus tick-borne pathogen composition, information about temporal tick-borne pathogen patterns remain scarce. These data are crucial for predicting seasonal/annual patterns which could improve understanding and prevent tick-borne diseases. Methods. We examined tick-borne pathogen (TBP) dynamics in I. ricinus collected monthly in a peri-urban forest over three consecutive years. In total, 998 nymphs were screened for 31 pathogenic species using high-throughput microfluidic real-time PCR. Results. We detected DNA from Anaplasma phagocytophilum (5.3%), Rickettsia helvetica (4.5%), Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (3.7%), Borrelia miyamotoi (1.2%), Babesia venatorum (1.5%) and Rickettsia felis (0.1%). Among all analysed ticks, 15.9% were infected by at least one of these microorganisms, and 1.3% were co-infected. Co-infections with B. afzeli / B. garinii and B. garinii / B. spielmanii were significantly over-represented. Moreover, significant variations in seasonal and/or inter-annual prevalence were observed for several pathogens ( R. helvetica , B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) , B. miyamotoi and A. phagocytophilum ). Conclusions. Analysing TBP prevalence in monthly sampled tick over three years allowed us to assess seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations of the prevalence of TBPs known to circulate in the sampled area, but also to detect less common species. All these data emphasize that sporadic tick samplings are not sufficient to determine TBP prevalence and that regular monitoring is necessary.",1813,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Borrelia burgdorferi is a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme borreliosis (LB). After an initial tick bite, it spreads from the deposition site in the dermis to distant tissues of the host. It is generally believed that this spirochete disseminates via the hematogenous route. Borrelia persica causes relapsing fever and is able to replicate in the blood stream. Currently the exact dissemination pathway of LB pathogens in the host is not known and controversially discussed. Methods. In this study, we established a strict intravenous infection murine model using host-adapted spirochetes. Survival capacity and infectivity of host-adapted B. burgdorferi sensu stricto ( Bbss ) were compared to those of B. persica ( Bp ) after either intradermal (ID) injection into the dorsal skin of immunocompetent mice or strict intravenous (IV) inoculation via the jugular vein. By in vitro culture and PCR, viable spirochetes and their DNA load in peripheral blood were periodically monitored during a 49/50-day course post-injection, as well as in various tissue samples collected at day 49/50. Specific antibodies in individual plasma/serum samples were detected with serological methods. Results. Regardless of ID or IV injection, DNA of Bp was present in blood samples up to day 24 post-challenge, while no Bbss was detectable in the blood circulation during the complete observation period. In contrast to the brain tropism of Bp , Bbss spirochetes were found in ear, skin, joint, bladder, and heart tissue samples of only ID-inoculated mice. All tested tissues collected from IV-challenged mice were negative for traces of Bbss . ELISA testing of serum samples showed that Bp induced gradually increasing antibody levels after ID or IV inoculation, while Bbss did so only after ID injection but not after IV inoculation. Conclusions. This study allows us to draw the following conclusions: (i) Bp survives in the blood and disseminates to the host’s brain via the hematogenous route; and (ii) Bbss , in contrast, is cleared rapidly from the blood stream and is a tissue-bound spirochete.",2100,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The presence of antibodies to Anaplasma spp. ( A. phagocytophilum , A. platys ), Ehrlichia spp. ( E. canis , E. chaffeensis , E. ewingii ), Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) and Dirofilaria immitis were assessed using IDEXX SNAP ® 4Dx ® ELISA tests. For each pathogen, risk factors (i.e. geographical area, keeping condition, sex, age, breed, tick infestation, weekly sanitation of dog enclosures and application of ectoparasiticides) were evaluated by logistic regression approach. Results. In total, 18.2% ( n = 91, 95% CI 15.1–21.8) of dogs scored seropositive for at least one pathogen, the most frequent being Ehrlichia spp. ( n = 56; 11.2%; 95% CI 8.7–14.3) followed by Anaplasma spp. ( n = 33; 6.6%, 95% CI 4.7–9.1), Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) ( n = 9; 1.8%, 95% CI 0.9–3.4) and D. immitis ( n = 7; 1.4%, 95% CI 0.9–2.9).

Hartemink', 'affiliation': 'Wageningen University &amp; Research, Wageningen, Netherlands'}]",10.1186/s13071-021-04607-7,2021.0,1,Article,"Background. The incidence of Lyme borreliosis varies over time and space through as yet incompletely understood mechanisms. In Europe, Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with a Borrelia burgdorferi ( s.l. ) genospecies, which is primarily transmitted by a bite of Ixodes ricinus nymphs. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial and temporal variation in nymphal infection prevalence of B. burgdorferi ( s.l. ) (NIP), density of questing nymphs (DON) and the resulting density of infected nymphs (DIN). Methods. We investigated the infection rates in I. ricinus nymphs that were collected monthly between 2009 and 2016 in 12 locations in the Netherlands. Using generalized linear mixed models, we explored how the NIP, DON and DIN varied during the seasons, between years and between locations. We also determined the genospecies of the Borrelia infections and investigated whether the genospecies composition differed between locations. Results. The overall NIP was 14.7%. A seasonal pattern in infection prevalence was observed, with higher estimated prevalences in the summer than in the spring and autumn. This, combined with higher nymphal densities in summer, resulted in a pronounced summer peak in the estimated DIN. Over the 7.5-year study period, a significant decrease in infection prevalence was found, as well as a significant increase in nymphal density. These two effects appear to cancel each other out; the density of infected nymphs, which is the product of NIP × DON, showed no significant trend over years. Mean infection prevalence (NIP, averaged over all years and all months) varied considerably between locations, ranging from 5 to 26%. Borrelia genospecies composition differed between locations: in some locations almost all infections consisted of B. afzelii , whereas other locations had more diverse genospecies compositions. Conclusion. In the Netherlands, the summer peak in DIN is a result of peaks in both NIP and DON. No significant trend in DIN was observed over the years of the study, and variations in DIN between locations were mostly a result of the variation in DON. There were considerable differences in acarological risk between areas in terms of infection prevalence and densities of ticks as well as in Borrelia genospecies composition.

Methods: The authors conducted a single-center randomized double-masked placebo-controlled trial on 55 patients with Lyme disease with persistent severe fatigue at least 6 or more months after antibiotic therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 28 days of IV ceftriaxone or placebo. The primary clinical outcomes were improvement in fatigue, defined by a change of 0.7 points or more on an 11-item fatigue questionnaire, and improvement in cognitive function (mental speed), defined by a change of 25% or more on a test of reaction time. The primary laboratory outcome was an experimental measure of CSF infection, outer surface protein A (OspA). Outcome data were collected at the 6-month visit. Results: Patients assigned to ceftriaxone showed improvement in disabling fatigue compared to the placebo group (rate ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.50 to 8.03; p = 0.001). No beneficial treatment effect was observed for cognitive function or the laboratory measure of persistent infection. Four patients, three of whom were on placebo, had adverse events associated with treatment, which required hospitalization. Conclusions: Ceftriaxone therapy in patients with PLS with severe fatigue was associated with an improvement in fatigue but not with cognitive function or an experimental laboratory measure of infection in this study. Because fatigue (a nonspecific symptom) was the only outcome that improved and because treatment was associated with adverse events, this study does not support the use of additional antibiotic therapy with parenteral ceftriaxone in post-treatment, persistently fatigued patients with PLS.",1714,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Assessments were made at 90 and 180 days after treatment. Symptom severity was measured from the cognitive functioning, pain, and role functioning scales of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS). Memory, attention, and executive functioning were assessed using objective tests. Mood was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Results : There were no significant baseline differences between seropositive and seronegative groups. Both groups reported a high frequency of MOS symptoms, depression, and somatic complaints but had normal baseline neuropsychological test scores. The combined groups showed significant decreases in MOS symptoms, higher objective test scores, and improved mood between baseline and 90 days. However, there were no significant differences between those receiving antibiotics and placebo. Conclusion : Patients with post-treatment chronic Lyme disease who have symptoms but show no evidence of persisting Borrelia infection do not show objective evidence of cognitive impairment. Additional antibiotic therapy was not more beneficial than administering placebo.",1920,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Background: No consensual criteria exist to diagnose neuroborreliosis. The intrathecal anti- Borrelia antibody index (AI) is a necessary criterion to diagnose neuroborreliosis in Europe, but not in the United States. Previous studies to determine the diagnostic value of the AI found a sensitivity ranging from 55% to 80%. However, these studies included only typical clinical cases of meningitis or meningoradiculitis, and none had a control group with CSF anti- Borrelia antibodies. Methods: We studied a sample of 123 consecutive patients with clinical signs of neurologic involvement and CSF anti- Borrelia antibodies. We determined the AI for all patients and a final diagnosis was made. Patients were then divided into three groups (neuroborreliosis, possible neuroborreliosis, control). Results: Thirty of the 40 patients with neuroborreliosis had a positive AI (AI sensitivity = 75%). Two of the 74 patients with another neurologic diagnosis had a positive AI (AI specificity = 97%). Conclusion: The antibody index has a very good specificity but only moderate sensitivity. Given the lack of consensual criteria for neuroborreliosis and the absence of a “gold standard” diagnostic test, we propose pragmatic diagnostic criteria for neuroborreliosis, namely the presence of four of the following five items: no past history of neuroborreliosis, positive CSF ELISA serology, positive anti- Borrelia antibody index, favorable outcome after specific antibiotic treatment, and no differential diagnosis. These new criteria will need to be tested in a larger, prospective cohort.",1591,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

A cerebral MRI was normal, and no antineuronal antibodies were found (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri). Despite negative serum antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi , acute neuroborreliosis was suspected because of lymphocytic mild meningitis (19 white cells/mm 3 , protein 0.79 g/L) and apparent intrathecal synthesis of B burgdorferi IgM antibodies (ELISA titers 6.17, normal <0.3), although false-positive IgM serologies can occur in this setting. Intravenous ceftriaxone treatment resulted in dramatic clinical improvement within a few weeks.

This bacterium is a spirochete which discovery is relatively recent. Lyme borreliosis is the most prevalent tick-borne disease in the North hemisphere. This systemic disease whose related symptoms include cutaneous manifestations (mainly erythema migrans) and/or neurological (neuroborreliosis) and/or articular (Lyme arthritis). The clinical picture of Lyme borreliosis is well defined. The clinical expression of the disease can occur early after the tick bite, or weeks, months or even years after the bite. The diagnosis of this pathology is based on clinical evidence supported by biological tests. Borrelia serology plays a pivotal role in the biological diagnosis of this pathology. It is based on a two-tiered testing algorithm (EIA then immuno-blot). This serology must be interpreted according to the clinical symptoms of the patient. It should not be used for the diagnosis of erythema migrans. Its sensitivity increases with the evolution of the disease; it is close to 100% for late forms. The direct diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis support the clinical diagnosis of most of the clinical manifestations and is based on molecular biology methods.

To investigate this, 34 Lyme disease sera and 34 sera from patients with other illnesses who had presented to a primary-care facility located in an area of borreliosis endemicity were tested by the BAT and Western blotting (WB). The BAT was more sensitive (79% versus 65%; P = 0.090), especially in cases in which patients had a single erythema migrans lesion ( P = 0.021). In addition, the potentially cross-reactive sera were negative by the BAT but WB yielded three (9%) false-positive results. The results from 104 sera from possible Lyme disease patients demonstrated the clinical usefulness of the more sensitive and specific BAT. The BAT was positive for 40 (38%) sera from patients with Lyme disease-related symptoms and appropriate clinical and epidemiological findings. WB confirmed Lyme disease in 30 (75%) of the 40 BAT-positive patients but failed to detect B. burgdorferi infection in 10 BAT-positive patients.

Results indicated that assays based on the C 6 peptide were nonreactive to sera from vaccinated nonexposed animals. The purpose of the present study was to confirm these results in a controlled trial by testing sera from experimentally vaccinated dogs known to be uninfected. Nine specific-pathogen-free beagles were assigned to one of three vaccine groups, each containing three dogs. Each group received one of three commercial Lyme vaccines: RECOMBITEK Lyme (Merial), LymeVax (Fort Dodge Animal Health), and Galaxy Lyme (Schering-Plough Animal Health). Each animal was administered a total of five doses of vaccine over a period of 39 weeks. Serum samples were collected prior to vaccination and then on a weekly basis from weeks 3 to 18 and from weeks 33 to 43. Selected samples were tested by the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the Western blot (WB) assay using whole-cell B. burgdorferi antigen extracts, and the results were compared to those obtained with two immunoenzyme-based procedures formatted by using the C 6 peptide.

In the present study, a standardized protocol spiking urine from healthy donors with a defined amount of whole Borrelia or Borrelia DNA was established. The development of a nested real-time PCR targeting ospA enabled a highly sensitive and quantitative analysis of these samples. We show the following. (i) Storage of spiked urine samples for up to 6 months at −20°C had no negative effect on spike recovery. (ii) Centrifugation of 10 ml of urine at 40,000 × g for 30 min resulted in a concentration of both spikes, i.e., whole Borrelia and DNA. (iii) The inhibition of DNA spike recovery in 48% (11 of 23 samples) of urine samples tested could be attributed to nuclease activity. This was abrogated by alkalizing the urine or by working with the samples on ice. Despite optimized conditions, analysis of urine samples of 12 patients with erythema migrans, the clinical stage considered to be associated with the highest bacterial load, revealed a positive result in only one sample.

In this study, we show the immunodominant epitope is located in the highly conserved region within the seven C-terminal amino acids.

Moreover, borreliacidal OspC antibodies were not induced in laboratory mice or hamsters despite heavy infections with B. burgdorferi spirochetes. These findings confirm that borreliacidal antibodies comprise the majority of the IgM and IgG OspC antibody response in human Lyme disease and that the epitope is located in the highly conserved C terminus.

Differences in the sensitivities of serologic assays for the detection of these antibodies, however, may not be the only or even the primary explanation for this observation. We investigated the impacts of four clinical variables on seropositivity—the duration of erythema migrans, the presence of single versus multiple skin lesions, and the gender and age of the patient. In this analysis, three different serologic tests were performed on acute-phase sera from 175 untreated patients with culture-confirmed erythema migrans: the C6 single-peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a commercially available ELISA in which a whole-cell sonicate of B. burgdorferi was the antigen, and a two-tier procedure. Irrespective of the serologic test performed, the results showed that seropositivity rates increased with the duration of the erythema migrans for patients with single lesions ( P < 0.001) but not for those with multiple skin lesions. The variability in seropositivity rates was greatest for the two-tier testing strategy, with a >6-fold-higher rate of seropositivity among patients with a single lesion of 22- to 30-day duration than among those whose skin lesion was of 1- to 7-day duration (85.7 versus 14.1%; P < 0.001). Rates of seropositivity by each of the testing methods were also significantly higher for patients with multiple skin lesions than for those with single lesions ( P < 0.001). In contrast, seropositivity rates were not affected by either the gender or the age of the patient. Thus, in patients with erythema migrans, certain clinical variables such as the duration and number of skin lesions had a profound impact on seropositivity rates, irrespective of the serologic assay performed.",1896,0,0,1,0,it,en,

In the present study, we evaluated luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPSs) for use for profiling of the antibody responses to a panel of B. burgdorferi proteins for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Initially, serum samples from a cohort of patients and controls ( n = 46) were used for training and were profiled by the use of 15 different B. burgdorferi antigen constructs. For the patient sera, the antibody responses to several B. burgdorferi antigens, including VlsE, flagellin (FlaB), BmpA, DbpA, and DbpB, indicated that the antigens had high levels of immunoreactivity. However, the best diagnostic performance was achieved with a synthetic protein, designated VOVO, consisting of a repeated antigenic peptide sequence, VlsE-OspC-VlsE-OspC, Analysis of an independent set of serum samples ( n = 139) used for validation showed that the VOVO LIPS test had 98% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 93% to 100%; P < 0.0001) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 94% to 100%; P < 0.0001).

Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the rates of detection of Lyme disease by the LIPS test and the C6 ELISA were not statistically different. However, the VOVO LIPS test displayed a wide dynamic range of antibody detection spanning over 10,000-fold without the need for serum dilution.

The anti-IL-17 antibody-treated mice lacked the extensive tissue damage, such as bone and cartilage erosion, that occurred in the tibiotarsal joints of untreated Borrelia -vaccinated and -infected control mice. We hypothesized that IL-35 would reduce the severity of arthritis by suppressing the production of IL-17 in Borrelia -vaccinated and -infected mice.

We show that a select combination of amino-terminal peptides significantly enhanced BBK07-based diagnostic accuracy compared to that with the full-length protein. Although in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) studies BBK07 peptides had overall lower sensitivity than established serodiagnostic peptides, such as the VlsE peptide C6 and OspC peptide pepC10, for the detection of early human LD, a subset of serum samples that failed to recognize either VlsE or OspC peptides were preferentially reactive to BBK07 peptides. These results highlight the fact that BBK07 peptides could be useful to complement the efficacy of VlsE and OspC peptide-based serodiagnostic assays. Finally, using a panel of canine sera, we show that BBK07 peptide is also effective for LD diagnosis in infected dogs. Together, our data show that peptides from the B. burgdorferi surface protein BBK07 are highly specific and sensitive serodiagnostic markers, and we suggest their future use in LD diagnostic assays.",1744,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Due to its universal distribution among B. burgdorferi sensu lato strains and high antigenicity, it is being explored for the development of a next-generation Lyme disease vaccine. An understanding of the surface presentation of OspC will facilitate efforts to maximize its potential as a vaccine candidate. OspC forms homodimers at the cell surface, and it has been hypothesized that it may also form oligomeric arrays. Here, we employ site-directed mutagenesis to test the hypothesis that interdimeric disulfide bonds at cysteine 130 (C130) mediate oligomerization. B. burgdorferi B31 ospC was replaced with a C130A substitution mutant to yield strain B31:: ospC ( C130A ). Recombinant protein was also generated. Disulfide-bond-dependent oligomer formation was demonstrated and determined to be dependent on C130. Oligomerization was not required for in vivo function, as B31:: ospC ( C130A ) retained infectivity and disseminated normally. The total IgG response and the induced isotype pattern were similar between mice infected with untransformed B31 and those infected with the B31:: ospC ( C130A ) strain. These data indicate that the immune response to OspC is not significantly altered by formation of OspC oligomers, a finding that has significant implications in Lyme disease vaccine design.",1418,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Western blot accuracy is limited by subjective interpretation of weakly positive bands, false-positive IgM immunoblots, and low sensitivity for detection of early disease. We developed an objective alternative second-tier immunoassay using a multiplex microsphere system that measures VlsE1-IgG and pepC10-IgM antibodies simultaneously in the same sample. Our study population comprised 79 patients with early acute Lyme disease, 82 patients with early-convalescent-phase disease, 47 patients with stage II and III disease, 34 patients post-antibiotic treatment, and 794 controls. A bioinformatic technique called partial receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) regression was used to combine individual antibody levels into a single diagnostic score with a single cutoff; this technique enhances test performance when a high specificity is required (e.g., ≥95%). Compared to Western blotting, the multiplex assay was equally specific (95.6%) but 20.7% more sensitive for early-convalescent-phase disease (89.0% versus 68.3%, respectively; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] for difference, 12.1% to 30.9%) and 12.5% more sensitive overall (75.0% versus 62.5%, respectively; 95% CI for difference, 8.1% to 17.1%).

Secondary objectives included assessing the prior duration and responsiveness of associated antibiotic therapy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 11 patients referred to an academic medical center infectious disease clinic during the years 2007 to 2009 with a diagnosis of Lyme disease based upon previously obtained synovial fluid B. burgdorferi immunoblot testing. Ten of the 11 (91%) patients with a diagnosis of late-onset Lyme arthritis based upon interpretation of synovial fluid B. burgdorferi immunoblot testing were seronegative and did not satisfy published criteria for the diagnosis of late-onset Lyme arthritis. None of the 10 patients had a clinical response to previously received antibiotics despite an average course of 72 days. Diagnosis of Lyme arthritis should not be based on synovial fluid B. burgdorferi immunoblot testing.

Mice infected with B. burgdorferi mounted a rapid IgM response to RevA, followed by a strong IgG response that generally remained elevated for more than 12 months, suggesting continued exposure of RevA protein to the immune system. RevA antibodies were bactericidal in vitro . To evaluate the RevA antigen as a potential vaccine, mice were vaccinated with recombinant RevA and challenged with B. burgdorferi by inoculation with a needle or by a tick bite. Cultured tissues from all treatment groups were positive for B. burgdorferi . Vaccinated animals also appeared to have similar levels of B. burgdorferi DNA compared to nonvaccinated controls.

We analyzed antibody responses during the first 3 months after the experimental infection of dogs using a novel multiplex assay. Results were compared to those obtained with two commercial assays detecting C6 antigen. Multiplex analysis identified antibodies to OspC and C6 as early as 3 weeks postinfection (p.i.) and those to OspF by 5 weeks p.i. Antibodies to C6 and OspF increased throughout the study, while antibodies to OspC peaked between 7 and 11 weeks p.i. and declined thereafter. A short-term antibody response to OspA was observed in 3/8 experimentally infected dogs on day 21 p.i. Quant C6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results matched multiplex results during the first 7 weeks p.i.; however, antibody levels subsequently declined by up to 29%. Immune responses then were analyzed in sera from 125 client-owned dogs and revealed high agreement between antibodies to OspF and C6 as robust markers for infection. Results from canine patient sera supported that OspC is an early infection marker and antibodies to OspC decline over time. The onset and decline of antibody responses to B. burgdorferi Osp antigens and C6 reflect their differential expression during infection.

Use of magnetic beads coated with intact spirochetes provided effective antigen presentation and allowed detection of host-generated antibodies in experimentally infected mice at day 11 postinoculation, whereas host-generated antibodies were detected at day 14 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and day 21 by immunoblotting. Furthermore, magnetic beads coated with recombinant B. burgdorferi in vivo -expressed antigen OspC or BmpA demonstrated positive detection of host-generated antibodies in mice at day 7 postinoculation with markedly increased iPCR signals above the background, with the quantification cycle ( C q ) value for each sample minus the mean background C q plus 3 standard deviations (Δ C q ) being 4 to 10, whereas Δ C q was 2.5 for intact spirochete-coated beads. iPCR demonstrated a strong correlation (Spearman rank correlation = 0.895, P < 0.0001) with a commercial ELISA for detection of host antibodies in human Lyme disease patient sera using the B. burgdorferi VlsE C6 peptide. In addition, iPCR showed potential applicability for direct detection of spirochetes in blood.

Ten years after the discovery of spirochaetes as agents of Lyme disease in 1982 in the USA, three genomic species had diverged from the phenotypically heterogeneous strains of Borrelia burgdorferi isolated in North America and Europe: Borrelia afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (further B. burgdorferi ), and Borrelia garinii. Whereas B. burgdorferi remained the only human pathogen in North America, all three species are aetiological agents of Lyme borreliosis in Europe. Another seven genospecies were described in the 1990s, including species from Asia ( Borrelia japonica, Borrelia turdi , and B. tanukii ), North America ( Borrelia andersonii ), Europe ( Borrelia lusitaniae and Borrelia valaisiana ), and from Europe and Asia ( Borrelia bissettii). Another eight species were delineated in the years up to 2010: Borrelia sinica (Asia), Borrelia spielmanii (Europe), Borrelia yangtze (Asia), Borrelia californiensis, Borrelia americana, Borrelia carolinensis (North America), Borrelia bavariensis (Europe), and Borrelia kurtenbachii (North America). Of these 18 genomic species B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi and B. garinii are the confirmed agents of localized, disseminated and chronic manifestations of Lyme borreliosis, whereas B. spielmanii has been detected in early skin disease, and B. bissettii and B. valaisiana have been detected in specimens from single cases of Lyme borreliosis. The clinical role of B. lusitaniae remains to be substantiated.",1472,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme disease is currently the most frequently reported vector-borne illness in the United States, accounting for more than 95% of such cases. The purpose of this report is to provide recommendations for preventing Lyme disease, including the use of Lyme disease vaccine. Individuals can reduce their risk of Lyme disease by avoiding tick-infested habitats when in endemic areas. If exposure to tick-infested habitats cannot be avoided, individuals may reduce their risk of infection by using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and regularly checking for and removing attached ticks. Morbidity from Lyme disease can be reduced significantly by detecting and treating the infection in its early stages; early and appropriate treatment almost always results in a prompt and uncomplicated cure. A Lyme disease vaccine (LYMErix, SmithKline Beecham, Collegeville, PA) was licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration on December 21, 1998, for persons 15 to 70 years of age. This vaccine seems to be safe and effective, but whether its use is cost-effective has yet to be clearly established. Use of this vaccine causes false-positive enzyme immunoassay results for Lyme disease. Lyme disease can be diagnosed in vaccinated persons by immunoblot testing. Decisions about the use of this vaccine should be based on an assessment of a person's risk as determined by activities and behaviors relating to tick exposure in endemic areas. This vaccine should be considered an adjunct to, not a replacement for, the practice of personal protective measures against tick exposure and the early diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease.",1638,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

Involvement of the optic nerve, either because of inflammation or increased intracranial pressure, is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. Of the 4 children reported here with optic nerve abnormalities, 2 had decreased vision months after disease onset attributable to optic neuritis, and 1 had headache and diplopia early in the infection because of increased intracranial pressure associated with Lyme meningitis. In these 3 children, optic nerve involvement responded well to intravenous ceftriaxone therapy. The fourth child had headache and visual loss attributable to increased intracranial pressure and perhaps also to optic neuritis. Despite treatment with ceftriaxone and steroids, he had persistent increased intracranial pressure leading to permanent bilateral blindness. Clinicians should be aware that neuro-ophthalmologic involvement of Lyme disease may have significant consequences. If increased intracranial pressure persists despite antibiotic therapy, measures must be taken quickly to reduce the pressure.",1036,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

Because of toxicity, doxycycline is usually avoided in children. For children who are unable to tolerate amoxicillin, there is currently no proven alternative oral therapy for LD. This randomized, unblinded study compared 2 dosage regimens of cefuroxime axetil (20 mg/kg/d and 30 mg/kg/d) with amoxicillin (50 mg/kg/d), each given for 20 days. Children were enrolled if they were 6 months to 12 years of age, had erythema migrans, and met other eligibility requirements. Serologic testing occurred at entry and after 6 months. Follow-up evaluations for safety, tolerability, and efficacy occurred at 10 and 20 days, 6 months, and 1 year. Forty-three children were randomized (13 in the amoxicillin group, 15 in each cefuroxime axetil group); 39 completed 12 months of follow-up. At the completion of treatment, there was total resolution of erythema migrans in 67% of the amoxicillin group, 92% of the low-dose cefuroxime group, and 87% of the high-dose cefuroxime group, and resolution of constitutional symptoms occurred in 100%, 69%, and 87%, respectively. All patients had a good outcome, with no long-term problems associated with LD. One patient, who was well at the first 2 follow-up visits, was treated with doxycycline because of new constitutional symptoms. Mild diarrhea occurred in a small number of participants in each group (1 patient was diagnosed and treated for Clostridium difficile -associated diarrhea, which occurred after completing the full course of study medication). No hypersensitivity reactions occurred. The number of patients in this trial was not sufficient to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the 3 groups; however, both amoxicillin and cefuroxime axetil seem to be safe, efficacious treatments for children with early LD.",1907,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

The US Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is a passive reporting system to which anyone can report an event. Publicity related to potential adverse events may change reporting patterns. The objective of this paper is to show how litigation-related reports have influenced the trends in possible adverse event reports to VAERS. METHODS. The VAERS public-use data files were downloaded in July 2004 and translated into identical SAS data sets for analysis. Cases that were related to litigation were identified using a word search algorithm. All cases for the most frequently reported symptoms in litigation (overdose, neuropathy, autism, “mental retardation,” arthralgia, and “speech disorder”) were reviewed. RESULTS. In recent years, most case reports to VAERS that were related to overdose, neuropathy, and thimerosal were related to litigation. Many cases that were related to autism and mental retardation were as well. CONCLUSIONS. This review shows a previously undisclosed rise in the number of reports to the VAERS related to pending litigation for vaccine injury. The implications of this for understanding longitudinal reporting patterns are discussed.",1195,0,0,0,1,ca,en,

This distinction is clinically important because pathogen-specific diagnostic test results are not available immediately and only patients with Lyme meningitis require parenteral antibiotic therapy. Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify clinical and laboratory features that might help clinicians distinguish patients with Lyme meningitis from those with enteroviral meningitis. Methods: This cross-sectional study compared patients diagnosed with Lyme or enteroviral meningitis evaluated at a large children's hospital between January 1, 1999 and September 20, 2002. Results: Twenty-four patients with Lyme meningitis and 151 patients with enteroviral meningitis had median ages of 10.5 and 5.5 years, respectively ( P < 0.0001). There was an equal proportion of boys with Lyme (63%) and enteroviral meningitis (62%; P = 1.0). The duration of symptoms before evaluation was longer for patients with Lyme meningitis (12 days) than with enteroviral meningitis (1 day; P < 0.0001). Cranial neuropathy was a presenting feature in 71% of children with Lyme meningitis. Cranial neuropathy, erythema migrans rash or papilledema occurred in 88% of patients with Lyme meningitis; no patients with enteroviral meningitis exhibited any of these findings ( P < 0.0001). Lyme meningitis was unlikely when cerebrospinal fluid neutrophils exceeded 10% (negative predictive value, 99%). Conclusions: We identified several clinical and laboratory features that may permit early differentiation of Lyme from enteroviral meningitis. These results may assist clinicians with decisions regarding additional testing and empiric antibiotic therapy.",1790,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Results: Of 108 patients with meningitis who qualified for the study, 20 patients met criteria for Lyme meningitis and 88 were classified as aseptic meningitis . Positive Lyme CSF-PCR was found in 1 patient (1 of 20, 5%) with Lyme meningitis and one patient classified as aseptic meningitis (1 of 88, 1%). Lyme CSF-PCR had a sensitivity of 5% and a specificity of 99%. The only Lyme meningitis patient with positive Lyme CSF-PCR had the highest CSF white blood cell count and CSF protein values compared with the other Lyme meningitis patients. Conclusions: This is the first study to evaluate Lyme CSF-PCR exclusively in North American children. This commercially available laboratory test is not generally helpful for identifying Lyme meningitis because of its low sensitivity.",1686,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lymphocyte transformation tests (LTTs) have been applied to detect specific cellular immune reactivity, but their clinical application has been severely hampered by the poorly defined Borrelia antigens and nonstandardized LTT formats used. In this study, we describe the development and clinical relevance of a novel LTT using a validated format (MELISA®) together with well-defined recombinant Borrelia -specific antigens. From an initial screening of 244 patients with suspected Borrelia infection or disease, 4 informative recombinant antigens were selected: OspC ( Borrelia afzelii ), p41-1 ( Borrelia garinii ), p41-2 ( B. afzelii ), and p100 ( B. afzelii ). Thereafter, 30 seronegative healthy controls were tested in LTT-MELISA® to determine specificity, 68 patients were tested in parallel to determine reproducibility, and 54 lymphocyte-reactive symptomatic patients were tested before and after antibiotic therapy to assess clinical relevance. Most (86.2%) of the 36.9% (90/244) LTT-MELISA® positive patients were seropositive and showed symptoms of active LB. Specificity was 96.7% and reproducibility 92.6%. After therapy, most patients (90.7%) showed negative or markedly reduced lymphocyte reactivity correlating with clinical improvement. This novel LTT-MELISA® assay appears to correlate with active LB and may have diagnostic relevance in confirming LB in clinically and serologically ambiguous cases.",1583,0,0,1,0,en,en,

We developed a streptavidin-modified biochip-based immunodiagnosis and compared it with conventional methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot (WB). The diagnostic sensitivity of the coated biochips was demonstrated to be identical, and the results of conventional assays such as ELISA and WB were confirmed. Flagellar antigens lead to better diagnosis because of a higher discriminative value. By contrast, OspC8, a peptide derived from the outer surface antigen, is less sensitive to identify immunity in LB. The inferior antigenicity of OspC8 may be due to epitope masking. Overall, this system is open to simultaneously analyze a larger family of peptides differing in length. Thus, an array approach is generally more advantageous to extend the pattern of antigens to be tested for antigenicity in LB. Serial analysis during ongoing disease may be valuable to learn more about the course of the disease and intermittent reactivation of infection.

With a prospective study design we wanted to characterize children with signs and symptoms indicative for NB, investigate clinical outcome and, if possible, identify factors of importance for recovery. Material/Methods: Children being evaluated for NB (n = 177) in southeast Sweden were categorized into 3 groups: “confirmed neuroborreliosis” (41%) with Borrelia antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid, “possible neuroborreliosis” (26%) with pleocytosis but no Borrelia antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid, and “not determined” (33%) with no pleocytosis and no Borrelia antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid. Antibiotic treatment was given to 69% of children. Patients were followed during 6 months and compared with a matched control group (n = 174). Results: Clinical recovery at the 6-month follow-up (n = 177) was generally good and no patient was found to have recurrent or progressive neurologic symptoms. However, persistent facial nerve palsy caused dysfunctional and cosmetic problems in 11% of patients. Persistent nonspecific symptoms, such as headache and fatigue, were not more frequently reported in patients than in controls. Influence on daily life was reported to the same extent in patients and controls. Consequently, persistent headache and fatigue at follow-up should not be considered as attributable to NB. No prognostic factors could be identified. Conclusions: Clinical recovery was satisfactory in children being evaluated for NB although persistent symptoms from facial nerve palsy occurred.

We hereby investigate 4 new recombinant or peptide Borrelia antigens in cerebrospinal fluid in children with neuroborreliosis to evaluate their performance as diagnostic antigens. Methods: An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect IgG antibodies to recombinant decorin binding protein A (DbpA), BBK32, outer surface protein C (OspC), and the invariable region 6 peptide (IR6). The recombinant antigens originated from 3 pathogenic subspecies; Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii, and Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Cerebrospinal fluid and serum from children with clinical features indicative for neuroborreliosis (n = 57) were analyzed. Classification of patients was based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. Controls were children with other neurologic diseases (n = 20) and adult patients with no proven infection (n = 16). Results: Sensitivity for DbpA was 82%, for BBK32 70%, for OspC 58% and for IR6 70%. Specificities were 94%, 100%, 97%, and 97%, respectively. No single antigen was superior. When new antigens were combined in a panel, sensitivity was 80% and specificity 100%. The reference flagella antigen showed a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 100%. Over all, the B. garinii related antigens dominated. Conclusions: Recombinant DbpA and BBK32 as well as the peptide antigen IR6 perform well in laboratory diagnostics of neuroborreliosis in children. New antigens seem to improve diagnostic performance when compared with the routine flagella antigen. If different antigens are combined in a panel to cover the antigenic diversity, sensitivity improves further and a specificity of 100% can be achieve.",1732,0,0,1,0,en,en,

No similar model has ever been proposed for European patients. The objective of our study was to develop a prediction model to differentiate LM from NLAM based on clinical and CSF biologic data. Methods: The medical charts of all children older than 2 years of age admitted to our hospital from 1996 through 2006 with a definite diagnosis of LM were analyzed and compared retrospectively with those having a diagnosis of NLAM. Chart review included the duration of symptoms, the presence of cranial neuropathy, and CSF analysis. Results: A total of 93 patients were included (LM: 26 patients; NLAM: 67 patients) in the study. Patients with LM had statistically more frequent cranial neuropathy (73% vs. 4%), displayed a longer duration of symptoms before admission (8.8 vs. 1.8 days), had a higher CSF protein (71 vs. 38 mg/d), and had a lower percentage of neutrophil cells in the CSF (3.4% vs. 51%) than patients with NLAM. A predicted probability was derived from these 4 variables. At a cutoff point of >0.432, the model had a negative predictive value of 100% and a positive predictive value of 92.3%, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 97%. Conclusions: We report the first European prediction model for LM.

LD manifests itself as a multisystem inflammatory disease that affects the skin in its early localized stage and spreads to the joints, nervous system, heart, and, to a lesser extent, other organ systems in its later disseminated stages. If diagnosed and treated early with appropriate antibiotics, LD is almost always readily cured. Developing a highly sensitive and specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay could be very useful in improving the diagnostic accuracy and decreasing turnaround time for results. We report the development of a LightCycler TaqMan assay targeting the OspA gene for clinical detection of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in various types of biologic samples. This assay was validated by testing a variety of clinical samples including cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, skin biopsies, and blood and culture isolates from skin biopsies. The TaqMan testing results were 100% concordant with previously reported results. Reference strains representing isolates from other geographic regions were also successfully amplified. The developed assay is robust, is highly sensitive and specific for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, and is suitable for clinical detection of the bacterium in biologic samples.",1337,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The aim of this study was to investigate long-term (>1 year) consequences of pediatric TBE and NB as well as the value of markers for brain damage and genetic susceptibility. Methods: From a previous prospective study, children diagnosed with TBE (n = 8) and NB (n = 12) as well as pediatric controls (n = 15) were followed up by clinical examination, semistructured interview and screening for cognitive dysfunction by the Five-to-Fifteen Questionnaire. The follow-up also included detection of serum autoantibodies against the neural proteins; glial fibrillary acidic protein and myelin basic protein, as well as genotyping of a 32 basepair deletion in the chemokine receptor type 5 gene. Results: Children diagnosed with TBE displayed significantly more long-term subjective complaints (ie, fatigue, headache and irritability) compared with the NB and control groups. Significantly higher frequency of disabilities was also detected by the Five-to-Fifteen Questionnaire in the TBE group. Both TBE and NB cause consequences (eg, prolonged convalescence, worries and financial loss) for the families. Markers for genetic susceptibility and brain damage had no prognostic values in this cohort. Conclusions: Pediatric TBE results in long-lasting residual symptoms and neurologic deficits affecting daily life.

The aim of this study was to report the incidence and symptoms of neuroborreliosis in Swedish children. Methods: Medical records of children (< 15 years) treated for neuroborreliosis 2002–2014 were studied retrospectively. The patients were identified in the computerized registers of discharge diagnoses at the Departments of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases in Gothenburg, Borås, Trollhättan and Halmstad using International Classification of Diseases 10 diagnosis codes G51.0, G01.9 and/or A69.1. Of those, patients with symptoms compatible with neuroborreliosis and a white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid ≥ 7 cells/mm 3 with ≥ 80% mononuclear cells were included. Only children living in the city of Gothenburg and 10 surrounding municipalities were included. Results: Five hundred forty-eight children were included. The median age was 7 (1–14) years. The total incidence for the 13-year-period was 2.8/10,000 and remained unchanged during the period. The incidence was significantly higher in rural (4.0/10,000) than in urban municipalities (2.1/10,000). The most common presenting symptoms were headache (n = 335), fatigue (n = 330) and cranial nerve palsies (n = 329). The median duration of symptoms before admittance was 4.0 days for facial palsy and 14.0 days for other symptoms ( P < 0.001).

Climatic variability acts directly on tick population dynamics and indirectly on human exposure to Lyme borreliosis spirochetes. In this study, conducted in primary healthcare clinics in southeastern Sweden, electronic patient records from 1997–2003 were searched for those that fulfilled the criteria for erythema migrans. Using a multilevel Poisson regression model, the influence of various climatic factors on the summer-season variations in the incidence of erythema migrans were studied. The mean annual incidence rate was 464 cases of erythema migrans per 100,000 inhabitants. The incidence was significantly higher in women than in men, 505 and 423 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively ( p <0.001). The summer-season variations in the erythema migrans incidence rate correlated with the monthly mean summer temperatures (incidence rate ratio 1.12; p <0.001), the number of winter days with temperatures below 0°C (incidence rate ratio 0.97; p <0.001), the monthly mean summer precipitation (incidence rate ratio 0.92; p <0.05), and the number of summer days with relative humidity above 86% (incidence rate ratio 1.04; p <0.05). In conclusion, Lyme borreliosis is highly endemic in southeastern Sweden.

We also wanted to explore whether early markers, such as CXCL13 in CSF and/or total IgM index could be useful as complementary diagnostic tools. Children being evaluated for LNB in a Swedish Lyme endemic area were included in the study ( n = 146). Serum and CSF were collected on admission. Patients with other specific diagnoses were controls ( n = 15). The recomBead Borrelia AI assay and the recomBead CXCL13 assay (Mikrogen) were applied together with total IgM index. The overall sensitivity for recomBead Borrelia AI (IgM and IgG together) was 74% and the specificity was 97%. However, the highest sensitivity (91%) at an acceptable level of specificity (90%) was obtained by recomBead Borrelia AI together with CXCL13 and total IgM index, showing a positive predictive value of 84% and a negative predictive value of 95%. Thus, the recomBead Borrelia AI assay performs with moderate sensitivity and high specificity in paediatric LNB patients.

This retrospective study included healthy individuals, patients with active Lyme neuroborreliosis and patients treated for Lyme neuroborreliosis. Two ELISAs were compared: the C6 ELISA and the SERION ELISA. Equivocal and positive results were confirmed by immunoblot. We included 174 healthy individuals, of whom 27 (15.5%) were treated for Lyme borreliosis in the past, 36 patients were treated for Lyme neuroborreliosis and 27 patients had active Lyme neuroborreliosis. All the active Lyme neuroborreliosis patients were reactive in both ELISAs (100% sensitivity); less reactivity was seen in the other three groups (range 17.7% to 69.4%). The concordance between the ELISA results was high in active Lyme neuroborreliosis patients (26/27; 96.3%) and healthy individuals (131/147; 89.1%), but lower in treated healthy individuals (18/27; 66.7%) and treated Lyme neuroborreliosis patients (18/36; 50.0%) ( p ≤ 0.005).

However, children often present with early LNB, and antibody production in the CSF may not be demonstrated. Recent studies have suggested the chemokine CXCL13 to be an early marker for LNB. The aim of the study was to evaluate CXCL13 for laboratory diagnosis in pediatric LNB patients and to evaluate the association with pleocytosis in CSF, clinical features, and recovery. CSF samples were collected from LNB patients, classified as definite LNB ( n = 44) or possible LNB ( n = 22), and controls classified as non-LNB ( n = 102) or other specific diagnoses ( n = 23). CSF samples were analyzed with the recomBead CXCL13 assay (Mikrogen Diagnostik, Germany), cut-off 160 pg/mL. CXCL13 was significantly higher in LNB patients compared to controls ( p < 0.001). Among LNB patients, 58/66 had elevated CXCL13, and among controls, 111/125 had CXCL13 levels under cut-off (sensitivity 88%, specificity 89%). In LNB patients with pleocytosis but no detectable anti- Borrelia antibodies in CSF (possible LNB), CXCL13 was elevated in 16/22 (73%). A weak correlation between CXCL13 and pleocytosis in CSF was found in LNB patients (Rho = 0.46, p < 0.01), but no differences in CXCL13 levels in relation to specific clinical features. In conclusion, CXCL13 is elevated in CSF in children with LNB, showing acceptable sensitivity and specificity. In patients with possible LNB, CXCL13 was elevated in a majority of cases (73%) and is suggested as a complementary diagnostic tool in pediatric LNB patients.

Serum samples from 62 patients (21 erythema migrans, 33 Lyme neuroborreliosis, 8 late LB) and 91 controls (including 29 potentially cross-reacting sera) were tested. For ViraChip and recomBead, optimised interpretation criteria were developed for both IgG and IgM. The most important modification for the proposed interpretation criteria for ViraChip is the interpretation of strong (> 2.5-fold above cutoff) singular IgG reactions against VlsE as positive. This significantly improves sensitivity (32 to 85%, p < 0.0001) without significant changes in specificity (borderline reactions interpreted as negative). By application of our modified rules, specificity of ViraChip IgM is significantly increased (89 to 97%, p < 0.05; borderline results included to negatives), and sensitivities of recomBead IgG and IgM are also significantly improved (69 to 87%, p < 0.01, and 57 to 74%, p < 0.01, respectively; borderline results included to positives). Further improvement of sensitivity by the rating of strong singular IgG reactions against VlsE as positive can also be shown for recomBead. IgG/IgM result combinations must be interpreted as a function of the assumed disease stage, and the best combinations differ for the various assays. Application of our proposed interpretation criteria significantly improve the discriminatory abilities of two assays; however, this must be confirmed with other data sets.

In European endemic areas like northeast France, articular manifestations are, after neuroborreliosis, the most frequent extra-cutaneous features observed. Among the pathogenic species of Borrelia , Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto is the most frequently identified during Lyme arthritis, but others species also seem to be involved. Current knowledge and key points. – The diagnosis of Lyme arthritis is usually based on combined clinical data and serological laboratory tests. In atypical forms, detection of bacterial DNA could be useful. While mechanisms involved in acute Lyme arthritis are beginning to be better understood, the pathogenesis of chronic arthritis, which concerns about 10% of the patients, remains unknown. Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the prolonged evolution of the articular disease: a chronic persistence of Borrelia burgdorferi , which evades the host immune system within the joint and/or an autoimmune mechanism by molecular mimicry. The antibiotic therapy is codified in acute arthritis, but is not really adapted in chronic Lyme arthritis or post-Lyme syndrome. Future prospects and projects. – To prevent the disease, the vaccine available in the United States does not offer complete protection and is not useful in Europe since the species heterogeneity is important for the outer surface protein A. A better understanding of Lyme disease pathogenesis can subsequently lead to new therapeutic or preventive approaches.",1569,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

Multiple differential diagnoses have to be considered and laboratory confirmation based on various test procedures is required until now. For screening assays the immunofluorescence assay (IFA), enzyme linked immunoassay (EIA), or indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) are frequently in use. During the last ten years a stepwise diagnostic procedure in USA and Europe has been recommended. The use of a serological screening assay as the first diagnostic step, followed by a confirmatory assay only in the case of a positive or borderline result of the screening assay is now “state of the art”. The most frequently used method is a sensitive enzyme linked immunoassay followed by a sensitive and specific immunoblot technique. However, the quality of these indirect serological tests and, most importantly, the interpretation criteria of the commercial tests vary dramatically. The choice of Borrelia strains, antigen preparation, production conditions and test procedures vary widely. The immunoblot, used as a confirmatory assay, must meet the highest quality standards but in practice under routine laboratory conditions, these levels are often not reached. The major reason for this “shortcoming” is that Lyme borreliosis is not a sexually transmitted disease and no official approval has been required by the commercial suppliers so far. Another increasingly important aspect is the introduction of molecular biological assays into laboratory routines. Numerous authors published many articles about the usefulness of polymerase chain reaction as a diagnostic tool for the detection of borreliae in human specimens. However, a routine method has not yet been established. Furthermore, no standardized method for DNA isolation from different human specimens has been developed so far. For this reason PCR is not accepted as a routine method and the application should be restricted to a few laboratories with experience in the field of Lyme borreliosis. In summary, it is important to inform clinicians about the limitations of the tests used and it would be very helpful to stage a European or worldwide conference to establish accepted rules for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis.",2346,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Of the IgM ELISA-positive sera, 72% were positive using Borrelia LINE IgM. IgM antibodies against particular antigens in Borrelia LINE tests were as follows: OspC (70%), VlsE (1.8%), P39 (40%), EBV (0.6%). All sera which were positive for IgG using ELISA were also found to be positive for IgG in Borrelia LINE IgG. IgG antibodies against individual antigens using Borrelia Line tests were as follows: VlsE (100%), p39 (95%), p83 (67.5%), iv1-BBA36 (42.5%), iv2-BBO323 (72.5%), iv3-Crasp3 (50%), iv4-p4 (12.5%). Antibodies against VlsE in the IgM class undergo quick seroconversion to the IgG class (demonstrated by Borrelia LINE tests) in an ongoing infection despite a persistingly positive result for the IgM class obtained using ELISA with recombinant antigens. The presence of numerous antibodies indicates the varied immunological response against B. burgdorferi antigens.

The relationship of the incidence of these diseases to meteorological characteristics of the preceding winter was examined. Included were data from 22 meteorological stations distributed over the territory of Bohemia in areas of high TBE and LB incidence (from the database of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague). Nineteen factors characterizing the severity of winter as a whole were examined. The closest correlation (statistically not significant) was between the incidence of TBE and the frost index, followed by the minimum winter temperature during the preceding winter season. Several other comparisons revealed similar correlation coefficients slightly below the limit of significance, nevertheless, even they also support the finding that the severity of winter influences TBE incidence in the following season. The occurrence of LB correlated in similar, not fully significant manner. The most distinct results were achieved with the number of days of thaw and the number of ice days. For both diseases, the meteorological parameters indicating the severity of winter are inversely proportional.",1375,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A total of 568 samples of individual adults and 162 samples of individual (n = 48) and pooled (of 2 to 7) samples of nymphs were analysed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Spirochetes were detected in 130 adult ticks (22.9 %) and in a minimum of 32 (5.3 %) nymphs. Further identification of 153 B. burgdorferi s. l.-positive samples by nested PCR using three species-specific primers revealed the occurrence of B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii .

All three Borrelia strains grew well in both media. In the majority of the experiments the number of B. afzelii cells was higher in MKP than in BSK-II medium while for B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. a tendency for better growth in BSK-II than MKP was established. In a mixture of equivalent amounts of two species, B. burgdorferi s.s. as a rule overgrew the other two species while in the mixture of B. afzelii and B. garinii the latter was a “dominant” strain. Comparing the performance of the two media, B. burgdorferi s.s. usually overgrew either B. afzelii or B. garinii in MKP as well as in BSK-II medium, however, the results were found to be statistically significant only for MKP medium. In the mixture of B. afzelii and B. garinii the latter was the predominant species but significant differences were established only for BSK-II medium. It seems that the overgrowth is predominantly the result of the characteristics of the individual Borrelia species and most probably not a consequence of growth differences in the two culture media. Further work with a larger number of strains is needed to confirm these findings.",1650,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Broad heterogeneity in B. burgdorferi s.l. was found including all species and subtypes except for B. lusitaniae, B. bissettii, and genospecies A14S. Regional prevalence of B. burgdorferi s.l. varied between 8% and 22.5%. The most frequent species were B. garinii (45.4%) and, notably, B. burgdorferi s.s. (31.3%). I. ricinus nymphs harbored almost exclusively B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. garinii OspA type 4, while in adults a broad variety of B. burgdorferi s.l. types was found. Mixed infections were significantly more often in nymphs than in adult ticks. In all mixed infected nymphs, B. burgdorferi s.s. with OspA type 4 was present. These data strongly suggest that B. burgdorferi s.s. and B. garinii OspA type 4 are maintained in these areas by specific transmission cycles involving a so far undetermined vertebrate host which is frequently fed on by I. ricinus larvae.

Five VlsE protein IR 6 peptide variants representing sequences from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii , and B. afzelii were used as antigens in both IgG and IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Serum antibodies of 187 patients at different stages of LB from Europe and the United States were evaluated for serodiagnosis. For comparison samples were tested with one of the commercial IR 6 ELISAs. Three B. afzelii IR 6 variant peptides revealed antibodies that were concordant with each other. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto peptide antibodies mostly paralleled B. afzelii peptide antibodies, and positive values were also obtained in the majority of European sera. For several sera, B. garinii IR 6 peptide antibodies were discordant to B. afzelii peptide antibodies. The commercial IR 6 peptide antibody assay (C6 ELISA) results correlated better with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto IR 6 than with B. garinii IR 6 peptide IgG results, especially in sera from patients with facial palsy. Thus, antibody specificity to IR 6 peptides may vary according to the infecting Borrelia species. In some manifestations of the disease, C6 ELISA may not cover all LB cases.

Among potential biocontrol agents, entomopathogenic fungi, nematodes, and parasitic wasps are the most promising candidates. In first laboratory experiments, different strains of the fungi Metarhizium anisopliae (five strains), Beauveria bassiana (three strains), and Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (two strains) were tested by placing I. ricinus larvae (fed and unfed) and nymphs (fed and unfed) in Petri dishes with filter paper soaked with conidial or blastospore suspensions (2.4×10 3 to 9.6×10 6 per cm 2 ). Ticks were exposed to the different fungi for at least 35 days in the dark at temperatures of 21–24 °C. The best LT 50 values for unfed larvae (14 days) and unfed nymphs (21 days) were obtained with blastospores of M. anisopliae 97 at 1.4×10 6 per cm 2 . In order to evaluate the potential of entomopathogenic nematodes, the efficacies of three different species, Steinernema carpocapsae , S. feltiae , and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora , were investigated in the laboratory.

Our aim was to evaluate diagnostic accuracy of CSF CXCL13 in a cohort of 59 consecutive patients referred to hospital for suspected LNB. Thirty-seven patients were classified as definite LNB and used as the reference standard. Seven were classified as probable, and seven as possible LNB. Eight patients did not fulfil case definitions and were used as controls. At presentation, CSF CXCL13 was elevated in all patients with definite LNB, as compared to a positive CSF B. burgdorferi (Bb) antibody index (AI) in 33 of 37. Pre-treatment sensitivity of elevated CSF CXCL13 and positive CSF Bb AI was 100 % (95 % CI = 91–100) and 78 % (95 % CI = 75–96) respectively (p = 0.053). Among the eight control patients, CSF CXCL13 was normal in five and only slightly elevated in three, and Bb AI was negative in five. Specificity of CSF CXCL13 and Bb AI was similar 63 % (95 % CI = 31–86) (p = 1.0). CSF CXCL13 was elevated in 6/7 patients with probable LNB and 3/7 patients with possible LNB. Bb AI was negative in all these 14 patients. An additional control group consisted of 31 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 11 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases, and ten with verified non-Lyme meningitis and high CSF cell count. CSF CXCL13 was slightly elevated in 15 MS patients, and in nine meningitis patients. Mean CSF CXCL13 was higher in definite LNB (3524 ng/g CSF protein) than in MS (27 ng/g) and non-Lyme meningitis (23 ng/g) (p < 0.001). Four months post-treatment CSF CXCL13 was normalized in 82 % of patients with definite LNB, as compared to a negative Bb AI in 10 % (p < 0.001).

The risk of contracting Lyme disease (LD) can vary spatially because of spatial heterogeneity in risk factors such as social-behavior and exposure to ecological risk factors. Integrating these risk factors to inform decision-making should therefore increase the effectiveness of mitigation interventions. Objectives:. The objective of this study was to develop an integrated social-behavioral and ecological risk-mapping approach to identify priority areas for LD interventions. Methods:. The study was conducted in the Montérégie region of Southern Quebec, Canada, where LD is a newly endemic disease. Spatial variation in LD knowledge, risk perceptions, and behaviors in the population were measured using web survey data collected in 2012. These data were used as a proxy for the social-behavioral component of risk. Tick vector population densities were measured in the environment during field surveillance from 2007 to 2012 to provide an index of the ecological component of risk. Social-behavioral and ecological components of risk were combined with human population density to create integrated risk maps. Map predictions were validated by testing the association between high-risk areas and the current spatial distribution of human LD cases. Results:. Social-behavioral and ecological components of LD risk had markedly different distributions within the study region, suggesting that both factors should be considered for locally adapted interventions. The occurrence of human LD cases in a municipality was positively associated with tick density ( p < 0.01 ) but was not significantly associated with social-behavioral risk. Conclusion:. This study is an applied demonstration of how integrated social-behavioral and ecological risk maps can be created to assist decision-making. Social survey data are a valuable but underutilized source of information for understanding regional variation in LD exposure, and integrating this information into risk maps provides a novel approach for prioritizing and adapting interventions to the local characteristics of target populations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1943",2135,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Purse', 'Paula A. Harrison']",10.1289/ehp4615,2019.0,13,journal-article,"Background:. Debates over whether climate change could lead to the amplification of Lyme disease (LD) risk in the future have received much attention. Although recent large-scale disease mapping studies project an overall increase in Lyme disease risk as the climate warms, such conclusions are based on climate-driven models in which other drivers of change, such as land-use/cover and host population distribution, are less considered. Objectives:. The main objectives were to project the likely future ecological risk patterns of LD in Europe under different assumptions about future socioeconomic and climate conditions and to explore similarity and uncertainty in the projected risks. Methods:. An integrative, spatially explicit modeling study of the ecological risk patterns of LD in Europe was conducted by applying recent advances in process-based modeling of tick-borne diseases, species distribution mapping, and scenarios of land-use/cover change. We drove the model with stakeholder-driven, integrated scenarios of plausible future socioeconomic and climate change [the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSPs) combined with the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)]. Results:. The model projections suggest that future temperature increases may not always amplify LD risk: Low emissions scenarios (RCP2.6) combined with a sustainability socioeconomic scenario (SSP1) resulted in reduced LD risk. The greatest increase in risk was projected under intermediate (RCP4.5) rather than high-end (RCP8.5) climate change scenarios. Climate and land-use change were projected to have different roles in shaping the future regional dynamics of risk, with climate warming being likely to cause risk expansion in northern Europe and conversion of forest to agriculture being likely to limit risk in southern Europe. Conclusions:. Projected regional differences in LD risk resulted from mixed effects of temperature, land use, and host distributions, suggesting region-specific and cross-sectoral foci for LD risk management policy. The integrated model provides an improved explanatory tool for the system mechanisms of LD pathogen transmission and how pathogen transmission could respond to combined socioeconomic and climate changes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4615",2272,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The purpose of our study was to determine whether 1 H-MRS could detect brain metabolite alterations in patients with early Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) in normal-appearing brain tissue on the conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods. Twenty-six patients diagnosed with early LNB and twenty-six healthy volunteers as a control group have been involved in the study. All of them underwent routine MRI protocol using 3.0-T MRI scanner. 1 H-MRS examinations were performed with repetition time (TR) = 2000 ms, and echo time (TE) = 135 ms.

The annual number of days with minimum temperatures above vital bioclimatic thresholds for the tick's life-cycle dynamics were related to tick density in both the early 1980s and the mid-1990s in 20 districts in central and northern Sweden. The winters were markedly milder in all of the study areas in the 1990s as compared to the 1980s. Our results indicate that the reported northern shift in the distribution limit of ticks is related to fewer days during the winter seasons with low minimum temperatures, i.e., below -12 degrees C. At high latitudes, low winter temperatures had the clearest impact on tick distribution. Further south, a combination of mild winters (fewer days with minimum temperatures below -7 degrees C) and extended spring and autumn seasons (more days with minimum temperatures from 5 to 8 degrees C) was related to increases in tick density. We conclude that the relatively mild climate of the 1990s in Sweden is probably one of the primary reasons for the observed increase of density and geographic range of I. ricinus ticks.",1302,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Previously, cerebral vasculitis has been regarded as an extremely rare complication of neuroborreliosis. The data on the long-term outcome in patients with cerebral vasculitis due to neuroborreliosis are limited. The objective of this study was to perform a longitudinal analysis of cases of neuroborreliosis-associated cerebral vasculitis. We recruited all patients ( n = 11) diagnosed with neuroborreliosis-associated in three neurological departments in an East German region. Inclusion criteria were sudden neurological deficits, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings that conform to cerebral ischemia or brain infarction, intrathecal synthesis of borrelia-specific antibodies, and non-atherosclerotic pathology of brain supplying arteries. Vasculitic changes were detected by digital subtraction angiography, MR angiography and/or transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Outcomes were measured by the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and EuroQoL Index. Cerebral vasculitis is a rare complication of Lyme disease (0.3 % of all cases in the endemic area). Ten out of 11 patients diagnosed with neuroborreliosis-associated vasculitis cerebral vasculitis using clinical, radiological and immunological criteria developed ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attacks (TIA), 7 patients had recurrent stroke. Vasculitic alterations could be demonstrated in 8 patients that all except one developed ischemic lesions. The median mRS was 3 (range 0–4) at admission and 2 (range 0–6) at discharge. The posterior circulation was affected in 8 of 11 patients; thrombosis of the basilar artery was detected in 2 patients, one died in the acute stage.

T cells were the predominant population in the CSF with CD4+ T cells being more prevalent than CD8+ T cells. Mostly in HIV patients, and under other conditions of immunosuppression, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were significantly altered and the CD4/CD8 ratio reduced. B cells and plasmablasts could hardly be detected in non-inflammatory diseases but were consistently elevated in inflammatory diseases.

Public health has potential to serve as a frame to convey the urgency of behavior change needed to adapt to a changing climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Local governments form the backbone of climate-related public health preparedness. Yet local health agencies are often inadequately prepared and poorly integrated into climate change assessments and plans. We reviewed the climate health profiles of 16 states and two cities participating in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)’s Climate-Ready States and Cities Initiative (CRSCI) that aims to build local capacity to assess and respond to the health impacts of climate change. Following recommendations from a recent expert panel strategic review, we present illustrations of emerging promising practice and future directions. We found that CRSCI has strengthened climate preparedness and response in local public health agencies by identifying critical climate-health impacts and vulnerable populations, and has helped integrate health more fully into broader climate planning. Promising practice was found in all three recommendation areas identified by the expert panel (leveraging partnerships, refining assessment methodologies and enhancing communications), particularly with regard to health impacts of extreme heat. Vast needs remain, however, suggesting the need to disseminate CRSCI experience to non-grantees. In conclusion, the CRSCI program approach and selected activities illustrate a way forward toward robust, targeted local preparedness and response that may serve as a useful example for public health departments in the United States and internationally, particularly at a time of uncertain commitment to climate change agreements at the national level. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1838",1801,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Wagner', 'affiliation': 'Kepler Universitätsklinikum, Linz, Austria'}]",10.1007/s00415-017-8669-7,2018.0,17,Article,"Background. The C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and its receptor CXCR5 play an important role in the homing of B-lymphocytes. As a biomarker in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), CXCL13 has increasingly been used for the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis (NB). We evaluated the diagnostic and prognostic potential of CXCL13 for NB and other neuroinflammatory diseases in an unselected cohort, paying attention to those patients particularly who might benefit from newly emerging CXCL13-directed therapies. Methods. We report the CSF CXCL13 concentrations and other relevant baseline characteristics for an unselected cohort of 459 patients. We compare different diagnostic groups and analyse the sensitivity and specificity of CSF CXCL13 as a marker of NB. The course of the CXCL13 concentrations is reported in a subgroup of 19 patients. Results. We confirm the high diagnostic yield of CXCL13 for NB in this unselected cohort. The optimal cut-off for the reliable diagnosis of NB was 93.83 pg/ml, resulting in a sensitivity and specificity of 95 and 97%, respectively (positive predictive value 55.9%, negative predictive value 99.8%), surpassing the sensitivity of both serological testing and PCR. CSF CXCL13 concentration showed a swift response to therapy. Non-NB patients with high CSF CXCL13 concentrations suffered from meningeosis neoplastica or infectious encephalitis. Conclusions. CXCL13 is a valuable tool for the diagnosis and assessment of therapeutic response in NB. Furthermore, our data point towards an emerging role of CXCL13 in the diagnosis and prognosis of viral encephalitis and meningeosis neoplastica. These results are of particular interest in the light of recently developed approaches to CXCL13-directed therapeutic interventions.",1762,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

There is no consensus on a single diagnostic tool deemed as the ‘gold standard’ for distinguishing between idiopathic (Bell’s palsy) and symptomatic causes. The diagnosis is one of exclusion and most often made on physical examination. In the present study, we describe the etiological background of peripheral facial palsy in N = 509 patients and evaluate the relevance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in differential diagnosis. Methods. We carried out a retrospective data analysis of 509 patients with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral facial palsy admitted to our emergency unit between January 2006 and January 2017. All patients were seen clinically; their CSF was analyzed and MRI was performed. Results. Of N = 526 patients with isolated facial palsy, 17 patients were excluded because they did not consent to CSF analysis. Of the remaining N = 509 patients, 383 patients (75.2%) were diagnosed with idiopathic facial palsy. In the remaining 126 patients (24.8%), the following etiologies for facial palsy could be found: Ramsay-Hunt-Syndrome ( N = 34), Lyme Neuroborreliosis ( N = 32), other viral/bacterial central nervous system (CNS) infections ( N = 8), neoplasias ( N = 18), autoimmune disease ( N = 12), otogenous processes ( N = 6), or other etiologies ( N = 16). Analysis of the CSF showed 85% sensitivity for Ramsay-Hunt-Syndrome and 100% for Lyme Neuroborreliosis and other viral/bacterial CNS infections. CSF analysis proved a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying these subgroups. MRI with contrast compounds, as performed in 409 patients, was the most important tool in diagnosing neoplasias (88% sensitivity) and otogenous processes (83% sensitivity). MRI with contrast-enhancing compounds did not reveal additional information concerning inflammatory facial nerve lesions when performed the same day as hospital admission. Conclusions. Although peripheral facial palsy was predominantly idiopathic (75.3%) in our cohort, the disease was caused in approximately 25% of the patients by factors which require specific treatment. In the present study, CSF analysis proved to be the leading method for the diagnosis of Ramsay-Hunt-Syndrome, Lyme Neuroborreliosis, and other CNS infections. These subgroups made up approximately 15% of our cohort. To detect these subgroups reliably, routine use of CSF analysis in peripheral facial palsy may be advisable, whereas MRI proved to be useful for exclusion of otogenic and neoplastic processes with a sensitivity of 83% and 88%. We found that the use of MRI with contrast-enhancing compounds does not provide additional diagnostic information on the day of hospital admission.

To optimize the current diagnostic and treatment procedures for patients with bilateral vestibulopathy (BV), this study aimed to determine the complete spectrum of symptoms associated with BV. Method. A prospective mixed-method study design was used. Qualitative data were collected by performing semi-structured interviews about symptoms, context, and behavior. The interviews were recorded and transcribed until no new information was obtained. Transcriptions were analyzed in consensus by two independent researchers. In comparison to the qualitative results, quantitative data were collected using the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a health-related quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L). Results. Eighteen interviews were transcribed. Reported symptoms were divided into fourteen physical symptoms, four cognitive symptoms, and six emotions. Symptoms increased in many situations, such as darkness (100%), uneven ground (61%), cycling (94%) or driving a car (56%). These symptoms associated with BV often resulted in behavioral changes: activities were performed more slowly, with greater attention, or were avoided. The DHI showed a mean score of severe handicap (54.67). The HADS questionnaire showed on average normal results (anxiety = 7.67, depression = 6.22). The EQ-5D-5L demonstrated a mean index value of 0.680, which is lower compared to the Dutch age-adjusted reference 0.839 (60–70 years). Conclusion. BV frequently leads to physical, cognitive, and emotional complaints, which often results in a diminished quality of life. Importantly, this wide range of symptoms is currently underrated in literature and should be taken into consideration during the development of candidacy criteria and/or outcome measures for therapeutic interventions such as the vestibular implant.",1858,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Safe and effective vaccines are needed urgently. Methods Download a PDF of the Research Summary . In an ongoing multinational, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, pivotal efficacy trial, we randomly assigned persons 16 years of age or older in a 1:1 ratio to receive two doses, 21 days apart, of either placebo or the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate (30 μg per dose). BNT162b2 is a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine that encodes a prefusion stabilized, membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike protein. The primary end points were efficacy of the vaccine against laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 and safety. Results A total of 43,548 participants underwent randomization, of whom 43,448 received injections: 21,720 with BNT162b2 and 21,728 with placebo. There were 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose among participants assigned to receive BNT162b2 and 162 cases among those assigned to placebo; BNT162b2 was 95% effective in preventing Covid-19 (95% credible interval, 90.3 to 97.6). Similar vaccine efficacy (generally 90 to 100%) was observed across subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, baseline body-mass index, and the presence of coexisting conditions. Among 10 cases of severe Covid-19 with onset after the first dose, 9 occurred in placebo recipients and 1 in a BNT162b2 recipient. The safety profile of BNT162b2 was characterized by short-term, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site, fatigue, and headache. The incidence of serious adverse events was low and was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups. Conclusions A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 conferred 95% protection against Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. Safety over a median of 2 months was similar to that of other viral vaccines. (Funded by BioNTech and Pfizer; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04368728 .) Introduction QUICK TAKE Safety and Efficacy of the BNT162b2 Covid-19 Vaccine 03:00 Coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has affected tens of millions of people globally 1 since it was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. 2 Older adults, persons with certain coexisting conditions, and front-line workers are at highest risk for Covid-19 and its complications. Recent data show increasing rates of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and Covid-19 in other populations, including younger adults. 3 Safe and effective prophylactic vaccines are urgently needed to contain the pandemic, which has had devastating medical, economic, and social consequences. We previously reported phase 1 safety and immunogenicity results from clinical trials of the vaccine candidate BNT162b2, 4 a lipid nanoparticle–formulated, 5 nucleoside-modified RNA (modRNA) 6 encoding the SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike, modified by two proline mutations to lock it in the prefusion conformation. 7 Findings from studies conducted in the United States and Germany among healthy men and women showed that two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2 elicited high SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers and robust antigen-specific CD8+ and Th1-type CD4+ T-cell responses. 8 The 50% neutralizing geometric mean titers elicited by 30 μg of BNT162b2 in older and younger adults exceeded the geometric mean titer measured in a human convalescent serum panel, despite a lower neutralizing response in older adults than in younger adults. In addition, the reactogenicity profile of BNT162b2 represented mainly short-term local (i.e., injection site) and systemic responses. These findings supported progression of the BNT162b2 vaccine candidate into phase 3. Here, we report safety and efficacy findings from the phase 2/3 part of a global phase 1/2/3 trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 30 μg of BNT162b2 in preventing Covid-19 in persons 16 years of age or older. This data set and these trial results are the basis for an application for emergency use authorization. 9 Collection of phase 2/3 data on vaccine immunogenicity and the durability of the immune response to immunization is ongoing, and those data are not reported here. Methods Trial Objectives, Participants and Oversight We assessed the safety and efficacy of two 30-μg doses of BNT162b2, administered intramuscularly 21 days apart, as compared with placebo. Adults 16 years of age or older who were healthy or had stable chronic medical conditions, including but not limited to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus infection, were eligible for participation in the trial. Key exclusion criteria included a medical history of Covid-19, treatment with immunosuppressive therapy, or diagnosis with an immunocompromising condition. Pfizer was responsible for the design and conduct of the trial, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and the writing of the manuscript. BioNTech was the sponsor of the trial, manufactured the BNT162b2 clinical trial material, and contributed to the interpretation of the data and the writing of the manuscript. All the trial data were available to all the authors, who vouch for its accuracy and completeness and for adherence of the trial to the protocol, which is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. An independent data and safety monitoring board reviewed efficacy and unblinded safety data. Trial Procedures With the use of an interactive Web-based system, participants in the trial were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 30 μg of BNT162b2 (0.3 ml volume per dose) or saline placebo. Participants received two injections, 21 days apart, of either BNT162b2 or placebo, delivered in the deltoid muscle. Site staff who were responsible for safety evaluation and were unaware of group assignments observed participants for 30 minutes after vaccination for any acute reactions. Safety The primary end points of this trial were solicited, specific local or systemic adverse events and use of antipyretic or pain medication within 7 days after the receipt of each dose of vaccine or placebo, as prompted by and recorded in an electronic diary in a subset of participants (the reactogenicity subset), and unsolicited adverse events (those reported by the participants without prompts from the electronic diary) through 1 month after the second dose and unsolicited serious adverse events through 6 months after the second dose. Adverse event data through approximately 14 weeks after the second dose are included in this report. In this report, safety data are reported for all participants who provided informed consent and received at least one dose of vaccine or placebo. Per protocol, safety results for participants infected with HIV (196 patients) will be analyzed separately and are not included here. During the phase 2/3 portion of the study, a stopping rule for the theoretical concern of vaccine-enhanced disease was to be triggered if the one-sided probability of observing the same or a more unfavorable adverse severe case split (a split with a greater proportion of severe cases in vaccine recipients) was 5% or less, given the same true incidence for vaccine and placebo recipients. Alert criteria were to be triggered if this probability was less than 11%. Efficacy The first primary end point was the efficacy of BNT162b2 against confirmed Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose in participants who had been without serologic or virologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection up to 7 days after the second dose; the second primary end point was efficacy in participants with and participants without evidence of prior infection. Confirmed Covid-19 was defined according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria as the presence of at least one of the following symptoms: fever, new or increased cough, new or increased shortness of breath, chills, new or increased muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, diarrhea, or vomiting, combined with a respiratory specimen obtained during the symptomatic period or within 4 days before or after it that was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by nucleic acid amplification–based testing, either at the central laboratory or at a local testing facility (using a protocol-defined acceptable test). Major secondary end points included the efficacy of BNT162b2 against severe Covid-19. Severe Covid-19 is defined by the FDA as confirmed Covid-19 with one of the following additional features: clinical signs at rest that are indicative of severe systemic illness; respiratory failure; evidence of shock; significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction; admission to an intensive care unit; or death. Details are provided in the protocol. An explanation of the various denominator values for use in assessing the results of the trial is provided in Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix , available at NEJM.org. In brief, the safety population includes persons 16 years of age or older; a total of 43,448 participants constituted the population of enrolled persons injected with the vaccine or placebo. The main safety subset as defined by the FDA, with a median of 2 months of follow-up as of October 9, 2020, consisted of 37,706 persons, and the reactogenicity subset consisted of 8183 persons. The modified intention-to-treat (mITT) efficacy population includes all age groups 12 years of age or older (43,355 persons; 100 participants who were 12 to 15 years of age contributed to person-time years but included no cases). The number of persons who could be evaluated for efficacy 7 days after the second dose and who had no evidence of prior infection was 36,523, and the number of persons who could be evaluated 7 days after the second dose with or without evidence of prior infection was 40,137. Statistical Analysis The safety analyses included all participants who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or placebo. The findings are descriptive in nature and not based on formal statistical hypothesis testing. Safety analyses are presented as counts, percentages, and associated Clopper–Pearson 95% confidence intervals for local reactions, systemic events, and any adverse events after vaccination, according to terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 23.1, for each vaccine group. Analysis of the first primary efficacy end point included participants who received the vaccine or placebo as randomly assigned, had no evidence of infection within 7 days after the second dose, and had no major protocol deviations (the population that could be evaluated). Vaccine efficacy was estimated by 100×(1−IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed cases of Covid-19 illness per 1000 person-years of follow-up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. The 95.0% credible interval for vaccine efficacy and the probability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30% were calculated with the use of a Bayesian beta-binomial model. The final analysis uses a success boundary of 98.6% for probability of vaccine efficacy greater than 30% to compensate for the interim analysis and to control the overall type 1 error rate at 2.5%. Moreover, primary and secondary efficacy end points are evaluated sequentially to control the familywise type 1 error rate at 2.5%. Descriptive analyses (estimates of vaccine efficacy and 95% confidence intervals) are provided for key subgroups. Results Participants Figure 1. Figure 1. Enrollment and Randomization. The diagram represents all enrolled participants through November 14, 2020. The safety subset (those with a median of 2 months of follow-up, in accordance with application requirements for Emergency Use Authorization) is based on an October 9, 2020, data cut-off date. The further procedures that one participant in the placebo group declined after dose 2 (lower right corner of the diagram) were those involving collection of blood and nasal swab samples. Table 1. Table 1. Demographic Characteristics of the Participants in the Main Safety Population. Between July 27, 2020, and November 14, 2020, a total of 44,820 persons were screened, and 43,548 persons 16 years of age or older underwent randomization at 152 sites worldwide (United States, 130 sites; Argentina, 1; Brazil, 2; South Africa, 4; Germany, 6; and Turkey, 9) in the phase 2/3 portion of the trial. A total of 43,448 participants received injections: 21,720 received BNT162b2 and 21,728 received placebo ( Figure 1 ). At the data cut-off date of October 9, a total of 37,706 participants had a median of at least 2 months of safety data available after the second dose and contributed to the main safety data set. Among these 37,706 participants, 49% were female, 83% were White, 9% were Black or African American, 28% were Hispanic or Latinx, 35% were obese (body mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters] of at least 30.0), and 21% had at least one coexisting condition. The median age was 52 years, and 42% of participants were older than 55 years of age ( Table 1 and Table S2). Safety Local Reactogenicity Figure 2. Figure 2. Local and Systemic Reactions Reported within 7 Days after Injection of BNT162b2 or Placebo, According to Age Group. Data on local and systemic reactions and use of medication were collected with electronic diaries from participants in the reactogenicity subset (8,183 participants) for 7 days after each vaccination. Solicited injection-site (local) reactions are shown in Panel A. Pain at the injection site was assessed according to the following scale: mild, does not interfere with activity; moderate, interferes with activity; severe, prevents daily activity; and grade 4, emergency department visit or hospitalization. Redness and swelling were measured according to the following scale: mild, 2.0 to 5.0 cm in diameter; moderate, >5.0 to 10.0 cm in diameter; severe, >10.0 cm in diameter; and grade 4, necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis (for redness) and necrosis (for swelling). Systemic events and medication use are shown in Panel B. Fever categories are designated in the key; medication use was not graded. Additional scales were as follows: fatigue, headache, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, new or worsened joint pain (mild: does not interfere with activity; moderate: some interference with activity; or severe: prevents daily activity), vomiting (mild: 1 to 2 times in 24 hours; moderate: >2 times in 24 hours; or severe: requires intravenous hydration), and diarrhea (mild: 2 to 3 loose stools in 24 hours; moderate: 4 to 5 loose stools in 24 hours; or severe: 6 or more loose stools in 24 hours); grade 4 for all events indicated an emergency department visit or hospitalization. 𝙸 bars represent 95% confidence intervals, and numbers above the 𝙸 bars are the percentage of participants who reported the specified reaction. The reactogenicity subset included 8183 participants. Overall, BNT162b2 recipients reported more local reactions than placebo recipients. Among BNT162b2 recipients, mild-to-moderate pain at the injection site within 7 days after an injection was the most commonly reported local reaction, with less than 1% of participants across all age groups reporting severe pain ( Figure 2 ). Pain was reported less frequently among participants older than 55 years of age (71% reported pain after the first dose; 66% after the second dose) than among younger participants (83% after the first dose; 78% after the second dose). A noticeably lower percentage of participants reported injection-site redness or swelling. The proportion of participants reporting local reactions did not increase after the second dose ( Figure 2A ), and no participant reported a grade 4 local reaction. In general, local reactions were mostly mild-to-moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to 2 days. Systemic Reactogenicity Systemic events were reported more often by younger vaccine recipients (16 to 55 years of age) than by older vaccine recipients (more than 55 years of age) in the reactogenicity subset and more often after dose 2 than dose 1 ( Figure 2B ). The most commonly reported systemic events were fatigue and headache (59% and 52%, respectively, after the second dose, among younger vaccine recipients; 51% and 39% among older recipients), although fatigue and headache were also reported by many placebo recipients (23% and 24%, respectively, after the second dose, among younger vaccine recipients; 17% and 14% among older recipients). The frequency of any severe systemic event after the first dose was 0.9% or less. Severe systemic events were reported in less than 2% of vaccine recipients after either dose, except for fatigue (in 3.8%) and headache (in 2.0%) after the second dose. Fever (temperature, ≥38°C) was reported after the second dose by 16% of younger vaccine recipients and by 11% of older recipients. Only 0.2% of vaccine recipients and 0.1% of placebo recipients reported fever (temperature, 38.9 to 40°C) after the first dose, as compared with 0.8% and 0.1%, respectively, after the second dose. Two participants each in the vaccine and placebo groups reported temperatures above 40.0°C. Younger vaccine recipients were more likely to use antipyretic or pain medication (28% after dose 1; 45% after dose 2) than older vaccine recipients (20% after dose 1; 38% after dose 2), and placebo recipients were less likely (10 to 14%) than vaccine recipients to use the medications, regardless of age or dose. Systemic events including fever and chills were observed within the first 1 to 2 days after vaccination and resolved shortly thereafter. Daily use of the electronic diary ranged from 90 to 93% for each day after the first dose and from 75 to 83% for each day after the second dose. No difference was noted between the BNT162b2 group and the placebo group. Adverse Events Adverse event analyses are provided for all enrolled 43,252 participants, with variable follow-up time after dose 1 (Table S3). More BNT162b2 recipients than placebo recipients reported any adverse event (27% and 12%, respectively) or a related adverse event (21% and 5%). This distribution largely reflects the inclusion of transient reactogenicity events, which were reported as adverse events more commonly by vaccine recipients than by placebo recipients. Sixty-four vaccine recipients (0.3%) and 6 placebo recipients (<0.1%) reported lymphadenopathy. Few participants in either group had severe adverse events, serious adverse events, or adverse events leading to withdrawal from the trial. Four related serious adverse events were reported among BNT162b2 recipients (shoulder injury related to vaccine administration, right axillary lymphadenopathy, paroxysmal ventricular arrhythmia, and right leg paresthesia). Two BNT162b2 recipients died (one from arteriosclerosis, one from cardiac arrest), as did four placebo recipients (two from unknown causes, one from hemorrhagic stroke, and one from myocardial infarction). No deaths were considered by the investigators to be related to the vaccine or placebo. No Covid-19–associated deaths were observed. No stopping rules were met during the reporting period. Safety monitoring will continue for 2 years after administration of the second dose of vaccine. Efficacy Table 2. Table 2. Vaccine Efficacy against Covid-19 at Least 7 days after the Second Dose. Table 3. Table 3. Vaccine Efficacy Overall and by Subgroup in Participants without Evidence of Infection before 7 Days after Dose 2. Figure 3. Figure 3. Efficacy of BNT162b2 against Covid-19 after the First Dose. Shown is the cumulative incidence of Covid-19 after the first dose (modified intention-to-treat population). Each symbol represents Covid-19 cases starting on a given day; filled symbols represent severe Covid-19 cases. Some symbols represent more than one case, owing to overlapping dates. The inset shows the same data on an enlarged y axis, through 21 days. Surveillance time is the total time in 1000 person-years for the given end point across all participants within each group at risk for the end point. The time period for Covid-19 case accrual is from the first dose to the end of the surveillance period. The confidence interval (CI) for vaccine efficacy (VE) is derived according to the Clopper–Pearson method. Among 36,523 participants who had no evidence of existing or prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 cases of Covid-19 with onset at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 162 among placebo recipients. This case split corresponds to 95.0% vaccine efficacy (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.3 to 97.6; Table 2 ). Among participants with and those without evidence of prior SARS CoV-2 infection, 9 cases of Covid-19 at least 7 days after the second dose were observed among vaccine recipients and 169 among placebo recipients, corresponding to 94.6% vaccine efficacy (95% CI, 89.9 to 97.3). Supplemental analyses indicated that vaccine efficacy among subgroups defined by age, sex, race, ethnicity, obesity, and presence of a coexisting condition was generally consistent with that observed in the overall population ( Table 3 and Table S4). Vaccine efficacy among participants with hypertension was analyzed separately but was consistent with the other subgroup analyses (vaccine efficacy, 94.6%; 95% CI, 68.7 to 99.9; case split: BNT162b2, 2 cases; placebo, 44 cases). Figure 3 shows cases of Covid-19 or severe Covid-19 with onset at any time after the first dose (mITT population) (additional data on severe Covid-19 are available in Table S5). Between the first dose and the second dose, 39 cases in the BNT162b2 group and 82 cases in the placebo group were observed, resulting in a vaccine efficacy of 52% (95% CI, 29.5 to 68.4) during this interval and indicating early protection by the vaccine, starting as soon as 12 days after the first dose. Discussion A two-dose regimen of BNT162b2 (30 μg per dose, given 21 days apart) was found to be safe and 95% effective against Covid-19. The vaccine met both primary efficacy end points, with more than a 99.99% probability of a true vaccine efficacy greater than 30%. These results met our prespecified success criteria, which were to establish a probability above 98.6% of true vaccine efficacy being greater than 30%, and greatly exceeded the minimum FDA criteria for authorization. 9 Although the study was not powered to definitively assess efficacy by subgroup, the point estimates of efficacy for subgroups based on age, sex, race, ethnicity, body-mass index, or the presence of an underlying condition associated with a high risk of Covid-19 complications are also high. For all analyzed subgroups in which more than 10 cases of Covid-19 occurred, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for efficacy was more than 30%. The cumulative incidence of Covid-19 cases over time among placebo and vaccine recipients begins to diverge by 12 days after the first dose, 7 days after the estimated median viral incubation period of 5 days, 10 indicating the early onset of a partially protective effect of immunization. The study was not designed to assess the efficacy of a single-dose regimen. Nevertheless, in the interval between the first and second doses, the observed vaccine efficacy against Covid-19 was 52%, and in the first 7 days after dose 2, it was 91%, reaching full efficacy against disease with onset at least 7 days after dose 2. Of the 10 cases of severe Covid-19 that were observed after the first dose, only 1 occurred in the vaccine group. This finding is consistent with overall high efficacy against all Covid-19 cases. The severe case split provides preliminary evidence of vaccine-mediated protection against severe disease, alleviating many of the theoretical concerns over vaccine-mediated disease enhancement. 11 The favorable safety profile observed during phase 1 testing of BNT162b2 4,8 was confirmed in the phase 2/3 portion of the trial. As in phase 1, reactogenicity was generally mild or moderate, and reactions were less common and milder in older adults than in younger adults. Systemic reactogenicity was more common and severe after the second dose than after the first dose, although local reactogenicity was similar after the two doses. Severe fatigue was observed in approximately 4% of BNT162b2 recipients, which is higher than that observed in recipients of some vaccines recommended for older adults. 12 This rate of severe fatigue is also lower than that observed in recipients of another approved viral vaccine for older adults. 13 Overall, reactogenicity events were transient and resolved within a couple of days after onset. Lymphadenopathy, which generally resolved within 10 days, is likely to have resulted from a robust vaccine-elicited immune response. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar in the vaccine and placebo groups (0.6% and 0.5%, respectively). This trial and its preliminary report have several limitations. With approximately 19,000 participants per group in the subset of participants with a median follow-up time of 2 months after the second dose, the study has more than 83% probability of detecting at least one adverse event, if the true incidence is 0.01%, but it is not large enough to detect less common adverse events reliably. This report includes 2 months of follow-up after the second dose of vaccine for half the trial participants and up to 14 weeks’ maximum follow-up for a smaller subset. Therefore, both the occurrence of adverse events more than 2 to 3.5 months after the second dose and more comprehensive information on the duration of protection remain to be determined. Although the study was designed to follow participants for safety and efficacy for 2 years after the second dose, given the high vaccine efficacy, ethical and practical barriers prevent following placebo recipients for 2 years without offering active immunization, once the vaccine is approved by regulators and recommended by public health authorities. Assessment of long-term safety and efficacy for this vaccine will occur, but it cannot be in the context of maintaining a placebo group for the planned follow-up period of 2 years after the second dose. These data do not address whether vaccination prevents asymptomatic infection; a serologic end point that can detect a history of infection regardless of whether symptoms were present (SARS-CoV-2 N-binding antibody) will be reported later. Furthermore, given the high vaccine efficacy and the low number of vaccine breakthrough cases, potential establishment of a correlate of protection has not been feasible at the time of this report. This report does not address the prevention of Covid-19 in other populations, such as younger adolescents, children, and pregnant women. Safety and immune response data from this trial after immunization of adolescents 12 to 15 years of age will be reported subsequently, and additional studies are planned to evaluate BNT162b2 in pregnant women, children younger than 12 years, and those in special risk groups, such as immunocompromised persons. Although the vaccine can be stored for up to 5 days at standard refrigerator temperatures once ready for use, very cold temperatures are required for shipping and longer storage. The current cold storage requirement may be alleviated by ongoing stability studies and formulation optimization, which may also be described in subsequent reports. The data presented in this report have significance beyond the performance of this vaccine candidate. The results demonstrate that Covid-19 can be prevented by immunization, provide proof of concept that RNA-based vaccines are a promising new approach for protecting humans against infectious diseases, and demonstrate the speed with which an RNA-based vaccine can be developed with a sufficient investment of resources. The development of BNT162b2 was initiated on January 10, 2020, when the SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequence was released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and disseminated globally by the GISAID (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) initiative. This rigorous demonstration of safety and efficacy less than 11 months later provides a practical demonstration that RNA-based vaccines, which require only viral genetic sequence information to initiate development, are a major new tool to combat pandemics and other infectious disease outbreaks. The continuous phase 1/2/3 trial design may provide a model to reduce the protracted development timelines that have delayed the availability of vaccines against other infectious diseases of medical importance. In the context of the current, still expanding pandemic, the BNT162b2 vaccine, if approved, can contribute, together with other public health measures, to reducing the devastating loss of health, life, and economic and social well-being that has resulted from the global spread of Covid-19.

                  Ab der 16. Schwangerschaftswoche kontraindiziert Begründung Das Erythema migrans ist ein Symptom der Lyme-Borreliose, dass
Tage bis wenige Wochen nach dem Biss einer mit Borrelia burgdorferi
infizierten Zecke auftreten kann. Gekennzeichnet ist die sogenannte
Wanderröte durch einen hellroten, langsam wachsenden Ring,
der sich von der Einstichstelle ausweitet und im Zentrum häufig
blasser als am Rand ist. Zusätzlich kann es durch die Infektion
in unterschiedlicher Ausprägung zu Fieber, Abgeschlagenheit,
Kopfschmerzen, Nackensteifigkeit, Myalgien und Arthralgien kommen. Eine manifeste Lyme-Borreliose sollte antibiotisch behandelt
werden. Solange das Erythema migrans nur von unspezifischen Allgemeinsymptomen
begleitet wird und keine Anzeichen für die Ausweitung auf
das Zentrale Nervensystem bestehen, ist eine orale Behandlung in der
Regel ausreichend [ 6 ]. Mittel der Wahl bei
Erwachsenen ist Doxycyclin, da es zusätzlich gegen den
ebenfalls durch Zecken übertragenen Erreger der humanen granulozytären
Ehrlichiose (Anaplasma phagocytophilum) wirksam ist [ 1 ]. Allerdings darf es während
der Schwangerschaft nur nach strenger Indikationsstellung angewendet
werden, da beim Feten durch die Einlagerung des Arzneistoffes Zahnverfärbungen,
Schmelzdefekte und eine Verzögerung des Knochenwachstums
möglich sind. Das Risiko für die beschriebenen
Entwicklungsstörungen besteht insbesondere ab der 16. Schwangerschaftswoche.
Von diesem Zeitpunkt an sollte eine Einnahme gänzlich vermieden
werden [ 5 ]. Schwangere Patientinnen können Amoxicillin oder Cefuroximaxetil
erhalten. Die Wirksamkeit der beiden Antibiotika gegenüber
Lyme-Borrelien ist bewiesen und es gibt bisher keine Anzeichen für eine
embryo- oder fetotoxische Wirkung [ 2 ]
            [ 5 ]
            [ 6 ]. Bei
bekannter Penicillin-Allergie sollte Cefuroximaxetil nur unter besonderer
Vorsicht angewendet werden, da eine Parallelallergie nicht ausgeschlossen werden
kann [ 3 ]. Alternativ ist der Einsatz eines
Makrolids wie Azithromycin möglich, für das bisher
ebenfalls keine Hinweise auf mögliche schädliche
Auswirkungen für den Embryo bzw. Fetus vorliegen. Da in
einer klinischen Studie allerdings gezeigt werden konnte, dass die Behandlung
mit Azithromycin weniger erfolgreich als eine Amoxicillin-Therapie verläuft
und überzeugende Untersuchungen zur Anwendung bei schwangeren
Patientinnen nicht existieren, sollte es nur in Ausnahmefällen
eingesetzt werden [ 4 ]
            [ 5 ]. An dieser Stelle sei abschließend darauf hingewiesen,
dass explizit zur oralen Therapie der Lyme-Borreliose lediglich einzelne
Präparate mit den Wirkstoffen Doxycyclin und Cefuroximaxetil
in Deutschland zugelassen sind. Literatur 1

Persistent symptoms after treatment for neuroborreliosis are common for reasons mainly unknown. These symptoms are often unspecific and could be caused by dysfunctions in endocrine systems, an issue that has not been previously addressed systematically. We therefore mapped hormone levels in patients with previous confirmed Lyme neuroborreliosis of different outcomes and compared them with a healthy control group. Methods. Twenty patients of a retrospective cohort of patients treated for definite Lyme neuroborreliosis were recruited 2.3 to 3.7 years (median 2.7) after diagnosis, together with 23 healthy controls. Lyme neuroborreliosis patients were stratified into two groups according to a symptom/sign score. All participants underwent anthropometric and physiological investigation as well as an extensive biochemical endocrine investigation including a short high-dose adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation (Synacthen ® ) test. In addition to hormonal status, we also examined electrolytes, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D and interleukin-6. Results. Eight patients (40%) had pronounced symptoms 2-3 years after treatment. This group had a higher cortisol response to synacthen as compared with both controls and the Lyme neuroborreliosis patients without remaining symptoms (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). No other significant differences in the various baseline biochemical parameters, anthropometric or physiological data could be detected across groups. Conclusions. Apart from a positive association between the occurrence of long-lasting complaints after Lyme neuroborreliosis and cortisol response to synacthen, no corticotropic insufficiency or other serious hormonal dysfunction was found to be associated with remaining symptoms after treatment for Lyme neuroborreliosis.",1797,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Bell's palsy and Lyme neuroborreliosis are the two most common diagnoses in patients with peripheral facial palsy in areas endemic for Borrelia burgdorferi . Bell's palsy is treated with corticosteroids, while Lyme neuroborreliosis is treated with antibiotics. The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis relies on the detection of Borrelia antibodies in blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid, which is time consuming. In this study, we retrospectively analysed clinical and cerebrospinal fluid parameters in well-characterised patient material with peripheral facial palsy caused by Lyme neuroborreliosis or Bell's palsy, in order to obtain a working diagnosis and basis for treatment decisions in the acute stage. Methods. Hospital records from the Department of Infectious Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, for patients with peripheral facial palsy that had undergone lumbar puncture, were reviewed. Patients were classified as Bell's palsy, definite Lyme neuroborreliosis, or possible Lyme neuroborreliosis, on the basis of the presence of Borrelia antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid and preceding erythema migrans. Results. One hundred and two patients were analysed; 51 were classified as Bell's palsy, 34 as definite Lyme neuroborreliosis and 17 as possible Lyme neuroborreliosis. Patients with definite Lyme neuroborreliosis fell ill during the second half of the year, with a peak in August, whereas patients with Bell's palsy fell ill in a more evenly distributed manner over the year. Patients with definite Lyme neuroborreliosis had significantly more neurological symptoms outside the paretic area of the face and significantly higher levels of mononuclear cells and albumin in their cerebrospinal fluid. A reported history of tick bite was uncommon in both groups. Conclusions. We found that the time of the year, associated neurological symptoms and mononuclear pleocytosis were strong predictive factors for Lyme neuroborreliosis as a cause of peripheral facial palsy in an area endemic for Borrelia . For these patients, we suggest that ex juvantibus treatment with oral doxycycline should be preferred to early corticosteroid treatment.",2174,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Borrelia afzelii is a tick-borne spirochete bacterium that causes Lyme borreliosis (LB) and is capable of co-feeding transmission. Whether ticks that acquire LB pathogens via co-feeding are actually infectious to vertebrate hosts has never been tested. We created nymphs that had been experimentally infected as larvae with B. afzelii via co-feeding or systemic transmission, and compared their performance over one complete LB life cycle. Co-feeding nymphs had a spirochete load that was 26 times lower than systemic nymphs but both nymphs were highly infectious to mice (i.e., probability of nymph-to-host transmission of B. afzelii was ~100%). The mode of transmission had no effect on the other infection phenotypes of the LB life cycle. Ticks that acquire B. afzelii via co-feeding transmission are highly infectious to rodents, and the resulting rodent infection is highly infectious to larval ticks.

Lyme disease spirochetes reside in infected Ixodes ticks and are transferred to mammalian hosts during tick feeding. Once transmitted, spirochetes must overcome the first line of defense of the innate immune system either by binding complement regulators or by terminating the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC). In B . bavariensis , the proteins BGA66 and BGA71 inhibit complement activation by interacting with the late complement components C7, C8, and C9, as well as with the formed MAC. In this study, we have determined the crystal structure of the potent MAC inhibitor BGA71 at 2.9 Ǻ resolution. The structure revealed a cysteine cross-linked homodimer. Based on the crystal structure of BGA71 and the structure-based sequence alignment with CspA from B . burgdorferi , we have proposed a potential binding site for C7 and C9, both of which are constituents of the formed MAC. Our results shed light on the molecular mechanism of immune evasion developed by the human pathogenic Borrelia species to overcome innate immunity.

With a prevalence of 4.7–13% in Danish Ixodes ricinus ticks, Rickettsia helvetica is one of the most frequently detected tick-borne organisms in Denmark. Most reports of human exposure have described asymptomatic seroconversion or a mild, self-limiting flu-like illness but it has also been implicated as a cause of subacute lymphocytic meningitis. Because Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ( Bbsl ) and R. helvetica are both found in the same tick species, potential co-transmission is a possibility. We examined 1) the seroprevalence of anti-rickettsia antibodies in patients investigated for Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), and 2) the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and sera of same patients for the presence of Rickettsia DNA. Methods. Ninety-nine sera and 87 CSF samples from patients with intrathecal synthesis of anti-Borrelia antibodies and 101 sera and 103 CSF samples from patients with no detectable intrathecal synthesis were retrospectively examined for this study. Sera were analyzed for antibodies against spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae and both the CSF and sera were tested for Rickettsia DNA using a genus-specific real-time PCR. Results. Of the patients tested for LNB, 32% (64/200) had IgG antibodies against SFG rickettsiae. Among patients with confirmed intrathecal synthesis of Borrelia-specific antibodies, 38% (38/99) exhibited IgG antibodies. None of these values were statistically significant when compared with sera from healthy blood donors ( p = 0.7 and 0.19). Rickettsia DNA was found in the CSF of 4% (8/190) of patients. Conclusion. No statistically significant difference was found in the seroprevalence of anti-rickettsia antibodies in patients tested for LNB and healthy blood donors, indicative of a low rate of exposure in this group of patients. Eight patients showed evidence of Rickettsia DNA in the CSF, five of whom had LNB. However, cycle threshold (Ct) values were high, indicating low concentrations of DNA, and no apparent alteration in the clinical manifestations of LNB were noted in the medical records of these patients.",2080,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Sixty-four unique strains were cultured from ticks collected in southern Canada and the genomes sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the chromosome revealed two large clades with multiple subclades. Consistent with previous studies on this species, the clades were not geographically defined, and some Canadian strains were highly divergent from previously sequenced US strains. There was evidence for recombination in the chromosome but this did not affect the phylogeny. Analysis of chromosomal genes indicated that these are under intense purifying selection. Phylogenies of the accessory genome and chromosome were congruent. Therefore strain differences identified in the phylogeny of chromosomal genes likely act as a proxy for genetic determinants of phenotypic differences amongst strains that are harboured in the accessory genome.

Lyme disease (LD), is the most common vector-borne illness in the US and Europe, with predominantly cutaneous, articular, cardiac and neuro-psychiatric manifestations. LD affects all layers of the heart and every part of the conducting system. Carditis is a less common manifestation of LD. Heart block (HB) as the initial and sole manifestation of LD is rare. Inducible HB has never been reported in LD. We report a case of heart block (HB) inducible with exercise and reversible with rest. Case presentation. A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department after experiencing two episodes of syncope while at work. He presented, with a heart rate of 57 bpm, and the ECG showed sinus bradycardia with first degree AV block. The PR interval was 480 ms (NL 120–200 ms). Physical exam was unremarkable. The cardiologist’s initial impression was vaso-vagal attack. He developed high degree AV block during a stress test for the initial work up, which resolved on cessation of exercise. A similar episode while walking in the hallway, resolved at rest. The high degree AV block appeared inducible with exercise and reversible with rest. His Lyme serology was strongly positive. He was treated with ceftriaxone and doxycycline. After completing treatment, the patient had a normal ECG and returned to work without limitations, doing manual labor. Conclusions. Manifestations of Lyme carditis (LC) vary from asymptomatic and symptomatic electrocardiographic changes and heart block (HB) reversible with treatment, to sudden death. HB as the sole and initial presentation of LC is rare. There have been no reports of inducible HB in LD. Here we present a case of inducible and reversible high degree HB in a case of LC and an update of literature. Exercise and stress testing should be avoided in suspected cases of LC until resolution of carditis. Lyme carditis should be suspected in individuals with cardiac manifestations in an endemic area, particularly in the younger patients with no other etiology evident.",2028,0,0,1,0,en,en,

After antibiotic treatment of Lyme borreliosis, a subset of patients report persistent symptoms, also referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome. The reported prevalence of persistent symptoms varies considerably, and its pathophysiology is under debate. The LymeProspect study has been designed to investigate the prevalence, severity, and a wide range of hypotheses on the etiology of persistent symptoms among patients treated for Lyme borreliosis in the Netherlands. Methods. LymeProspect is a prospective, observational cohort study among adults with proven or probable Lyme borreliosis, either erythema migrans or disseminated manifestations, included at the start of antibiotic treatment. During one year of follow-up, participants are subjected to questionnaires every three months and blood is collected repeatedly during the first three months. The primary outcome is the prevalence of persistent symptoms after treatment, assessed by questionnaires online focusing on fatigue (CIS, subscale fatigue severity), pain (SF-36, subscale pain) and neurocognitive dysfunction (CFQ). Potential microbiological, immunological, genetic, epidemiological and cognitive-behavioral determinants for persistent symptoms are secondary outcome measures. Control cohorts include patients with long-lasting symptoms and unconfirmed Lyme disease, population controls, and subjects having reported a tick bite not followed by Lyme borreliosis. Discussion. This article describes the background and design of the LymeProspect study protocol. This study is characterized by a prospective, explorative and multifaceted design. The results of this study will provide insights into the prevalence and determinants of persistent symptoms after treatment for Lyme borreliosis, and may provide a rationale for preventive and treatment recommendations.

As BB0405 is highly conserved across different B. burgdorferi sensu lato species, we investigated whether vaccination with recombinant BB0405 or through intradermal bb0405 DNA tattoo vaccination could provide protection against different Borrelia species, specifically against Borrelia afzelii , the predominant B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies causing Lyme borreliosis across Eurasia. We immunized C3H/HeN mice with recombinant BB0405 or with a codon-optimized bb0405 DNA vaccine using the pVAC plasmid and immunized corresponding control groups mice with only adjuvant or empty vectors. We subsequently subjected these immunized mice to a tick challenge with B. afzelii CB43-infected Ixodes ricinus nymphs. Upon vaccination, recombinant BB0405 induced a high total IgG response, but bb0405 DNA vaccination did not elicit antibody responses. Both vaccine formulations did not provide protection against Borrelia afzelii strain CB43 after tick challenge. In an attempt to understand the lack of protection of the recombinant vaccine, we determined expression of BB0405 and showed that B. afzelii CB43 spirochetes significantly and drastically downregulate the expression of BB0405 protein at 37 °C compared to 33 °C, where as in B. burgdorferi B31 spirochetes expression levels remain unaltered.

Human dirofilariosis is still a little known infection even in endemic areas. Dirofilariosis is zoonotic infection usually abortive in humans; instead, we report a very rare case (the 4th in the world), the first in Italy, in which at least two infective larvae became mature adults that mated and produced active microfilariae even though they did not reach peripheral blood. Case presentation. A 30-year-old Italian woman presented with a transient oedematous swelling on the left abdominal wall with a creeping eruption followed by the occurrence of a subcutaneous nodular painless mass in the iliac region. One month later, a similar temporary swelling appeared on the contralateral inguinal region associated with intermittent joint discomfort in both knees. The patient had recently travelled abroad, therefore many possible diagnoses were to be ruled out. Routine laboratory investigations revealed eosinophilia. An ultrasound examination of the iliac swelling evidenced a well-defined cyst with a big filamentous formation in continuous movement. A fine-needle aspiration of the lesion was performed for parasitological, cytological and histological exams. The prompt microscopic examination of the aspired material showed the presence of numerous microfilariae that were initially morphologically attributed to Mansonella ozzardi. Subsequently, the revision of the Giemsa stained film and molecular analyses of the biological material, allowed to identify Dirofilaria repens as etiological agent of infection. Conclusions. We report of a case in whom microfilariae were detected in fine-needle aspirate of subcutaneous node, without evidence of microfilaraemia, and the infection failed to become fully patent. Therefore we confirm that complete development and fertilization of D. repens worms in human hosts may occur, at variance with what is commonly believed, that Dirofilaria worms cannot fully develop in humans.",1940,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We developed the first multiplex, array-based assay for serodiagnosis of tick-borne diseases called the TBD-Serochip. The TBD-Serochip was designed to discriminate antibody responses to 8 major tick-borne pathogens present in the United States, including Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia microti , Borrelia burgdorferi , Borrelia miyamotoi , Ehrlichia chaffeensis , Rickettsia rickettsii , Heartland virus and Powassan virus. Each assay contains approximately 170,000 12-mer linear peptides that tile along the protein sequence of the major antigens from each agent with 11 amino acid overlap. This permits accurate identification of a wide range of specific immunodominant IgG and IgM epitopes that can then be used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and integrate differential diagnosis into a single assay. To test the performance of the TBD-Serochip, we examined sera from patients with confirmed Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and Powassan virus disease. We identified a wide range of specific discriminatory epitopes that facilitated accurate diagnosis of each disease. We also identified previously undiagnosed infections.

As relatively a minor fraction of spirochetes transits between the host and the vector precluding their reliable detection at early infection, artificial membrane feeders emerged as useful tools to study roles of spirochete proteins in pathogen entry, persistence, and exit through ticks. Here we report the development of a modified membrane feeder to study the role of a Borrelia burgdorferi surface protein called Lmp1 in spirochete transitions between the murine host and ticks. We show that our membrane feeder supports the blood meal engorgement process where ticks can acquire spirochetes from the feeder containing extremely low levels of pathogens (10 2 cells/ml of blood). Our data revealed that in comparison to wild-type spirochetes, lmp1 deletion mutants are significantly impaired for acquisition in naïve ticks as well as transmission from infected ticks. Taking together, our data suggest that Lmp1 plays an essential role in spirochete transitions between hosts and the vector. These studies also underscore the usefulness of artificial membrane feeding system as a valuable tool to study the role of B. burgdorferi gene-products in pathogen persistence in and passage through vector ticks.",1325,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

In addition, it has been shown that serum sensitive isolates are (partially) protected by the Ixodes Tick Salivary Lectin Pathway Inhibitor (TSLPI) protein; a salivary gland protein that inhibits the function of Mannose Binding Lectin (MBL). MBL is a C-type lectin that recognizes oligosaccharides on pathogens and activates the complement system via the lectin pathway. MBL deficiency has been linked to a more severe course of several infectious diseases and humans with detectable antibodies against B. burgdorferi are significantly more often MBL deficient compared to humans without antibodies against B. burgdorferi . Here we set out to investigate the role of MBL in the immune response against B. burgdorferi in more detail. We demonstrate that B. burgdorferi N40 needle-infected C57BL/6 MBL deficient mice harbored significantly higher B. burgdorferi numbers in skin tissue during the early course of infection. In line with these findings they also developed higher anti- B. burgdorferi IgG serum antibodies compared to WT controls. In contrast , B. burgdorferi loads in distant tissue such as heart, joints or bladder at later time points were similar for both mouse strains. These in vivo findings were corroborated using a B. burgdorferi N40-infected I. scapularis infestation model. We showed that MBL is capable of binding B. burgdorferi through its carbohydrate recognition domains, but in vitro complement killing assays, peritoneal macrophage and whole blood stimulations, phagocytosis assays and an in vivo migration experiment did not reveal the mechanism by which MBL facilitates early clearance of B. burgdorferi . To conclude, we show a protective role of MBL in the early stages of B. burgdorferi infection, yet the underlying mechanism warrants further investigation.",1999,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

We used qPCR to determine presence of B . burgdorferi sl in tissue samples (ear) from 16 mammalian species and questing ticks from Norway, and we sequenced the 5S–23 S rDNA intergenic spacer region to determine genospecies from 1449 qPCR-positive isolates obtaining 423 sequences. All infections coming from small rodents and shrews were linked to the genospecies B . afzelii , while B . burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss) was only found in red squirrels ( Sciurus vulgaris ). Red squirrels were also infected with B . afzelii and B . garinii . There was no evidence of B . burgdorferi sl infection in moose ( Alces alces ), red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) or roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), confirming the role of cervids as incompetent hosts.

Controlled infection experiments are necessary to separate variation in the probability of exposure from genetic variation in susceptibility to infection, but such experiments are rare for wild vertebrate reservoir hosts and their zoonotic pathogens. The bank vole ( Myodes glareolus ) is an important reservoir host of Borrelia afzelii , a tick-borne spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Bank vole populations are polymorphic for Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), an innate immune receptor that recognizes bacterial lipoproteins. To test whether the TLR2 polymorphism influences variation in the susceptibility to infection with B . afzelii , we challenged pathogen-free, lab-born individuals of known TLR2 genotype with B . afzelii -infected ticks. We measured the spirochete load in tissues of the bank voles. The susceptibility to infection with B . afzelii following an infected tick bite was very high (95%) and did not differ between TLR2 genotypes. The TLR2 polymorphism also had no effect on the spirochete abundance in the tissues of the bank voles.

Multiple non-natural hosts of I. ricinus have shown to develop immunity after repeated tick bites. Tick immunity has also been shown to impair B. burgdorferi transmission. Most interestingly, multiple tick bites reduced the likelihood of contracting Lyme borreliosis in humans. A vaccine that mimics tick immunity could therefore potentially prevent Lyme borreliosis in humans. A yeast surface display library (YSD) of nymphal I. ricinus salivary gland genes expressed at 24, 48 and 72 h into tick feeding was constructed and probed with antibodies from humans repeatedly bitten by ticks, identifying twelve immunoreactive tick salivary gland proteins (TSGPs). From these, three proteins were selected for vaccination studies. An exploratory vaccination study in cattle showed an anti-tick effect when all three antigens were combined. However, immunization of rabbits did not provide equivalent levels of protection. Our results show that YSD is a powerful tool to identify immunodominant antigens in humans exposed to tick bites, yet vaccination with the three selected TSGPs did not provide protection in the present form. Future efforts will focus on exploring the biological functions of these proteins, consider alternative systems for recombinant protein generation and vaccination platforms and assess the potential of the other identified immunogenic TSGPs.",1516,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

During this period, 49 females, 32 males, and 55 I. ricinus nymphs were collected from an area of 900 m 2 . The results of the present study show that the occurrence and seasonal activity of this tick species are mainly influenced by microhabitat conditions, and saturation deficit has a significant effect on the activity of the species.

We report the characterisation of the variable large protein ( vlp ) gene expressed by clinical isolate A1 of Borrelia recurrentis ; the agent of the life-threatening disease louse-borne relapsing fever. Methods. The major vlp protein of this isolate was characterised and a DNA probe created. Use of this together with standard molecular methods was used to determine the location of the vlp1 B. recurrentis A1 gene in both this and other isolates. Results. This isolate was found to carry silent and expressed copies of the vlp1 B. recurrentis A1 gene on plasmids of 54 kbp and 24 kbp respectively, whereas a different isolate, A17, had only the silent vlp1 B. recurrentis A17 on a 54 kbp plasmid. Silent and expressed vlp1 have identical mature protein coding regions but have different 5' regions, both containing different potential lipoprotein leader sequences. Only one form of vlp1 is transcribed in the A1 isolate of B. recurrentis , yet both 5' upstream sequences of this vlp1 gene possess features of bacterial promoters. Conclusion. Taken together these results suggest that antigenic variation in B. recurrentis may result from recombination of variable large and small protein genes at the junction between lipoprotein leader sequence and mature protein coding region. However, this hypothetical model needs to be validated by further identification of expressed and silent variant protein genes in other B. recurrentis isolates.",1455,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in many provinces with high incidence in mainland China, although integrated intervention measures including rodent control, environment management and vaccination have been implemented for over ten years. In this study, we conducted a geographic information system (GIS)-based spatial analysis on distribution of HFRS cases for the whole country with an objective to inform priority areas for public health planning and resource allocation. Methods. Annualized average incidence at a county level was calculated using HFRS cases reported during 1994–1998 in mainland China. GIS-based spatial analyses were conducted to detect spatial autocorrelation and clusters of HFRS incidence at the county level throughout the country. Results. Spatial distribution of HFRS cases in mainland China from 1994 to 1998 was mapped at county level in the aspects of crude incidence, excess hazard and spatial smoothed incidence. The spatial distribution of HFRS cases was nonrandom and clustered with a Moran's I = 0.5044 ( p = 0.001). Spatial cluster analyses suggested that 26 and 39 areas were at increased risks of HFRS ( p < 0.01) with maximum spatial cluster sizes of ≤ 20% and ≤ 10% of the total population, respectively. Conclusion. The application of GIS, together with spatial statistical techniques, provide a means to quantify explicit HFRS risks and to further identify environmental factors responsible for the increasing disease risks.

Here we report a case of an erythema resembling the erythema migrans manifestation of Lyme disease, but with atypical symptoms like persistent pruritus. The patient had no history of a recent tick-bite but displayed a positive serology for an advanced stage of Lyme borreliosis, which stood in contrast to the clinical manifestation of erythema migrans as a symptom of early Lyme disease. Three skin swabs and soil samples, collected in the area where the patient possibly acquired the infection, were examined by bacterial and fungal culture methods. Microorganisms were identified by using 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatics. The patient and soil isolates were compared by employing RAPD analysis. The serum samples of the patient were examined by immunoblotting. Arthrobacter mysorens , a soil bacterium, was isolated from the collected skin and soil samples. The identity of both isolates was determined by molecular fingerprinting methods. A. mysorens was proven to be causative for the erythema by direct isolation from the affected skin and a positive serology, thus explaining the atypical appearance of the erythema compared to erythema migrans caused by Borrelia infection.

Methods/Design. 15 NB patients with persistent symptoms ≥6 months post-treatment were double-blindly randomized to receive 200 mg of doxycycline or a placebo for three weeks. After a six-week wash-out period, a cross-over with a three-week course of a placebo or doxycycline was conducted. The primary outcome measures were improvement of persistent symptoms assessed by neurological examinations, a symptom severity score and estimation of the quality of life. The secondary outcome measure was changes in systemic cytokine responses. Results. All 15 patients finished the study.

Doxycycline is one of the recommended antibiotics for treating erythema migrans (EM). Since EM predominantly occurs during summer, the potential of doxycycline to induce photosensitivity is of concern. In studies on the efficacy of doxycycline for treating relatively small numbers of patients with EM, the reported frequency of photosensitivity has varied from none to 15%. The aim of this study was to elucidate the frequency and clinical symptoms of doxycycline-induced photosensitivity in a large cohort of patients with EM treated in a single medical centre. Methods. Prospectively collected data on adverse events were analysed in adult patients with EM treated with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 10–15 days. Results. Photosensitivity reactions ranging from itching and burning sensations to transient mild erythema of sun-exposed skin were documented in 16/858 (1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.0%) patients and appeared from June to October with highest frequency in July. These adverse events were more frequent in patients treated for 14 or 15 days (16/750 [2.1%]; 95% CI 1.2–3.4%) than in those treated for 10 days (0/108 [0%]; 95% CI 0.0–3.4%); however, the difference was not significant ( P = 0.24).

Impact of climate change on tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle in a given region depends on how the region-specific climate change patterns influence tick population development processes and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) transmission dynamics involving both systemic and co-feeding transmission routes. Predicting the transmission risk of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with projected climate conditions is essential for planning public health interventions including vaccination programs to mitigate the TBE incidence in the inhabitants and travelers. We have previously developed and validated a mathematical model for retroactive analysis of weather fluctuation on TBE prevalence in Hungary, and we aim to show in this research that this model provides an effective tool for projecting TBEV transmission risk in the enzootic cycle. Methods. Using the established model of TBEV transmission and the climate predictions of the Vas county in western Hungary in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100, we quantify the risk of TBEV transmission using a series of summative indices - the basic reproduction number, the duration of infestation, the stage-specific tick densities, and the accumulated (tick) infections due to co-feeding transmission. We also measure the significance of co-feeding transmission by observing the cumulative number of new transmissions through the non-systemic transmission route. Results. The transmission potential and the risk in the study site are expected to increase along with the increase of the temperature in 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. This increase will be facilitated by the expected extension of the tick questing season and the increase of the numbers of susceptible ticks (larval and nymphal) and the number of infected nymphal ticks co-feeding on the same hosts, leading to compounded increase of infections through the non-systemic transmission. Conclusions. The developed mathematical model provides an effective tool for predicting TBE prevalence in the tick-host enzootic cycle, by integrating climate projection with emerging knowledge about the region-specific tick ecological and pathogen enzootic processes (through model parametrization fitting to historical data). Model projects increasing co-feeding transmission and prevalence of TBEV in a recognized TBE endemic region, so human risk of TBEV infection is likely increasing unless public health interventions are enhanced.",2464,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Compared to a previous cohort of patients with confirmed transient synovitis or septic arthritis, the 95% confidence interval for ESR was 21 - 33 mm/hr in those diagnosed with toxic synovitis (TS), 37 - 46 mm/hr for Lyme arthritis (LA), and 44 - 64 mm/hr for septic arthritis (SA). Synovial WBC counts (cells/mm3) 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 5,644 - 15,388 cells/mm3for TS, 47,533 - 64,242 cells/mm3for LA, and 105,432 - 260,214 cells/mm3for SA. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of fever > 38.5oC (P < 0.001) and refusal to bear weight (P < 0.01) between SA, LA, and TS.ConclusionsMonoarticular Lyme arthritis can be a cause of hip pain in certain geographic areas and has clinical and diagnostic overlap with transient synovitis and acute bacterial septic arthritis. This study consolidates the available literature and represents the largest series of patients diagnosed with Lyme arthritis of the hip to date. We propose a diagnostic algorithm that serially incorporates ESR, followed by a synovial neutrophil count, when evaluating pediatric patients with an irritable hip in Lyme endemic areas.",2964,0,0,1,0,ro,en,

This study examined the role of DnaK suppressor protein (DksA) in the transcriptional response of B. burgdorferi to starvation. Wild-type and dksA mutant B. burgdorferi strains were subjected to starvation by shifting cultures grown in rich complete medium, Barbour-Stoenner-Kelly II (BSK II) medium, to a defined mammalian tissue culture medium, RPMI 1640, for 6 h under microaerobic conditions (5% CO 2 , 3% O 2 ). Microarray analyses of wild-type B. burgdorferi revealed that genes encoding flagellar components, ribosomal proteins, and DNA replication machinery were downregulated in response to starvation. DksA mediated transcriptomic responses to starvation in B. burgdorferi , as the dksA -deficient strain differentially expressed only 47 genes in response to starvation compared to the 500 genes differentially expressed in wild-type strains. Consistent with a role for DksA in the starvation response of B. burgdorferi , fewer CFU of dksA mutants were observed after prolonged starvation in RPMI 1640 medium than CFU of wild-type B. burgdorferi spirochetes. Transcriptomic analyses revealed a partial overlap between the DksA regulon and the regulon of Rel Bbu , the guanosine tetraphosphate and guanosine pentaphosphate [(p)ppGpp] synthetase that controls the stringent response; the DksA regulon also included many plasmid-borne genes. Additionally, the dksA mutant exhibited constitutively elevated (p)ppGpp levels compared to those of the wild-type strain, implying a regulatory relationship between DksA and (p)ppGpp. Together, these data indicate that DksA, along with (p)ppGpp, directs the stringent response to effect B. burgdorferi adaptation to its environment.",1892,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme carditis is well described, occurring in less than 1% of Lyme disease. High-grade heart block is uncommon in early disseminated Lyme disease. In Lyme carditis due to sinus node dysfunction and/or high grade atrioventricular block, the pulse rates are significantly lower which can lead to syncope. This can happen in the setting of an unstable ventricular escape rhythm with pulse rates ranging around 30 beats per minute or lower. In patients with low cardiovascular reserve, high-degree AV block can cause sudden death. Here we describe a rare case of profound bradycardia in disseminated Lyme disease. The patient’s only two symptoms are bradycardia and jaw pain. He lacks erythema migrans, neurological symptoms or syncope - despite having high-degree AV block. Initially prescribed doxycycline 100mg BID, his PR interval begins to normalize, but once a Lyme titre was positive for IgM (p41, p39, p23) and IgG (p66, p45, p41, p39, p23, p18), the patient was switched to 2g ceftriaxone IV Q 24h, per Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) guidelines.

Co-infection is an uncommon occurrence but still representative in endemic areas. If there is delayed initiation of therapy in these kinds of patients, there may be dire consequences that may require aggressive therapy. Clinicians should consider co-infection when suspecting tick-borne disease which can prove to be fatal if not addressed promptly.

The B. burgdorferi rpoS mutant strain was less resistant to osmotic stress in stationary phase than the isogenic rpoS wild-type organism.

Comparative genome hybridization was used to explore the relationship between different genotypes. The chromosomes of all studied isolates were highly conserved (>93%) with respect to both sequence and gene order. Plasmid sequences were substantially more diverse. Plasmids lp54, cp26, and cp32 were present in all tested isolates, and their sequences and gene order were conserved. The majority of linear plasmids showed variation both in terms of presence among different isolates and in terms of sequence and gene order. The data strongly imply that all B. burgdorferi clinical isolates contain linear plasmids related to each other, but the structure of these replicons may vary substantially from isolate to isolate. These alterations include deletions and presumed rearrangements that are likely to result in unique plasmid elements in many isolates. There is a strong correlation between complete genome hybridization profiles and other typing methods, which, in turn, also correlate to differences in pathogenicity. Because there is substantially less variation in the chromosomal and circular plasmid portions of the genome, the major differences in open reading frame content and genomic diversity among isolates are linear plasmid driven.",1416,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Motility and chemotaxis genes comprise 5 to 6% of the genome of B. burgdorferi , yet the functions of most of those genes remain uncharacterized, mainly due to the paucity of a nonpolar gene inactivation system. In this communication, we describe the development of a novel gene inactivation methodology to target B. burgdorferi fliL , a putative periplasmic flagellar gene located in a large motility operon and transcribed by RNA polymerase containing σ 70 . Although the morphology of nonpolar fliL mutant cells was indistinguishable from that of wild-type cells, the mutant exhibited a defective-motility phenotype. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) of intact organisms revealed that the periplasmic flagella in the fliL mutant were frequently tilted toward the cell pole instead of their normal orientation toward the cell body. These defects were corrected when the mutant was complemented in cis . Moreover, a comparative analysis of flagellar motors from the wild type and the mutant provides the first structural evidence that FliL is localized between the stator and rotor. Our results suggest that FliL is likely involved in coordinating or regulating the orientation of periplasmic flagella in B. burgdorferi .",1388,0,0,0,1,en,en,

How spirochetes coordinate the rotation of the periplasmic flagella for chemotaxis is poorly understood. In other bacteria, modulation of flagellar rotation is essential for chemotaxis, and phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of the response regulator CheY plays a key role in regulating this rotary motion. The genome of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi contains multiple homologues of chemotaxis genes, including three copies of cheY , referred to as cheY1 , cheY2 , and cheY3 . To investigate the function of these genes, we targeted them separately or in combination by allelic exchange mutagenesis. Whereas wild-type cells ran, paused (flexed), and reversed, cells of all single, double, and triple mutants that contained an inactivated cheY3 gene constantly ran. Capillary tube chemotaxis assays indicated that only those strains with a mutation in cheY3 were deficient in chemotaxis, and cheY3 complementation restored chemotactic ability. In vitro phosphorylation assays indicated that CheY3 was more efficiently phosphorylated by CheA2 than by CheA1, and the CheY3-P intermediate generated was considerably more stable than the CheY-P proteins found in most other bacteria. The results point toward CheY3 being the key response regulator essential for chemotaxis in B. burgdorferi . In addition, the stability of CheY3-P may be critical for coordination of the rotation of the periplasmic flagella.",1554,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Unique to RF species, and little characterized to date, are large linear plasmids of ∼160 kb, or ∼10% of the genome. By a combination of Sanger and next-generation methods, we determined the sequences of large linear plasmids of two New World species: Borrelia hermsii , to completion of its 174-kb length, and B. turicatae , partially to 114 kb of its 150 kb. These sequences were then compared to corresponding sequences of the Old World species B. duttonii and B. recurrentis and to plasmid sequences of LD Borrelia species. The large plasmids were largely colinear, except for their left ends, about 27 kb of which was inverted in New World species. Approximately 60% of the B. hermsii lp174 plasmid sequence was repetitive for 6 types of sequence, and half of its open reading frames encoded hypothetical proteins not discernibly similar to proteins in the database. The central ∼25 kb of all 4 linear plasmids was syntenic for orthologous genes for plasmid maintenance or partitioning in Borrelia species. Of all the sequenced linear and circular plasmids in Borrelia species, the large plasmid's putative partition/replication genes were most similar to those of the 54-kb linear plasmids of LD species. Further evidence for shared ancestry was the observation that two of the hypothetical proteins were predicted to be structurally similar to the LD species' CspA proteins, which are encoded on the 54-kb plasmids.",1557,0,0,0,1,en,en,

LB is a zoonosis caused by Borrelia bacteria transmitted by Ixodes tick-bite. Because of the absence of a national registry, epidemiology of LB in France is not well known. Moreover, diagnosis of NB may be difficult because of the various clinical forms. Acute meningoradiculitis is the most common presentation, but pauci-symptomatic meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis, polyneuropathy, cerebrovascular involvement, and rarely chronic encephalomyelitis are also described. The vector Ixodes ricinus ( I. ricinus ) is found throughout metropolitan France excepting border areas of the Mediterranean seaside and in regions with an altitude above 1500 meters. In France, the Borrelia infestation rate of Ixodes is 7% with wide disparity between administrative districts. Prospective work in 1999–2000 by 875 general practitioners participating in the “Sentinel” network established the estimated incidence of BL (9.4/100 000) and of NB (0.6/100 000) in France. Incidence is higher in certain regions: in Alsace, prospective work by 419 general practitioners and specialists in cooperation with the national surveillance agency ( Institut national de veille sanitaire ), estimated BL incidence at 86 to 200/100 000 inhabitants and NB at 10/100 000. Thus, although globally France is a country with a moderate risk for LB, some regions such as Limousin, Auvergne, Lorraine and Alsace, have a high risk of LB, comparable to countries in the northeastern Europe such as Germany and Sweden.",1599,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

In the present study, we developed a nested PCR for detection of Lyme Borrelia-specific DNA in cerebrospinal fluid from Swedish patients with LB. The genospecies were subsequently identified by sequence analysis in a total of 7 PCR-positive patients. Two sequences were identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s. s.), 1 as B. afzelii and 4 as B. garinii. These are the first reported cases in which B. burgdorferi s. s. has been shown to be the causative agent of human LB in Sweden.

The study protocol included lumbar puncture before and 6–8 weeks after treatment initiation. There was a marked decrease (1.2 log 10 ×10 6 /l) of the median CSF mononuclear cell count following treatment. With the assumption of a linear regression of the logarithmic mononuclear cell counts between the 2 lumbar punctures, no significant difference between the 2 antibiotic treatments could be found.

Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne zoonosis currently affecting approximately 1000 people annually in the UK (confirmed through serological diagnosis) although it is estimated that the real figures may be as high as 3000 cases. It is important to know what factors may predict correct appraisal of LD symptoms and how the experience of LD might predict preferences for future precautionary actions. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with early LD patients via the Lyme Borreliosis Unit at the Health Protection Agency. One hundred and thirty participants completed measures of awareness of having been bitten by ticks, knowledge of ticks and LD, interpretation of LD symptoms, suspicions of having LD prior to seeing the General Practitioner (GP), and preferences for precautionary actions during future countryside visits. Chi-square tests and logistic regression were used to identify key predictors of awareness of having been bitten by ticks and of having LD. t -tests assessed differences between groups of participants on suspicions of having LD and preferences for future precautions. Pearson correlations examined relationships between measures of preferences for precautions and frequency of countryside use, knowledge of ticks and LD, and intentions to avoid the countryside in the future. Results. 73.8% of participants ( n = 96) reported a skin rash as the reason for seeking medical help, and 44.1% ( n = 64) suspected they had LD before seeing the GP. Participants reporting a direct event in realizing they had been bitten by ticks (seeing a tick on skin or seeing a skin rash and linking it to tick bites) were more likely to suspect they had LD before seeing the doctor. Participants distinguished between taking precautions against tick bites during vs. after countryside visits, largely preferring the latter. Also, the more frequently participants visited the countryside, the less likely they were to endorse during-visit precautions. Conclusions. The results suggest that the risk of LD is set in the context of the restorative benefits of countryside practices, and that it may be counterproductive to overemphasize pre- or during-visit precautions. Simultaneously, having experienced LD is not associated with any withdrawal from countryside.",2291,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In vector-borne diseases, interactions between pathogens occur in both the vertebrate host and the arthropod vector. Spirochete bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies complex are transmitted by Ixodes ticks and cause Lyme borreliosis in humans. In Europe, there is a high diversity of Borrelia pathogens, and the main tick vector, Ixodes ricinus , is often infected with multiple Borrelia genospecies. In the present study, we characterized the pairwise interactions between five B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies in a large data set of I. ricinus ticks collected from the same field site in Switzerland. We measured two types of pairwise interactions: (i) co-occurrence, whether double infections occurred more or less often than expected, and (ii) spirochete load additivity, whether the total spirochete load in double infections was greater or less than the sum of the single infections. Mixed infections of Borrelia genospecies specialized on different vertebrate reservoir hosts occurred less frequently than expected (negative co-occurrence) and had joint spirochete loads that were lower than the additive expectation (inhibition). In contrast, mixed infections of genospecies that share the same reservoir hosts were more common than expected (positive co-occurrence) and had joint spirochete loads that were similar to or greater than the additive expectation (facilitation). Our study suggests that the vertebrate host plays an important role in structuring the community of B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies inside the tick vector.",1688,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Among those small DNAs are the cp32 elements, a family of prophages that replicate as circular episomes. All complete cp32s contain an erp locus, which encodes surface-exposed proteins. Sequences were compared for all 193 erp alleles carried by 22 different strains of Lyme disease-causing spirochete to investigate their natural diversity and evolutionary histories. These included multiple isolates from a focus where Lyme disease is endemic in the northeastern United States and isolates from across North America and Europe. Bacteria were derived from diseased humans and from vector ticks and included members of 5 different Borrelia genospecies. All erp operon 5′-noncoding regions were found to be highly conserved, as were the initial 70 to 80 bp of all erp open reading frames, traits indicative of a common evolutionary origin. However, the majority of the protein-coding regions are highly diverse, due to numerous intra- and intergenic recombination events. Most erp alleles are chimeras derived from sequences of closely related and distantly related erp sequences and from unknown origins. Since known functions of Erp surface proteins involve interactions with various host tissue components, this diversity may reflect both their multiple functions and the abilities of Lyme disease-causing spirochetes to successfully infect a wide variety of vertebrate host species.",1500,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme disease (LD) is the most common tick-borne disease in the United States and in Europe. The aim of this study was to examine knowledge, perceived risk, feelings of anxiety, and behavioral responses of the general public in relation to tick bites and LD in the Netherlands. Methods. From a representative Internet panel a random sample was drawn of 550 panel members aged 18 years and older (8-15 November 2010) who were invited to complete an online questionnaire. Results. Response rate (362/550, 66%). This study demonstrates that knowledge, level of concern, and perceived efficacy are the main determinants of preventive behavior. 35% (n = 125/362) of the respondents reported a good general knowledge of LD. While 95% (n = 344/362) perceived LD as severe or very severe, the minority (n = 130/362, 36%) perceived their risk of LD to be low. Respondents were more likely to check their skin after being outdoors and remove ticks if necessary, than to wear protective clothing and/or use insect repellent skin products. The percentage of respondents taking preventive measures ranged from 6% for using insect repellent skin products, to 37% for wearing protective clothing. History of tick bites, higher levels of knowledge and moderate/high levels of worry were significant predictors of checking the skin. Significant predictors of wearing protective clothing were being unemployed/retired, higher knowledge levels, higher levels of worry about LD and higher levels of perceived efficacy of wearing protective clothing. Conclusions. Prevention programs targeting tick bites and LD should aim at influencing people’s perceptions and increasing their knowledge and perceived efficacy of protective behavior. This can be done by strengthening motivators (e.g. knowledge, concern about LD, perceived efficacy of wearing protective clothing) and removing barriers (e.g. low perceived personal risk, not knowing how to recognize a tick).

Lyme disease (LD) is a vector-borne disease that is endemic in many temperate countries, including Switzerland, and is currently emerging in Canada. This study compares the importance of knowledge, exposure and risk perception for the adoption of individual preventive measures, within and between two different populations, one that has been living in a LD endemic region for several decades, the Neuchâtel canton in Switzerland, and another where the disease is currently emerging, the Montérégie region in the province of Québec, Canada. Methods. A web-based survey was carried out in both study regions (814 respondents) in 2012. Comparative analysis of the levels of adoption of individual preventive measures was performed and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test and compare how knowledge, exposure and risk perception were associated with the adoption of selected measures in both regions and globally. Results. In Montérégie, the proportion of reported adoption of five of the most commonly recommended preventive measures varied from 6% for ‘applying acaricides on one’s property’ to 49% for ‘wearing protective clothing’ , and in Neuchâtel, proportions ranged from 6% ( acaricides ) to 77% for ‘checking for ticks ( tick check)’ . Differences were found within gender, age groups and exposure status in both regions. The perceived efficacy of a given measure was the strongest factor associated with the adoption of three specific preventive behaviors for both regions : tick check, protective clothing and tick repellent . Risk perception and a high level of knowledge about LD were also significantly associated with some of these specific behaviors, but varied by region. Conclusions. These results strongly suggest that social and contextual factors such as the epidemiological status of a region are important considerations to take into account when designing effective prevention campaigns for Lyme disease. It furthermore underlines the importance for public health authorities to better understand and monitor these factors in targeted populations in order to be able to implement preventive programs that are well adapted to a population and the epidemiological contexts therein.",2236,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme disease control strategies may include tick control interventions in high risk areas. Public authorities may be interested to assess how these types of interventions are perceived by the public which may then impact their acceptability. The aims of this paper are to compare socio-cognitive factors associated with high acceptability of tick control interventions and to describe perceived issues that may explain their low acceptability in populations living in two different regions, one being an endemic region for LD since the last 30 years, the Neuchâtel canton, in Switzerland, and another where the disease is emerging, the Montérégie region, in Canada. Methods. A mixed methods’ design was chosen. Quantitative data were collected using web-surveys conducted in both regions ( n = 814). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to compare socio-cognitive factors associated with high acceptability of selected interventions. Qualitative data were collected using focus group’s discussions to describe perceived issues relative to these interventions. Results. Levels of acceptability in the studied populations were the lowest for the use of acaricides and landscaping and were under 50 % in both regions for six out of eight interventions, but were higher overall in Montérégie. High perceived efficacy of the intervention was strongly associated with high acceptability of tick control interventions. A high perceived risk about LD was also associated with a high acceptability of intervention under some models. High level of knowledge about LD was negatively associated with high acceptability of the use of acaricides in Neuchâtel. Perceived issues explaining low acceptability included environmental impacts, high costs to the public system, danger of individual disempowerment and perceptions that tick control interventions were disproportionate options for the level of LD risk. Conclusion. This study suggests that the perceived efficacy and LD risk perception may be key factors to target to increase the acceptability of tick control interventions. Community-level issues seem to be important considerations driving low acceptability of public health interventions. Results of this study highlight the importance for decision-makers to account for socio-cognitive factors and perceived issues that may affect the acceptability of public health interventions in order to maximize the efficacy of actions to prevent and control LD.",2470,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The approach to surveillance of Lyme borreliosis varies between countries, depending on the purpose of the surveillance system and the notification criteria used, which prevents direct comparison of national data. In Norway, Lyme borreliosis is notifiable to the Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases (MSIS). The current notification criteria include a combination of clinical and laboratory results for borrelia infection (excluding Erythema migrans) but there are indications that these criteria are not followed consistently by clinicians and by laboratories. Therefore, an evaluation of Lyme borreliosis surveillance in Norway was conducted to describe the purpose of the system and to assess the suitability of the current notification criteria in order to identify areas for improvement. Methods. The CDC Guidelines for Evaluation of Surveillance Systems were used to develop the assessment of the data quality, representativeness and acceptability of MSIS for surveillance of Lyme borreliosis. Data quality was assessed through a review of data from 1996 to 2013 in MSIS and a linkage of MSIS data from 2008 to 2012 with data from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR). Representativeness and acceptability were assessed through a survey sent to 23 diagnostic laboratories. Results. Completeness of key variables for cases reported to MSIS was high, except for geographical location of exposureThe NPR-MSIS linkage identified 1047 cases in both registries, while 363 were only reported to MSIS and 3914 were only recorded in NPR. A higher proportion of cases found in both registries were recorded as neuroborreliosis in MSIS (84.4 %) than those cases found only in MSIS (20.1 %). The trend (average yearly increase or decrease in reported cases) of neuroborreliosis in MSIS was not significantly different from the trend for all other clinical manifestations recorded in MSIS in negative binomial regression ( p = 0.3). The 16 surveyed laboratories (response proportion 70 %) indicated differences in testing practices and low acceptability of the notification criteria. Conclusions. Given the challenges associated with diagnosing Lyme borreliosis, the selected notification criteria should be closely linked with the purpose of the surveillance system. Restricting reportable Lyme borreliosis to neuroborreliosis may increase validity, while a more sensitive case definition (potentially including erythema migrans) may better reflect the true burden of disease.

Lyme disease or Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common tick-borne disease both in the United States and Europe. Children, in particular, are at high risk of contracting LB. Since child-specific educational tools on ticks, tick bites and LB are lacking, we developed an online educational video game. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of an online educational video game versus a newly developed leaflet aimed to improve prevention of tick bites and LB among Dutch schoolchildren. Methods. A total of 887 children, aged 9–13 years and attending the two final years of primary schooling, were recruited from 25 primary schools in June and July 2012. They were assigned through cluster randomization to one of three intervention groups: ‘game’ (22.4%), ‘leaflet’ (35.6%) or ‘control’ (41.9%). Prior to and directly following intervention, the children were asked to complete a short questionnaire. The main outcome measures were knowledge, perception (perceived susceptibility and importance) and preventive behavior in relation to tick bites and LB. Generalized linear mixed models were used to analyze the data. Results. In the game group, the leaflet group and the control group, knowledge about ticks and tick bites improved significantly. The game was also an effective tool for improving preventive behavior; the frequency of checking for ticks increased significantly. However, there were no significant differences in knowledge improvement between the interventions. The game outperformed the leaflet in terms of improving preventive behavior, whereas the frequency of tick checks increased significantly. But this frequency didn’t increase more than in the control group. Conclusions. The positive knowledge effects observed in the control group suggests the presence of a mere measurement effect related to completion of the questionnaire. The game did not outperform the leaflet or control group on all outcome measures. Therefore, the game may be of value as a complementary role, in addition to other media, in child-specific public health education programs on ticks and LB. This trial was retrospectively registered on October 21, 2016 (trial registration number: ISRCTN15142369).",2217,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme disease (LD) is an infectious multi-system illness caused by the bacterial genus Borrelia and spread by bites of infected ticks. Although most patients are successfully treated by timely antibiotic therapy, it is broadly accepted that a sizeable number of patients experience treatment failure and continue to suffer long-term, debilitating symptoms, including pain, fatigue, cognitive dysfunction and other symptoms. This is known as post-treatment LD (PTLD), for which diagnosis is not standardized and treatment remains controversial. The prevalence and societal burden of PTLD is unknown. Methods. In an effort to help characterize the LD landscape, we estimated the number of PTLD cases in the US in 2016 and 2020 using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques, publically-available demographic datasets, uncertainty in the inputs and realistic assumptions about incidence and treatment failure rates. Results. Depending on the input assumptions, PTLD prevalence estimates for 2016 ranged from 69,011 persons (95% CI 51,796 to 89,312) to 1,523,869 (CI 1,268,634 to 1,809,416). Prevalence in 2020 is predicted to be higher than 2016, and may be as high as 1,944,189 (CI 1,619,988 to 2,304,147) cases. Conclusions. The cumulative prevalence of PLTD in the United States is estimated to be high and continues to increase. These findings will be of interest to epidemiologists and health economists studying disease burden in the US and elsewhere, and justify funding to study PTLD diagnosis and treatment.",1517,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In contrast, Lyme disease control and prevention focused on the individual, advocating personal protection and backyard control, with the disease incidence steeply increasing since 1980s. Control of Lyme and other tick-borne diseases will require a paradigm shift emphasizing measures to reduce tick and host (deer) populations and a substantial R&D effort. These steps will require changing the political climate, perceptions and opinions to generate support among governmental levels and the general public.

Serological surveillance, based on the measurement of the presence of specific antibodies in a given population, can be used in addition to traditional and routine disease surveillance methods. The added value of this has been largely documented for vaccine-preventable diseases, but to a lesser extent for vector-borne diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of seroprevalence data as additional source of information on the epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis in Belgium. Methods. In total, 3215 residual blood samples collected in 2013–2015 were analysed with Liaison® Borrelia IgG kit (DiaSorin S.p.A, Saluggia, Italy). Positive and equivocal results were further examined with immunoblotting ( recom Line Borrelia IgG kit, Mikrogen, Neuried, Germany). Crude prevalence estimates of equivocal and seropositive results were calculated and further adjusted accounting for clustered sampling and standardized for age, sex and population per province, according to the Belgian population structure in 2014. The effect of age, sex and region on seropositivity was assessed using log-binomial regression. Results. The overall weighted national seroprevalence for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, adjusted for clustered sampling, age, sex and province was 1.06% (95%CI 0.67–1.67). Although not statistically significant, the highest prevalences were observed in men and in those younger than 15 years or older than 59 years of age. At provincial level, the seroprevalence estimates do not follow the geographical distribution of tick bites and diagnoses of Lyme borreliosis as detected through other surveillance systems. Conclusions. Although the use of residual samples for seroprevalence estimates has several advantages, it seems to be a limited tool for serological surveillance of Lyme borreliosis in Belgium, other than follow-up of trends if repeated over time. A population-based sampling strategy might provide a more representative nationwide sample, but would be very time intensive and expensive. Seroprevalence studies within risk groups or risk areas in Belgium could provide a useful alternative approach to complement routine surveillance data of Lyme borreliosis.",2198,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme disease is emerging in Canada due to expansion of the range of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis from the United States. National surveillance for human Lyme disease cases began in Canada in 2009. Reported numbers of cases increased from 144 cases in 2009 to 2025 in 2017. It has been claimed that few (< 10%) Lyme disease cases are reported associated with i) supposed under-diagnosis resulting from perceived inadequacies of serological testing for Lyme disease, ii) expectation that incidence in Canadian provinces and neighbouring US states should be similar, and iii) analysis of serological responses of dogs to the agent of Lyme disease, Borrelia burgdorferi . We argue that performance of serological testing for Lyme disease is well studied, and variations in test performance at different disease stages are accounted for in clinical diagnosis of Lyme disease, and in surveillance case definitions. Extensive surveillance for tick vectors has taken place in Canada providing a clear picture of the emergence of risk in the Canadian environment. This surveillance shows that the geographic scope of I. scapularis populations and Lyme disease risk is limited but increasing in Canada. The reported incidence of Lyme disease in Canada is consistent with this pattern of environmental risk, and the differences in Lyme disease incidence between US states and neighbouring Canadian provinces are consistent with geographic differences in environmental risk. Data on serological responses in dogs from Canada and the US are consistent with known differences in environmental risk, and in numbers of reported Lyme disease cases, between the US and Canada. Conclusion. The high level of consistency in data from human case and tick surveillance, and data on serological responses in dogs, suggests that a high degree of under-reporting in Canada is unlikely. We speculate that approximately one third of cases are reported in regions of emergence of Lyme disease, although prospective studies are needed to fully quantify under-reporting. In the meantime, surveillance continues to identify and track the ongoing emergence of Lyme disease, and the risk to the public, in Canada.",2197,0,0,1,0,en,en,

To investigate B. burgdorferi diversity in Canada, where Lyme disease is emerging, bacterial DNA in 309 infected adult Ixodes scapularis ticks collected in surveillance was characterized by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and analysis of outer surface protein C gene ( ospC ) alleles. Six ticks carried Borrelia miyamotoi , and one tick carried the novel species Borrelia kurtenbachii . 142 ticks carried B. burgdorferi sequence types (STs) previously described from the United States. Fifty-eight ticks carried B. burgdorferi of 1 of 19 novel or undescribed STs, which were single-, double-, or triple-locus variants of STs first described in the United States. Clonal complexes with founder STs from the United States were identified. Seventeen ospC alleles were identified in 309 B. burgdorferi -infected ticks. Positive and negative associations in the occurrence of different alleles in the same tick supported a hypothesis of multiple-niche polymorphism for B. burgdorferi in North America. Geographic analysis of STs and ospC alleles were consistent with south-to-north dispersion of infected ticks from U.S. sources on migratory birds. These observations suggest that the genetic diversity of B. burgdorferi in eastern and central Canada corresponds to that in the United States, but there was evidence for founder events skewing the diversity in emerging tick populations. Further studies are needed to investigate the significance of these observations for the performance of diagnostic tests and clinical presentation of Lyme disease in Canada.",1753,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Enzootic maintenance of the pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi by I. scapularis and small mammals is well documented, whereas its “cryptic” maintenance by other specialist ticks and wildlife hosts remains largely unexplored because these ticks rarely bite humans. We quantified B. burgdorferi infection in a cryptic bird-rabbit-tick cycle. Furthermore, we explored the role of birds in maintaining and moving B. burgdorferi strains by comparing their genetic diversity in this cryptic cycle to that found in cycles vectored by I. scapularis. We examined birds, rabbits, and small mammals for ticks and infection over a 4-year period at a focal site in Michigan, 90 km east of a zone of I. scapularis invasion. We mist netted 19,631 birds that yielded 12,301 ticks, of which 86% were I. dentatus , a bird-rabbit specialist. No resident wildlife harbored I. scapularis , and yet 3.5% of bird-derived ticks, 3.6% of rabbit-derived ticks, and 20% of rabbit ear biopsy specimens were infected with B. burgdorferi . We identified 25 closely related B. burgdorferi strains using an rRNA gene intergenic spacer marker, the majority (68%) of which had not been reported previously. The presence of strains common to both cryptic and endemic cycles strongly implies bird-mediated dispersal. Given continued large-scale expansion of I. scapularis populations, we predict that its invasion into zones of cryptic transmission will allow for bridging of novel pathogen strains to humans and animals.",1622,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In this study, we investigated whether an introduced species, the Siberian chipmunk ( Tamias sibiricus barberi ), was a potentially new reservoir host for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the causative agent of Lyme disease. First, we ascertained whether chipmunks were infected by all of the B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies associated with rodents and available in their source of infection, questing nymphs. Second, we determined whether the prevalence and diversity of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in chipmunks were similar to those of a native reservoir rodent, the bank vole ( Myodes glareolus ). Our research took place between 2006 and 2008 in a suburban French forest, where we trapped 335 chipmunks and 671 voles and collected 743 nymphs of ticks that were questing for hosts by dragging on the vegetation. We assayed for B. burgdorferi sensu lato with ear biopsy specimens taken from the rodents and in nymphs using PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Chipmunks were infected by the three Borrelia genospecies that were present in questing nymphs and that infect rodents ( B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii , and B. garinii ). In contrast, voles hosted only B. afzelii . Furthermore, chipmunks were more infected (35%) than voles (16%). These results may be explained by the higher exposure of chipmunks, because they harbor more ticks, or by their higher tolerance of other B. burgdorferi sensu lato genospecies than of B. afzelii . If chipmunks are competent reservoir hosts for B. burgdorferi sensu lato, they may spill back B. burgdorferi sensu lato to native communities and eventually may increase the risk of Lyme disease transmission to humans.",1869,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We evaluated all 84 cases in which the EBV polymerase chain reaction test (PCR) was requested on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for the period 2003–2008. Fourteen patients with proven neuroborreliosis served as the control group. Nine patients were diagnosed with a primary EBV infection and neurological symptoms (median age 36 y; 4 male). Viral DNA copies in CSF were detected by PCR in 7 of 9 patients. The presenting symptoms were meningeal signs, epileptic insults, polyradiculomyelitis, polyradiculitis, and/or sudden cognitive disorders. All EBV cases had a pleocytosis with significantly increased mononuclear leukocytes as compared to the neuroborreliosis group (median 99% interquartile range (96–100%) versus 90% (86–97%). In cases with a primary EBV infection, viral loads ranged from 43 to 3202 copies/ml in CSF and from 61 to 15,595 copies/ml in serum. Seventy-eight percent of the cases had a positive PCR on CSF.

Recent studies have suggested that a chemokine, CXCL13, could have an important role in the diagnosis of LNB. The aim of this study was to assess CXCL13 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children with LNB. Methods: CSF samples were available for 57 children with symptoms indicative of LNB. Based on the presence of anti-flagella antibodies and pleocytosis in CSF, patients were divided into 3 different groups: confirmed LNB ( n = 24), possible LNB ( n = 16), and non-LNB ( n = 17). CXCL13 levels were determined with a commercial kit (Quantikine). Results: All 24 patients with confirmed LNB had elevated CXCL13 levels in CSF. Elevated CXCL13 was also observed in the majority of patients without anti-flagella antibodies in the CSF (possible LNB). Of the 17 non-LNB and 50 control samples, 1 was positive. Conclusions: In LNB, the production of CXCL13 in CSF seems to precede antibody production. Assessment of CSF CXCL13 may improve the diagnostics for children with possible LNB.",1158,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Mass mortality events in scallops have been reported worldwide, often with the causative agent(s) remaining uncharacterized. In May 2013 and 2014, two mass mortality events affecting king scallops were recorded in the Lyme Bay marine protected area (MPA) in Southwest England. Histopathological examination showed gill epithelial tissues infected with intracellular microcolonies (IMCs) of bacteria resembling Rickettsia -like organisms (RLOs), often with bacteria released in vascular spaces. Large colonies were associated with cellular and tissue disruption of the gills. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the intracellular location of these organisms in affected epithelial cells. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the putative IMCs obtained from infected king scallop gill samples, collected from both mortality events, were identical and had a 99.4% identity to 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from “ Candidatus Endonucleobacter bathymodioli” and 95% with Endozoicomonas species. In situ hybridization assays using 16S rRNA gene probes confirmed the presence of the sequenced IMC gene in the gill tissues. Additional DNA sequences of the bacterium were obtained using high-throughput (Illumina) sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis identified over 1,000 genes with high similarity to protein sequences from Endozoicomonas spp. (ranging from 77 to 87% identity). Specific PCR assays were developed and applied to screen for the presence of IMC 16S rRNA gene sequences in king scallop gill tissues collected at the Lyme Bay MPA during 2015 and 2016.

Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is endemic in Liaoning Province, China, and this province was the most serious area affected by HFRS during 2004 to 2005. In this study, we conducted a spatial analysis of HFRS cases with the objective to determine the distribution of HFRS cases and to identify key areas for future public health planning and resource allocation in Liaoning Province. Methods. The annual average incidence at the county level was calculated using HFRS cases reported between 2000 and 2005 in Liaoning Province. GIS-based spatial analyses were conducted to detect spatial distribution and clustering of HFRS incidence at the county level, and the difference of relative humidity and forestation between the cluster areas and non-cluster areas was analyzed. Results. Spatial distribution of HFRS cases in Liaoning Province from 2000 to 2005 was mapped at the county level to show crude incidence, excess hazard, and spatial smoothed incidence. Spatial cluster analysis suggested 16 and 41 counties were at increased risk for HFRS (p < 0.01) with the maximum spatial cluster sizes at ≤ 50% and ≤ 30% of the total population, respectively, and the analysis showed relative humidity and forestation in the cluster areas were significantly higher than in other areas. Conclusion. Some clustering of HFRS cases in Liaoning Province may be etiologically linked. There was strong evidence some HFRS cases in Liaoning Province formed clusters, but the mechanism underlying it remains unknown. In this study we found the clustering was consistent with the relative humidity and amount of forestation, and showed data indicating there may be some significant relationships.",1702,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease transmitted by ixodid tick bites, mainly of Hyalomma spp., or through contact with blood/tissues from infected people or animals. CCHF is endemic in the Balkan area, including Bulgaria, where it causes both sporadic cases and community outbreaks. Methods. We described trends of CCHF in Bulgaria between 1997 and 2009 and investigated the associations between CCHF incidence and a selection of environmental factors using a zero-inflated modelling approach. Results. A total of 159 CCHF cases (38 women and 121 men) were identified between 1997 and 2009. The incidence was 0.13 cases per 100,000 population/year with a fatality rate of 26%. An epidemic peak was detected close to the Turkish border in the summer of 2002. Most cases were reported between April and September. Increasing mean temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), savannah-type land coverage or habitat fragmentation increased significantly the incidence of CCHF in the CCHF-affected areas. Similar to that observed in Turkey, we found that areas with warmer temperatures in the autumn prior to the case-reporting year had an increased probability of reporting zero CCHF cases. Conclusions. We identified environmental correlates of CCHF incidence in Bulgaria that may support the prospective implementation of public health interventions.",1407,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Recreational trails abound across the United States and represent high risk areas for tick exposure. Although online reviews represent a rich source of user information, they have rarely been used in determining the risk of tick exposure during recreational trail use. Based on online user reviews and comments, the purpose of this study was to determine risk factors and behavioral recommendations associated with tick encounters ( Tick Presence ) on recreational trails in the state of Indiana, U.S. Methods. We reviewed 26,016 user comments left on AllTrails.com for 697 Indiana trails. Reviews were evaluated to determine Tick Presence/Absence , the total number of Tick Presence Reviews per trail, and multiple trail and user behavioral characteristics. We used hot spot (Getis-Ord Gi*) analysis to test the hypothesis of whether there are clusters in the number of Tick Presence Reviews . Pearson chi-square tests of independence evaluated whether tick presence was associated with several trail characteristics. Finally, negative binomial regression evaluated the strength of the association between the number of Tick Presence Reviews and several trail characteristics. Results. Tick Presence was recorded at 10% ( n = 65) of trails and occurred most frequently in May. Hot spot analysis revealed statistically significant clusters of Tick Presence Reviews on trails in the Southern Indiana State Region . Results of χ 2 tests indicated significant associations between Tick Presence Reviews and (a) State Region and (b) Land Management Type ; Mann-Whitney U tests detected significant differences in Tick Presence Reviews based on Trail Length and Elevation Gain. Subsequent results of a negative binomial regression model indicated that Southern Indiana State Region, Federal and Private Land Management Type , and Elevation Gain were factors significantly associated with Tick Presence Reviews. Content of user reviews indicated several behaviors employed to prevent tick encounters, particularly Repellent Application and Recreational Deterrenc e; 25% included a behavior Recommendation to others. Conclusions. Online, user-generated trail reviews have the potential to serve as rich data sources for identifying recreational trails, where 1) the risk of tick exposure is great, 2) more robust active tick and tick-borne pathogen surveillance may be warranted, and 3) tailored prevention interventions are needed.",2437,0,1,0,0,en,en,

After the fifth cycle of chemotherapy (FCR: fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab and prednisone) the 63-year-old patient developed night sweat, arthralgia in elbows, wrists, proximal interphalangeal joints (PIPs) and strong neuropathic pain in both legs, followed by paresthesia and hypesthesia in the feet, arms and face. Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), a slight elevation of liver enzymes and decreased IgG levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a lymphomononuclear pleocytosis and an elevation of protein. A broad diagnostic work-up was negative including a negative Borrelia IgG and IgM ELISA. The patient did not remember recent tick bites, but after specific questioning he recollected a transient erythema on his leg developing just before the start of the last cycle of chemotherapy. As the combination of neuropathic pain and arthralgia, the transient erythema and the lymphomononuclear pleocytosis raised the suspicion of Lyme neuroborreliosis, the patient was treated for 3 weeks with ceftriaxone. On therapy all symptoms resolved and CRP normalized. Retrospective PCR analysis of a CSF sample confirmed the clinical diagnosis by detecting Borrelia garinii DNA. This case demonstrates that in immunosuppressed patients borrelial serology may be negative and that additional diagnostic approaches (including tests for direct Borrelia detection) may be needed to demonstrate borrelial infection.",1584,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Reports on patients with European Lyme borreliosis in whom borreliae were isolated from the blood are rare and nearly exclusively limited to those with solitary or multiple erythema migrans. Here we report on patients with other manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in whom borreliae were isolated from their blood. Patients and methods. This is a retrospective review of the medical files of patients diagnosed with borrelial lymphocytoma, Lyme neuroborreliosis, Lyme arthritis and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the UMC Ljubljana, Slovenia, for whom a borrelia blood culture was ordered. The clinical features of patients whose blood culture tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato were reviewed, and the association between the proportion of patients with a positive blood culture and various clinical manifestations was examined. Results. Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was isolated from the blood of 1/53 (1.9%) patients with borrelial lymphocytoma, 6/176 (3.4%) patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis, 1/13 (7.7%) patients with Lyme arthritis, and 3/200 (1.5%) patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. The time interval from the onset of symptoms attributed to Lyme borreliosis and the blood culture ranged from 1 day to >2 years (median 3.5 weeks). At the time of the blood culture, erythema migrans was present in 4/11 (36.4%) borrelia blood culture-positive patients, i.e. in the patient with borrelial lymphocytoma, the patient with Lyme arthritis and the 2/6 patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis. Only two of these 11 (18.2%) patients had fever at the time of the blood culture. Conclusions. In European patients with Lyme borreliosis, borreliae can be cultured from the blood not only early in the course of the disease but also occasionally later during disease progression.",1865,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Acute transverse myelitis (ATM) is a rare disorder (1–8 new cases per million of population per year), with 20% of all cases occurring in patients younger than 18 years of age. Diagnosis requires clinical symptoms and evidence of inflammation within the spinal cord (cerebrospinal fluid and/or magnetic resonance imaging). ATM due to neuroborreliosis typically presents with impressive clinical manifestations. Case presentation. Here we present a case of Lyme neuroborreliosis-associated ATM with severe MRI and CSF findings, but surprisingly few clinical manifestations and late conversion of the immunoglobulin G CSF/blood index of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. Conclusion. Clinical symptoms and signs of neuroborrelial ATM may be minimal, even in cases with severe involvement of the spine, as shown by imaging studies. The CSF/blood index can be negative in the early stages and does not exclude Lyme neuroborreliosis; if there is strong clinical suspicion of Lyme neuroborreliosis, appropriate treatment should be started and the CSF/blood index repeated to confirm the diagnosis.",1103,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The long-term outcomes were similar between patients with Lyme facial nerve palsy and controls after a median follow-up duration of 4.6 years. Patients with Lyme facial nerve palsy had significantly higher reported rates of fatigue (60%) than controls (27%) ( p = 0.019), but similar energy and vitality scores on the SF-36 questionnaire (55.0 vs. 58.4, p = 0.621). SF-36 social functioning domain scores were significantly lower in patients with Lyme facial nerve palsy (77.5) than in controls (88.6) ( p = 0.044). There were no other significant differences noted between the two cohorts. Conclusions. For patients with Lyme facial nerve palsy in North America, treatment with oral doxycycline appears to be an effective therapeutic strategy.",1490,0,0,1,0,en,en,

 burgdorferi B31 by using PCR to detect each of the plasmids in
 a panel of 19 clonal isolates. The clones exhibited high-, low-, and
 intermediate-infectivity phenotypes based on their frequency of
 isolation from needle-inoculated C3H/HeN mice. Presence or absence of
 21 of the 22 plasmids was determined in each of the clones by using PCR
 primers specific for regions unique to each plasmid, as identified in
 the recently available genome sequence. Southern blot hybridization
 results were used to confirm the PCR results in some cases. Plasmid
 lp25 exhibited a direct correlation with infectivity in that it was
 consistently present in all clones of high or intermediate infectivity

 infectivity; all clones that lacked lp28–1 but contained lp25 had
 an intermediate infectivity phenotype, in which infection was
 primarily restricted to the joints. Plasmids cp9, cp32–3, lp21,
 lp28–2, lp28–4, and lp56 apparently are not required for infection in

The genome of Borrelia burgdorferi encodes a large
 number of lipoproteins, many of which are expressed only at certain
 stages of the spirochete's life cycle. In the current study we
 describe the B. burgdorferi population structure with
 respect to the production of two lipoproteins [outer surface protein A
 (OspA) and outer surface protein C (OspC)] during transmission from
 the tick vector to the mammalian host. Before the blood meal, the
 bacteria in the tick were a homogeneous population that mainly produced
 OspA only. During the blood meal, the population became more
 heterogeneous; many bacteria produced both OspA and OspC, whereas
 others produced only a single Osp and a few produced neither Osp. From
 the heterogeneous spirochetal population in the gut, a subset depleted
 of OspA entered the salivary glands and stably infected the host at
 time points >53 hr into the blood meal. We also examined genetic
 heterogeneity at the B. burgdorferi vlsE locus before
 and during the blood meal. In unfed ticks, the vlsE locus was stable and one predominant and two minor alleles were
 detected. During the blood meal, multiple vlsE alleles
 were observed in the tick. Tick feeding may increase recombination at
 the vlsE locus or selectively amplify rare vlsE alleles present in unfed ticks. On the basis of our
 data we propose a model, which is different from the established model
 for B. burgdorferi transmission. Implicit in our model
 is the concept that tick transmission converts a homogeneous spirochete
 population into a heterogeneous population that is poised to infect the

Insertion of lysine during protein synthesis depends on the enzyme lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS), which exists in two unrelated forms, LysRS1 and LysRS2. LysRS1 has been found in most archaea and some bacteria, and LysRS2 has been found in eukarya, most bacteria, and a few archaea, but the two proteins are almost never found together in a single organism. Comparison of structures of LysRS1 and LysRS2 complexed with lysine suggested significant differences in their potential to bind lysine analogues with backbone replacements. One such naturally occurring compound, the metabolic intermediate S -(2-aminoethyl)- l -cysteine, is a bactericidal agent incorporated during protein synthesis via LysRS2. In vitro tests showed that S -(2-aminoethyl)- l -cysteine is a poor substrate for LysRS1, and that it inhibits LysRS1 200-fold less effectively than it inhibits LysRS2. In vivo inhibition by S -(2-aminoethyl)- l -cysteine was investigated by replacing the endogenous LysRS2 of Bacillus subtilis with LysRS1 from the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. B. subtilis strains producing LysRS1 alone were relatively insensitive to growth inhibition by S -(2-aminoethyl)- l -cysteine, whereas a WT strain or merodiploid strains producing both LysRS1 and LysRS2 showed significant growth inhibition under the same conditions. These growth effects arising from differences in amino acid recognition could contribute to the distribution of LysRS1 and LysRS2 in different organisms. More broadly, these data demonstrate how diversity of the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases prevents infiltration of the genetic code by noncanonical amino acids, thereby providing a natural reservoir of potential antibiotic resistance.",1724,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Comparative genomics of closely related bacterial isolates is a powerful method for uncovering virulence and other important genome elements. We determined draft sequences (8-fold coverage) of the genomes of strains JD1 and N40 of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto , the causative agent of Lyme disease, and we compared the predicted genes from the two genomes with those from the previously sequenced B31 genome. The three genomes are closely related and are evolutionarily approximately equidistant (≈0.5% pairwise nucleotide differences on the main chromosome). We used a Poisson model of nucleotide substitution to screen for genes with elevated levels of nucleotide polymorphisms. The three-way genome comparison allowed distinction between polymorphisms introduced by mutations and those introduced by recombination using the method of phylogenetic partitioning. Tests for recombination suggested that patches of high-density nucleotide polymorphisms on the chromosome and plasmids arise by DNA exchange. The role of recombination as the main mechanism driving B. burgdorferi diversification was confirmed by multilocus sequence typing of 18 clinical isolates at 18 polymorphic loci. A strong linkage between the multilocus sequence genotypes and the major alleles of outer-surface protein C ( ospC ) suggested that balancing selection at ospC is a dominant force maintaining B. burgdorferi diversity in local populations. We conclude that B. burgdorferi undergoes genome-wide genetic exchange, including plasmid transfers, and previous reports of its clonality are artifacts from the use of geographically and ecological isolated samples. Frequent recombination implies a potential for rapid adaptive evolution and a possible polygenic basis of B. burgdorferi pathogenicity. balancing selection ospC Lyme disease Stevens' test",1844,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The interaction between humans and ticks are at the very core of our understanding of the epidemiology of tick borne zoonoses, but only few experimental studies have been performed. Hence our understanding of the epidemiology of tick-borne disease has to rest on the assumption that the potential tick activity, which is reflected in tick samples from the vegetation or samples from animals, corresponds with tick–human interaction. Observations which may reflect the long term tick–human contact are available in Denmark. These observations are records of requests for information on I. ricinus forwarded to the Danish Pest Infestation Laboratory (DPIL). This article was based on the assumption that the request could be seen as a measure of tick–human interaction reflecting the tick densities in relative terms. The perceived tick densities given by the number of requests on I. ricinus divided by the total number of requests to DPIL was fairly stable from 1965 to 1985, while it doubled during the late 1980’s reaching a higher level in the beginning of the 1990’s. The perceived density was well explained by the variation in temperature, solar radiation (monthly measurement) and deer abundance (yearly assessments). The measure of deviation, i.e. the ratio between observed requests +1 and modelled requests +1, for the individual years varied between 0.91 and 1.20, with considerable within-year variation.

The results show that macromolecular crowding affects protein-folding dynamics as well as overall protein shape. In crowded milieus, distinct conformational changes in VlsE are accompanied by secondary structure alterations that lead to exposure of a hidden antigenic region.

Phagocytosed Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) induces inflammatory signals that differ both quantitatively and qualitatively from those generated by spirochetal lipoproteins interacting with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1/2 on the surface of human monocytes. Of particular significance, and in contrast to lipoproteins, internalized spirochetes induce transcription of IFN-β. Using inhibitory immunoregulatory DNA sequences (IRSs) specific to TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, we show that the TLR8 inhibitor IRS957 significantly diminishes production of TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 and completely abrogates transcription of IFN-β in Bb-stimulated monocytes. We demonstrate that live Bb induces transcription of TLR2 and TLR8, whereas IRS957 interferes with their transcriptional regulation. Using confocal and epifluorescence microscopy, we show that baseline TLR expression in unstimulated monocytes is greater for TLR2 than for TLR8, whereas expression of both TLRs increases significantly upon stimulation with live spirochetes. By confocal microscopy, we show that TLR2 colocalization with Bb coincides with binding, uptake, and formation of the phagosomal vacuole, whereas recruitment of both TLR2 and TLR8 overlaps with degradation of the spirochete. We provide evidence that IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 is translocated into the nucleus of Bb-infected monocytes, suggesting its activation through phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings indicate that the phagosome is an efficient platform for the recognition of diverse ligands; in the case of Bb, phagosomal signaling involves a cooperative interaction between TLR2 and TLR8 in pro- and antiinflammatory cytokine responses, whereas TLR8 is solely responsible for IRF7-mediated induction of IFN-β.",1747,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Although the global climate is changing at an unprecedented rate, links between weather and infectious disease have received little attention in high income countries. The “El Niño Southern Oscillation” (ENSO) occurs irregularly and is associated with changing temperature and precipitation patterns. We studied the impact of ENSO on infectious diseases in four census regions in the United States. We evaluated infectious diseases requiring hospitalization using the US National Hospital Discharge Survey (1970–2010) and five disease groupings that may undergo epidemiological shifts with changing climate: ( i ) vector-borne diseases, ( ii ) pneumonia and influenza, ( iii ) enteric disease, ( iv ) zoonotic bacterial disease, and (v) fungal disease. ENSO exposure was based on the Multivariate ENSO Index. Distributed lag models, with adjustment for seasonal oscillation and long-term trends, were used to evaluate the impact of ENSO on disease incidence over lags of up to 12 mo. ENSO was associated more with vector-borne disease [relative risk (RR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03–8.48] and less with enteric disease (0.73, 95% CI 0.62–0.87) in the Western region; the increase in vector-borne disease was attributable to increased risk of rickettsioses and tick-borne infectious diseases. By contrast, ENSO was associated with more enteric disease in non-Western regions (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02–1.15). The periodic nature of ENSO may make it a useful natural experiment for evaluation of the impact of climatic shifts on infectious disease risk. The impact of ENSO suggests that warmer temperatures and extreme variation in precipitation events influence risks of vector-borne and enteric disease in the United States.",1741,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The mechanisms that sustain long-term survival of this bacterium are largely unknown. Here we report a unique innate immune evasion strategy of B. burgdorferi , orchestrated by a surface protein annotated as BBA57, through its modulation of multiple spirochete virulent determinants. BBA57 function is critical for early infection but largely redundant for later stages of spirochetal persistence, either in mammals or in ticks. The protein influences host IFN responses as well as suppresses multiple host microbicidal activities involving serum complement, neutrophils, and antimicrobial peptides. We also discovered a remarkable plasticity in BBA57-mediated spirochete immune evasion strategy because its loss, although resulting in near clearance of pathogens at the inoculum site, triggers nonheritable adaptive changes that exclude detectable nucleotide alterations in the genome but incorporate transcriptional reprograming events.

In this study, we investigated how infection with the Lyme disease-causing bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ) affects host metabolic pathways and how these metabolic pathways may impact host defense. First, metabolome analysis was performed on human primary monocytes from healthy volunteers, stimulated for 24 h with Bb at low multiplicity of infection (MOI). Pathway analysis indicated that glutathione (GSH) metabolism was the pathway most significantly affected by Bb . Specifically, intracellular levels of GSH increased on average 10-fold in response to Bb exposure. Furthermore, these changes were found to be specific, as they were not seen during stimulation with other pathogens. Next, metabolome analysis was performed on serum samples from patients with early-onset Lyme disease in comparison with patients with other infections. Supporting the in vitro analysis, we identified a cluster of GSH-related metabolites, the γ-glutamyl amino acids, specifically altered in patients with Lyme disease, and not in other infections. Lastly, we performed in vitro experiments to validate the role for GSH metabolism in host response against Bb. We found that the GSH pathway is essential for Bb -induced cytokine production and identified glutathionylation as a potential mediating mechanism. Taken together, these data indicate a central role for the GSH pathway in the host response to Bb . GSH metabolism and glutathionylation may therefore be important factors in the pathogenesis of Lyme disease and potentially other inflammatory diseases as well.",1669,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Although the north-eastern region of Poland is considered typical for D. reticulatus and is treated as a contiguous area of Eastern populations of the meadow ticks, the occurrence of this tick species in this region to date has been recorded as separate foci. The present report supplements data on the geographical distribution of D. reticulatus in urban and natural biotopes of north-eastern Poland (Warmia and Mazury province). In 2015–2017 (during the springtime activity of ticks) adult questing D. reticulatus were found in 13 of 25 monitored localities. Six sites are located in urbanized areas, within the administrative borders of the city of Olsztyn and seven sites are in natural biotopes in the central part of Warmia and Mazury. A total of 398 adult D. reticulatus ticks, including 257 females and 141 males, were collected. A comparison of data grouped according to urban and natural type of area revealed no statistical differences between them. Taking into account the habitat type, the mean tick density was the highest in open landscapes. The identification of new foci D. reticulatus in the endemic areas of Lyme borreliosis, tick-borne encephalitis and canine babesiosis is crucial for determining the risk of diseases transmitted by ticks and taking proper preventive measures.",1375,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We aimed at providing (1) estimates of life stage and sex specific (larvae, nymphs, males and females, hereafter referred to as tick life stages) total Ixodes burden and (2) equations which can be used to predict the total life stage burden by counting the life stage on a selected body area. Within a period of 1½ years, we conducted whole body counts of ticks from 80 hunter-killed roe deer originating from a beech dominated forest area in central Germany. Averaged over the entire study period (winter 2007–summer 2009), the mean tick burden per roe deer was 64.5 (SE ± 10.6). Nymphs were the most numerous tick life stage per roe deer (23.9 ± 3.2), followed by females (21.4 ± 3.5), larvae (10.8 ± 4.2) and males (8.4 ± 1.5). The individual tick burden was highly aggregated ( k = 0.46); levels of aggregation were highest in larvae ( k = 0.08), followed by males ( k = 0.40), females ( k = 0.49) and nymphs ( k = 0.71). To predict total life stage specific burdens based on counts on selected body parts, we provide linear equations. For estimating larvae abundance on the entire roe deer, counts can be restricted to the front legs. Tick counts restricted to the head are sufficient to estimate total nymph burden and counts on the neck are appropriate for estimating adult ticks (females and males). In order to estimate the combined tick burden, tick counts on the head can be used for extrapolation. The presented linear models are highly significant and explain 84.1, 77.3, 90.5, 91.3, and 65.3% (adjusted R 2 ) of the observed variance, respectively. Thus, these models offer a robust basis for rapid tick abundance assessment.

The different development stages showed rather consistent attachment site patterns and relative narrow feeding site niches. Larvae were mostly found on the head and on the front legs of roe deer, nymphs reached highest densities on the head and highest adult densities were found on the neck of roe deer. The tick stages feeding (larvae, nymphs, females) on roe deer showed high degrees of intrastadial spatial aggregation, whereas males did not. Male ticks showed large feeding site overlap with female ticks. Feeding site overlap between larval-female and larval-nymphal ticks did occur especially during the months May–August on the head and front legs of roe deer and might allow pathogen transmission via co-feeding. Tick density, niche width and niche overlap on roe deer are mainly affected by seasonality, reflecting seasonal activity and abundance patterns of ticks.

Antibiotic treatment-resistant Lyme arthritis is a chronic inflammatory joint disease that follows infection with Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ). A marked Ab and T cell response to Bb outer surface protein A (OspA) often develops during prolonged episodes of arthritis. Furthermore, cross-reaction between the bacterial OspA and human LFA-1α L at the T cell level and the inability to detect Bb in the joint implicate an autoimmune mechanism. To analyze the nature of response to OspA and LFA-1α L , we used OspA-specific T cell hybrids from DR4 transgenic mice, as well as cloned human cells specific for OspA 165–184 , the immunodominant epitope, from five DRB1*0401 + patients, using OspA-MHC class II tetramers. Although OspA 165–184 stimulated nearly all OspA-specific human T cell clones tested to proliferate and secrete IFN-γ and IL-13, LFA-1α L326–345 stimulated ∼10% of these clones to proliferate and a greater percentage to secrete IL-13. Assays with LFA- or OspA-DR4 monomers revealed that higher concentrations of LFA-DR4 were needed to stimulate dual-reactive T cell hybrids. Our analysis at the clonal level demonstrates that human LFA-1α L326–345 behaves as a partial agonist, perhaps playing a role in perpetuating symptoms of arthritis.",1262,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease agent, causes joint inflammation in an experimental murine model. Inflammation occurs, in part, due to the ability of B. burgdorferi to induce the production of proinflammatory cytokines and a strong CD4 + T helper type 1 response. The mechanisms by which spirochetes induce these responses are not completely known, although transcription factors, such as NF-κB in phagocytic cells, initiate the proinflammatory cytokine burst. We show here that the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase of 38 kDa (p38 MAP kinase) is involved in the proinflammatory cytokine production elicited by B. burgdorferi Ags in phagocytic cells and the development of murine Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi Ags activated p38 MAP kinase in vitro, and the use of a specific inhibitor repressed the spirochete-induced production of TNF-α. The infection of mice that are deficient for a specific upstream activator of the kinase, MAP kinase kinase 3, resulted in diminished proinflammatory cytokine production and the development of arthritis, without compromising the ability of CD4 + T cells to respond to borrelial Ags or the production of specific Abs. Overall, these data indicated that the p38 MAP kinase pathway plays an important role in B. burgdorferi -elicited inflammation and point to potential new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of inflammation induced by the spirochete.",1416,0,0,1,0,en,en,

To assess the contribution of TLR signaling in the host response to Borrelia burgdorferi , mice deficient in the common TLR adaptor protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), were infected with B. burgdorferi . MyD88-deficient mice harbored extremely high levels of B. burgdorferi in tissues when compared with wild-type littermates and greater amounts of spirochetes in tissues than TLR2-deficient mice. These findings suggest that, in addition to TLR2, other MyD88-dependent pathways play a significant role in the host defense to B. burgdorferi . MyD88 −/− mice maintained the ability to produce Abs directed against B. burgdorferi . Partial clearance of spirochetes was evident in long term infection studies and immune sera from MyD88-deficient mice were able to protect naive mice from infection with B. burgdorferi . Thus, the acquired immune response appeared to be functional in MyD88 −/− mice, and the inability to control spirochete numbers was due to a failure of cells involved in innate defenses. Although macrophages from MyD88 −/− mice responded poorly to Borrelia sonicate in vitro, MyD88 −/− mice still developed an inflammatory arthritis after infection with B. burgdorferi characterized by an influx of neutrophils and mononuclear cells.

The murine model of Lyme disease provides a unique opportunity to study the localized host response to similar stimulus, Borrelia burgdorferi , in the joints of mice destined to develop severe arthritis (C3H) or mild disease (C57BL/6). Pathways associated with the response to infection and the development of Lyme arthritis were identified by global gene expression patterns using oligonucleotide microarrays. A robust induction of IFN-responsive genes was observed in severely arthritic C3H mice at 1 wk of infection, which was absent from mildly arthritic C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, infected C57BL/6 mice displayed a novel expression profile characterized by genes involved in epidermal differentiation and wound repair, which were decreased in the joints of C3H mice. These expression patterns were associated with disease state rather than inherent differences between C3H and C57BL/6 mice, because C57BL/6-IL-10 −/− mice infected with B. burgdorferi develop more severe arthritis than C57BL/6 mice and displayed an early gene expression profile similar to C3H mice. Gene expression profiles at 2 and 4 wk postinfection revealed a common response of all strains that was likely to be important for the host defense to B. burgdorferi and mediated by NF-κB-dependent signaling. The gene expression profiles identified in this study add to the current understanding of the host response to B. burgdorferi and identify two novel pathways that may be involved in regulating the severity of Lyme arthritis.",1515,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In the peritoneal cavity, a further loss was demonstrated early in response to B. crocidurae in the B1b, B1c, and B2 cell subsets, but B1a cells were not significantly altered. The loss of B1c and B2 cells was sustained through subsequent peaks of spirochetemia, suggesting these subsets may be important in resolving relapsing episodes. In contrast, an early and significant increase in peritoneal B1a, B1b, and B1c cells, but not B2 cells, occurred in response to B. burgdorferi . Later in the course of infection, both species of Borrelia induced the selective expansion of peritoneal B1b cells, suggesting that B1b cells may participate in long-lasting immunity to Lyme and relapsing fever spirochetes. Our data demonstrate that different Borrelia can activate the same B cell subsets in distinct ways and they each elicit a complex interplay of MZ and multiple peritoneal B cell subsets in the early response to infection.",1638,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The present study demonstrates that extracellular, live spirochetes accumulate in the cortical areas of lymph nodes following infection of mice with either host-adapted, or tick-borne B. burgdorferi and that they, but not inactivated spirochetes, drive the lymphadenopathy. The ensuing lymph node response is characterized by strong, rapid extrafollicular B cell proliferation and differentiation to plasma cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis, while germinal center reactions were not consistently observed. The extrafollicular nature of this B cell response and its strongly IgM-skewed isotype profile bear the hallmarks of a T-independent response. The induced B cell response does appear, however, to be largely antigen-specific. Use of a cocktail of recombinant, in vivo -expressed B. burgdorferi -antigens revealed the robust induction of borrelia-specific antibody-secreting cells by ELISPOT. Furthermore, nearly a quarter of hybridomas generated from regional lymph nodes during acute infection showed reactivity against a small number of recombinant Borrelia-antigens. Finally, neither the quality nor the magnitude of the B cell responses was altered in mice lacking the Toll-like receptor adaptor molecule MyD88. Together, these findings suggest a novel evasion strategy for B. burgdorferi : subversion of the quality of a strongly induced, potentially protective borrelia-specific antibody response via B. burdorferi 's accumulation in lymph nodes.",1758,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Risk factors for the widely endemic and much-debated tick-borne infection, Lyme borreliosis (LB), are unknown. The mannose-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of the complement cascade has an essential role in the eradication of Borrelia burgdorferi . A sufficient concentration of biologically active MBL in body fluids is an indicator of proper function of the MBL pathway. In this study, we investigated whether impaired MBL pathway function, represented by reduced serum MBL concentration, predisposes individuals to LB. First, we determined a serum MBL concentration cut-off level associated with diminished MBL pathway function in a group of 201 individuals. Then, we identified 350 borrelia Ab + LB patient serum samples and 350 Ab − control samples from the archives of our laboratory and measured serum MBL concentrations in both sample groups. The concentration data were analyzed statistically using logistic regression, controlling for MBL cut-off, age, gender, and age and gender interaction. Serum MBL concentrations < 787 and < 445 ng/ml were associated with diminished and deficient MBL pathway function, respectively. Using these cut-offs, diminished (41.4 versus 27.4%, p = 0.0027) and deficient (26.3 versus 17.1%, p = 0.0361) MBL pathway functions were observed statistically more frequently in the LB patient samples than in the control samples. Also, the age-adjusted median serum MBL concentrations were significantly lower in the LB patient samples than in the non-LB controls. Our findings indicate that a deficiency in the MBL pathway of the complement cascade is a risk factor for developing disseminated Ab + LB.",1643,0,0,1,0,en,en,

These bacteria exist in nature as obligate parasites in an enzootic cycle between small vertebrate hosts and Ixodid tick vectors, with humans representing incidental hosts. During the natural enzootic cycle, infected ticks in endemic areas feed not only upon naïve hosts, but also upon seropositive infected hosts. In the current study, we considered this environmental parameter and assessed the impact of the immune status of the blood-meal host on the phenotype of the Lyme disease spirochete within the tick vector. We found that blood from a seropositive host profoundly attenuates the infectivity (>10 4 fold) of homologous spirochetes within the tick vector without killing them. This dramatic neutralization of vector-borne spirochetes was not observed, however, when ticks and blood-meal hosts carried heterologous B . burgdorferi s.l. strains, or when mice lacking humoral immunity replaced wild-type mice as blood-meal hosts in similar experiments. Mechanistically, serum-mediated neutralization does not block induction of host-adapted OspC+ spirochetes during tick feeding, nor require tick midgut components. Significantly, this study demonstrates that strain-specific antibodies elicited by B . burgdorferi s.l. infection neutralize homologous bacteria within feeding ticks, before the Lyme disease spirochetes enter a host. The blood meal ingested from an infected host thereby prevents super-infection by homologous spirochetes, while facilitating transmission of heterologous B . burgdorferi s.l. strains. This finding suggests that Lyme disease spirochete diversity is stably maintained within endemic populations in local geographic regions through frequency-dependent selection of rare alleles of dominant polymorphic surface antigens.",1949,0,0,1,0,en,en,

T cells predominate the immune responses in the synovial fluid of patients with persistent Lyme arthritis; however, their role in Lyme disease remains poorly defined. Using a murine model of persistent Lyme arthritis, we observed that bystander activation of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells leads to arthritis-promoting IFN-γ, similar to the inflammatory environment seen in the synovial tissue of patients with posttreatment Lyme disease. TCR transgenic mice containing monoclonal specificity toward non– Borrelia epitopes confirmed that bystander T cell activation was responsible for disease development. The microbial pattern recognition receptor TLR2 was upregulated on T cells following infection, implicating it as marker of bystander T cell activation. In fact, T cell–intrinsic expression of TLR2 contributed to IFN-γ production and arthritis, providing a mechanism for microbial-induced bystander T cell activation during infection. The IL-10–deficient mouse reveals a novel TLR2-intrinsic role for T cells in Lyme arthritis, with potentially broad application to immune pathogenesis.",1096,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Tick-to-vertebrate host transmission requires that Bbsl survives during blood feeding. Complement is an important innate host defense in blood and interstitial fluid. Bbsl produces a polymorphic surface protein, CspA, that binds to a complement regulator, Factor H (FH) to block complement activation in vitro . However, the role that CspA plays in the Bbsl enzootic cycle remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that different CspA variants promote spirochete binding to FH to inactivate complement and promote serum resistance in a host-specific manner. Utilizing a tick-to-mouse transmission model, we observed that a cspA -knockout B . burgdorferi is eliminated from nymphal ticks in the first 24 hours of feeding and is unable to be transmitted to naïve mice. Conversely, ectopically producing CspA derived from B . burgdorferi or B . afzelii , but not B . garinii in a cspA -knockout strain restored spirochete survival in fed nymphs and tick-to-mouse transmission. Furthermore, a CspA point mutant, CspA-L246D that was defective in FH-binding, failed to survive in fed nymphs and at the inoculation site or bloodstream in mice. We also allowed those spirochete-infected nymphs to feed on C3 -/- mice that lacked functional complement. The cspA -knockout B . burgdorferi or this mutant strain complemented with cspA variants or cspA-L246D was found at similar levels as wild type B . burgdorferi in the fed nymphs and mouse tissues. These novel findings suggest that the FH-binding activity of CspA protects spirochetes from complement-mediated killing in fed nymphal ticks, which ultimately allows Bbsl transmission to mammalian hosts.",1884,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Infection of mice with Borrelia burgdorferi causes an inflammatory arthritis that peaks 3–4 wk postinfection and then spontaneously resolves. Although the recruitment of neutrophils is known to drive the development of arthritis, mechanisms of disease resolution remain unclear. Efficient clearance of apoptotic cells (AC) is likely an important component of arthritis resolution. In this article, we show the number of AC increases in the joints of B. burgdorferi –infected mice around day 21 postinfection and peaks around day 28. Injection of AC directly into the ankles of B. burgdorferi –infected mice limited ankle swelling but had no effect on spirochete clearance or arthritis severity scores. In vitro, addition of AC to bone marrow macrophage cultures decreased B. burgdorferi –induced TNF-α and KC and increased IL-10. In addition, phagocytosis of B. burgdorferi and neutrophil migration to LTB 4 were inhibited by AC. Exogenous AC caused an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) expression both in vitro and in vivo during B. burgdorferi infection. The PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone elicited similar changes in macrophage cytokine production and neutrophil migration as exogenous AC. Addition of the PPAR-γ antagonist GW 9662 abrogated the effects of AC in vitro. Injection of rosiglitazone directly into the tibiotarsal joints of B. burgdorferi –infected mice decreased ankle swelling and immune cell recruitment, similar to the injection of AC. These results suggest that clearance of AC plays a role in the resolution of inflammation during experimental Lyme arthritis through the activation of PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ agonists, such as rosiglitazone, may therefore be effective treatments for inducing arthritis resolution.",1767,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In this study we investigated the function of BBK32 orthologues of the Lyme-associated Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, designated BAD16 from B . afzelii strain PGau and BGD19 from B . garinii strain IP90. Our data show that B . afzelii BAD16-C exhibits BBK32-C-like activities in all assays tested, including high-affinity binding to purified C1r protease and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. Recombinant B . garinii BGD19-C also bound C1 and C1r with high-affinity yet exhibited significantly reduced in vitro complement inhibitory activities relative to BBK32-C or BAD16-C. Interestingly, natively produced BGD19 weakly recognized C1r relative to BBK32 and BAD16 and, unlike these proteins, BGD19 did not confer significant protection from serum killing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to convert BBK32-C to resemble BGD19-C at three residue positions that are identical between BBK32 and BAD16 but different in BGD19. The resulting chimeric protein was designated BXK32-C and this BBK32-C variant mimicked the properties observed for BGD19-C. To query the disparate complement inhibitory activities of BBK32 orthologues, the crystal structure of BBK32-C was solved to 1.7Å limiting resolution. BBK32-C adopts an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the helical core. The structure revealed that the three residues targeted in the BXK32-C chimera are surface-exposed, further supporting their potential relevance in C1r binding and inhibition. Additional binding assays showed that BBK32-C only recognized C1r fragments containing the serine protease domain. The structure-function studies reported here improve our understanding of how BBK32 recognizes and inhibits C1r and provide new insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spirochetes of the B . burgdorferi sensu lato complex.",2107,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The protein players and molecular mechanism of recombinational switching at vlsE have not been characterized. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the independent disruption of 17 genes that encode factors involved in DNA recombination, repair or replication on recombinational switching at the vlsE locus during murine infection. In Neisseria gonorrhoeae , 10 such genes have been implicated in recombinational switching at the pilE locus. Eight of these genes, including recA , are either absent from B. burgdorferi , or do not show an obvious requirement for switching at vlsE . The only genes that are required in both organisms are ruvA and ruvB , which encode subunits of a Holliday junction branch migrase. Disruption of these genes results in a dramatic decrease in vlsE recombination with a phenotype similar to that observed for lp28-1 or vls- minus spirochetes: productive infection at week 1 with clearance by day 21. In SCID mice, the persistence defect observed with ruvA and ruvB mutants was fully rescued as previously observed for vlsE -deficient B. burgdorferi . We report the requirement of the RuvAB branch migrase in recombinational switching at vlsE , the first essential factor to be identified in this process. These findings are supported by the independent work of Lin et al. in the accompanying article, who also found a requirement for the RuvAB branch migrase. Our results also indicate that the mechanism of switching at vlsE in B. burgdorferi is distinct from switching at pilE in N. gonorrhoeae , which is the only other organism analyzed genetically in detail. Finally, our findings suggest a unique mechanism for switching at vlsE and a role for currently unidentified B. burgdorferi proteins in this process.",2433,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Ouyang', 'affiliation': 'UT Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, United States'}]",10.1371/journal.ppat.1001272,2011.0,80,Article,"In Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the Lyme disease spirochete, the alternative σ factor σ 54 (RpoN) directly activates transcription of another alternative σ factor, σ S (RpoS) which, in turn, controls the expression of virulence-associated membrane lipoproteins. As is customary in σ 54 -dependent gene control, a putative NtrC-like enhancer-binding protein, Rrp2, is required to activate the RpoN-RpoS pathway. However, recently it was found that rpoS transcription in Bb also requires another regulator, BosR, which was previously designated as a Fur or PerR homolog. Given this unexpected requirement for a second activator to promote σ 54 -dependent gene transcription, and the fact that regulatory mechanisms among similar species of pathogenic bacteria can be strain-specific, we sought to confirm the regulatory role of BosR in a second virulent strain (strain 297) of Bb. Indeed, BosR displayed the same influence over lipoprotein expression and mammalian infectivity for strain Bb 297 that were previously noted for Bb strain B31. We subsequently found that recombinant BosR (rBosR) bound to the rpoS gene at three distinct sites, and that binding occurred despite the absence of consensus Fur or Per boxes. This led to the identification of a novel direct repeat sequence ( TAAATTAAAT ) critical for rBosR binding in vitro . Mutations in the repeat sequence markedly inhibited or abolished rBosR binding. Taken together, our studies provide new mechanistic insights into how BosR likely acts directly on rpoS as a positive transcriptional activator. Additional novelty is engendered by the facts that, although BosR is a Fur or PerR homolog and it contains zinc (like Fur and PerR), it has other unique features that clearly set it apart from these other regulators. Our findings also have broader implications regarding a previously unappreciated layer of control that can be involved in σ 54 –dependent gene regulation in bacteria.",1940,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We previously demonstrated the existence of cholesterol-lipid-rich domains in membranes of the prokaryote, B. burgdorferi , the causative agent of Lyme disease [LaRocca et al. (2010) Cell Host & Microbe 8, 331–342]. Here, we show that these prokaryote membrane domains have the hallmarks of eukaryotic lipid rafts, despite lacking sphingolipids. Substitution experiments replacing cholesterol lipids with a set of sterols, ranging from strongly raft-promoting to raft-inhibiting when mixed with eukaryotic sphingolipids, showed that sterols that can support ordered domain formation are both necessary and sufficient for formation of B. burgdorferi membrane domains that can be detected by transmission electron microscopy or in living organisms by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Raft-supporting sterols were also necessary and sufficient for formation of high amounts of detergent resistant membranes from B. burgdorferi . Furthermore, having saturated acyl chains was required for a biotinylated lipid to associate with the cholesterol-lipid-rich domains in B. burgdorferi , another characteristic identical to that of eukaryotic lipid rafts. Sterols supporting ordered domain formation were also necessary and sufficient to maintain B. burgdorferi membrane integrity, and thus critical to the life of the organism. These findings provide compelling evidence for the existence of lipid rafts and show that the same principles of lipid raft formation apply to prokaryotes and eukaryotes despite marked differences in their lipid compositions.",1739,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We show that the spirochetes can acquire cholesterol from plasma membranes of epithelial cells. In addition, through fluorescent and confocal microscopy combined with biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that B. burgdorferi labeled with the fluorescent cholesterol analog BODIPY-cholesterol or 3 H-labeled cholesterol transfer both cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids to HeLa cells. The transfer occurs through two different mechanisms, by direct contact between the bacteria and eukaryotic cell and/or through release of outer membrane vesicles. Thus, two-way lipid exchange between spirochetes and host cells can occur. This lipid exchange could be an important process that contributes to the pathogenesis of Lyme disease.",967,0,0,0,1,en,en,

To successfully survive and complete its enzootic cycle, B . burgdorferi adapts to diverse hosts by regulating genes required for survival in specific environments. Here we describe the first ever use of transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-seq) to identify genes required for B . burgdorferi survival in its tick host. We found that insertions into 46 genes resulted in a complete loss of recovery of mutants from larval Ixodes ticks. Insertions in an additional 56 genes resulted in a >90% decrease in fitness. The screen identified both previously known and new genes important for larval tick survival. Almost half of the genes required for survival in the tick encode proteins of unknown function, while a significant portion (over 20%) encode membrane-associated proteins or lipoproteins. We validated the results of the screen for five Tn mutants by performing individual competition assays using mutant and complemented strains. To better understand the role of one of these genes in tick survival, we conducted mechanistic studies of bb0017 , a gene previously shown to be required for resistance against oxidative stress. In this study we show that BB0017 affects the regulation of key borrelial virulence determinants. The application of Tn-seq to in vivo screening of B . burgdorferi in its natural vector is a powerful tool that can be used to address many different aspects of the host pathogen interaction.",1590,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Spatial models for predicting disease risk based on environmental factors such as climate and landscape have been developed for a number of important vector-borne diseases. The resulting risk maps have proven value for highlighting areas for targeting public health programs. However, these methods generally only offer technical information on the spatial distribution of disease risk itself, which may be incomplete for making decisions in a complex situation. In prioritizing surveillance and intervention strategies, decision-makers often also need to consider spatially explicit information on other important dimensions, such as the regional specificity of public acceptance, population vulnerability, resource availability, intervention effectiveness, and land use. There is a need for a unified strategy for supporting public health decision making that integrates available data for assessing spatially explicit disease risk, with other criteria, to implement effective prevention and control strategies. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a decision support tool that allows for the consideration of diverse quantitative and qualitative criteria using both data-driven and qualitative indicators for evaluating alternative strategies with transparency and stakeholder participation. Here we propose a MCDA-based approach to the development of geospatial models and spatially explicit decision support tools for the management of vector-borne diseases. We describe the conceptual framework that MCDA offers as well as technical considerations, approaches to implementation and expected outcomes. We conclude that MCDA is a powerful tool that offers tremendous potential for use in public health decision-making in general and vector-borne disease management in particular.",1998,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Tick-borne disease is the result of spillover of pathogens into the human population. Traditionally, literature has focused on characterization of tick-borne disease pathogens and ticks in their sylvatic cycles. A limited amount of research has focused on human-tick exposure in this system, especially in the Northeastern United States. Human-tick interactions are crucial to consider when assessing the risk of tick-borne disease since a tick bite is required for spillover to occur. Methods. Citizen scientists collected ticks from the Northeastern US through a free nationwide program. Submitted ticks were identified to species, stage, and sex. Blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis , were tested for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and hard-tick relapsing fever Borrelia . Seasonality of exposure and the citizen science activity during tick exposure was recorded by the citizen scientist. A negative binomial model was fit to predict county level CDC Lyme disease cases in 2016 using citizen science Ixodes scapularis submissions, state, and county population as predictor variables. Results. A total of 3740 submissions, comprising 4261 ticks, were submitted from the Northeastern US and were reported to be parasitizing humans. Of the three species submitted, blacklegged ticks were the most prevalent followed by American dog ticks and lone star ticks. Submissions peaked in May with the majority of exposure occurring during every-day activities. The most common pathogen in blacklegged ticks was B. burgdorferi s.l. followed by hard-tick relapsing fever Borrelia . Negative binomial model performance was best in New England states followed by Middle Atlantic states. Conclusions. Citizen science provides a low-cost and effective methodology for describing the seasonality and characteristics of human-tick exposure. In the Northeastern US, everyday activities were identified as a major mechanism for tick exposure, supporting the role of peri-domestic exposure in tick-borne disease. Citizen science provides a method for broad pathogen and tick surveillance, which is highly related to human disease, allowing for inferences to be made about the epidemiology of tick-borne disease.",2231,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The collection sites included 20 private gardens, nine public recreational parks, the boundaries of 14 sylvatic suburban areas and two footpaths between suburban farmed fields. Generally, numbers of specimens collected along sylvatic suburban areas and at urban sites with dense tree populations were significantly higher than at the other collection sites. Out of 1,394 specimens (865 nymphs, 241 females, 288 males) that were randomly chosen for Borrelia analysis by a simple PCR, 250 (17.9 %) were found to be infected with B. burgdorferi sensu lato. While the infection prevalences varied significantly between females (26.6%), males (12.5%) and nymphs (17.3%), there were no striking differences between sylvatic and unwooded sites. A total of 92.8% of the ticks Borrelia -positive by the simple PCR were also positive in a diagnostic nested PCR. Using genospecies-specific oligonucleotide probes, single Borrelia genospecies infections (91.4%) could be assigned to B. afzelii (39.5%), B. garinii (27.9%), B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (15.6%) and B. valaisiana (8.6%) by DNA hybridization. Various combinations of double infections were observed in 4.3% of the infected ticks. Another 4.3% of the Borrelia infections were untypeable. The B. burgdorferi genospecies distribution in the city area was shown to be variable from site to site and, even more, it was distinct from rural collection sites near Bonn. This is ascribed to a different spectrum of reservoir hosts. Taking into account the infection prevalences of host-seeking ticks in the forested surroundings of Bonn, our study demonstrates that the risk of acquiring Lyme disease after a tick bite in urban/suburban areas is comparably as high as in woodlands outside of the city.",2008,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Several studies have focused on the health effects of blood-sucking ectoparasites on avian hosts, but there is limited information on the effects of ticks on adult and sub-adult birds, which may actively avoid ticks and are likely to present low infestation intensities. We evaluated the effects of the presence of feeding ticks and intensity of infestation on health variables of avian hosts. We also evaluated whether these variables were affected by tick infection by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and by the presence of Borrelia infection on the birds’ skin. Presence of parasite association among ticks, haemosporidea and Borrelia within the bird-host was also tested. We found that infestation by ticks significantly increased heterophyl/lymphocyte ratio in Turdus merula suggesting increased stress. This was especially evident at high infestation intensities when a significant decrease in body mass and body condition (body mass corrected for size) was also observed. Erithacus rubecula infested with more than 10 larvae tended to have lower haematocrit and blood haemoglobin. Plasma globulin concentration in T . merula tended to be affected by the presence of attached ticks and their infection with Borrelia , but this depended on the age of the bird. No association was detected among ticks, haemosporidea and Borrelia infection. We showed that ticks have detrimental effects on their avian hosts even under natural infestation conditions and that confirmed Borrelia reservoir hosts may also present symptoms of infection, though these may be subtle.",1691,0,0,0,1,en,en,

This infection commonly is accompanied by diarrhoea and abdominal pain, but extraintestinal symptoms, such as skin lesions, may also accompany the disease. In this study, our aim was to assess the frequency, clinical symptoms and skin manifestations of confirmed positive Blastocystis sp. infections. Data of 80 patients with confirmed positive Blastocystis sp. infections were assessed retrospectively. The average age of the patients was 46.3 years of age (with a range between 13 and 85 years of age). The number of female patients was higher than the number of males (48 vs. 32; 60 vs. 40 %). Gastrointestinal and dermatological symptoms and the results of routine biochemical and haematological blood tests of enrolled patients were collected and analyzed. The skin manifestations were analyzed using the data available (including descriptions, photos and histologies). We discovered that 11.25 % of our enrolled patients exhibited skin manifestations associated to Blastocystis sp., mainly on the females. The occurrence of Blastocystis sp. was 6 % in symptomatic patients who required medical attendance in the time period between 2005 and 2013. Of the 80 patients, 73.75 % indicated that they had gastrointestinal symptoms: 40 patients complained of abdominal pain and 17 with blood in their stool, while other symptoms, such as meteorism (15 subjects), weigh loss (8 subjects), perianal pain or itching (6 subjects), passing stool with mucus (5 subjects), vomiting (2 subjects) and fever (2 subjects) were less frequent. The prevalence of abdominal pain in the cohort without skin lesions was higher compared to those patients with skin problems ( p = 0.007). The mean value of C-reactive protein showed elevated levels, but eosinophils were within a normal range. In addition, we did not find significant difference in eosinophilia between patients with vs. without skin manifestations. Thus, we suggest that eosinophilia is not an obligatory laboratory finding in protozoon infections, such as Blastocystis sp.

The widespread European tick species Ixodes ricinus represents an important vector for spirochaetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group and Rickettsiales such as Anaplasma phagocytophilum . The meadow or ornate dog tick ( Dermacentor reticulatus ) is an important vector for Babesia canis, as is the brown dog tick ( Rhipicephalus sanguineus ) for Babesia vogeli in the Mediterranean region. The present work covers pathogen transmission by tick vectors, including the mechanisms and the minimum intervals required, in conjunction with possible non-vector-borne transmission routes. It also addresses the incubation periods, pathogenicity and clinical findings associated with each pathogen and genospecies and presents case examples. Current data on prevalence, annual fluctuations and distribution in various pre-selected dog populations (symptomatic versus asymptomatic) in both countries are depicted in maps. Reasons for changes in prevalence (especially of Borrelia ) are discussed. Criteria and algorithms for clinical diagnosis and monitoring in dogs, including case history, direct detection (blood smears, molecular detection by species-specific PCR and sequencing) and indirect methods (whole-cell and peptide-based antibody tests), are presented, together with laboratory abnormalities (haematology, clinical chemistry, urine). The role of anti-C6 antibody concentration (ACAC) and its correlation with proteinuria and Lyme nephritis are assessed on the basis of new data. Consideration is also given to the importance of blood smears, PCR and serology in the case of anaplasmosis and babesiosis, and the diagnostic value of combining these methods. The relevance of molecular differentiation of Anaplasma species ( A. phagocytophilum versus A. platys ) and Babesia spp. (large versus small forms) in cases of serological cross-reaction is emphasized. A summary is given of methods for prophylaxis using acaricide products (collars, spot-on solutions and oral treatments in both countries), vaccination ( Borrelia and Babesia vaccines) and imidocarb-based chemoprophylaxis for large Babesia .",2220,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Small rodents were trapped with Sherman traps in Veneto (NE Italy), where the largest Italian populations of chipmunks occur. A total of 14 individual ticks were found on 223 rodents, with 6 more ticks obtained from stored dead chipmunks from the same study area. Ectoparasites were screened for pathogens by molecular analyses including species-specific PCR amplifications. Rickettsia monacensis , Borrelia lusitaniae , and Anaplasma platys were present in the parasites of both native rodents and introduced chipmunks. The present findings suggest a role for the invasive species E. sibiricus in the maintenance of the Ixodes ricinus life cycle, which may result in the modification of the transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens. Moreover, the presence of Rickettsia in urban populations of chipmunks may represent a serious risk for human health and should be investigated further.",1294,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Clusters by season and locality reveal a striking epidemiological overlap between sporadic schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis (MS). As the birth excesses of those individuals who later in life develop schizophrenia mirror the seasonal distribution of Ixodid ticks, a meta analysis has been performed between all neuropsychiatric birth excesses including MS and the epidemiology of spirochaetal infectious diseases. Results. The prevalence of MS and schizophrenic birth excesses entirely spares the tropical belt where human treponematoses are endemic, whereas in more temperate climates infection rates of Borrelia garinii in ticks collected from seabirds match the global geographic distribution of MS. If the seasonal fluctuations of Lyme borreliosis in Europe are taken into account, the birth excesses of MS and those of schizophrenia are nine months apart, reflecting the activity of Ixodes ricinus at the time of embryonic implantation and birth. In America, this nine months' shift between MS and schizophrenic births is also reflected by the periodicity of Borrelia burgdorferi transmitting Ixodes pacificus ticks along the West Coast and the periodicity of Ixodes scapularis along the East Coast. With respect to Ixodid tick activity, amongst the neuropsychiatric birth excesses only amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) shows a similar seasonal trend. Conclusion. It cannot be excluded at present that maternal infection by Borrelia burgdorferi poses a risk to the unborn. The seasonal and geographical overlap between schizophrenia, MS and neuroborreliosis rather emphasises a causal relation that derives from exposure to a flagellar virulence factor at conception and delivery. It is hoped that the pathogenic correlation of spirochaetal virulence to temperature and heat shock proteins (HSP) might encourage a new direction of research in molecular epidemiology.",1889,0,1,0,0,en,en,

West Nile virus (WNV) poses a significant health risk for residents of Mississippi. Physicians and state health officials are interested in new and efficient methods for monitoring disease spread and predicting future outbreaks. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) models have the potential to support these efforts. Environmental conditions favorable for mosquito habitat were modeled using GIS to derive WNV risk maps for Mississippi. Variables important to WNV dissemination were selected and classified as static and dynamic. The static variables included road density, stream density, slope, and vegetation. The dynamic variable represented seasonal water budget and was calculated using precipitation and evaporation estimates. Significance tests provided deterministic evidence of variable importance to the models. Results. Several models were developed to estimate WNV risk including a landscape-base model and seasonal climatic sub-models. P-values from t-tests guided variable importance ranking. Variables were ranked and weights assigned as follows: road density (0.4), stream density (0.3), slope (0.2) and vegetation (0.1). This landscape-base model was modified by climatic conditions to assess the importance of climate to WNV risk. Human case data at the zip code level were used to validate modeling results. All models were summarized by zip codes for interpretation and model validation. For all models, estimated risk was higher for zip codes with at least one human case than for zip codes where no human cases were recorded. Overall median measure of risk by zip code indicated that 67% of human cases occurred in the high-risk category. Conclusion. Modeling results indicated that dead bird occurrences are correlated with human WNV risk and can facilitate the assessment of environmental variables that contribute to that risk. Each variable's importance in GIS-based risk predictions was assigned deterministically. Our models indicated non-uniform distribution of risk across the state and showed elevated risk in urban and as well as rural areas. Model limitations include resolution of human data, zip code aggregation issues, and quality/availability of vegetation and stream density layers. Our approach verified that WNV risk can be modeled at the state level and can be modified for risk predictions of other vector-borne diseases in varied ecological regions.",2407,0,1,0,0,en,da,

The World Health Organization is supporting many developing countries to eradicate tuberculosis. It is an agony that one fifth of the tuberculosis patients worldwide are in India. The eradication of tuberculosis is the greatest public health challenge for this developing country. The aim of the present population based study on Mycobacterium tuberculosis is to test a large set of tuberculosis cases for the presence of statistically significant geographical clusters. A spatial scan statistic is used to identify purely spatial and space-time clusters of tuberculosis. Results. Significant (p < 0.05 for primary clusters and p < 0.1 for secondary clusters) high rate spatial and space-time clusters were identified in three areas of the district. Conclusion.

Disease maps are used increasingly in the health sciences, with applications ranging from the diagnosis of individual cases to regional and global assessments of public health. However, data on the distributions of emerging infectious diseases are often available from only a limited number of samples. We compared several spatial modelling approaches for predicting the geographic distributions of two tick-borne pathogens: Ehrlichia chaffeensis , the causative agent of human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis, and Anaplasma phagocytophilum , the causative agent of human granulocytotropic anaplasmosis. These approaches extended environmental modelling based on logistic regression by incorporating both spatial autocorrelation (the tendency for pathogen distributions to be clustered in space) and spatial heterogeneity (the potential for environmental relationships to vary spatially). Results. Incorporating either spatial autocorrelation or spatial heterogeneity resulted in substantial improvements over the standard logistic regression model. For E. chaffeensis , which was common within the boundaries of its geographic range and had a highly clustered distribution, the model based only on spatial autocorrelation was most accurate. For A. phagocytophilum , which has a more complex zoonotic cycle and a comparatively weak spatial pattern, the model that incorporated both spatial autocorrelation and spatially heterogeneous relationships with environmental variables was most accurate. Conclusion. Spatial autocorrelation can improve the accuracy of predictive disease risk models by incorporating spatial patterns as a proxy for unmeasured environmental variables and spatial processes. Spatial heterogeneity can also improve prediction accuracy by accounting for unique ecological conditions in different regions that affect the relative importance of environmental drivers on disease risk.",1910,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Maxent models were constructed using geocoded seroprevalence data from surveillance of California ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) as case points and Worldclim bioclimatic data as predictor variables, and compared and validated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) statistics. Additionally, model results were compared to locations of positive and negative coyote ( Canis latrans ) samples, in order to determine the correlation between Maxent model predictions and areas of plague risk as determined via wild carnivore surveillance.

Models of plague activity in California ground squirrels, based on recent climate conditions, accurately identified case locations (AUC of 0.913 to 0.948) and were significantly correlated with coyote samples. The final models were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios. These models suggest that by 2050, climate conditions may reduce plague risk in the southern parts of California and increase risk along the northern coast and Sierras. Conclusion. Because different modeling approaches can yield substantially different results, care should be taken when interpreting future model predictions. Nonetheless, niche modeling can be a useful tool for exploring and mapping the potential response of plague activity to climate change. The final models in this study were used to identify potential plague risk areas based on an ensemble of six future climate scenarios, which can help public managers decide where to allocate surveillance resources. In addition, Maxent model results were significantly correlated with coyote samples, indicating that carnivore surveillance programs will continue to be important for tracking the response of plague to future climate conditions.",2212,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Six dogs served as negative controls (group 1), six dogs served as positive controls (group 2) receiving the original fipronil spot-on (Frontline® spot-on Dog, Merial) at a dosage of 0.67 mL for a dog weighing from 2 to 10 kg and 1.34 mL for a dog weighing from 10.1 to 20 kg and six dogs were treated with a 10% w / v fipronil-based spot-on solution (Effipro® Spot-on, Virbac SA) at an identical dosage (group 3, 0.67 mL for a dog weighing from 2 to 10 kg and 1.34 mL for a dog weighing from 10.1 to 20 kg). Each dog was sedated and subsequently infested with 50 unfed adult I. ricinus on days −7, −2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Forty-eight hours after the treatment and 48 h after each challenge (days −5, 2, 9, 16, 23, 30 and 37), the population of the remaining ticks was assessed for each animal. Geometric mean tick counts obtained were reduced by 99% and 94% on day 2 in groups 2 and 3, respectively, compared to the negative control group. Dogs were protected from re-infestations with an efficacy of >90% for 3 weeks in group 2 and for 5 weeks in group 3.

Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus can cause severe symptoms in humans. The incidence of this vector-borne pathogen in humans is characterised by spatial and temporal heterogeneity. To explain the variation in reported human TBE cases per county in southern Germany, we designed a time-lagged, spatially-explicit model that incorporates ecological, environmental, and climatic factors. Results. We fitted a logistic regression model to the annual counts of reported human TBE cases in each of 140 counties over an eight year period. The model controlled for spatial autocorrelation and unexplained temporal variation. The occurrence of human TBE was found to be positively correlated with the proportions of broad-leafed, mixed and coniferous forest cover. An index of forest fragmentation was negatively correlated with TBE incidence, suggesting that infection risk is higher in fragmented landscapes. The results contradict previous evidence regarding the relevance of a specific spring-time temperature regime for TBE epidemiology. Hunting bag data of roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ) in the previous year was positively correlated with human TBE incidence, and hunting bag density of red fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) and red deer ( Cervus elaphus ) in the previous year were negatively correlated with human TBE incidence. Conclusions. Our approach suggests that a combination of landscape and climatic variables as well as host-species dynamics influence TBE infection risk in humans. The model was unable to explain some of the temporal variation, specifically the high counts in 2005 and 2006. Factors such as the exposure of humans to infected ticks and forest rodent population dynamics, for which we have no data, are likely to be explanatory factors. Such information is required to identify the determinants of TBE more reliably. Having records of TBE infection sites at a finer scale would also be necessary.",1927,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Lyme arthritis is caused in Europe by three main pathogenic species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia garinii , and Borrelia afzelii . Because few synovial samples have yet been analysed by species-specific DNA amplification methods, further studies are needed to define the spectra of clinical manifestations associated with these different species. Two cases of treatment resistant Lyme arthritis are reported here, in which DNA amplification of the flagellin gene followed by dot-blot hybridisation in the synovial fluid identified B garinii as the causative agent. Clinical and biological data did not differ from the usual descriptions of Lyme arthritis, but as the recently reported molecular mimicry between OspA and hLFA1 is not applicable to B garinii , the pathogenesis of the present cases remains unclear.

The long latent stage seen in syphilis, followed by chronic central nervous system infection and inflammation, can be explained by the persistence of atypical cystic and granular forms of Treponema pallidum . We investigated whether a similar situation may occur in Lyme neuroborreliosis. Method. Atypical forms of Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetes were induced exposing cultures of Borrelia burgdorferi (strains B31 and ADB1) to such unfavorable conditions as osmotic and heat shock, and exposure to the binding agents Thioflavin S and Congo red. We also analyzed whether these forms may be induced in vitro , following infection of primary chicken and rat neurons, as well as rat and human astrocytes. We further analyzed whether atypical forms similar to those induced in vitro may also occur in vivo , in brains of three patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis. We used immunohistochemical methods to detect evidence of neuroinflammation in the form of reactive microglia and astrocytes. Results. Under these conditions we observed atypical cystic, rolled and granular forms of these spirochetes. We characterized these abnormal forms by histochemical, immunohistochemical, dark field and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods. The atypical and cystic forms found in the brains of three patients with neuropathologically confirmed Lyme neuroborreliosis were identical to those induced in vitro . We also observed nuclear fragmentation of the infected astrocytes using the TUNEL method. Abundant HLA-DR positive microglia and GFAP positive reactive astrocytes were present in the cerebral cortex. Conclusion. The results indicate that atypical extra- and intracellular pleomorphic and cystic forms of Borrelia burgdorferi and local neuroinflammation occur in the brain in chronic Lyme neuroborreliosis. The persistence of these more resistant spirochete forms, and their intracellular location in neurons and glial cells, may explain the long latent stage and persistence of Borrelia infection. The results also suggest that Borrelia burgdorferi may induce cellular dysfunction and apoptosis. The detection and recognition of atypical, cystic and granular forms in infected tissues is essential for the diagnosis and the treatment as they can occur in the absence of the typical spiral Borrelia form.",2310,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

The chemokine CXCL13 is known to dictate homing and motility of B cells in lymphoid tissue and has been implicated in the formation of ectopic lymphoid tissue in chronic inflammation. Whether it influences B cell trafficking during acute infection, is largely unclear. In previous studies, we showed that (I) CXCL13 levels are markedly increased in the B cell-rich cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with acute Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), and (II) CXCL13 is released by monocytes upon recognition of borrelial outer surface proteins by Toll-like receptor 2. Here, we assessed the role of CXCL13 - in comparison to other chemokines - in the recruitment of B cells to the CSF of patients with acute LNB. Methods. Measurement of chemokines was done by ELISA. B cells were isolated from whole blood using magnetic cell separation (MACS). For migration experiments, a modified Boyden chamber assay was used and the migrated B cells were further analysed by FACS. The migration was inhibited either by preincubation of the CSF samples with neutralizing antibodies, heating to 60°C, removal of proteins >3 kDa, or by pre-treatment of the B cells with pertussis toxin. The principal statistical tests used were one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni test (chemokine measurements) as well as paired Student's t-test (migration experiments). Results. Measurements of chemokine levels revealed an increase in three of the four known major B cell chemoattractants CXCL13, CCL19 and CXCL12 in LNB CSF. The CXCL13 CSF:serum ratio, as a measure of the chemotactic gradient, was substantially higher than that of CCL19 and CXCL12. Moreover, the chemotactic activity of LNB CSF was reduced up to 56% after preincubation with a neutralizing CXCL13 antibody, while combined preincubation with antibodies against CXCL13, CCL19, and CXCL12 did not lead to further reduction. Since treatment with pertussis toxin, heating to 60°C, and removal of proteins >3 kDa abrogated the chemotactic activity, further not yet identified chemokines seem to be involved in B cell recruitment to LNB CSF. Conclusion. Combined, our study suggests a key role of CXCL13 in B cell migration to sites of infection as shown here for the CSF of LNB patients.",2235,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

Previous studies indicate that successful resolution of Lyme neuroborreliosis (NB) is associated with a strong T helper (Th) 1-type cytokine response in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) followed by a down-regulating Th2 response, whereas the role of the recently discovered Th17 cytokine response is unknown. Methods. To investigate the relative contribution of different Th associated cytokine/chemokine responses, we used a multiple bead array to measure the levels of CXCL10 (Th1 marker), CCL22 (Th2 marker), IL-17 (Th17 marker) and CXCL8 (general inflammation marker), in serum and in CSF from untreated patients with confirmed NB (n = 133), and non-NB patients (n = 96), and related the findings to clinical data. Samples from patients with possible early NB (n = 15) and possible late NB (n = 19) were also analysed, as well as samples from an additional control group with orthopaedic patients (n = 17), where CSF was obtained at spinal anaesthesia. Results. The most prominent differences across groups were found in the CSF. IL-17 was elevated in CSF in 49% of the patients with confirmed NB, but was not detectable in the other groups. Patients with confirmed NB and possible early NB had significantly higher CSF levels of CXCL10, CCL22 and CXCL8 compared to both the non-NB group and the control group (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). Patients in the early NB group, showing a short duration of symptoms, had lower CCL22 levels in CSF than did the confirmed NB group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients within the confirmed NB group showing a duration of symptoms <2 weeks, tended to have lower CCL22 levels in CSF than did those with longer symptom duration (p = 0.023). Cytokine/chemokine levels were not correlated with clinical parameters or to levels of anti- Borrelia -antibodies. Conclusion. Our results support the notion that early NB is dominated by a Th1-type response, eventually accompanied by a Th2 response. Interestingly, IL-17 was increased exclusively in CSF from patients with confirmed NB, suggesting a hitherto unknown role for Th17 in NB. However, for conclusive evidence, future prospective studies are needed.",2155,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

Lyme disease was recognized as a separate entity in 1976 because of geographic clustering of children in Lyme, Connecticut who were thought to have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, a presumed autoimmune disease. However, the clustering suggested that they had a previously unrecognized illness, most likely of infectious origin. Lyme borreliosis is now known to be the most common vector-borne disease in the United States and Europe. This tick-borne infection is caused by 3 pathogenic species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato. In the United States, it results exclusively from infection with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (hereafter referred to as B. burgdorferi). Although all 3 species are found in Europe, most of the infection there is caused by B. afzelii or B. garinii. In the U.S., arthritis with intense joint inflammation, especially affecting knees, is a frequent late manifestation of the infection. Moreover, a small percentage of these patients have persistent proliferative synovitis for months to years after 2-3 months of oral and intravenous antibiotics, called antibiotic-refractory arthritis. In contrast, Lyme arthritis occurs infrequently in Europe. When present, it is often associated with minimal joint swelling, and it is not clear whether antibiotic-refractory arthritis is a feature of the infection there. Antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis in the U.S. is associated with an increased frequency of infection with ribosomal RNA intergenic spacer type 1 (RST1) strains of B. burgdorferi, which have a high inflammatory potential. However, this outcome is not thought to result from persistent infection after antibiotic treatment. PCR and culture results for B. burgdorferi have been uniformly negative from synovial tissue obtained from therapeutic synovectomies months after antibiotic therapy. Moreover, re-emergence of infection has not been observed with the use of DMARDs, such as methotrexate or TNF inhibitors, after antibiotic treatment. Instead, risk factors for antibiotic-refractory arthritis include 1) specific HLA-DR alleles, a risk factor commonly associated with autoimmune disease; in this case, the DRB1*0401, 0101, and 1501 alleles are most common, 2) a Toll-like receptor 1 (TLR1) polymorphism that leads to exceptionally high levels of inflammatory chemokines and cytokines in affected joints, particularly, IFNγ and IFNγ-inducible chemokines, and 3) low percentages of CD4+FoxP3+Treg cells in joint fluid. For these reasons, this disease course is postulated to result from infection-induced, site-specific autoimmunity, excessive inflammation and immune dysregulation in joints. We recently used a discovery-based approach to identify autoantigens in patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. Using tandem-mass spectrometry, naturally presented HLA-DR self-peptides from patients’ synovial were identified, synthesized, and reacted with the matching patient’s PBMC. In this way, we recently identified endothelial cell growth factor (ECGF) as an autoantigen that induces T and B cell responses in a subset of patients with antibiotic-refractory arthritis. However, as in rheumatoid arthritis, we suspect that other as-yet-to-be-identified autoantigens could be important in this outcome. Thus, in the U.S., Lyme arthritis is caused by an infectious agent, but in a genetically susceptible subgroup, site-specific autoimmunity may develop.

Laboratory diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) is partly based on the detection of intrathecal Borrelia burgdorferi –specific antibody production (increased antibody index (AI)). However, AI can be negative in patients with early LNB and, conversely, can remain elevated for months after antibiotic treatment. Recent studies suggested that the chemokine CXCL13 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a biomarker for active LNB. Also, CSF neopterin-level determination has been used to assess the degree of neuroinflammation in a wide variety of diseases. Methods. CXCL13 concentrations were analyzed in CSF samples of 366 retrospectively identified individuals. The samples represented pretreatment LNB (38 patients), non-LNB comparison patients, tick-borne encephalitis, central nervous system (CNS) varicella zoster virus infection, CNS herpes simplex virus infection, CNS HHV6 infection, CNS enterovirus infection, and untreated neurosyphilis. The panel included also samples from patients with multiple sclerosis and other neuroinflammatory conditions. Of the LNB patients, 24 posttreatment CSF samples were available for CXCL13 analysis. Neopterin concentrations were determined in a subset of these samples. Results. The CXCL13 concentrations in CSF samples of untreated LNB patients were significantly higher (median, 6,480 pg/ml) than the concentrations in the non-LNB group (median, <7.8 pg/ml), viral CNS infection samples (median, <7.8 pg/ml), or samples from patients with noninfectious neuroinflammatory conditions (median, <7.8 pg/ml). The use of cut-off 415 pg/ml led to a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.7% for the diagnosis of LNB in these samples. CSF CXCL13 median concentrations declined significantly from 16,770 pg/ml before to 109 pg/ml after the treatment. CSF neopterin concentration was significantly higher among the untreated LNB patients than in the non-LNB group. The use of neopterin concentration 10.6 n M as the cut-off led to a sensitivity of 88.6% and a specificity of 65.0% for the diagnosis of LNB. The CSF neopterin concentrations decreased statistically significantly with the treatment. Conclusions. These results clearly indicate that highly elevated CSF CXCL13 levels are strongly associated with untreated LNB. CXCL13 outperformed neopterin and appears to be an excellent biomarker in differentiating LNB from viral CNS infections and from other neuroinflammatory conditions.",2442,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

B cell immunity, including the chemokine CXCL13, has an established role in Lyme neuroborreliosis, and also, T helper (Th) 17 immunity, including IL-17A, has recently been implicated. Methods. We analysed a set of cytokines and chemokines associated with B cell and Th17 immunity in cerebrospinal fluid and serum from clinically well-characterized patients with definite Lyme neuroborreliosis (group 1, n = 49), defined by both cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis and Borrelia -specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and from two groups with possible Lyme neuroborreliosis, showing either pleocytosis (group 2, n = 14) or Borrelia -specific antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (group 3, n = 14). A non-Lyme neuroborreliosis reference group consisted of 88 patients lacking pleocytosis and Borrelia -specific antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Results. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of B cell-associated markers (CXCL13, APRIL and BAFF) were significantly elevated in groups 1, 2 and 3 compared with the reference group, except for BAFF, which was not elevated in group 3. Regarding Th17-associated markers (IL-17A, CXCL1 and CCL20), CCL20 in cerebrospinal fluid was significantly elevated in groups 1, 2 and 3 compared with the reference group, while IL-17A and CXCL1 were elevated in group 1. Patients with time of recovery <3 months had lower cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL-17A, APRIL and BAFF compared to patients with recovery >3 months. Conclusions. By using a set of markers in addition to CXCL13 and IL-17A, we confirm that B cell- and Th17-associated immune responses are involved in Lyme neuroborreliosis pathogenesis with different patterns in subgroups. Furthermore, IL-17A, APRIL and BAFF may be associated with time to recovery after treatment.",1776,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

Currently, the term “Lyme disease” refers to the entire group of etiologically independent ixodic tick-borne borelliosis. More than 13 genomic groups are identified that belong to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group. Only three types of Borrelia are currently considered to be pathogenic for humans: B.burgdorferi sensu stricto, B.garinii and B.afzelii. The nature of organ lesions depends on the species of Borrelia. Adults and school-age children are prone to LD. Children also have three clinical and pathomorphological stages of LD. The diagnosis is carried out step by step: the determination of M and G immunoglobulins using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, with a positive test — confirmation by immunoblotting. The described clinical case is of some interest in terms of late etiological diagnosis, since the course of the disease was without acute period and absence of the main feature — migratory erythema. Etiotropic treatment was started late. References Uchaikin VF, Shamsheva OV. Infektsionnye bolezni u detei [Infectious diseases in children]. Moscow: Geotar-media; 2015. 387-391 pp. (in Russian).

Horbachevsky Ternopil State Medical University, Ternopil, Ukraine, V.O. Kosovska I.

The first cases of Lyme borreliosis in Ukraine are known since 1994. Western Ukraine, including the Ternopil region, is an endemic zone of Lyme borreliosis, because it is located in a zone with fertile soils, temperate continental climate, forest landscapes, which contributes to preservation in the nature of the main reservoir of Borrelia — ixodid ticks. Zones of ixodid tick borreliosis were found in 57 settlements of 14 districts of the region and in the city of Ternopil. Accordingly, every inhabitant of the Ternopil region is potentially infected. The ticks are often infected with several infections that pose a threat to human health and life. The case of Lyme borreliosis was recorded in a Ternopil Region Children’s Clinical Hospital in a 7-year-old child who was admitted with her mother complaints of generalized tonic-clonic seizures for about 2 hours, which arose suddenly against the background of a satisfactory state, followed by loss of consciousness. After the introduction of the sibazon, seizures stopped. About a month ago, the tick bite was detected in the area of the anterior abdominal wall to the left below the umbilicus and the formation of a small itchy papule of 1 cm in diameter in the place of a bite, which increased every day and persisted for about 2 weeks. The edges of the erythema were clear, bright. The child received antibiotic therapy (ceftriaxone) for 1 day. After the treatment, the child is discharged home in a satisfactory condition. Thus, Lyme borreliosis is an actual problem in Ukraine and, in particular, in the Ternopil region. In order to prevent the tick bites, it is mandatory to use closed clothes, repellents when visiting forest park areas. After returning from the forest, it is necessary to conduct a thorough examination of the skin in order to timely detect the tick bites. In case of tick bite, it is necessary to properly remove arthropod and it is advisable to carry out a specific laboratory diagnosis. Observation of patients with Lyme borreliosis should be performed within 1 month. References Andreychyn MA, editor.

The diagnostic approach depends on the form of disease, but clinical diagnosis continues to be preferred among others. The method of choice among laboratory tests is to determine serum antibodies. The causative agent of disease is sensitive to several classes of antibiotics; their choice and dose is based on the syndrome of disease. After the illness, patients may have non-specific symptoms in which additional antibiotic therapy is not recommended. Authors of the following guidelines do not recommend testing ticks for Borrelia burgdorferi after a bite. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is recommended for children and adults for the first 72 hours only in case of a high risk of infection. Adherence to simple personal protection rules, the use of repellents and timely inspection will prevent the development of infection.

In Ukraine, seven species of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. with pathogenic potential are known. Therefore, the annual analysis of the incidence of Lyme di­sease remains relevant. The purpose was to analyze the epidemiological and epizootic features of Lyme disease in 2019 in Ukraine. Materials and methods. State industry statistical reports were used. The packages R-3.5.1 and Past 3.17 were used for statistical analysis. Results. In 2019, the peak of the disease shifted to July. The share of sick children under 4 years of age decreased 3.5 times and the share of school-age children decreased 5.67 times. The number of sick men has increased. The percentage of people with severe disease has doubled to 1.87 %. Outside Ukraine, patients became infected in 103 cases in 21 countries. The algorithm of actions after detection of a tick is resulted. Conclusions. In 2019, 4482 cases of Lyme disease were registered (10.62 per 100 thousand population). The intensive indicator for Ukraine is exceeded in 10 oblasts and Kyiv. The proportion of morbidity of urban residents is gradually decreasing.

How this happens is unknown. We examined the effect of mAb binding on OspB tertiary structure by using limited proteolysis to probe changes in protein conformation. Truncated OspB (tOspB) that lacked N-terminal lipid was cleaved by four enzymes: trypsin, endoproteinase Arg-C, endoproteinase Asp-N, and endoproteinase Glu-C. CB2 affected the cleavage by trypsin and Arg-C, but not by AspN or Glu-C. None of the enzymes cleaved CB2 under these conditions. Both trypsin and Arg-C cleaved tOspB near the N-terminus; CB2 slowed the rate of cleavage, but did not affect the identity of the sites cleaved. Irrelevant mAb had no effect, indicating that the effect was specific. CB2 was active against tOspB of strain B31, but not against tOspB of strain BEP4, to which it does not bind, suggesting that binding was required to elicit the effect on cleavage. With trypsin, CB2 showed a maximal effect at 8 mol of tOspB to 1 mol of mAb. At this ratio, not enough CB2 was present to bind all the tOspB; therefore, either CB2 shows turnover or CB2 acts by binding tOspB and effecting a change in this tOspB such that it, in turn, propagates the effect in other molecules of tOspB. Regardless of the mechanism, these data show that CB2 elicits a change in tOspB that can be measured by its reduced susceptibility to protease cleavage.",1465,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Spirochete adaptation in vivo is associated with preferential Borrelia burgdorferi gene expression. In this paper, we show that the administration of B. burgdorferi -immune sera to IFN-γR-deficient mice that have been infected with B. burgdorferi N40 for 4 days causes spirochete clearance. In contrast, immune sera-mediated clearance of B. burgdorferi N40 is not apparent in immunocompetent mice, suggesting a role for IFN-γ-mediated responses in B. burgdorferi N40 host adaptation. B. burgdorferi- immune sera also induces clearance of B. burgdorferi N40 that have been passaged in vitro 75 times ( B. burgdorferi N40-75), a derivative of B. burgdorferi N40 that does not rapidly adapt in vivo in immunocompetent mice. B. burgdorferi N40-75 produce lower levels of IFN-γ and IL-12 in mice than does B. burgdorferi N40, and the administration of these cytokines to B. burgdorferi N40-75-infected mice results in an increased spirochetal burden, further indicating that IFN-γ-mediated events promote B. burgdorferi survival. Differential immunoscreening and RT-PCR demonstrate that IFN-γ-mediated signals facilitate spirochete recombination at the variable major protein like sequence locus, a site for early antigenic variation in vivo, and that recombination rates by B. burgdorferi N40 are lower in IFN-γR-deficient mice than in control animals. These results suggest that the murine immune response can promote the in vivo adaptation of B. burgdorferi .",1467,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Objective: To estimate the annual incidence of inflammatory joint diseases in a population based prospective referral study in an adult population in Kronoberg County in southern Sweden. Methods: The patients were referred from primary healthcare centres to the rheumatology department in Växjö Central Hospital or to the one private rheumatologist in Växjö participating in the study. Additionally, the hospital records for patients with joint aspirates during the inclusion period were checked. The patients were registered as incident cases if the onset of the joint inflammation was between 1 May 1999 and 1 May 2000. A systematic follow up of incoming referrals was conducted up to 31 January 2001. Children under the age of 16 and patients with septic arthritis, crystal arthropathies, and osteoarthritis were excluded from the study. Results: A total of 151 new cases with inflammatory joint diseases were identified during one year, corresponding to a total annual incidence of 115/100 000. Of these, 31 patients (21%) had rheumatoid arthritis, the annual incidence being 24/100 000 (for women 29/100 000, and for men 18/100 000). Reactive arthritis was diagnosed in 37 patients (24%, annual incidence 28/100 000) and 54 patients had undifferentiated arthritis (36%, annual incidence 41/100 000). Eleven patients presented with psoriatic arthritis (7%, annual incidence 8/100 000). The incidence of Lyme arthritis was small in this non-endemic area, and the incidence of sarcoid arthritis corresponded to that in earlier studies. Conclusion: This is the first prospective population based annual incidence study of early arthritis in Sweden. In this population, 36% of the incident cases had undifferentiated arthritis, whereas rheumatoid arthritis and reactive arthritis accounted for 45% of the cases. The incidence figures compare well with figures reported from other countries.",1900,0,0,0,1,en,en,

We used multiparameter flow cytometry to characterize leukocyte immunophenotypes and cytokines in skin and peripheral blood of patients with erythema migrans (EM). Dermal leukocytes and cytokines were assessed in fluids aspirated from epidermal suction blisters raised over EM lesions and skin of uninfected controls. Compared with corresponding peripheral blood, EM infiltrates were enriched for T cells, monocytes/macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs), contained lower proportions of neutrophils, and were virtually devoid of B cells. Enhanced expression of CD14 and HLA-DR by lesional neutrophils and macrophages indicated that these innate effector cells were highly activated. Staining for CD45RO and CD27 revealed that lesional T lymphocytes were predominantly Ag-experienced cells; furthermore, a subset of circulating T cells also appeared to be neosensitized. Lesional DC subsets, CD11c + (monocytoid) and CD11c − (plasmacytoid), expressed activation/maturation surface markers. Patients with multiple EM lesions had greater symptom scores and higher serum levels of IFN-α, TNF-α, and IL-2 than patients with solitary EM. IL-6 and IFN-γ were the predominant cytokines in EM lesions; however, greater levels of both mediators were detected in blister fluids from patients with isolated EM. Circulating monocytes displayed significant increases in surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)1 and TLR2, while CD11c + DCs showed increased expression of TLR2 and TLR4; lesional macrophages and CD11c + and CD11c − DCs exhibited increases in expression of all three TLRs. These results demonstrate that Borrelia burgdorferi triggers innate and adaptive responses during early Lyme disease and emphasize the interdependence of these two arms of the immune response in the efforts of the host to contain spirochetal infection.",1842,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiological agent of Lyme disease, comprises three genospecies, Borrelia garinii, afzelii , and burgdorferi sensu strictu, that exhibit different pathogenicity and differ in the susceptibility to C-mediated killing. We examined C-sensitive and C-resistant strains of B. burgdorferi for deposition of C3 and late C components by fluorescence microscope and flow cytometry. Despite comparable deposition of C3 on the two strains, the resistant strain exhibited reduced staining for C6 and C7, barely detectable C9, and undetectable poly C9. Based on these findings, we searched for a protein that inhibits assembly of C membrane attack complex and documented an anti-human CD59-reactive molecule on the surface of C-resistant spirochetes by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. A molecule of 80 kDa recognized by polyclonal and monoclonal anti-CD59 Abs was identified in the membrane extract of C-resistant strains by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The molecule was released from the bacterial wall using deoxycholate and trypsin, suggesting its insertion into the bacterial membrane. The CD59-like molecule acts as C inhibitor on Borrelia because incubation with F(ab′) 2 anti-CD59 renders the serum-resistant strain exquisitely susceptible to C-mediated killing and guinea pig erythrocytes bearing C5b-8, unlike the RBC coated with C5b-7, are protected from reactive lysis by the bacterial extract.

Lyme disease cases occur when humans are exposed to the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi through the bite of an infected ixodid tick. The probability of human exposure to infected ticks results from a combination of human behaviors and entomological risk. Human behaviors include use of tick habitats, use of protective clothing, and grooming for tick removal. Entomological risks include the density of ticks in a habitat and the proportion of these that are infected with B. burgdorferi . Recent studies have suggested that humans are at higher risk of exposure to B. burgdorferi near edges between forests and herbaceous communities, including lawns and old fields, but whether this increased risk is a function of human behaviors, entomological risk, or both, is unknown. We assessed entomological risk across forest–old field edges in Dutchess County, NY. Densities of ticks and of infected ticks were considerably higher within forests than at forest–field edges, and were lowest within fields. Thus, edges between forests and fields do not pose a higher entomological risk than do the forests themselves, although risk at the edge is higher than in herbaceous habitat. Landscapes with abundant edges between forested and herbaceous habitat, and roughly even proportions of both, might attract both heavy human use and pose moderately high entomological risk, and thus could be targeted for mitigation. We suggest that determining appropriate methods for reducing human exposure to LD requires differentiating entomological risk from human behaviors.",1649,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Both isolates elicited a robust proinflammatory response in RAW264.7 cells characterized by an increase in transcript levels of genes encoding CC and CXC chemokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and TNF superfamily members. Transcription of genes encoding IL-1β, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP-1α, CXCR4, and TLR2 induced in RAW264.7 cells by either live or heat-killed spirochetes did not differ significantly at any time point over a 24-h period, nor was there a difference in the protein levels of IL-10, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-12p70 in culture supernatants.

The cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes are known modulators of innate immune cell function; however, their contributions to adaptive immunity are relatively unknown. We investigated the roles of COX-1 and COX-2 in the humoral immune response to infection with the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi . We report that in vitro, murine B cells constitutively expressed COX-1 and up-regulated expression of both COX-1 and COX-2 as well as their products PGE 2 , PGF 2α , and thromboxane B 2 and their receptors following stimulation with B. burgdorferi or anti-CD40. In vitro inhibition of COX-1 and/or COX-2 in murine B cells resulted in decreased eicosanoid production and altered Ab production. Importantly, infection of mice lacking COX-1, but not COX-2, activity resulted in a defect in Ig class-switching and a lack of Borrelia -specific IgG production. This defect correlated with decreased germinal center formation and IL-6 and IL-17 production, and it could be partially recovered by restoration of IL-6, but fully recovered by IL-17. Furthermore, sera from COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice were dramatically less effective in killing B. burgdorferi , but borreliacidal activity was restored in COX-1 inhibitor-treated mice administered IL-17. We conclude that IL-17 plays a role in Ab production and Ig class-switching in response to infection and that COX-1 is a critical, previously unrecognized regulator of this response.",1440,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid into the leukotrienes, which are critical regulators of inflammation and inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and arthritis. Although leukotrienes are present in the synovial fluid of Lyme disease patients, their role in the development of Lyme arthritis has not been determined. In the current study, we used a murine model of Lyme arthritis to investigate the role 5-LO products might have in the development of this inflammatory disease. After infection of Lyme arthritis-susceptible C3H/HeJ mice with Borrelia burgdorferi , mRNA expression of 5-LO and 5-LO–activating protein was induced in the joints, and the 5-LO product leukotriene B 4 was produced. Using C3H 5-LO–deficient mice, we demonstrated that 5-LO activity was not necessary for the induction of Lyme arthritis, but that its deficiency resulted in earlier joint swelling and an inability to resolve arthritis as demonstrated by sustained arthritis pathology through day 60 postinfection. Although production of anti- Borrelia IgG was decreased in 5-LO–deficient mice, bacterial clearance from the joints was unaffected. Phagocytosis of B. burgdorferi and efferocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils was defective in macrophages from 5-LO–deficient mice, and uptake of opsonized spirochetes by neutrophils was reduced.

In the B cell lineage, CD83 is expressed especially on activated B cells and on light zone B cells during the germinal center (GC) reaction. The function of CD83 during GC responses is unclear. CD83 −/− mice have a strong reduction of CD4 + T cells, which makes it difficult to analyze a functional role of CD83 on B cells during GC responses. Therefore, in the present study we generated a B cell–specific CD83 conditional knockout (CD83 B-cKO) model. CD83 B-cKO B cells show defective upregulation of MHC class II and CD86 expression and impaired proliferation after different stimuli. Analyses of GC responses after immunization with various Ags revealed a characteristic shift in dark zone and light zone B cell numbers, with an increase of B cells in the dark zone of CD83 B-cKO mice. This effect was not accompanied by alterations in the level of IgG immune responses or by major differences in affinity maturation. However, an enhanced IgE response was observed in CD83 B-cKO mice. Additionally, we observed a strong competitive disadvantage of CD83-cKO B cells in GC responses in mixed bone marrow chimeras. Furthermore, infection of mice with Borrelia burgdorferi revealed a defect in bacterial clearance of CD83 B-cKO mice with a shift toward a Th2 response, indicated by a strong increase in IgE titers. Taken together, our results show that CD83 is important for B cell activation and modulates GC composition and IgE Ab responses in vivo.",1510,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Cytokines play multiple roles during neuro-inflammatory processes and several cytokines have been studied in the context of specific diseases. This study provides a comprehensive picture of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) changes during neuro-inflammation by analyzing multiple cytokines in combination with immune cell subsets and standard CSF parameters. Methods. Using multiplex assays, we simultaneously measured 36 cytokines (CCL1–3, CCL7, CCL8, CCL11, CCL13, CCL19, CCL20, CCL22–27, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL11–13, CXCL16, CX3CL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL10, IL16, GM-CSF, IFNγ, MIF, TNFα, and MIB1β) in the CSF and serum of 75 subjects. Diagnoses included clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS, n = 18), secondary progressive MS ( n = 8), neuro-syphilis ( n = 6), Lyme neuro-borreliosis ( n = 13), bacterial and viral meningitis ( n = 20), and patients with non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND, n = 10). Cytokine concentrations were correlated with CSF standard parameters and CSF immune cell subsets (CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, plasmablasts, monocytes, and NK cells) quantified by flow cytometry. Results. We observed increased levels of multiple cytokines (26/36) in patients with neuro-inflammatory diseases when compared to NIND that consistently correlated with CSF cell count and Q Albumin . Most CSF cytokine concentrations correlated with each other, but correlations between CSF and serum values were scarce (3/36). Within the CSF compartment, CXCL13 showed a strong association with B cells when analyzing all patients, as well as patients with an intact blood-brain barrier (BBB). NK cells positively correlated with CSF concentrations of multiple cytokines (22/36) when analyzing all patients. These correlations were maintained when looking at patients with a disrupted BBB but not detectable in patients with an intact BBB. Conclusions. Under conditions of neuro-inflammation, multiple CSF cytokines are regulated in parallel and most likely produced locally. A combined increase of CSF CXCL13 levels and B cells occurs under conditions of an intact BBB. Under conditions of a disrupted BBB, CSF NK cells show significantly increased values and seem to have a major contribution to overall inflammatory processes, reflected by a strong correlation with multiple cytokines. Future studies are necessary to address the exact kinetics of these cytokines during neuro-inflammation and their relation to specific diseases phenotypes.",2519,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

More recent research in landscape ecology has produced an expanded view of ecotones and elaboration of their characteristics and functions in ecosystems. Parallel research on emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and the causes of increased rates of pathogen transmission, spread, and adaptation suggests a correspondence between ecotonal processes and the ecological and evolutionary processes responsible for zoonotic and vector-borne emerging infections. A review of the literature suggests that ecotones play a role in a number of the most important EIDs. Yet these are the only diseases for which specific landscape ecological information exists in the literature or disease reports. However, the similar disease ecologies of these with about half of the approximately 130 zoonotic EIDs suggests ecotones, particularly their anthropogenic origination or modification, may be generally associated with ecotones and the global trend of increasing EIDs.",1143,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Recently it has been suggested that various types of spirochetes, in an analogous way to Treponema pallidum, could cause dementia and may be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we review all data available in the literature on the detection of spirochetes in AD and critically analyze the association and causal relationship between spirochetes and AD following established criteria of Koch and Hill. The results show a statistically significant association between spirochetes and AD (P = 1.5 × 10 -17 , OR = 20, 95% CI = 8-60, N = 247). When neutral techniques recognizing all types of spirochetes were used, or the highly prevalent periodontal pathogen Treponemas were analyzed, spirochetes were observed in the brain in more than 90% of AD cases. Borrelia burgdorferi was detected in the brain in 25.3% of AD cases analyzed and was 13 times more frequent in AD compared to controls. Periodontal pathogen Treponemas ( T. pectinovorum, T. amylovorum, T. lecithinolyticum, T. maltophilum, T. medium, T. socranskii ) and Borrelia burgdorferi were detected using species specific PCR and antibodies. Importantly, co-infection with several spirochetes occurs in AD. The pathological and biological hallmarks of AD were reproduced in vitro by exposure of mammalian cells to spirochetes. The analysis of reviewed data following Koch's and Hill's postulates shows a probable causal relationship between neurospirochetosis and AD. Persisting inflammation and amyloid deposition initiated and sustained by chronic spirochetal infection form together with the various hypotheses suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of AD a comprehensive entity. As suggested by Hill, once the probability of a causal relationship is established prompt action is needed. Support and attention should be given to this field of AD research. Spirochetal infection occurs years or decades before the manifestation of dementia.

In previous studies, neurons were documented to undergo apoptosis in the presence of microglia and live Borrelia burgdorferi , but not with either agent alone. Microscopy showed that several Toll-like receptors (TLRs) were upregulated in microglia upon B. burgdorferi exposure. It was hypothesized that the inflammatory milieu generated by microglia in the presence of B. burgdorferi results in neuronal apoptosis and that this inflammation was likely generated through TLR pathways. Methods. In this study, we explored the role of several TLR and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2)-dependent pathways in inducing inflammation in the presence of B. burgdorferi , using ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) and/or inhibitors, in primary non-human primate (NHP) microglia. We also used several inhibitors for key mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways to determine the role of downstream pathways in inflammatory mediator release. Results. The results show that the TLR2 pathway plays a predominant role in inducing inflammation, as inhibition of TLR2 with either small interfering RNA (siRNA) or inhibitor, in the presence of B. burgdorferi , significantly downregulated interleukin 6 (IL-6), chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand 8 (CXCL8), chemokine (C-C) motif ligand 2 (CCL2), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production. This was followed by TLR5, the silencing of which significantly downregulated IL-6 and TNF. The role of TLR4 was inconclusive as a TLR4-specific inhibitor and TLR4 siRNA had opposing effects in the presence of B. burgdorferi . Silencing of NOD2 by siRNA in the presence of B. burgdorferi significantly upregulated IL-6, CCL2, and TNF. Downstream signaling involved the adaptor molecule myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88), as expected, as well as the MAPK pathways, with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) being predominant, followed by Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways. Conclusions. Several receptors and pathways, with both positive and negative effects, mediate inflammation of primary microglia in response to B. burgdorferi , resulting in a complex, tightly regulated immune network.",2191,0,1,0,0,fr,en,

Infectious diseases of humans, wildlife, and domesticated species are increasing worldwide, driving the need to understand the mechanisms that shape outbreaks. Simultaneously, human activities are drastically reducing biodiversity. These concurrent patterns have prompted repeated suggestions that biodiversity and disease are linked. For example, the dilution effect hypothesis posits that these patterns are causally related; diverse host communities inhibit the spread of parasites via several mechanisms, such as by regulating populations of susceptible hosts or interfering with parasite transmission. However, the generality of the dilution effect hypothesis remains controversial, especially for zoonotic diseases of humans. Here we provide broad evidence that host diversity inhibits parasite abundance using a meta-analysis of 202 effect sizes on 61 parasite species. The magnitude of these effects was independent of host density, study design, and type and specialization of parasites, indicating that dilution was robust across all ecological contexts examined. However, the magnitude of dilution was more closely related to the frequency, rather than density, of focal host species. Importantly, observational studies overwhelmingly documented dilution effects, and there was also significant evidence for dilution effects of zoonotic parasites of humans. Thus, dilution effects occur commonly in nature, and they may modulate human disease risk. A second analysis identified similar effects of diversity in plant–herbivore systems. Thus, although there can be exceptions, our results indicate that biodiversity generally decreases parasitism and herbivory. Consequently, anthropogenic declines in biodiversity could increase human and wildlife diseases and decrease crop and forest production.",1817,0,1,0,0,en,en,

In this study we compared serology, antigen presence, hematology, blood chemistries and clinical presentation of 22 horses from a highly endemic region that were clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease to that of 21 clinically normal horses from the same region. We found that horses clinically diagnosed with Lyme disease were more likely to have Borrelia burgdorferi spirochetal DNA in their blood and urine, have a higher percentage of positive immunoblots containing antibodies to certain B. burgdorferi proteins, and tend to have higher ELISA titers than healthy horses from the same region.

Polyhistidine-tagged recombinant OspC (rOspC) proteins were produced in Escherichia coli and used, after biotinylation, as antigens on streptavidin-coated plates in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). In IgM ELISA, 30% (5/17) and 35% (6/17) of patients with erythema migrans (EM) in the acute or convalescent phase, respectively, reacted with one to three rOspCs. Of the patients, 53% (8/15) with neuroborreliosis (NB) and 53% (8/15) with Lyme arthritis (LA) had IgM antibodies to OspC. The immunoreactivity was stronger against rOspC from B. afzelii and B. garinii than against rOspC from B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . In early Lyme borreliosis (LB), rOspC and flagella performed equally well in detecting IgM antibodies. Cross-reactive antibodies to rOspC were observed in serum samples from patients with rheumatoid factor positivity and with syphilis or Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. In IgM ELISA, thiocyanate in the serum dilution buffer reduced EBV-associated non-specific positive reactions. Of the patient sera examined in IgG ELISA, 30% (5/17) with EM in the acute phase, 35% (6/17) with EM in the convalescent phase, 33% (5/15) with NB and 60% (9/15) with LA were positive.

To assess sensitivity, 20 serum samples obtained 1–6 weeks after onset of illness from 20 persons who had physician-diagnosed erythema migrans (EM) were tested for IgM and IgG antibodies. In tests for IgM antibody, seropositivity of ≥25% was recorded when ELISAs had separate preparations of protein (p) 37, p41-G, outer-surface protein (Osp) C, OspE, OspF or VlsE antigens. Sera reacted most frequently (80% positive) with VlsE antigen in analyses for IgG antibodies. When results of both class-specific assays were considered for VlsE, OspC or OspF, 90% of the EM cases were serologically confirmed. Results of specificity testing with a further 59 sera from persons who had syphilis, louse-borne relapsing fever, oral infections, rheumatoid arthritis or human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and 28 normal sera indicated no false positive reactions when VlsE antigen was used in tests for IgM antibody. One of the 11 louse-borne relapsing fever sera cross-reacted with VlsE antigen in tests for IgG antibodies. Minor cross-reactivity also occurred when p37, OspC, OspE or OspF antigens were used. Overall, VlsE was the most suitable antigen for laboratory diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis during the early weeks of B. burgdorferi infection because of its high sensitivity and specificity.",1519,0,0,1,0,en,en,

We evaluated NDV as a vector for expressing selected antigens of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi . A series of recombinant NDVs were generated that expressed intracellular or extracellular forms of two B. burgdorferi antigens: namely, the basic membrane protein A (BmpA) and the outer surface protein C (OspC). Expression of the intracellular and extracellular forms of these antigens was confirmed in cultured chicken cells. C3H or Balb/C mice that were immunized intranasally with the NDV vectors mounted vigorous serum antibody responses against the NDV vector, but failed to mount a robust response against either the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA or OspC. By contrast, a single immunization of hamsters with the NDV vectors via the intranasal, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal route resulted in rapid and rigorous antibody responses against the intracellular or extracellular forms of BmpA and OspC. When groups of hamsters were separately inoculated with various NDV vectors and challenged with B. burgdorferi (10 8 cells/animal), immunization with vector expressing either intracellular or extracellular BmpA was associated with a significant reduction of the pathogen load in the joints.

Progress is being made case by case in defining the several clinical presentations of Lyme disease in adult horses. Current serologic tests are very sensitive and specific for detecting either infection (previous or concurrent) or exposure but may not distinguish between them. Treatment protocols are available for Lyme disease in horses; however, the ability of those protocols to eliminate the organism remains questionable. Currently, minocycline is being attempted in some presumed Lyme cases as an improved alternative to doxycycline and oxytetracycline. Vaccination, like many aspects of Lyme disease, remains controversial, although the canine-approved vaccines have the potential to prevent infection based upon vaccine studies in ponies and other animals.",964,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

The need for lumbar puncture in diagnostics of LB in children with facial palsy has been questioned. Our aim was to evaluate the prevalence of LB and the diagnostic value of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample among children with an acute facial palsy. Methods: We collected medical records and laboratory data of children and adolescents 0–16 years of age (n = 94) diagnosed with facial palsy between 2002 and 2016 in the Turku University Hospital. A positive B. burgdorferi serology in serum or CSF or a positive B. burgdorferi polymerase chain reaction in CSF were considered as signs of definite LB. C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) values were measured in CSF samples from 28 children during 2014–2016. Results: Lumbar puncture was performed on 84 of 94 children with facial palsy. LB was confirmed in 29 of 42 children with, and in 4 of 42 without, pleocytosis . The sensitivity and specificity of pleocytosis to predict LB were 88% (95% confidence interval, 78%–98%) and 75% (62%–88%), respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values were 69% (55%–83%) and 90% (81%–99%), respectively. An increased CSF CXCL13 value had 67% (51%–83%) sensitivity and 100% specificity for LB. Conclusions: Because serum serology can be negative at presentation, lumbar puncture is a valuable tool when diagnosing LB among children with facial palsy. Pleocytosis and increased protein and CXCL13 values in the CSF suggest LB as the cause of facial palsy.",1600,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Preventive strategies for LD in canines center on vaccination and tick control (acaricides). Both subunit and bacterin based LD veterinary vaccines are available. Outer surface protein C (OspC), a potent immunogen and dominant early antigen, has been demonstrated to elicit protective antibody (Ab) responses. However, a single OspC protein elicits a relatively narrow range of protection. There are conflicting reports as to whether the immunodominant epitopes of OspC reside within variable or conserved domains. A detailed understanding of the antigenic determinants of OspC is essential for understanding immune responses to this essential virulence factor and vaccinogen. Here, we investigate the contribution of the conserved C-terminal C10 motif in OspC triggered Ab responses. Using a panel of diverse recombinant full length OspC proteins and their corresponding C10 deletion variants (OspCΔC10), we demonstrate that the C10 motif does not significantly contribute to immunization or infection induced Ab responses in rabbits, rats, canines, horses and non-human primates. Furthermore, the C10 motif is not required to trigger potent bactericidal Ab responses. This study provides insight into the antigenic structure of OspC. The results enhance our understanding of immune responses that develop during infection or upon vaccination and have implications for interpretation of LD diagnostic assays that employ OspC.",1547,0,0,1,0,it,en,

The collected I. persulcatus were allowed to feed on specific pathogen-free SCID mice and red blood cells from the mice were used to isolate Babesia spp. with the microareophilous stationary-phase culture technique. Paired and tetrad forms of merozoites were observed by light microscope in red blood cells of SCID mice. In vitro growth of the parasites was also achieved in mice erythrocytes, which indicated the presence of Babesia spp. in I. persulactus . To further identify the Babesia species, polymerase chain reaction screening and subsequent sequencing of nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA (nss-rRNA) was employed. The results indicate that the observed parasites might be an isolate strain responsible for human babesiosis – B. microti – which has 99.3% identity with that of B. microti isolate RcM5201 ( AB112050 ) from Mishan in Heilongjiang and Kobe isolates from Japan. In addition, the infection rate of B. microti in I. persulcatus ticks in the region was 3.6–4.0% in adult females and no infection in males.

As there is no standardized PCR method for detection and identification of spirochaete DNA, we carried out a comparative analysis using a set of complementary primers for three regions in the genomic DNA of these bacteria (genes fla and rrs and the non-coding rrs–rrlA region). DNA extracted from 579 Ixodes ricinus ticks was subjected to nested PCR. DNA of the examined spirochaetes was detected in 43 (7.4 %) lysates when the fla gene was used as a molecular marker, in 7 (1.2 %) lysates when using primers complementary to the rrs gene, and in 12 (2.1 %) lysates using primers complementary to the non-coding rrs–rrlA sequence. RFLP analysis based on the fla gene helped identify species from the B. burgdorferi sensu lato complex ( B. burgdorferi sensu stricto , Borrelia afzelii , Borrelia garinii , Borrelia valaisiana ), detect co-infections, and also identify Borrelia miyamotoi .

In this study, the seroprevalence of Dirofilaria immitis , Ehrlichia canis , and Borrelia burgdorferi in dogs residing in two types of intensive housing, greyhound kennels and animal shelters, was compared to dogs residing in low-intensity housing, private homes. Serum was collected from a cross-section of 1500 adult dogs from Florida, including 500 pet dogs referred to the Veterinary Medical Center of the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Florida, 500 racing greyhounds, and 500 dogs residing in animal shelters. Serum was tested for D. immitis antigen, E. canis antibodies, and B. burgdorferi antibodies by ELISA. Seroprevalence of D. immitis was significantly higher (14.6%) in shelter dogs and in pet dogs (1.4%) than in racing greyhounds (0.2%) ( P < 0.04). There were no significant differences in the seroprevalence of E. canis (0.4–1.6%) or B. burgdorferi (0–0.8%) among the groups. There was no association of sex or age with D. immitis infection, but pit bull type dogs were more than twice as likely to be infected than other breeds ( P = 0.003). Evidence for vector-borne infections, particularly D. immitis , was found in dogs throughout the state. The prevalence was greatest for D. immitis infection in shelter dogs, likely due to lack of preventive medications prior to impoundment.

The parasitic arthropods addressed here are those ectoparasites belong to the class of insects, such as fleas and sand flies, or the subclass of acarids, such as ticks. These parasitic arthropods interact intensively with their hosts by blood feeding. Fleas, sand flies and ticks hold the vector capacity to transmit pathogens such as virus, bacteria or protozoa to cats, dogs and humans. The diseases caused by these pathogens are summarized under the terms canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD), feline vector-borne diseases (FVBD) or metazoonoses. In small animal practice, it is important to understand that the transmitted pathogen may either lead to a disease with clinical signs, or more often to asymptomatic, clinically healthy, or silent infections. Blocking of the vector–host interactions, the blood feeding and subsequently the transmission of pathogens during blood feeding is a key element of CVBD control. The focus of this review is on the current knowledge of the epidemiology of parasitic vectors and three important CVBDs they transmit; rickettsiosis, tick borreliosis and canine leishmaniosis from a European perspective, and how veterinary medicine may contribute to the challenges of CVBDs and their control. Prevention of CVBDs is fundamentally based on ectoparasite control. Ectoparasite management in cats and dogs is important not only for the health and well-being of the individual companion animal but for public health in general and is therefore a perfect example of the ‘One health’ approach.",1736,0,0,0,1,lt,en,

The VlsE IgG had the highest diagnostic value with an AUC (area under the curve) of 96% on the receiver operating characteristic curve. The OspC IgM had AUCs just above 80%. All the other antigens had both low quantitative reactivity and lower contrast in the patients with LNB compared to controls. The diagnostic value of the assay may be improved by using a logistic model giving a sensitivity of 90 and 79% for the specificities at 92 and 98%, respectively. Overall, the patients with LNB had serum reactivity in IgG VlsE, but modest antibody reactivity in the remaining 12 IgG and 13 IgM antibody measurements.

To characterize the species and stages of ticks most commonly recovered from cats and determine the prevalence of disease agents in the ticks, we conducted a survey of ticks removed from cats at veterinary practices in 18 states from April 2016–June 2017. A total of 796 ticks were submitted from 332 cats from 41 different veterinary practices. A single tick was submitted from the majority of cats, with a mean infestation intensity of 2.4 (range 1–46). The most common tick was Ixodes scapularis , accounting for 422/796 (53.0%) ticks submitted, followed by Amblyomma americanum (224/796; 28.1%) and Dermacentor variabilis (131/796; 16.5%); a few I. pacificus , I. banksi , D. occidentalis , A. maculatum , Rhipicephalus sanguineus , and Otobius megnini were also submitted. A majority of ticks were adults (593/796; 74.5%); females predominated in all adult tick submissions including I. scapularis (277/327; 84.7% female), A. americanum (66/128; 51.6% female), and D. variabilis (75/126; 59.5% female). Immature ticks included 186 nymphs and 17 larvae and were primarily I. scapularis and A. americanum . Adult I. scapularis were most reported to be attached to the dorsal head and neck; A. americanum to the abdomen and perianal region; and D. variabilis to the back and ear. Ticks were collected in every month; the largest number of submissions were in May and June (42.5% of ticks) and October and November (35.9% of ticks). Adults of I. scapularis were most commonly submitted October through December, A. americanum March through June, and D. variabilis May through July. Cats with ticks were predominantly male (58.8%) and altered (76.2%), and most reportedly spent >30% of time outdoors, although 64/294 (21.8%) for which lifestyle estimates were provided were reported to live primarily (≤30% of time outside; n = 54) or entirely (100%; n = 10) indoors.

Two further children who presented with acute hemiparesis as a result of cerebral ischaemic infarction had a cerebrovascular course of neuroborreliosis. One was a 15 year old girl; the other, a 5 year old boy, is to our knowledge the youngest patient described with this course of illness.

Investigations History, physical examination and serologic testing confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Diagnosis Lyme disease. Management The patient refused antibiotic therapy during the first 2 years of her illness. During the next 2 years, she consulted a rheumatologist, but declined antibiotic therapy. She continued to have recurrent episodes of arthritis, following which she was successfully treated with doxycycline, given initially for 2 weeks, with a second, 4-week cycle administered 2 months later. This case illustrates the natural history of untreated Lyme disease, which is rarely observed in most patients since diagnosis almost always leads to successful antibiotic treatment. Furthermore, this case also demonstrates that infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can persist for years in untreated patients; however, antibiotic therapy is still likely to be effective, despite long-term infection.",1093,0,0,1,0,en,en,

It has been suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CXCL13 is a diagnostic marker of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB), as its levels have been shown to be significantly higher in LNB than in several other CNS infections. Levels have also been shown to decline after treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone, but levels after treatment with oral doxycycline have previously not been studied. Like Borrelia burgdorferi , HIV also has neurotropic properties. Elevated serum CXCL13 concentrations have been reported in HIV patients, but data on CSF levels are limited. Methods. We longitudinally analysed CSF CXCL13 concentrations in 25 LNB patients before and after oral doxycycline treatment. Furthermore, we analysed CSF CXCL13 concentrations in 16 untreated LNB patients, 27 asymptomatic untreated HIV-1 infected patients and 39 controls with no signs of infectious or inflammatory disease. Results. In the longitudinal LNB study, initially high CSF CXCL13 levels declined significantly after doxycycline treatment, which correlated to a decreased CSF mononuclear cell count. In the cross-sectional study, all the LNB patients had CSF CXCL13 levels elevated above the lowest standard point of the assay (7.8 pg/mL), with a median concentration of 500 pg/mL (range 34–11,678). Of the HIV patients, 52% had elevated CSF CXCL13 levels (median 10 pg/mL, range 0–498). There was a clear overlap in CSF CXCL13 concentrations between LNB patients and asymptomatic HIV patients. All but one of the 39 controls had CSF CXCL13 levels below 7.8 pg/mL. Conclusions. We confirm previous reports of highly elevated CSF CXCL13 levels in LNB patients and that these levels decline after oral doxycycline treatment. The same pattern is seen for CSF mononuclear cells. CSF CXCL13 levels are elevated in neurologically asymptomatic HIV patients and the levels overlap those of LNB patients. The diagnostic value of CSF CXCL13 in LNB remains to be established.",1946,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Meerpohl']",10.1186/s12883-015-0501-3,2015.0,12,journal-article,"Background. Many aspects of clinical management of Lyme neuroborreliosis are subject to intense debates. Guidelines show considerable variability in their recommendations, leading to divergent treatment regimes. The most pronounced differences in recommendations exist between guidelines from scientific societies and from patient advocacy groups. Assessment of the methodological quality of these contradictory guideline recommendations can be helpful for healthcare professionals. Methods. Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE and databases of four international and national guideline organizations for guidelines on Lyme neuroborreliosis published from 1999–2014. Characteristics (e.g., year of publication, sponsoring organization) and key recommendations were extracted from each guideline. Two independent reviewers assessed the methodological quality of each guideline according to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. AGREE II scores from guidelines developed by scientific societies and from patient advocacy groups were compared across domains. Results. We identified eight eligible guidelines of which n = 6 were developed by scientific societies and n = 2 by patient advocacy groups. Agreement on AGREE II scores was good (Cohen’s weighted kappa = 0.87, 95 % CI 0.83–0.92). Three guidelines, all from scientific societies, had an overall quality score of ≥ 50 %. Two of them were recommended for use according to the AGREE II criteria. Across all guidelines, the AGREE II domain with the highest scores was “Clarity of Presentation” (65, SD 19 %); all other domains had scores < 50 % with the domain “Applicability” having the lowest scores (4, SD 4 %). Guidelines developed by scientific societies had statistically significantly higher scores regarding clarity of presentation than guidelines from patient advocacy groups ( p = 0.0151). No statistically significant differences were found in other domains. Conclusions. Current guidelines on Lyme neuroborreliosis vary in methodological quality and content. Health care providers and patients need to be aware of this variability in quality when choosing recommendations for their treatment decisions regarding Lyme neuroborreliosis. No statement can be given on quality of content and validity of recommendations, as these issues are not subject to assessment with the AGREE II tool and are prone to individual interpretation of the available evidence by the corresponding guideline panels. To enhance guideline quality, guideline panels should put more emphasis on linking recommendations to the available evidence, transparency in reporting how evidence was searched for and evaluated, and the implementation of recommendations into clinical practice.",2767,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Many aspects of pharmacological treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis in children, such as choice of drug, dosage, and duration are subject to intense debates, leading to uncertainties in patients’ parents and healthcare providers alike. To assess the available evidence for pharmacological treatment for children with Lyme neuroborreliosis we conducted a systematic review. Methods. The comprehensive systematic literature search included randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies (NRS) on treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis in children (age <18 years). Our primary outcome was neurological symptoms after treatment. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tools for RCTs and NRS. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results. Two RCTs and four NRS were eligible for inclusion. Risk of bias in RCTs and NRS was generally high. Reporting of studies was generally poor. Regarding the primary outcome neurological symptoms at 1–3 months, no statistically significant difference could be found in cohort studies between doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics. In two RCTs comparing penicillin G and ceftriaxone, no patient experienced residual neurological symptoms at the last reported time points. Quality of evidence according to GRADE was judged very low. Conclusions. Data is scarce and with limited quality. Several issues could not be addressed due to scarcity of information. No eligible study compared different treatment durations. According to the available evidence, there seems to be no difference between different antibiotic agents for the treatment of Lyme neuroborreliosis in children regarding neurological symptoms. We found no evidence that supports extended antibiotic regimes. Review registration. Systematic review registration: CRD42014008839 .",1903,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Lyme arthritis, which is caused by the tick-transmitted spirochaete Borrelia burgdorferi , is effectively treated in most patients with antibiotic therapy; however, in a subset of patients, arthritis can persist and worsen after the spirochaete has been killed (known as post-infectious Lyme arthritis). This Review details the current understanding of the pathogenetic events in Lyme arthritis, from initial infection in the skin, through infection of the joints, to post-infectious chronic inflammatory arthritis. The central feature of post-infectious Lyme arthritis is an excessive, dysregulated pro-inflammatory immune response during the infection phase that persists into the post-infectious period. This response is characterized by high amounts of IFNγ and inadequate amounts of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. The consequences of this dysregulated pro-inflammatory response in the synovium include impaired tissue repair, vascular damage, autoimmune and cytotoxic processes, and fibroblast proliferation and fibrosis. These synovial characteristics are similar to those in other chronic inflammatory arthritides, including rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, post-infectious Lyme arthritis provides a model for other chronic autoimmune or autoinflammatory arthritides in which complex immune responses can be triggered and shaped by an infectious agent in concert with host genetic factors.",1495,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Eighty-nine serum samples from clinically well-defined patients were tested in eight different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) systems based on whole-cell antigens, whole-cell antigens supplemented with VlsE and assays using exclusively recombinant proteins. A subset of samples was tested in five immunoblots: one whole-cell blot, one whole-cell blot supplemented with VlsE and three recombinant blots. The number of IgM- and/or IgG-positive ELISA results in the group of patients suspected of Borrelia infection ranged from 34 to 59%. The percentage of positives in cross-reactivity controls ranged from 0 to 38%. Comparison of immunoblots yielded large differences in inter-test agreement and showed, at best, a moderate agreement between tests. Remarkably, some immunoblots gave positive results in samples that had been tested negative by all eight ELISAs. The percentage of positive blots following a positive ELISA result depended heavily on the choice of ELISA–immunoblot combination. We conclude that the assays used to detect anti- Borrelia antibodies have widely divergent sensitivity and specificity. The choice of ELISA–immunoblot combination severely influences the number of positive results, making the exchange of test results between laboratories with different methodologies hazardous.",1455,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The approach was a retrospective study on patients with EBV activity proven by a positive EBV antibody-specific index (AI) and/or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) PCR. One hundred six children and adults (AI positive = 77, AI + PCR positive = 3, PCR positive = 26) were identified, most with reactivated infections. Twenty-eight showed typical EBV-related diseases (encephalitis, neuritis, meningitis), 19 further infections (HSV encephalitis, neuroborreliosis, HIV infection, bacterial meningitis), nine immune-mediated disorders (multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis), and 50 further diseases not typical for EBV. The highest AI values occurred in patients with encephalitis. No relationship between disease category or AI values and viral loads was found. Additional reanalysis of 1,500 consecutive CSF EBV PCR studies revealed the highest positive rates among patients with further infections ( n = 18/227, 7.9%) but lower rates among patients with typical EBV-related disorders (5/395; 1.3%), immune-mediated disorders ( n = 2/174; 1.1%) and other conditions ( n = 4/704; 0.6%). Intrathecal EBV activity is not restricted to typical EBV-related disorders, unexpectedly frequent in further CNS infections and also present in non-inflammatory conditions.

Minocycline, a member of the tetracycline family, has a low risk of adverse effects and an ability to improve behavioral performance in humans with cognitive disruption. We performed a single-arm open-label trial in which 25 children diagnosed with Angelman syndrome (AS) were administered minocycline to assess the safety and tolerability of minocycline in this patient population and determine the drug’s effect on the cognitive and behavioral manifestations of the disorder. Methods. Participants, age 4-12 years old, were randomly selected from a pool of previously screened children for participation in this study. Each child received 3 milligrams of minocycline per kilogram of body weight per day for 8 weeks. Participants were assessed during 3 study visits: baseline, after 8-weeks of minocycline treatment and after an 8-week wash out period. The primary outcome measure was the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development 3rd Edition (BSID-III). Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Global Impressions Scale (CGI), Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales 2nd Edition (VABS-II), Preschool Language Scale 4th Edition (PLS-IV) and EEG scores. Observations were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05 using ANOVA and partial eta squared (η 2 ) was calculated to show effect size. Multiple comparisons testing between time points were carried out using Dunnett’s post hoc testing. Results. Significant improvement in the mean raw scores of the BSID-III subdomains communication and fine motor ability as well as the subdomains auditory comprehension and total language ability of the PLS-IV when baseline scores were compared to scores after the washout period. Further, improvements were observed in the receptive communication subdomain of the VABS-II after treatment with minocycline. Finally, mean scores of the BSID-III self-direction subdomain and CGI scale score were significantly improved both after minocycline treatment and after the wash out period. Conclusion. The clinical and neuropsychological measures suggest minocycline was well tolerated and causes improvements in the adaptive behaviors of this sample of children with Angelman syndrome. While the optimal dosage and the effects of long-term use still need to be determined, these findings suggest further investigation into the effect minocycline has on patients with Angelman syndrome is warranted.

The key test reagent developed for this antibody detection system was tannic acid-treated and glutaraldehyde-fixed sheep red blood cells (SRBC) containing Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) antigens attached to the outer surface of the SRBC. In order to establish suitable cut-off titers, initial specificity and sensitivity measurements were made using sera from 100 anonymous healthy volunteers and 30 additional pre-determined samples known to be non-reactive or reactive for Lyme disease or syphilis. These results were compared with those obtained using a commercially available ELISA. At titers ≥64, the IHA test had a combined 98% specificity and 100% sensitivity for these 130 serum samples, 30 of which were known positives or negatives, whereas the ELISA was less specific (93%) and much less sensitive (80%). Subsequent testing was performed on sera from 65 patients with the erythema migrans (EM) rash and 20 patients with early disseminated (cardiac/neurologic) symptoms or with Lyme arthritis. At initial presentation, 46–48% of the EM patients had IHA reactivity, with titers ≥128, while 42% were positive in the ELISA. Follow-up testing performed on these EM patients, 8–12 days after receiving antibiotic treatment, revealed that Bb antibodies were detected best by the IHA test (83–86% reactive) relative to the ELISA (81% reactive). Bb antibodies were readily detectable on all of the serum samples from the early disseminated and late stage Lyme disease cases in both assay systems.

In the current study, we compared the immunoglobulin G (IgG) VlsE (sixth invariant region) peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) with the current two-tier approach of sonicate ELISA and Western blot in the serodiagnosis of Lyme facial paralysis. Study design: Retrospective. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Serum samples from 47 Lyme patients with facial paralysis and 86 control subjects were analyzed for IgG antibodies to VlsE peptide of Borrelia burgdorferi and for immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies to sonicate antigens of B. burgdorferi using the two-tier approach. Intervention: Diagnostic. Main outcome measure: Serum IgG antibody responses to VlsE (IR 6 ) peptide. Results: All 47 (100%) patients with facial paralysis and 4 (5%) of 86 controls had positive antibody responses to the VlsE peptide. In the two-tier test, 41 (87%) patients had positive IgM, 31 (66%) had positive IgG, and all 47 patients had positive IgM or IgG responses. Of the 86 control subjects, 2 (2%) had positive results with the two-tier test. Thus, the sensitivities of the VlsE and the two-tier tests were 100%; the specificity of the VlsE ELISA was 95% and the specificity of the two-tier test was 98%. Conclusions: The VlsE peptide ELISA showed a high sensitivity and specificity in the serological diagnosis of Lyme facial paralysis, similar to the two-tier test. The principal advantage of the VlsE peptide ELISA is that it requires only one test rather than four tests. However, the specificity of the VlsE test may not be as high as that of the two-tier test.",1677,0,0,1,0,hu,en,

The aim of the study was to compare the immunoblot pattern of Lyme borreliosis patients and control sera from endemic and non-endemic regions and to identify the most suitable interpretation criteria for our immunoblot test. Serum samples of 24 Estonian patients with Lyme disease, 12 sera from patients with tick-borne encephalitis, 40 Estonian control sera, and sera from 50 Laplanders from North Sweden where people usually never come into contact with ticks were tested for IgG antibodies to Borrelia . Sonicated lysate of Borrelia afzelii (strain ACA1) was used in immunoblot as source of antigens. In our test system the following interpretation criteria gave the specificity of 96% for Estonian population: ≥ 1 band from p58, p21, p17 and p14 plus ≥ 2 bands from p83/100, p39, p34, p30 and p25; or ≥ 4 bands from p83/100, p39, p34, p30 and p25. The comparison of Estonian controls with Laplanders showed that subclinical infections with Borrelia are rather common in Estonia. Also the rate of other infections, giving rise to cross-reactive antibodies, may be more frequent in Estonians. The frequent reactions with Borrelia antigens in a healthy population complicate the serodiagnosis of Lyme disease.",1470,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Im Spätstadium können multiple Organsysteme befallen werden, in Europa insbesondere die Haut mit verschiedenen Formen der Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, das zentrale und periphere Nervensystem, die Gelenke und der Herzmuskel. Die Erkrankung kann durch die typische Anamnese, den klinischen Befund und die Erhöhung der borrelienspezifischen IgM- und IgG-Antikörper im Serum und Liquor entsprechend der MIQ-Richtlinien diagnostiziert werden; in besonderen Fällen auch durch Anzucht von B. burgdorferi oder DNS-Nachweis mittels PCR.

We report the case of a patient who presented with the classic features of OMS as a manifestation of acute Borrelia burgdorferi infection that was shown both on serum and cerebrospinal fluid examination. The outcome was favourable after prolonged antibiotic treatment.

Late stage or “Chronic Lyme” infection with or without “co-infections” is a difficult diagnosis to establish. The symptom complex of both conditions can be very similar. This case study represents an attempt to support serious consideration for a subpopulation of patients otherwise diagnosed with “CFS,” as actually representing chronic Lyme disease. Method : A case study is presented of a 33-year-old man, who for two years, was being managed as having CFS. However, after ∼2 years of utilizing multiple modalities of management with limited success, the diagnosis of Lyme disease was reconsidered. Historical exposure risks to Lyme disease in this individual were high. He had prolonged exposure in the highly tick-infested mountains of North Carolina for 18 months, several years prior to becoming ill. More aggressive investigation confirmed the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Appropriate changes in management were associated with an improved level of functioning that was far in excess of what maximal management of CFS was able to achieve. The features of CFS and chronic Lyme disease can be very similar and include the following. Profound fatigue often associated with cognitive impairment. Other common symptoms related to both of these conditions include sleep disturbances, fibromyalgia, and dysautonomias. In pursuing clarification of this diagnosis, the author was exposed to a contrast in medical opinion regarding diagnostic tools and criteria that were perceived as creating potential barriers to the management of patients presenting with these symptoms. Conclusion : Acceptance and awareness of the possibility that Lyme disease can present as CFS has important therapeutic and prognostic implications.",1822,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Results: We found that 68.75% of CFS/Lyme patients show evidence of mycoplasma coinfections (odds ratio [OR] = 41.8; confidence limits [CL] = 11.3–155; and p < .001) compared with controls, whereas 50% of CFS patients without a diagnosis of Lyme disease show Mycoplasma coinfections (OR = 19.0; CL = 5.3–69; and p < .001) compared with controls. Because CFS patients without a diagnosis of Lyme disease have a high prevalence of one of four Mycoplasma species and a majority show evidence of multiple infections, we examined CFS/Lyme patients' blood for various Mycoplasma species. We found that CFS patients with Lyme disease mostly had single species Mycoplasma infections (OR = 31.7; CL = 8.6–116; and p < .001) with a preponderance of Mycoplasma fermentans infections (50% of patients; OR = 59.0; CL = 7.6–460; and p < .001), whereas the most commonly found Mycoplasma species in CFS patients without Lyme disease was Mycoplasma pneumoniae (34% of patients; OR = 14.94; CL = 3.3–69; and p < .001). Conclusions: The results indicate that a subset of CFS patients show evidence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi , and a large fraction of these patients were also infected with Mycoplasma fermentans and to a lesser degree with other Mycoplasma species.",1634,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A 15-year-old boy presented at the age of 9 with recurrent rather painless swelling of the right knee. Altogether four episodes lasting for 1–2 weeks each occurred over a period of 18 months before medical advice was sought. Physical examination revealed only a slightly limited range of motion. Living in an endemic area of borreliosis, he reported a tick bite 6 months prior to onset of his symptoms with erythema migrans and was treated for 10 days with amoxicillin. Serology revealed two positive unspecific bands in IgG immunoblot (p41 and 66) with slight positivity for ELISA. Ultrasound revealed synovial thickening and increased fluid. Despite the weak positive serology a diagnosis of lyme arthritis could not be excluded and intravenous antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone was started. After two further relapses antiinflammatory therapy including intraarticular steroids were introduced with no long lasting effect. A chronical disease developed with alternate periods of swelling and almost complete remission. Ultrasound as well as MRI demonstrated ongoing signs of synovitis, therefore after further progression, a diagnostic arthroscopy was performed showing an inconspicuous knee joint. A second MRI showed focal suprapatellar enhancement and was followed by open arthrotomy revealing a histopathological proven synovial cavernous juxtaarticular hemangioma. To our knowledge, the differential diagnosis of lyme arthritis and synovial hemangioma has not yet been reported despite obvious clinical similarities. In conclusion, in children and adolescents synovial hemangioma has to be considered in differential diagnosis of recurrent knee swelling. Early diagnosis is important to prevent prolonged suffering from chronic joint swelling with probable joint damages, unnecessary treatment procedures and as well school and sports absenteeism.",2001,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Die erste und häufigste Manifestation bei ca. 80–90% der Patienten ist die lokalisierte Frühinfektion der Haut, das Erythema migrans, das neben der typischen Form zahlreiche atypische klinische Varianten hat. Das solitäre Borrelienlymphozytom ist sehr viel seltener und v. a. bei Kindern zu finden. Durch die Verbesserung der Früherkennung wird nur bei 10–20% der Erkrankten die Diagnose erst im disseminierten oder Spätstadium gestellt. Multiple Erythemata migrantia als Zeichen der hämatogenen Disseminierung von B. burgdorferi werden häufig nicht erkannt. Im Spätstadium treten an der Haut eine chronische plasmazelluläre Dermatitis und die Acrodermatitits chronica atrophicans im ödematös infiltrativen Stadium bis hin zum atrophen Stadium auf. Zur Sicherung ungewöhnlicher kutaner Krankheitsmanifestationen eignen sich der DNA-Nachweis mittels Polymerasekettenreaktion und die kulturelle Anzucht aus Hautgewebe.

Optic Neuritis is a rare manifestation of Neuroborreliosis and we present the only case in the literature diagnosed by the gold standard two-tier testing procedure of ELISA and Immunoblot. A previously fit 50-year-old theology teacher had a flu-like illness in January 2010 and suffered from fatigue for 2 months. In April he had right arm and facial paraesthesia. MRI Brain was unremarkable. He was fitted with a pacemaker in September as long pauses were discovered on Holter monitoring. In October he developed painful eye movements and over the course of a few days his visual acuity and colour vision deteriorated and he was diagnosed with optic neuritis. Two months later he presented to the neurology department with a 3 week history of bladder and bowel dysfunction, ascending sensory symptoms and leg weakness. Physical examination revealed a spastic paraparesis. CSF consisted mainly of lymphocytes (283 µl), an elevated protein (1.11) and occasional plasma cells. He had strongly positive serum and CSF IgM and IgG titres for borrelia on both ELISA and immunoblot testing. He had a previous tick bite and had numerous exposures in Germany, Hungary and the New Forest. He was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and he improved such that he could walk again. This case demonstrates the clinical heterogeneity of Neuroborreliosis and earlier recognition of this as a cause of optic neuritis could prevent development of more devastating consequences such as transverse myelitis.",1498,0,0,1,0,en,de,

The infection with Borrelia burgdorferi can result in acute to chronic Lyme disease. In addition, coinfection with tick-borne pathogens, Babesia species and Anaplasma phagocytophilum has been increasing in endemic regions of the USA and Europe. The currently used serological diagnostic tests are often difficult to interpret and, moreover, antibodies against the pathogens persist for a long time making it difficult to confirm the cure of the disease. In addition, these tests cannot be used for diagnosis of early disease state before the adaptive immune response is established. Since nucleic acids of the pathogens do not persist after the cure, DNA-based diagnostic tests are becoming highly useful for detecting infectious diseases. Results. In this study, we describe a real-time multiplex PCR assay to detect the presence of B. burgdorferi, B. microti and A. phagocytophilum simultaneously even when they are present in very low copy numbers. Interestingly, this quantitative PCR technique is also able to differentiate all three major Lyme spirochete species, B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii , and B. garinii by utilizing a post-PCR denaturation profile analysis and a single molecular beacon probe. This could be very useful for diagnosis and discrimination of various Lyme spirochetes in European countries where all three Lyme spirochete species are prevalent. As proof of the principle for patient samples, we detected the presence of low number of Lyme spirochetes spiked in the human blood using our assay. Finally, our multiplex assay can detect all three tick-borne pathogens in a sensitive and specific manner irrespective of the level of each pathogen present in the sample. We anticipate that this novel diagnostic method will be able to simultaneously diagnose early to chronic stages of Lyme disease, babesiosis and anaplasmosis using the patients’ blood samples. Conclusion. Real-time quantitative PCR using specific primers and molecular beacon probes for the selected amplicon described in this study can detect three tick-borne pathogens simultaneously in an accurate manner.",2109,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Study Design A retrospective case report and a systematic literature search in PubMed and Embase were performed. Results We describe a patient presenting with sudden sensorineural hearing loss, followed by a facial paralysis, which could be attributed to Lyme disease confirmed by positive serology and a positive immunoblot. She was successfully treated with ceftriaxone, with recovery of the facial paralysis, although no recovery of the hearing loss was observed. A systematic literature search resulted in 4 relevant and valid articles revealing that confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi varies from 0% to 21.3%, suggesting active Lyme disease as a cause in patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Two studies demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi as compared with the incidence in the general local population. Conclusion Literature suggests that sudden sensorineural hearing loss may coincide with Borrelia burgdorferi infection. A higher incidence of confirmed positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi in patients with sudden deafness seems to be depending on the country and on the tests used to confirm Lyme disease. This should be taken into account if serologic testing for Lyme disease in patients with sudden deafness is considered.",1423,0,0,1,0,hu,en,

This review summarizes the literature on scleratrophic skin lesions as a manifestation of a Borrelia infection. An association of morphea with Lyme borreliosis was mainly reported from Middle-European Countries, Japan and South America. B. afzelii has been identified predominantly from the chronic skin lesions of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) and has been cultivated from morphea lesions in isolated cases. Scleratrophic skin lesions like morphea, lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) and anetoderma have been observed in coexistence with ACA. Since all these diseases show clinical and histological similarities, they might have a common origin. The laboratory results that point to a borrelial origin of these diseases, however, are contradictory. Antibodies against B. burgdorferi were detected in up to 50% of patients. Borrelia DNA was shown in up to 33% of morphea and 50% of LSA patients. Borrelia were visualized on histological slides by polyclonal antibodies in up to 69% of morphea and 63% of LSA patients. In other reports no evidence of Borrelia – associated morphea or LSA has been reported. For anetoderma, single case reports showed positive Borrelia serology and/or PCR and a response to antibiotic treatment. The response of scleratrophic skin lesions to antibiotic treatment varies and can be seen in patients with or without a proven association to a Borrelia infection. This suggests that scleratrophic diseases might be of heterogeneous origin, but a Borrelia infection could be one cause of these dermatoses.",1555,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Early Lyme neuroborreliosis, which is much better defined and far more common than late Lyme neuroborreliosis, is in Europe caused mainly by B. garinii and comprises the classic triad of meningitis, radiculoneuritis and/or cranial neuropathy, while in American patients subacute meningitis with or without cranial neuropathy is the most common manifestation. Among chronic forms of European Lyme neuroborreliosis peripheral neuritis associated with acrodermatitis chronic atrophicans is most frequently observed. A reliable diagnosis of borrelial central nervous system infection requires demonstration of lymphocytic pleocytosis and the evidence of borrelial infection of the central nervous system, established by intrathecal synthesis of specific antibodies and/or isolation of Borreliae from the cerebrospinal fluid.

Lyme disease is one of the most frequent tick-borne diseases worldwide, it can be multi-systemic and insidious, in particular when it shows a chronic course. In recent years co-infections represent an emerging issue in Lyme disease spectrum because in addition to Borrelia burgdorferi sl many other potential pathogens may be transmitted by hard ticks Ixodes species. The main co-infections found in Lyme disease described in this review are represented by Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia species, Bartonella species, Rickettsiae species and tick-borne encephalitis virus . For each single co-infecting micro-organism, clinical features, diagnostic issues and therapeutical approaches are discussed. Co-infections represent an emerging problem because they might exacerbate Lyme disease clinical features, they can also mimic Lyme borreliosis sharing common manifestations, and eventually they can change the course of the disease itself.

BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease in which the myelin sheath of nerve cells is damaged. It can cause delayed neurologic symptoms similar to those seen in Lyme disease (LD) patients. Thymus derived T-cells (myelin reactive) migrate to the blood brain barrier and stimulate an inflammatory cascade in the central nervous system. Cell based therapies play an important role in treating neurological diseases such as MS and LD. CASE REPORT: Human embryonic stem cell (hESC) therapy was used to treat two patients with both MS and LD. The hESCs were administered via different routes including intramuscular, intravenous, and supplemental routes (e.g., deep spinal, caudal, intercostal through eye drops) to regenerate the injured cells. Both the patients showed remarkable improvement in their functional skills, overall stamina, cognitive abilities, and muscle strength. Furthermore, the improvement in the patients’ conditions were assessed by magnetic resonance tractography and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). CONCLUSIONS: Therapy with hESCs might emerge as an effective and safe treatment for patients with both MS and LD. Well-designed clinical trials and follow-up studies are needed to prove the long-term efficacy and safety of hESC therapy in the treatment of patients with MS and LD.

A tick antifreeze glycoprotein, IAFGP, possesses potent antibiofilm properties against a variety of clinical pathogens, including S. aureus . Synergy between IAFGP, or a peptide (P1) representative of a repeat region of the protein, with different antibiotics was assessed in vitro . Antibiotics that synergized with either IAFPG or P1 were further evaluated in vivo using vertebrate and invertebrate infection models. IAFGP readily enhanced the efficacy of antibiotics against S. aureus . Synergy with daptomycin, an antibiotic used to treat methicillin-resistant S. aureus , was observed in vitro and in vivo using iafgp -transgenic mice and flies. Furthermore, synergy with ciprofloxacin or gentamicin, antibiotics not generally used to treat S. aureus , was also perceived. The combined effect of the antibiotic and IAFGP was associated with improved permeation of the antibiotic into the cell. Our results highlight that synergy of IAFGP with antibiotics traditionally used to treat this pathogen, and enhancement of the potency of antibiotics not commonly used against this microbe, can provide novel alternative therapeutic strategies to combat bacterial infections.",1315,0,0,1,0,en,en,

With approximately one-third of their genomes consisting of linear and circular plasmids, the Lyme disease agent cluster of species has the most complex genomes among known bacteria. We report here a comparative analysis of plasmids in eleven Borreliella (also known as Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato) species. Results. We sequenced the complete genomes of two B. afzelii, two B. garinii, and individual B. spielmanii , B. bissettiae, B. valaisiana and B. finlandensis isolates. These individual isolates carry between seven and sixteen plasmids, and together harbor 99 plasmids. We report here a comparative analysis of these plasmids, along with 70 additional Borreliella plasmids available in the public sequence databases. We identify only one new putative plasmid compatibility type (the 30th) among these 169 plasmid sequences, suggesting that all or nearly all such types have now been discovered. We find that the linear plasmids in the non- B. burgdorferi species have undergone the same kinds of apparently random, chaotic rearrangements mediated by non-homologous recombination that we previously discovered in B. burgdorferi . These rearrangements occurred independently in the different species lineages, and they, along with an expanded chromosomal phylogeny reported here, allow the identification of several whole plasmid transfer events among these species. Phylogenetic analyses of the plasmid partition genes show that a majority of the plasmid compatibility types arose early, most likely before separation of the Lyme agent Borreliella and relapsing fever Borrelia clades, and this, with occasional cross species plasmid transfers, has resulted in few if any species-specific or geographic region-specific Borreliella plasmid types. Conclusions. The primordial origin and persistent maintenance of the Borreliella plasmid types support their functional indispensability as well as evolutionary roles in facilitating genome diversity. The improved resolution of Borreliella plasmid phylogeny based on conserved partition-gene clusters will lead to better determination of gene orthology which is essential for prediction of biological function, and it will provide a basis for inferring detailed evolutionary mechanisms of Borreliella genomic variability including homologous gene and plasmid exchanges as well as non-homologous rearrangements.",2377,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

clinical manifestation in Lyme disease. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may help in
any diagnostic doubt characterized by CSF pleocytosis (lymphoïd and plasma cells) and borrelia -specific antibodies produced intathecally. Keywords: Cerebrospinal Fluid; Neuroborreliosis; Erythema Migrans Introduction. A 62-year-old man presented with a back pain radiating to
right thigh, severe asthenia and no fever. Serum C protein and
erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Two months later
given tetraparesis manifestation, a MR scan of spine has been
realized and displayed high-density signal extending between T11
to L1. The MR scan of brain was normal. Infectious mononucleosis
screen, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B and C serology were negative.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed hypercellular specimen
(white blood cells=630/μL, red blood cells=10/μL). The protein
concentration was 2.1 g/L and glucose 3.2 mmol/L (normal paired
plasma glucose). The cytological analysis of CSF (cytocentrifuge
preparation, magnification x60, May-Grünwald Giemsa staining,
Figure 1A-1C showed polymorphous lymphoïd population including
small lymphocytes, granular lymphocytes, large immunoblasts
(arrow) and plasma cells (asterisk). Flow cytometry (FCM) immunophenotyping of CSF (Figure 1D)
identified mainly small T-cells (84%) associated to polytypic B-cells
(10%) including large and small cells, and polytypic plasma cells
(4%). Morphology associatied to immunologic profile argue to CSF
involvemennt by activated lymphoïd population. The patient only
remembered untreated skin lesions on abdomen 10 weeks before.
The Borrelia enzyme immunoassy result was found to be reactive
and confirmed with positive immunoblot to IgG and IgM. The CSF
also contained antibodies to Borrelia and the Borrelia-specific CSF
to serum IgG antibody index was at 8.1 (normal range < 1.3). The
patient was therefore diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliose and
treated with intravenous ceftriaxone, which resulted in an almost
complete recovery. Figure 1: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (cytocentrifuge preparation, magnification x60, May-Grünwald Giemsa staining, Fig
A-C): Small lymphoid cells (scanty cytoplasm and regular nuclear), granular lymphocytes (abundant and pale cytoplasm with
azurophilic granules), immunoblasts (large cells with abundant and basophilic cytoplasm; arrow) and plasma cells (eccentric
nuclei with clumped chromatin and basophilic cytoplasm; asterisk). Immunophenotype by multiparameter flow cytometry
(FCM) was realized on CSF. Data were acquired on a BD FACSCanto II cytometer and analyzed with BD FACS DIVA version
8.0.1 software (*Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). A first panel of 10 antibodies in one tube was used to identify T- and
B-cells : CD3 (clone SK7,15-18*, APC-H7), CD5 (clone L17F12*, PerCP Cy5.5), CD4 (clone RPA-T4*, V450), CD8 (RPA-T8*,
FITC), CD45 (clone HI30*, V500), CD20 (clone L27-9*, V450), CD19 (clone J3-119**, PE Cy7), CD10 (clone HI10a3*, APC), CD56
(clone NCAM 16,2*, PE) and kappa/lambda (***, FITC/PE) (** Beckman-Coulter, Hialeah, FL, USA, ***Dako, Carpinteria, CA).
A second panel was used to identify plasma cells (including CD38 [clone HB7*, V450], CD138 [Syndecan-1**, PC5]). Conclusion. In conclusion, this case illustrates CNS involvement in
neuroborreliosis that will develop in less of 5% of untreated
erythema migrans, and usually 4–6 weeks after tick exposure
[1]. Only 25% of patients with neuroborreliosis recall a tick bite
and about 50% report a localized skin reaction so the absence
of a history of tick bite or rash does not exclude the diagnosis.
Although the analysis of CSF is not recommended in all patients,
in any diagnostic doubt it will be usefulness with characteristically
CSF pleocytosis (lymphoïd and plasma cells) and borrelia -specific

Background: Lyme Disease (LD) is the most commonly reported vector-borne
disease in the United States, affecting over 300,000 people in the United States each year.
If early LD goes undetected or is inadequately treated, the causative spirochete bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi , can disseminate throughout the body and cause chronic symptoms
that will characterize a patient with late LD. The incidence of LD is generally reported at
a higher rate in light-skinned patients as compared to dark-skinned patients. Aim: To assess the rate and causative factors of late Lyme Disease in dark-skinned
individuals within the Appalachian region and encourage research into the need for early
clinical evaluation and testing for at-risk patients. Discussion: Healthcare providers are at risk of missing the diagnosis of acute Borrelia
infection in dark-skinned patients based on historically lower reporting frequency and
non-traditional early symptoms and clinical presentation. Misdiagnosis, or delayed
diagnosis, adversely affects the health outcomes of people of color and risks progression
of the infection from early to late LD. Recommendations: We defined the characteristics of darker skin tones as a
quantitative score to identify the risk for non-traditional presentation of the early signs of Borrelia infection. Using this score, we recommend determining the association between
dark skin color and undiagnosed LD based upon a systematic study on the correlation
of patient skin color and positive LD testing. This data should be combined with other
risks of exposure. The results of the recommended research would determine whether
physicians in Appalachia should incorporate comprehensive treatment plans for LD in
dark-skinned patients as preventive medical practice. Keywords: Lyme Disease; Dark Skinned;
Missed Diagnosis; Appalachia; Minority;
Late Lyme Disease; Chronic Lyme Disease Lyme Disease Defined. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) presently, Lyme Disease (LD) is the most commonly
reported vector-borne disease in the United States, affecting
over 300,000 people in the United States each year [1]. LD is not
only of nationwide concern, but also infects people in more than
80 countries worldwide [2]. LD is commonly transmitted by the
blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis, infected with the spirochete
bacteria, Borrelia burgdorferi [1]. However, LD spirochetes are
also transmitted globally through minor Borrelia species such as B.
garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae, B. japonica, B. tanukii, B.
turdi, B. miyamotoi and B. mayonii [3,4]. According to the CDC in 2016, the highest incidence of reported
cases of B. burgdorferi transmitted LD in the U.S. occurs in the New
England region and Midwestern regions such as Wisconsin and
Minnesota [1,5]. B. mayonii was recently reported in 2013 and is
a genetic strain that is a mixture of B. burgdorferi, B. garinii , and B.
afzelii [6]. Currently, B. mayonii resides in the Midwestern region of
the United States and is the only other known Borrelia species to
cause LD in the United States [6]. Outside of the United States, LD occurs mostly in Europe
and Asia. In Europe, the majority of the LD reports appear from
Scandinavian countries and Central Europe [4]. In Europe, LD cases
are primarily caused by B. afzelii , followed by B. garinii, B. valaisiana and B. lusitaniae [3,4-5]. In Asia, specifically Japan, B. japonica, B.
tanukii, B. turdi , and B. miyamotoi are the causative agents of LD
[3,4]. While multiple Borrelia species contribute to LD globally, B.
burgdorferi remains the primary causative agent of LD in the United
States [1]. Patients infected with LD can present with a variety of
symptoms [7]. During the early phase of LD, 50% of patients
get a non-itchy rash, but only 9% of people get the characteristic
bullseye, Erythema Migrans (EM), usually centered on the tick bite
site. Other symptoms that manifest during the acute phase of LD
are flu-like symptoms that range from fevers, chills, sweats, muscle
aches, fatigue, nausea, and joint pain [8]. A more severe symptom,
especially in younger patients, involves peripheral cranial nerve
VII, causing facial drooping, a condition resulting in unilateral or
bilateral facial palsy, commonly known as Bell’s Palsy [8]. If LD goes undetected or is improperly treated, the spirochete
bacteria can disseminate throughout the body and various chronic
symptoms may occur that will characterize a patient with chronic,
or late phase, LD [8]. Late LD symptoms include but are not limited
to: malar flush, red earlobes, temporomandibular joint dysfunction,
jaw pain, severe headaches, neck stiffness, additional EM rashes
on other areas of the body, arthritis, severe joint pain, facial palsy,
intermittent pain in tendons, muscles, joints, and bones, heart
palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, encephalomyelitis,
meningitis, neuritis, shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the
hands or feet, depression and problems with short-term memory
[7-9]. It should be noted that as of the last decade, “chronic Lyme
disease” has been considered an inadequately descriptive term
which would be more accurately described as “late Lyme disease”
[10]. The two phrases are commonly interchanged, and, in this
paper, they are used synonymously to maintain accurate reporting
of survey data. Vector of Lyme Disease in Appalachia. In the U.S. Appalachian region, the primary bacterial species
that transmits LD is B. burgdorferi [12,13]. The vector for LD in
the Appalachian region is the Ixodes scapularis tick species and is
typically found in regions with mesic forests and alfisol type soils,
a soil that is leached basic or slightly acid with a clay-enriched B
horizon subsoil, overlying sedimentary rocks [13]. These conditions
are characteristic of mountainous towns and communities found in
the Appalachian region especially above 3,000 feet. Besides LD, I.
scapularis serves as a vector for anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Borrelia
miyamotoi disease, Powassan virus disease, and ehrlichiosis
associated with Ehrlichia muris eauclarensis [14]. Approximately 80% of LD cases occur in endemic regions,
specifically the northeast United States [15]. The majority of the
remaining cases occur in the southeast and Appalachian regions.
Between 2000 and 2014, the geographic distribution of LD cases
significantly expanded in the southeastern United States, especially
in the southern Virginia mountain ranges [11,15-17]. This spread
is expected to continue further south in Appalachia over upcoming
years. The cause of this continued increase of LD incidence is
unknown at the time, but some hypotheses include climate
change and increases in population in endemic regions [11]. Tick
abundance is correlated with higher altitudes because of climate
change [18]. However, one study anticipates a 213% increase in
suitable habitat regions for I. scapularis because of climate change
[19]. This study also reports that the southern states of the U.S. will
become non-habitable for I. scapularis due to temperature increase,
and therefore expects the prevalence of LD to increase in northern
regions of North America [19]. Vector of Lyme Disease in Appalachia. Appalachia is a 205,000 square mile region that surrounds
the Appalachian Mountains sections from southern New York to
northeastern Mississippi. Geographically, this region includes all
of West Virginia and parts of 12 other states: Alabama, Georgia,
Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia [20].
Ethnically, the majority of the region’s earliest settlers came from
Anglo-Scottish border countries (Scottish-Irish) with a minority
consisting of Swedish and Finnish settlers [21]. In the 19th century,
major pioneer groups included Germans along with Italians and
Eastern Europeans. African Americans have been a consistent
minority representative, consisting of 8% of the Appalachian
Research Council (ARC)-designated region, and Native Americans,
Cherokee Indians in particular [22,23]. A racial group of interest with respect to the incidence of LD in
Appalachia are the Melungeons. Melungeons are an isolated tri-racial
group of mixed African, European, and Native American ancestry
associated with the Cumberland Gap area of central Appalachia,
including portions of East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and
eastern Kentucky [24,25]. The origins of the Melungeons came
from the principle of “partus sequitur ventrem” which became
Virginia Law in 1662 that deemed children to be classified by the
ethnicity of the mother. This led to the union between black men
and white women, which became the foundation for the oldest free
families of color [26]. According to genealogists, the earliest lineage
came from the unions of black and white indentured servants prior
the widespread rise of slavery and with the later passing of laws
that restricted interracial marriages, the children of these groups
intermarried with each other or mixed with persons of Native
American ancestry [25-27]. This diversification of the population
led to a variety of physical traits, including skin tone, within the
Appalachian region. This is of medical significance due to the
historical challenge of diagnosing dermatological presentations of
diseases such as LD. The Appalachian Trail: Exposure to LD Vectors. Cases of LD in Virginia have increased in frequency since 2005
[20]. Unique to the northeastern states with the highest prevalence
of LD is the 2,175-mile Appalachian Trail (AT). Its route transects
the eastern United States, passing through Virginia to Springer
Mountain in Georgia, and is an ideal geographic area for LD
acquisition because of the presence of the tick vector and rodent and
deer hosts [21-23]. Many parents with infants and young children
use the AT for day trips or short weekend camping. Epidemiological
data of LD reported for counties along the AT shows that the
highest rates of LD occur in New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey,
and incidence rates in these states have increased since 1992 [24-
26]. With millions of visitors, day hikers, and section hikers that
frequent various sections of the trail, interaction between hiker and
tick, and thus exposure to the vectors of LD, is likely [27]. According to the study done by Knoll et al. [26], 23 out of
379 hikers reported that a rash developed during the hike. They
concluded that the LD identification abilities of hikers remain poor
with only 54% able to identify the surrogate marker of EM bullseye
[28]. Regardless of geographic region, previous studies report a
risk of exposure to spirochete-infected host-seeking I. scapularis nymphs in recreational settings including the Appalachian Trail
[29]. However, the epidemiological surveillance conducted at the
county spatial scale by Eisen et al. [28] demonstrated that despite
the elevated risk of tick contact in national parks, one cannot
adequately infer the risk of tick-borne disease for park visitors and
hikers [29,30]. Due to varied ecology and varied human behaviors
within parks, the density of infected ticks may further obfuscate
any real correlations and findings [31]. Racial Differences in Reported LD Incidence. Skin color is classified utilizing either the Fitzpatrick scale or
the older von Luschan scale. The Fitzpatrick scale consists of six
roman numerals that categorize epidermal melanin based on its
response to the effects of sun and Ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas
the older von Luschan scale visually evaluates a subject’s skin color
by comparing it to a standardized set of thirty-six opaque tiles
[32]. The von Luschan scale would be a more relevant tool for the
study of direct skin color, while the Fitzpatrick scale focuses on the
response of variously pigmented skin to UV exposure [33]. Drawing
a parallel between skin color and specific ethnic groups is difficult,
controversial, and often unreliable. In most states including Virginia, there are five categories to
indicate one’s racial designation and this information can be readily
acquired [34]. However, this information is often inadequate due
to ethnic groups having a substantial variation in skin color. For
example, Virginia has an Asian population of 6.1%, but they could
fall under any of the Roman numerals in the Fitzpatrick scale [35].
As reported by Fix et al [34] from 1993-2000, the incidence of LD
was inordinately higher among the white population [36]. In this
investigation, the data for race was compiled via self-designation,
but this method is prone to errors as the classification process
is not well defined. However, using this method does allow LD to
be analyzed in conjunction with skin color rather than race alone
[36,37]. Since skin color and ethnicity is difficult to accurately compare
and contrast with the diagnosis of LD and with the presence of
erythema migrans, the Maryland State LD Registry was established
in 1993 by the University of Maryland, Baltimore, and the
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). Their goal
was to provide a database for assessing outcomes of antibiotic
therapy and to provide thorough, statewide surveillance for LD
during 1993–1996. The registry was heavily patient driven and
was inclusive to the different kinds of people who were affected
by LD [36-39]. Presently, Lymedisease.org, an educational and
research advocacy group, has established MyLyme Data to develop
and to accelerate research in LD by providing observational data
and by serving as a research platform for more traditional LD
studies. Most of the patients in MyLyme Data (79%) identify their
current stage of illness as late (16% of patients) or as chronic LD
(61% of patients). This registry is designed to address all sorts
of factors such as disease progression, delayed diagnoses, factors
contributing to poor outcomes, geographical prevalence, ethnicity
and skin color, treatments, genetic factors, and studying those who
made a full recovery [40]. Reporting of LD Incidence for Individuals with Dark Skin. The incidence of LD is generally reported at a higher rate
in white people as compared to other races [36-41]. This high
incidence of LD is attributed to living in an endemic area, which
is regarded as a key risk factor due to increased risk of exposure
[36]. Although people with lighter skin and people of color both
live in endemic areas, this disparity in the reporting of LD incidence
persists [42]. According to a study on the racial differences in
reported LD incidence, this disparity could be due to a number of
factors including risk exposure, disparities in access to healthcare,
misdiagnosis, and health provider bias [36]. The characteristic
EM rash does not always appear with LD, but if present, the rash
can be difficult to see on darker skin [43,44]. The possible result
of misdiagnosis or the inability to appreciate EM could explain the
increased occurrence of arthritis among African Americans in an
endemic area as arthritis is an indication of the late disseminated
stage of LD [36-46]. The study on racial differences in reported
LD incidence also found a negative association between the LD
symptoms of EM and arthritis [36]. As LD spreads towards the
southwestern part of Virginia, health providers, as well as the
general population, need to have an increased awareness of how LD
manifests in people of color so that infected individuals may receive
proper treatment [47]. Differences in Exposure Risks for Individuals with Dark
Skin. The disparity of LD incidence between people with light skin
and people with darker skin has been correlated to LD Exposure risk [36]. A study conducted from 2000-2014 to characterize
LD expansion in Virginia found that the most notable area of LD
expansion was along the Appalachian Mountains [11]. They found
that this trend increases exposure risk for individuals living along
this mountain chain to certain tick habitats ranging from suburban
to rural locations. According to a 2011 study conducted by the
National Park Service, 92% of visitors who went to Shenandoah
National Park were white [48]. In regard to risk exposure, a 2018
Outdoor Participation Report by The Outdoor Foundation found
that 74% of people who engaged in at least one of forty-two different
outdoor activities in 2017 were non-Hispanic Caucasian, while 10%
were Hispanic, 9% were Black, and 6% were Asian [49]. Racial
differences in outdoor activities appears to be a significant factor in
the racial disparity in LD incidence rates [36-49]. However, underrecognition
of LD in people with dark skin seems to also be a likely
significant factor in LD incidence disparity as LD is underreported
by as much as 90% and is more difficult to diagnose than in people
with light skin [11-36]. When statewide surveillance of LD began in Virginia in 1989,
the practice of confirming LD cases was with the presence of EM
or the correlation of laboratory testing with at least one late stage
symptom. This practice continued until 2008, when the National
Surveillance Case Definition changed [50]. The current practice to
confirm a LD case in an already endemic area is with the presence of
EM or known exposure; otherwise, a positive laboratory testing is
required in a non-endemic area for the confirmation of LD [50,51].
Despite the change, these guidelines still could lead to an underdiagnosis
of dark-skinned individuals with LD due to the differing
appearance of the classic EM. Manifestation of LD Differences in Ethnic Groups. LD is known as the “second great imitator” after systemic
erythematous lupus, due to its numerous nonspecific symptoms
[51]. The EM rash is the only physical symptom that is distinctive
enough to allow a diagnosis of LD in the absence of laboratory
testing [49]. It is important to note that on darker skin, EM
resembles a bruise [52]. Currently, laboratory tests alone for LD are
not reliable and require confirmation by a clinical diagnosis [43].
As LD persists untreated, it causes a late disseminated infection
with symptoms including arthritis, arrhythmia, encephalopathy,
carditis, and severe headaches which are more prevalently
observed in individuals with darker skin since the EM rash is
difficult to observe [45-53]. Hispanics with LD, for instance, were
significantly more likely than non-Hispanics with LD to have signs
of disseminated infection and symptom onset matching the criteria
for late phase or chronic LD [54]. This could suggest an association
between the presence of an LD infection and the related symptoms.
Although diagnostic tests should be performed and appropriate
therapy could be administered to patients with symptoms of LD,
the difficulty of diagnosing LD lies in health providers’ awareness of
how LD manifests in populations of darker skin color [46]. The Role of Healthcare Providers in LD Diagnosis. LD can be very difficult to diagnose because the most common
diagnostic tests are inaccurate approximately 50% of the time,
especially sub-acutely or late in the disease process [43]. Without
the characteristic EM to aid in diagnosing LD, blood tests, which
are utilized to detect antibodies to LD, require increased accuracy,
specificity, and sensitivity in preventing and treating LD [54]. LD
requires a clinical diagnosis and health providers in areas with
increased LD prevalence need to be aware of LD manifestations
in people of all ethnicities and skin colors [43]. Healthcare
providers assume based on recorded statistics that LD is rare in
African Americans and people of color, which translates into lower
incidence rates reported for people of color who may be presenting
with less characteristic symptoms [36]. Misdiagnosis, or late
diagnosis, adversely affects health outcomes of people of color as
patients living with chronic LD have reported severe decline in
health status [46]. Recommendations. Implications. The primary concern related to these facts is that LD is reported
with lower frequency in populations in Appalachia with darker skin
tones but may be due to discrepancies in diagnosis by healthcare
professionals, among other factors [36]. In order for healthcare
professionals to address the issue for their patients, we provide the
following recommendations. We define the characteristic of darker
skin tones as a “high VL score”, or a score of ≥19 on the von Luschan
chromatic scale Figure 1, which has a maximum score of 38 for
the darkest possible skin pigmentation expected in a patient [36,
56]. It is noted that while the von Luschan scale has been phased
out of medical use for racial demographic categorization, it is an
inexpensive and sufficient tool for skin tone as an independent
characteristic [56]. One reason that the initial symptoms of LD
are potentially overlooked in these patients is that the EM that
normally characterizes the acute Ixodes tick bite associated with B.
burgdorferi infection is less visible during general examination of
high VL scoring patients [36-49]. Figure 1: Image of the original tiles used for the von
Luschan scale. The specific wavelengths of each pigment
has been identified by spectrophotometry. Many individuals in Appalachia who self-identify as minorities
according to the U.S. Census Bureau are projected to be high VL
scoring patients based on the Bureau’s average physical criteria
[36-56]. Additionally, certain minorities, such as African American
and Latinx individuals, have shown lower rates of receiving regular
medical service due to lack of access and/or an inability to afford
healthcare, as well as higher rates of occupations or lifestyles that
carry greater risk of exposure to the vectors of LD [49]. The lack
of physician access as well as the increased risk of exposure for
dark-skinned patients is of interest to us as a potential cause of
undiagnosed LD. This delay in diagnosis is a contributing factor in
the increased prevalence of LD in patients who are high VL scorers,
as well as the possibility of LD to be mistaken for other conditions
due to the similarities in patient presentations [57,58]. Areas of Focus. In order to confirm the need for further research into the
prevalence of undiagnosed acute and late phase LD in dark-skinned
patients, we recommend a systematic two-step research approach
that is justified by our observations. Both steps allow for the
anonymization of the patients involved and are expected to pose no
health risk to the participants. The combined data collected from
these studies would allow quantitative correlations to be made
regarding skin tone and the prevalence of undiagnosed and chronic
LD in the Appalachian region. The first step would focus on the
results of a medical survey of patients known to have LD to see if
there is a significantly greater prevalence of late phase LD in von
Luschan scale scorers of ≥19 out of 38 compared to von Luschan
scale scorers of below 19 [36-57]. The second step would focus on willing undiagnosed
participants who would be tested for acute and late phase LD, with
an interest in the correlation between positive results and higher
von Luschan scores [36-56]. The test for LD would involve use of
the Lyme antigen test, which is specific for the Borrelia bacterial
outer surface protein A (OpsA) and will show a positive result
if the Borrelia spirochete is present in the patient’s blood [57-
59]. This test has a higher sensitivity than the Enzyme-Linked
Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Western Blot methods, which
are only specific for the host’s antibody response to Borrelia and are
less accurate [57]. Following a positive test result, a physician must
then confirm LD through clinical investigation into the patient’s
other physical symptoms, environment, lifestyle, and relevant
background [57,58]. Potential Consequences and Related Recommendations. A positive correlation in both of the above research endeavors
would justify the inclusion of LD testing and preventive medicine for
LD for all patients in Appalachia who score ≥19 on the von Luschan
scale [36-57]. We advise physicians in the fields of primary care
and emergency medicine in particular to note correlating factors
between patients who have high VL scores and the prevalence of
LD [36-49]. Due to the high overlap between patients who are darkskinned
and are minorities, the greatest chance of encountering
these at-risk patients is during primary care or Emergency
Department (ED) visits. The results of the recommended research
would determine whether primary care and ED physicians in
Appalachia should: incorporate testing for LD as part of general
preventive medical treatment, prescribe preventive treatment for
at-risk patients, check for signs of Ixodes tick during a general exam
in at-risk patients, and prescribe antibiotics for patients that show
signs of Ixodes bites [57,58]. Additionally, at-risk patients should
be educated about the prevention of Lyme and self-monitoring for
signs of an Ixodes tick bite or symptoms of LD, as well as lifestyle
factors that increase risk of exposure to the vectors of LD and Borrelia [49-58]. References. (2019) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lyme Disease. (2013) Lyme Disease Association.

BACKGROUND: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) presents as a disruption of horizontal conjugate ocular movement and is an uncommon finding in the pediatric population. Its presence warrants a thorough evaluation to search for demyelinating, mass effect, inflammatory, or infectious etiologies. CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old African American girl presented to the Emergency Department with acute horizontal binocular diplopia in left gaze. An ophthalmic examination revealed a right INO. She denied any fever, chills, or neck stiffness. Complete blood counts and a metabolic panel were unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits revealed scattered pontine, periventricular, and subcortical white matter signal abnormalities within the left frontal lobe suggestive of active demyelination. MRI of the spinal column also demonstrated multiple areas of increased signal intensity from the C3 to C7-T1 region. Inflammatory and autoimmune studies were negative. However, her serum IgM and IgG studies were positive for Borrelia burgdorferi with negative CSF titers. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis demonstrated mildly elevated glucose (82 mg/dL) and oligoclonal bands, but was otherwise unremarkable. She was started on intravenous methylprednisolone and ceftriaxone. She was subsequently diagnosed with pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis and started on disease-modifying therapy, with full resolution of diplopia and INO 2 weeks later. CONCLUSIONS: We present a case of INO presenting as the first manifestation of multiple sclerosis in a pediatric patient with a concurrent infectious etiology. A thorough evaluation can lead to earlier identification and treatment of underlying diseases. Keywords: Lyme Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Ocular Motility Disorders",1793,0,0,1,0,en,en,

BACKGROUND: Lyme borreliosis, caused by spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi genospecies complex, is the most commonly reported tickborne infection in North America and those infected may present with cutaneous, cardiac, articular, and neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The protean nature of many of its clinical manifestations presents a diagnostic conundrum. Lyme disease can affect the heart, albeit rarely, with cardiac abnormalities usually manifesting as varying degrees of heart block or arrhythmias. CASE REPORT: We present a case of complete heart block in a young man who participated in outdoor activities in a Lyme-endemic area and developed fatigue and palpitations weeks after a flu-like illness. He noticed that his heart rate was low; he had an intermediate suspicious index in Lyme carditis (SILC) score with positive Lyme serologies. His initial electrocardiogram when he presented to the emergency department showed a complete heart block. In this case, he was successfully managed with intravenous ceftriaxone, amoxicillin, and a transcutaneous pacemaker, obviating the need for a permanent pacemaker. CONCLUSIONS: Electrocardiographic changes such as heart block and arrhythmias with or without symptoms may be the initial manifestation of Lyme carditis in a patient who may or may not remember a tick bite or have a typical skin rash. The SILC score may assist in recognizing these cases and prompt initiation of antibiotics usually leads to the resolution of these electrocardiographic abnormalities and symptoms that may be present.

The objective of the study was to examine the performance of the C6 EIA, and to determine optimal cut-off values for the test. The analysed data contained results of 1368 serum samples. C6 EIA index values were compared statistically with the immunoblot (IB) test results. The identified cut-off values were further tested in a well-defined LB patient cohort. Cut-off value 1.6 appeared to be optimal when C6 EIA was used as a stand-alone test. When using C6 EIA as the first-tier test, the optimal cut-off values were 0.9 and 2.4 for negative and positive results. When C6 EIA was used as a second-tier test, samples yielding C6 index values ≥3.0 could be considered positive. The identified cut-off values had also a high sensitivity to identify seropositivity among definite LB patients. The identified cut-off values refine the role of C6 EIA in LB serology. Importantly, the use of C6 EIA leads to a reduction in the number of samples that need to be analysed using an IB, thus also reducing the costs.

Wark', 'Rebecca Masel', 'Cao Thach Tran', 'Philip Haines']",10.12659/ajcr.933789,2021.0,0,journal-article,"Abstract. BACKGROUND: Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by bacteria of the Borrelia genus, endemic to the northeastern region of the United States. It typically presents with fevers, myalgias, and erythema migrans, but it can result in disseminated symptoms if left untreated. Lyme carditis is a rare, but potentially fatal complication of Lyme disease, occurring in up to 4-10% of untreated cases. Typically, it presents with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities, which resolve with intravenous antibiotics and temporary pacing if indicated. Diverse cardiac pathology, however, has been associated with Lyme carditis, which may be underrecognized in practice. CASE REPORT: A 34-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented with fatigue, dizziness, and shortness of breath, 2 weeks after camping in Rhode Island. Her presenting electrocardiogram demonstrated third-degree heart block. She was noted to have targetoid rashes on her left shoulder and breast on physical examination. On laboratory work-up, she was found to have positive Lyme total antibody enzyme immunoassay and positive Lyme western immunoblot. The findings were diagnostic for Lyme carditis. The patient’s cardiac rhythm subsequently converted to slow atrial flutter with variable ventricular response unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. Given evidence suggesting that atrioventricular conduction was preserved, synchronized electrical cardioversion was pursued and was ultimately successful in rhythm conversion to normal sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS: Although Lyme carditis is rare, this diagnosis should be of high clinical consideration in presentations of cardiac conduction abnormalities with acute onset and without other obvious cause, particularly in Lyme-endemic regions such as the northeastern United States.

Investigations of possible resistance mechanisms of the Borrelia burgdorferi complex must analyze clinical isolates obtained from LB patients, despite their receiving antibiotic treatment. Here, borrelial isolates obtained from five patients with erythema migrans (EM) before the start of antibiotic therapy and again after the conclusion of treatment were investigated. The 10 isolates were characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and plasmid profile analysis and subjected to susceptibility testing against a variety of antimicrobial agents including those used for initial chemotherapy. Four out of five patients were infected by the same genospecies ( Borrelia afzelii , n = 3; Borrelia garinii , n = 1) at the site of the EM lesion before and after antimicrobial therapy. In one patient the genospecies of the initial isolate ( B . afzelii ) differed from that of the follow-up isolate ( B . garinii ). No significant changes in the in vitro susceptibilities became obvious for corresponding clinical isolates before the start and after the conclusion of antimicrobial therapy. This holds true for the antimicrobial agents used for specific chemotherapy of the patients, as well as for any of the additional agents tested in vitro. Our study substantiates borrelial persistence in some EM patients at the site of the infectious lesion despite antibiotic treatment over a reasonable time period. Borrelial persistence, however, was not caused by increasing MICs or minimal borreliacidal concentrations in these isolates. Therefore, resistance mechanisms other than acquired resistance to antimicrobial agents should be considered in patients with LB resistant to treatment.",1831,0,0,0,1,en,en,

At least three species of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) cause tick-borne Lyme disease. Previous work including the genome analysis of B. burgdorferi B31 and B. garinii PBi suggested a highly variable plasmid part. The frequent occurrence of duplicated sequence stretches, the observed plasmid redundancy, as well as the mainly unknown function and variability of plasmid encoded genes rendered the relationships between plasmids within and between species largely unresolvable. Results. To gain further insight into Borreliae genome properties we completed the plasmid sequences of B. garinii PBi, added the genome of a further species, B. afzelii PKo, to our analysis, and compared for both species the genomes of pathogenic and apathogenic strains. The core of all Bbsl genomes consists of the chromosome and two plasmids collinear between all species. We also found additional groups of plasmids, which share large parts of their sequences. This makes it very likely that these plasmids are relatively stable and share common ancestors before the diversification of Borrelia species. The analysis of the differences between B. garinii PBi and B. afzelii PKo genomes of low and high passages revealed that the loss of infectivity is accompanied in both species by a loss of similar genetic material. Whereas B. garinii PBi suffered only from the break-off of a plasmid end, B. afzelii PKo lost more material, probably an entire plasmid. In both cases the vls gene locus encoding for variable surface proteins is affected. Conclusion. The complete genome sequences of a B. garinii and a B. afzelii strain facilitate further comparative studies within the genus Borrellia. Our study shows that loss of infectivity can be traced back to only one single event in B. garinii PBi: the loss of the vls cassettes possibly due to error prone gene conversion. Similar albeit extended losses in B. afzelii PKo support the hypothesis that infectivity of Borrelia species depends heavily on the evasion from the host response.",2036,0,0,0,1,ca,en,

The study included 45 unselected RA patients with knee joint effusions and 27 patients with knee joint effusions because of NEA. Serum and SF samples were investigated isochronously. OPG and sRANKL were measured by ELISA assays. In RA, sRANKL levels were higher in serum than in SF ( P = 0.007). In contrast, the NEA revealed higher sRANKL in SF compared to the serum ( P = 0.001). Though in RA the average levels of sRANKL ser were 5.6 times and of sRANKL syn 1.5 times higher than in NEA, the differences were not significant. The free (unbound) OPG in SF was not significantly different in RA compared to NEA. Also in serum, the measured free OPG was only slightly higher in RA.

Lyme disease in the United States is caused primarily by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto while other species are also prevalent in Europe. Genetic techniques have identified several chromosomal and plasmid-borne regulatory and virulence factors involved in Lyme pathogenesis. B31 and N40 are two widely studied strains of B. burgdorferi, which belong to two different 16 S-23 S r RNA s pacer t ypes (RST) and outer surface protein C (OspC) allelic groups. However, the presence of several known virulence factors in N40 has not been investigated. This is the first comprehensive study that compared these two strains both in vitro and using the mouse model of infection. Results. Phylogenetic analyses predict B31 to be more infectious. However, our studies here indicate that N40D10/E9 is more infectious than the B31 strain at lower doses of inoculation in the susceptible C3H mice. Based-upon a careful analyses of known adhesins of these strains, it is predicted that the absence of a known fibronectin-glycosaminoglycan binding adhesin, bbk32 , in the N40 strain could at least partially be responsible for reduction in its binding to Vero cells in vitro . Nevertheless, this difference does not affect the infectivity of N40D10/E9 strain. The genes encoding known regulatory and virulence factors critical for pathogenesis were detected in both strains. Differences in the protein profiles of these B. burgdorferi strains in vitro suggest that the novel, differentially expressed molecules may affect infectivity of B. burgdorferi . Further exacerbation of these molecular differences in vivo could affect the pathogenesis of spirochete strains. Conclusion. Based upon the studies here, it can be predicted that N40D10/E9 disseminated infection at lower doses may be enhanced by its lower binding to epithelial cells at the site of inoculation due to the absence of BBK32. We suggest that complete molecular analyses of virulence factors followed by their evaluation using the mouse infection model should form the basis of determining infectivity and pathogenicity of different strains rather than simple phylogenetic group analyses. This study further emphasizes a need to investigate multiple invasive strains of B. burgdorferi to fully appreciate the pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to Lyme disease manifestations.",2339,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

Sixty consecutive patients (49 men, mean age 62 years) with clinically suspected gout were included in this case–control study. DECT and US of feet, knees, hands and elbows were performed in all patients. Polarisation microscopy of synovial fluid or a score incorporating serum uric acid level, first MTP joint involvement, gender, previous patient-reported arthritis attack, cardiovascular diseases, joint redness and onset within 1 day was used as standard of reference. Standard of reference classified 39 patients as gout positive. Sixteen patients had gout and a concomitant rheumatic disease. Sensitivities for diagnosis of gout disease were 84.6 % (33/39) for DECT and 100 % (39/39) for US. Specificities were 85.7 % (18/21) for DECT and 76.2 % (16/21) for US. Positive and negative predictive values were 91.7 % (33/36) and 75.0 % (18/24) for DECT, 88.6 % (39/44) and 100 % (16/16) for US, respectively.

In Europe, Ixodes ricinus ticks are the most important vectors of diseases threatening humans, livestock, wildlife and companion animals. Nevertheless, genomic sequence information is missing and functional annotation of transcripts and proteins is limited. This lack of information is restricting studies of the vector and its interactions with pathogens and hosts. Here we present and integrate the first analysis of the I. ricinus genome with the transcriptome and proteome of the unfed I. ricinus midgut. Methods. Whole genome sequencing was performed on I. ricinus ticks and the sequences were de novo assembled. In parallel, I. ricinus ticks were dissected and the midgut transcriptome sequenced. Both datasets were integrated by transcript discovery analysis to identify putative genes and genome contigs were screened for homology. An alignment-based and a motif-search-based approach were combined for the annotation of the midgut transcriptome. Additionally, midgut proteins were identified and annotated by mass spectrometry with public databases and the in-house built transcriptome database as references and results were cross-validated. Results. The de novo assembly of 1 billion DNA sequences to a reference genome of 393 Mb length provides an unprecedented insight into the I. ricinus genome. A homology search revealed sequences in the assembled genome contigs homologous to 89 % of the I. scapularis genome scaffolds indicating coverage of most genome regions. We identified moreover 6,415 putative genes. More than 10,000 transcripts from naïve midgut were annotated with respect of predicted function and/or cellular localization. By combining an alignment-based with a motif-search-based annotation approach, we doubled the number of annotations throughout all functional categories. In addition, 574 gel spots were significantly identified by mass spectrometry ( p < 0.05) and 285 distinct proteins expressed in the naïve midgut were annotated functionally and/or for cellular localization. Our systems approach reveals a midgut metabolism of the unfed tick that is prepared to sense and process an anticipated blood meal. Conclusions. This multiple-omics study vastly extends the publicly available DNA and RNA databases for I. ricinus , paving the way for further in-depth analysis of the most important European disease vector and its interactions with pathogens and hosts.",2411,0,0,0,1,ca,en,

Carpi', 'affiliation': 'Yale University, New Haven, United States'}]",10.1186/s12864-015-1634-x,2015.0,24,Article,"Background. Rapid and accurate retrieval of whole genome sequences of human pathogens from disease vectors or animal reservoirs will enable fine-resolution studies of pathogen epidemiological and evolutionary dynamics. However, next generation sequencing technologies have not yet been fully harnessed for the study of vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens, due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality pathogen sequence data directly from field specimens with a high ratio of host to pathogen DNA. Results. We addressed this challenge by using custom probes for multiplexed hybrid capture to enrich for and sequence 30 Borrelia burgdorferi genomes from field samples of its arthropod vector. Hybrid capture enabled sequencing of nearly the complete genome (~99.5 %) of the Borrelia burgdorferi pathogen with 132-fold coverage, and identification of up to 12,291 single nucleotide polymorphisms per genome. Conclusions. The proprosed culture-independent method enables efficient whole genome capture and sequencing of pathogens directly from arthropod vectors, thus making population genomic study of vector-borne and zoonotic infectious diseases economically feasible and scalable. Furthermore, given the similarities of invertebrate field specimens to other mixed DNA templates characterized by a high ratio of host to pathogen DNA, we discuss the potential applicabilty of hybrid capture for genomic study across diverse study systems.",1439,0,0,0,1,ca,en,

BACKGROUND: Babesiosis is an emerging, tick-borne zoonosis caused by intraerythrocytic protozoa of the genus Babesia . Babesia microti is the main pathogen causing human disease and is endemic in the northeastern and upper midwestern parts of the USA. Severity of infection ranges from mild, self-limited, febrile viral-like illness accompanied by nonspecific symptoms to life-threatening infection complicated by severe hemolytic anemia, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and renal or/and hepatic failure. Splenic rupture (SR) is a very rare but life-threatening complication of severe B. microti infection. CASE REPORT: A 79-year-old female farmer from Wisconsin, USA was admitted during summer with hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous splenic rupture. She was transfused with 3 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC) and underwent emergent splenectomy. Postoperatively, she recovered well and was discharged on postoperative day 4. However, she was re-admitted on postoperative day 10 for febrile hemolytic anemia. Further exposure history was obtained and was significant for multiple tick bites 8 weeks preceding the index hospitalization. She was promptly diagnosed with babesiosis and Lyme disease co-infection. She responded favorably to 10 days of azithromycin and atovaquone and 21 days of oral doxycycline. CONCLUSIONS: Despite its rare occurrence, SR due to B. microti infection is a dreaded complication that can rapidly progress to hemorrhagic shock and death. In contrast to other complications of babesiosis, SR is not correlated with parasite burden or immune status of the affected host. Babesiosis should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis in patients from endemic areas presenting with atraumatic splenic rupture.

The blacklegged tick, Ixodes scapularis , is the primary vector of the Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi in North America. Though the tick is found across the eastern United States, Lyme disease is endemic to the northeast and upper midwest and rare or absent in the southern portion of the vector’s range. In an effort to better understand the tick microbiome from diverse geographic and climatic regions, we analysed the bacterial community of 115 I. scapularis adults collected from vegetation in Texas and Massachusetts, representing extreme ends of the vector’s range, by massively parallel sequencing of the 16S V4 rRNA gene. In addition, 7 female I. scapularis collected from dogs in Texas were included in the study. Results. Male I. scapularis ticks had a more diverse bacterial microbiome in comparison to the female ticks. Rickettsia spp. dominated the microbiomes of field-collected female I. scapularis from both regions, as well as half of the males from Texas. In addition, the male and female ticks captured from Massachusetts contained high proportions of the pathogens Anaplasma and Borrelia , as well as the arthropod endosymbiont Wolbachia . None of these were found in libraries generated from ticks collected in Texas. Pseudomonas , Acinetobacter and Mycobacterium were significantly differently abundant ( p < 0.05) between the male ticks from Massachusetts and Texas. Anaplasma and Borrelia were found in 15 and 63% of the 62 Massachusetts ticks, respectively, with a co-infection rate of 11%. Female ticks collected from Texas dogs were particularly diverse, and contained several genera including Rickettsia , Pseudomonas , Bradyrhizobium , Sediminibacterium , and Ralstonia . Conclusions. Our results indicate that the bacterial microbiomes of I. scapularis ticks vary by sex and geography, with significantly more diversity in male microbiomes compared to females. We found that sex plays a larger role than geography in shaping the composition/diversity of the I. scapularis microbiome, but that geography affects what additional taxa are represented (beyond Rickettsia ) and whether pathogens are found. Furthermore, recent feeding may have a role in shaping the tick microbiome, as evident from a more complex bacterial community in female ticks from dogs compared to the wild-caught questing females. These findings may provide further insight into the differences in the ability of the ticks to acquire, maintain and transmit pathogens. Future studies on possible causes and consequences of these differences will shed additional light on tick microbiome biology and vector competence.",2641,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

The ability of rickettsiae to survive in multiple eukaryotic host environments provides a good model for studying pathogen-host molecular interactions. Rickettsia typhi , the etiologic agent of murine typhus, is a strictly intracellular gram negative α-proteobacterium, which is transmitted to humans by its arthropod vector, the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis . Thus, R. typhi must cycle between mammalian and flea hosts, two drastically different environments. We hypothesize that temperature plays a role in regulating host-specific gene expression, allowing R. typhi to survive in mammalian and arthropod hosts. In this study, we used Affymetrix microarrays to screen for temperature-induced genes upon a temperature shift from 37°C to 25°C, mimicking the two different host temperatures in vitro . Results. Temperature-responsive genes belonged to multiple functional categories including among others, transcription, translation, posttranslational modification/protein turnover/chaperones and intracellular trafficking and secretion. A large number of differentially expressed genes are still poorly characterized, and either have no known function or are not in the COG database. The microarray results were validated with quantitative real time RT-PCR. Conclusion. This microarray screen identified various genes that were differentially expressed upon a shift in temperature from 37°C to 25°C. Further characterization of the identified genes may provide new insights into the ability of R. typhi to successfully transition between its mammalian and arthropod hosts.",1594,0,1,0,0,cy,en,

Lyme borreliosis, caused by tick-borne Borrelia burgdorferi , is a multi-phasic, multi-system disease in humans. Similar to humans, C3H mice develop arthritis and carditis, with resolution and periodic bouts of recurrence over the course of persistent infection. Borrelia burgdorferi arthritis-related protein (Arp/BBF01), a highly conserved protein among B. burgdorferi s.s. isolates, has been shown to be antigenic in humans with Lyme borreliosis, and a target for antibody-mediated disease resolution in the mouse model. Results. A mutant strain of B. burgdorferi s.s. deficient of the arp gene and a complemented version of that mutant were created and examined for phenotypic effects in mice compared to wild-type B. burgdorferi . Deletion of arp did not abolish infectivity, but did result in a higher infectious dose compared to wild-type B. burgdorferi , which was restored by complementation. Spirochete burdens in tissues of C3H- scid mice were lower when infected with the arp mutant, compared to wild-type, but arthritis was equally severe. Spirochete burdens were also lower in C3H mice infected with the arp mutant, but disease was markedly reduced. Ticks that fed upon infected C3H mice were able to acquire infection with both wild-type and arp mutant spirochetes. Arp mutant spirochetes were marginally able to be transmitted to naïve hosts by infected ticks. Conclusion. These results indicated that deletion of BBF01/ arp did not abrogate, but diminished infectivity and limited spirochete burdens in tissues of both immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts, and attenuated, but did not abolish the ability of ticks to acquire or transmit infection.",1681,0,1,0,0,cy,en,

In order to address this question, we conducted a comparative genomics analysis on a set of bacterial pathogens from seven genera – Borrelia, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, Francisella, Coxiella , and Bartonella , including species from three different host vectors – ticks, lice, and fleas. The final set of 102 genomes used in the study encoded a total of 120,046 protein sequences. We found that no genes or metabolic pathways were present in all tick-borne bacteria. However, we found some genes and pathways were present in subsets of tick-transmitted organisms while absent from bacteria transmitted by lice or fleas. Conclusion. Our analysis suggests that the ability of pathogens to be transmitted by ticks arose multiple times over the course of evolution.

The diagnosis of Lyme disease is based on a history of tick-bite, physical examination, and serological tests. In the seronegative patients with Lyme borreliosis symptoms, additional testing should be introduced. Methods: The study group was composed of 240 hospitalized patients presented with various clinical symptoms suggesting Lyme borreliosis: 221 of the patients with neurological abnormalities and 19 with oligoarticular arthritis. Citrated blood and serum samples were collected from the patients for culture and serological examination, respectively. Moreover, 173 cerebrospinal and 6 synovial fluid samples were tested. New oligonucleotide primers based on B. burgdorferi sensu lato 16SrRNA gene sequences were designed for the detection of the bacteria in blood, cerebrospinal, and synovial fluid specimens with PCR. Levels of specific antibodies were measured in serum, cerebrospinal fluid and synovial fluid samples using ELISA and Western blot. B. burgdorferi spirochetes from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and synovial fluid samples were cultured in cell line. Extracted and purified B. burgdorferi DNA was identified by PCR with new oligonucleotide primers. Then three genospecies were identified by PCR amplification with other primer sets specific for 16S rDNA and/or by the restriction fragment length polymorphism of 23S(rrl)-5S( rrf ). Results: Bacterial DNA were found in samples from 32 patients, including 28 patients with neuroborreliosis and 4 with Lyme arthritis. B. burgdorferi-sipecific IgM and/or IgG serum antibodies were detected in 14 of these patients. Fourteen strains of Borrelia garini , 4 strains of Borrelia afzelii and 1 strain of B. burgdorferi sensu stricto were identified by PCR. Genospecies were not recognized in 13 specimens. Conclusions: The procedure can be a rapid and sensitive diagnostic method for the detection of etiological agents in clinical materials derived from patients with the clinical symptoms of Lyme borreliosis. It can be utilized for both basic research as well as routine laboratory diagnosis.",2201,0,0,1,0,it,en,

The medical records of patients hospitalised between 1993 and 2000 and with a discharge diagnosis of LM (n=14) or AM (n=16) were retrospectively reviewed. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used to compare data. Of the patients, 16 were identified with AM and 14 with LM, amongst which 7 presented with isolated LM and 7 with associated peripheral facial palsy (PFP). Patients with AM, when compared with LM, complained of more pronounced signs and symptoms of meningitis (fever, headaches, and neck stiffness); they statistically displayed a shorter period of symptoms before admission (1.6 vs 15 days), higher neutrophilic component (mean 56% vs 2.4%), and lower protein levels (mean 0.39 vs 1.12 g/l) on cerebrospinal fluid analysis. In the neuroborreliosis group, the duration of symptoms was shorter and the cerebrospinal protein level was lower in cases of LM associated with PFP compared to isolated LM (mean 1.3 vs 15 days; mean 0.55 g/l vs 1.12 g/l). Conclusions. Our results suggest that some clinical data and laboratory findings may help the physician to diagnose aseptic or Lyme meningitis before completion of serologic testing. LM should be suspected in cases of meningitis with very low CSF neutrophilic counts and high protein levels associated with prolonged duration of symptoms, low grade fever, and absence of pronounced signs of meningitis.",1546,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The genes IscaGPRdop1 and IscaGPRdop2 were identified in the I. scapularis genome assembly and predicted as orthologs of previously characterized D 1 -like dopamine receptors in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and honeybee Apis mellifera . Heterologous expression in HEK 293 cells demonstrated that each receptor functioned as a D 1 -like dopamine receptor because significant increases in levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were detected following dopamine treatment. Importantly, the receptors were distinct in their pharmacological properties regarding concentration-dependent response to dopamine, constitutive activity, and response to other biogenic amines. Exposure to a variety of dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists further demonstrated a D 1 -like pharmacology of these dopamine receptors and highlighted their differential activities in vitro .",1227,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Considering the vast difference in treatment management between these 2 pathologies, differentiating between them is of critical importance. Septic arthritis often needs to be addressed surgically, whereas Lyme arthritis can be treated with oral antibiotics alone. Laboratory testing for Lyme disease often results in a delay in diagnosis because many laboratories batch-test Lyme specimens only a few times per week because of increased expense.

The patient denied premature coronary artery disease in the family. Initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with a 1 mm ST-elevation involving lead II and lead aVF and a 1 mm ST-depression in lead V1 with associated T-wave inversion. Initial Troponin I (normal <0.4 ng/mL) and CK-MB (normal <7.7 ng/mL) were elevated at 7.82 ng/mL and 55.2 ng/mL, respectively. Six hours later, Troponin I increased to 13.44 ng/mL and CK-MB to 75.7 ng/mL. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization which did not show any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Two days later the patient developed right-sided facial palsy. Diagnosis of Lyme disease was confirmed by ELISA with positive IgM and IgG antibodies. Treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and oral steroids was started. Eventually resolution of symptoms and, normalization of cardiac markers and EKG changes, were achieved. This is a rare case of Lyme myocarditis associated with markedly elevated Troponin I, normal left ventricle function, and an absence of conduction abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, Lyme myocarditis mimicking acute coronary syndrome with such high levels of Troponin I and neurologic compromise has not been previously described. Lyme myocarditis may be a challenging diagnosis in endemic areas especially in patients with coronary artery disease risk factors, presenting with typical chest pain, EKG changes and positive cardiac biomarkers. Therefore, it should be considered a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with clinical symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome.

Methods: Inclusion criteria: patients with clinical manifestations compatible with LB and Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi positive serology, hospitalized in a Romanian hospital between January 2011 and October 2012. Exclusion criteria: erythema migrans (EM) or suspicion of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) with lumbar puncture performed for diagnosis. A questionnaire was completed for each patient regarding associated diseases, tick bites or EM history and clinical signs/symptoms at admission, end of treatment and 3 months later. Two-tier testing (TTT) used an ELISA followed by a Western Blot kit. The patients were classified in groups, using the LB probability score and were evaluated in a multidisciplinary team. Antibiotherapy followed guidelines’ recommendations. Results: Sixty-four patients were included, presenting diverse associated comorbidities. Fifty-seven patients presented positive TTT, seven presenting either ELISA or Western Blot test positive. No differences in outcome were found between the groups of patients classified as very probable, probable and little probable LB. Instead, a better post-treatment outcome was described in patients with positive TTT. Conclusion: The patients investigated for the suspicion of LB present diverse clinical manifestations and comorbidities that complicate differential diagnosis. The LB diagnosis probability score used in our patients did not correlate with the antibiotic treatment response, suggesting that the probability score does not bring any benefit in diagnosis.",1832,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis has been always challenging because of the lack of specific, but simple assay formats. Two-tiered testing has been recommended by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide more specific results for diagnosis of Lyme disease. However, such a technique is time consuming and is not well suited for early stage detection. Therefore, many tests were proposed as alternatives to overcome these drawbacks. Simple assays, which are mainly performed in one-tier manner, could be conducted with better performance than the two-tiered testing. Proposed assays utilize both newly identified antigens and new platforms to improve detection performance. These assays can be classified into those based on employing a single antigen and assays based on using multiple antigens. In addition to assays to this type of assays, immunoassays on borreliosis-related biomarkers are available.

Three cases were treated with oral antibiotics alone; 1 case was treated with unnecessary surgery due to uncertainty of the diagnosis and the delay in the laboratory performing the Lyme serology tests.

However, the large variation in level of CXCL13 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) observed in LNB patients is still unexplained. We aimed to identify factors associated with the level of CXCL13 in children with LNB, possibly improving the interpretation of CXCL13 as a diagnostic marker of LNB. Methods: Children with confirmed and probable LNB were included in a prospective study on CXCL13 in CSF as a diagnostic marker of LNB. The variables age, sex, facial nerve palsy, generalized inflammation symptoms (fever, headache, neck-stiffness and/or fatigue), duration of symptoms, Borrelia antibodies in CSF, Borrelia antibody index (AI), CSF white blood cells (WBC), CSF protein and detection of the genospecies Borrelia garinii by PCR were included in simple and multivariable regression analyses to study the associations with the CXCL13 level. Results: We included 53 children with confirmed and 17 children with probable LNB. CXCL13 levels in CSF were positively associated with WBC, protein and Borrelia antibodies in CSF in both simple and multivariable analyses. We did not find any associations between CXCL13 and age, sex, clinical symptoms, duration of symptoms, AI or the detection of Borrelia garinii . Conclusions: High levels of CSF CXCL13 are present in the early phase of LNB and correlate with the level of CSF WBC and protein. Our results indicate that CSF CXCL13 in children evaluated for LNB can be interpreted independently of clinical features or duration of symptoms.",1645,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database from inception to August 2019. We did not restrict our search by study design or by publication date, status, or language. Results: Twenty-eight studies describing 46 cases of papilledema secondary to neurologic LB were included. Common clinical features included cranial neuropathy (68%) and diplopia (61%). Most patients did not recall tick bite (71%) and were afebrile (74%). Brain imaging was normal in 64% cases. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed lymphocytic pleocytosis (77%). Initial treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was given in 52% of cases and resulted in a 100% resolution rate. Concomitant treatment with acetazolamide resulted in favorable outcomes. Conclusions: For patients in endemic regions who describe symptoms suggestive of intracranial hypertension and papilledema, especially accompanied by facial nerve palsy and other cranial nerve palsies, underlying neurologic LB should be considered.",1313,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Some Borrelia species cause highly-prevalent diseases in humans and domestic animals. Evolutionary, ecological, and molecular research on many Borrelia species have resulted in tremendous progress toward understanding the biology and natural history of these species. Yet, many outstanding questions, such as how Borrelia populations will be impacted by climate and land-use change, will require an interdisciplinary approach. The evolutionary ecology research framework incorporates theory and data from evolutionary, ecological, and molecular studies while overcoming common assumptions within each field that can hinder integration across these disciplines. Evolutionary ecology offers a framework to evaluate the ecological consequences of evolved traits and to predict how present-day ecological processes may result in further evolutionary change. Studies of microbes with complex transmission cycles, like Borrelia, which interact with multiple vertebrate hosts and arthropod vectors, are poised to leverage the power of the evolutionary ecology framework to identify the molecular interactions involved in ecological processes that result in evolutionary change. Using existing data, we outline how evolutionary ecology theory can delineate how interactions with other species and the physical environment create selective forces or impact migration of Borrelia populations and result in micro-evolutionary changes. We further discuss the ecological and molecular consequences of those micro-evolutionary changes. While many of the currently outstanding questions will necessitate new experimental designs and additional empirical data, many others can be addressed immediately by integrating existing molecular and ecological data within an evolutionary ecology framework.",1921,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Recent studies suggest that the genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l. and sometimes their subtypes are propagated by different spectra of hosts, mainly birds and rodents. In order to test the concept of host-association, we analysed the relationships between Borrelia genospecies, rodent hosts and I. ricinus ticks in an endemic focus of Lyme borreliosis in western Slovakia. Rodents and questing ticks were collected at a forested lowland locality near Bratislava. Tick infestation levels on rodents were determined, and spirochaete infections in ticks and in ear punch biopsies were analysed by PCR followed by genotyping. Mice were more heavily infested with ticks than bank voles, and a higher proportion of mice was infected with spirochaetes than voles. However, the infectivity of voles was much higher than that of mice. The vast majority of infections detected in the skin and in ticks feeding on the rodents represented B. afzelii . In contrast, more than half of all infections in questing ticks collected in the same region of Slovakia were identified as B. valaisiana and B. garinii . In conclusion, whilst the study reveals that mice and voles play different quantitative roles in the ecology of Lyme borreliosis, it demonstrates that B. afzelii is specifically maintained by European rodents, validating the concept of host-association of B. burgdorferi s.l.",1571,0,0,0,1,lt,en,

Assembly of the expressed sequence tags yielded 557 contigs, 138 of which appear to code for secreted peptides or proteins based on translation of a putative signal peptide. Based on the BLASTX similarity of these contigs to 66 matches of Ixodes scapularis peptide sequences, only 58% sequence identity was found, indicating a rapid divergence of salivary proteins as observed previously for mosquito and triatomine bug salivary proteins. Here we report 106 mostly full-length sequences that clustered in 16 different families: Basic-tail proteins rich in lysine in the carboxy-terminal, Kunitz-containing proteins (monolaris, ixolaris and penthalaris families), proline-rich peptides, 5-, 9.4- and 18.7-kDa proteins of unknown functions, in addition to metalloproteases (class PIII-like) similar to reprolysins. We also have found a family of disintegrins, named ixodegrins that display homology to variabilin, a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist from the tick Dermacentor variabilis . In addition, we describe peptides (here named ixostatins) that display remarkable similarities to the cysteine-rich domain of ADAMST-4 (aggrecanase). Many molecules were assigned in the lipocalin family (histamine-binding proteins); others appear to be involved in oxidant metabolism, and still others were similar to ixodid proteins such as the anticomplement ISAC. We also identified for the first time a neuropeptide-like protein (nlp-31) with GGY repeats that may have antimicrobial activity. In addition, 16 novel proteins without significant similarities to other tick proteins and 37 housekeeping proteins that may be useful for phylogenetic studies are described. Some of these proteins may be useful for studying vascular biology or the immune system, for vaccine development, or as immunoreagents to detect prior exposure to ticks.

Heparin-binding protein, a potent inducer of increased vascular permeability, is released from activated neutrophils in severe sepsis. Objective: In this study we investigated whether heparin-binding protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid could be used as a diagnostic marker for acute bacterial meningitis. Design: One prospective and one retrospective patient cohort from two university hospitals in Sweden were analyzed. Setting and Patients: Cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected from 174 patients with suspected central nervous system infection. Thirty-seven patients with acute community-acquired bacterial meningitis, four patients with neurosurgical bacterial meningitis, 29 patients with viral meningitis or encephalitis, seven patients with neuroborreliosis, and 97 control patients were included. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Cerebrospinal fluid samples were analyzed for the concentrations of heparin-binding protein, lactate, protein, glucose, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells. Heparin-binding protein levels were significantly higher ( p < .01) in patients with acute bacterial meningitis (median 376 ng/mL, range 12–858 ng/mL) than in patients with viral central nervous system infection (median 4.7 ng/mL, range 3.0–41 ng/mL) or neuroborreliosis (median 3.6 ng/mL, range 3.2–10 ng/mL) or in control patients with a normal cerebrospinal fluid cell count (median 3.5 ng/mL, range 2.4–8.7 ng/mL). In the prospectively studied group, a heparin-binding protein concentration exceeding 20 ng/mL gave a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 99.2%, and positive and negative predictive values of 96.2% and 100%, respectively, in diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for heparin-binding protein was 0.994, which was higher than for the other investigated parameters.

We are exploring arthropod dopamine receptors as novel targets for insecticide/acaricide development because of their integral roles in neurobiology. Herein, we developed a screening assay for dopamine receptor antagonists to further characterize the pharmacological properties of the two D 1 -like dopamine receptors ( Is dop1 and Is dop2) identified in the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis , and develop a screening assay for receptor antagonists. A cell-based, cyclic AMP luciferase reporter assay platform was implemented to screen the LOPAC 1280 small molecule library for Is dop2 receptor antagonists, representing the first reported chemical library screen for any tick G protein-coupled receptor. Screening resulted in the identification of 85 “hit” compounds with antagonist activity at the Is dop2 receptor. Eight of these chemistries were selected for confirmation assays using a direct measurement of cAMP, and the effects on both Is dop1 and Is dop2 were studied for comparison. Each of these eight compounds showed antagonistic activity at both Is dop1 and Is dop2, although differences were observed regarding their relative potencies. Furthermore, comparison of the pharmacological properties of the tick dopamine receptors with that of the Aa DOP2 receptor from the yellow fever mosquito and the human dopamine D 1 receptor (hD 1 ) revealed species-specific pharmacological profiles of these receptors.

Ticks are the second most important vectors of infectious diseases after mosquitoes worldwide. The growth of international tourism including in rural and remote places increasingly exposes travelers to tick bite. Our aim was to review the main tick-borne infectious diseases reported in travelers in the past 5 years. Recent Findings. In recent years, tick-borne bacterial diseases have emerged in travelers including spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses, borrelioses, and diseases caused by bacteria of the Anaplasmataceae family. Summary. African tick-bite fever, due to Rickettsia africae , is the most frequent agent reported in travelers returned from Sub-Saharan areas. Other SFG agents are increasingly reported in travelers, and clinicians should be aware of them. Lyme disease can be misdiagnosed in Southern countries. Organisms causing tick-borne relapsing fever are neglected pathogens worldwide, and reports in travelers have allowed the description of new species. Infections due to Anaplasmataceae bacteria are more rarely described in travelers, but a new species of Neoehrlichia has recently been detected in a traveler. The treatment of these infections relies on doxycycline, and travelers should be informed before the trip about prevention measures against tick bites.",1311,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The tripartite association of Borrelia –vertebrate–tick has proved ecologically successful for these bacteria, which have become some of the most prominent tick-borne pathogens in the northern hemisphere. To keep evolutionary pace with its double-host life history, Borrelia must adapt to the evolutionary pressures exerted by both sets of hosts. In this review, we attempt to reconcile functional, phylogenetic, and ecological perspectives to propose a coherent scenario of Borrelia evolution. Available empirical information supports that the association of Borrelia with ticks is very old. The major split between the tick families Argasidae–Ixodidae (dated some 230–290 Mya) resulted in most relapsing fever (Rf) species being restricted to Argasidae and few associated with Ixodidae. A further key event produced the diversification of the Lyme borreliosis (Lb) species: the radiation of ticks of the genus Ixodes from the primitive stock of Ixodidae (around 217 Mya). The ecological interactions of Borrelia demonstrate that Argasidae-transmitted Rf species remain restricted to small niches of one tick species and few vertebrates. The evolutionary pressures on this group are consequently low, and speciation processes seem to be driven by geographical isolation. In contrast to Rf, Lb species circulate in nested networks of dozens of tick species and hundreds of vertebrate species. This greater variety confers a remarkably variable pool of evolutionary pressures, resulting in large speciation of the Lb group, where different species adapt to circulate through different groups of vertebrates. Available data, based on ospA and multilocus sequence typing (including eight concatenated in-house genes) phylogenetic trees, suggest that ticks could constitute a secondary bottleneck that contributes to Lb specialization. Both sets of adaptive pressures contribute to the resilience of highly adaptable meta-populations of bacteria.",2046,0,0,0,1,en,en,

On occasions, patients with Lyme disease present with isolated cranial nerve palsies; multiple palsies have rarely been reported in the literature.We discuss the case of a patient, who presented with a third nerve palsy and bilateral seventh nerve palsies and was subsequently diagnosed as suffering from Lyme disease.To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Lyme disease presenting with this combination of neurological signs. A 53-year-old male from the Scottish Western Isles presented with a two-day history of double vision. On examination, he was found to have a left third cranial nerve palsy and a left seventh cranial nerve palsy. Five days later, the patient developed a right seventh cranial nerve palsy. Serum and CSF enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis were both positive for Lyme disease as was CSF polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Subsequently, the patient gave a history of multiple tick bites over the previous few years. He was commenced on appropriate antibiotic therapy and oral prednisolone. A rapid improvement in his condition was noted. This case demonstrates the importance of considering the diagnosis of Lyme disease in patients with multiple cranial neuropathies, especially those residing in, or with a history of travel to, endemic areas. In addition, it illustrates how early diagnosis, with the institution of appropriate therapy, leads to a prompt improvement in neurological symptoms and signs.",1565,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Handlungsbedarf wurde von den Teilnehmern auf unterschiedlichsten Gebieten gesehen: Diagnose, Epidemiologie, Immunologie, Klinik, Ökologie und Versorgungsforschung. Beispiele für Gebiete, die nach Expertenmeinung mit Vorrang zu bearbeiten sind, sind die Standardisierung der serologischen Tests, die Entwicklung von Markern für eine aktive Infektion, die Verbesserung der Datengrundlage zum Vorkommen der Lyme-Borreliose in Deutschland und Untersuchungen zur Bestimmung der Krankheitslast.",1158,0,0,1,0,de,de,

For our analysis, we used all the relevant data about the patients with Lyme borreliosis reported in the Epidemiological Informative System of Communicable Diseases in Slovakia during the decade of 1999–2008. During the observed period, there were 7,349 reported cases of LB in Slovakia. Whereas the incidence of early localized infection did not change during the observed period, there was a significant increase in the incidence of early disseminated infection and late persistent infection of LB. Seventy per cent of all patients was infected by tick bite. LB was more frequently reported in females than in males (56.1% vs. 43.9%; p < 0.05), and the most involved age group was the productive age (15–64 years). The incidence of disseminated infection and persistent infection was rising with increasing age. Regarding the seasonality of LB, we found the highest incidence during the summer months. Comparing the situation of LB in 1999 and 2008, significant increase in the number of reported cases was in April and June and from September to November ( p < 0.05).

In 2008, 3688 patients (4223 serum samples) were tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), with 832 patients tested by confirmatory in-house IgG Western blot: 272 patients were Western blot-positive, 170 were weak positive, 156 were equivocal and 234 were negative. These results were assessed, and a review of interpretation criteria from both the USA and Europe was carried out. New interpretation criteria and a testing algorithm were developed. The revised criteria changed the results in 109/3688 (3%) patients and produced significantly more Western blot-positive and weak-positive patients than with the current criteria (485 vs . 442, P <0.0001). In total, 76 patients who were negative/equivocal became positive, which may have led to a change in their management. Conversely, 33 patients who were weak-positive became equivocal but their management may not have been affected. The authors believe that the revised criteria have simplified blot interpretation and improved the sensitivity and robustness of their Western blot method. Using a protocol tailored to patients that incorporates clinical characteristics means that the entire process will be easier and will aid the management of patients",1448,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Lyme neuroborreliosis is the most common bacterial central nervous system infection in the temperate parts of the northern hemisphere. Even though human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -1 infection is common in Lyme borreliosis endemic areas, only five cases of co-infection have previously been published. Four of these cases presented with typical Lyme neuroborreliosis symptoms such as meningoradiculitis and facial palsy, while a fifth case had more severe symptoms of encephalomyelitis. All five were treated with intravenous cephalosporins and clinical outcome was good for all but the fifth case Case presentations. We present four patients with concomitant presence of HIV-1 infection and Lyme neuroborreliosis diagnosed in Western Sweden. Patient 1 was a 60-year-old Caucasian man with radicular pain and cognitive impairment. Patient 2 was a 39-year-old Caucasian man with headaches, leg weakness, and pontine infarction. Patient 3 was a 62-year-old Caucasian man with headaches, tremor, vertigo, and normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Patient 4 was a 50-year-old Caucasian man with radicular pain and peripheral facial palsy. Patients one, two, and three all had subnormal levels of CD4 cells, indicating impaired immunity. All patients were treated with oral doxycycline with good clinical outcome and normalization of CSF pleocytosis. Conclusion. Given the low HIV-1 prevalence and medium incidence of Lyme neuroborreliosis in Western Sweden where these four cases were diagnosed, co-infection with HIV-1 and Borrelia is probably more common than previously thought. The three patients that were the most immunocompromised suffered from more severe and rather atypical neurological symptoms than are usually described among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis. It is therefore important for doctors treating HIV patients to consider Lyme neuroborreliosis in a patient presenting with atypical neurological symptoms. All four patients were treated with oral doxycycline with a good outcome, further proving the efficacy of this regime.",2054,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Previous attempts to characterize naturally Asp-containing MurAs have resulted in no protein or no activity. We have expressed and characterized His-tagged Lyme disease MurA (Bb_MurA H6 ). The protein was most soluble at high salt concentrations but maximally active around physiological ionic strength. The steady-state kinetic parameters at pH 7 were k cat = 1.07 ± 0.03 s −1 , K M,PEP = 89 ± 12 μM, and K M,UDP-GlcNAc = 45 ± 7 μM. Mutating the active site Asp to Cys, D116C, caused a 21-fold decrease in k cat and rendered the enzyme fosfomycin sensitive. The pH profile of k cat was bell-shaped and centered around pH 5.3 for Bb_MurA H6 , with p K a1 = 3.8 ± 0.2 and p K a2 = 7.4 ± 0.2. There was little change in p K a1 with the D116C mutant, 3.5 ± 0.3, but p K a2 shifted to >11. This demonstrated that the p K a2 of 7.4 was due to D116, almost 3 pH units above an unperturbed carboxylate, and that it must be protonated for activity. This supports D116’s proposed role as a general acid/base catalyst. As fosfomycin does not react with simple thiols, nor most protein thiols, the reactivity of D116C with fosfomycin, combined with the strongly perturbed p K a2 for D116, strongly implies an unusual active site environment and a chemical role in catalysis for Asp/Cys. There is also good evidence for C115 having a role in product release. Both roles may be operative for both Asp- and Cys-containing MurAs.",1665,0,0,1,0,de,en,

Lyme Bay provides an excellent case study of the challenges likely to be posed by wider stakeholder involvement imposed under the new Marine Act. This paper examines a broad range of perspectives in relation to the Lyme Bay consultation and subsequent closure, via semi-structured interviews with 25 representatives of different interest groups in Lyme Bay. All respondents acknowledged significant flaws in the process leading to the Lyme Bay decision and felt the Marine Act was well placed to tackle many of these criticisms. However, while the Marine Act should provide a framework for resolving conflicts, it will not prevent them. Success will depend on collaboration between different marine interests, and also on the government acknowledging that outcomes are unlikely to favour everyone in the short-term and that top-down interventions are inevitable.",1217,0,0,1,0,it,en,

The normal startle response is a form of physiological myoclonus. Its anatomic origin is probably the brain stem. Pathologic startles are defined as reproducible exaggerated startle responses to trivial and not surprising stimuli. Symptomatic forms of an exaggerated startle response can be due to a variety of brain stem disorders. We have, however, found scant data about an exaggerated startle reflex induced by Lyme neuroborreliosis. We therefore report the case of a patient with this unusual presentation. Case presentation. A 69-year old Caucasian man presented with a two-week history of a pronounced startle myoclonus, as well as a four-week history of double vision, gait disturbance and severe lancinating pain in his upper thoracic region. Neurological examination showed an excessive startle reaction of his upper trunk evoked by visual and tactile stimulation, a positive sign of Lhermitte, mild right-sided palsy of his sixth and seventh cranial nerve, moderate dysarthria, very brisk deep tendon reflexes, pallhypesthesia of his legs, and an atactic gait disturbance. A diagnosis of a Lyme neuroborreliosis was confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid examination. Under intravenous treatment with ceftriaxone, our patient improved considerably with complete remission in a follow-up at two months. Conclusions. This case illustrates the chameleon role that neuroborreliosis likes to play: although the wide spectrum of different symptoms that neuroborreliosis can present with has been described, to the best of our knowledge this is the first case report about a symptomatic form of a pathologic startle response as the predominating sign of Lyme neuroborreliosis.",1688,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The aims of the present study is to investigate the role of the C6 EIA as a screening assay, as part of two-tier EIA test strategy, and its use as a marker of treatment response or resolving infection in a routine diagnostic laboratory. The C6 EIA was significantly less sensitive than the Enzygnost Lyme link VlsE/IgG EIA (169/249 vs. 190/249 reactive sera, respectively; P=0.0455, Fishers exact two-tailed test). The two-EIA strategy, utilising C6 EIA confirmation, was slightly more sensitive than traditional two-tier testing (82/151 vs. 67/151 positive sera). Twenty-seven patients were positive by the two-EIA strategy but negative by Western blot, raising questions of specificity, but 12 samples positive with the traditional two-tier testing were negative with the two-EIA strategy. There was no evidence to support the use of the C6 EIA for monitoring treatment response or resolving infection. The authors have devised a novel approach to detect LB in Scottish patients. For cases with a high clinical suspicion of disease, the C6 EIA could be incorporated into a two-EIA strategy, replacing the need for Western blot confirmation with a simpler, more cost-effective two-EIA strategy. Western blot confirmation would be reserved for those patients with discordant EIA results and whose clinical picture is more complex.",1660,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This paper provides a detailed account of the methodology employed from survey design to data analysis to provide a protocol for future MPA monitoring programmes. Information on historical fishing effort, substrate distributions and current and previous closure boundaries was overlaid using GIS to locate suitable monitoring sites. Non-destructive and cost-effective techniques, including a towed high-definition video array and static baited video, were used to quantify changes in relative abundances of epibenthos and nekton over three years at sites previously fished but now closed to bottom towed fishing compared to both fished and un-fished reference sites.

These factors of immune evasion include regulation of membrane proteins, variable epitopes of surface proteins, protection against the immune system through tick saliva, the ability to migrate to regions where it is not exposed to the immune system or antibiotics, invagination or invasion within various cells, pleomorphic forms, and the potential to produce biofilms. The window of conventional treatment for Lyme disease is short and has the potential to display different symptoms depending on the strain of Borrelia bugdorferi. These symptoms are dependent on the localization of Borrelia burgdorferi which correlates to the significance of diagnosing Lyme disease early to prevent such a spread throughout the body. Such complications of Borrelia burgdorferi may demand new clinical treatment discoveries for patient fighting the chronic form.",990,0,0,1,0,en,en,

These infections can cause a significant burden on patients more so than Lyme disease alone. Along with the many underdiagnosed cases of Lyme disease throughout the world exists numerous undiagnosed co-infection and secondary co-infections leading to debilitating symptoms for many patients. The potential for co-infections varies by location as well as to the exposure to various species of ticks. Since there is potential for patients to experience several tick bites including those of different species, additional microorganisms also commonly transmitted via tick bite are included that are typically left out of the conversation of potential Borrelia burgdorferi co-infections. The most common co-infections of Lyme disease include anaplasmosis, babasiosis, bartonellosis and ehrlichiosis. Secondary co-infections or opportunistic infections commonly seen in patients with Lyme disease are also discussed.

patient diagnosed with acute neuroborreliosis presenting with anterior optic
neuritis (papillitis) in a non-endemic region. Case Presentation: A 43-year-old
previously healthy right handed man admitted due to an insidious onset of
severe headache and spells of ascending paresthesias from his right foot into
his right arm and face followed by speech arrest and clumsiness of his right
hand. His neurologic exam was significant for somnolence, nuchal rigidity and
Kernig and Brudzinski signs were present. MRI of the brain with gadolinium
showed diffuse hyperintense signal involving the supra and infratentorial
cortical sulci, with associated faint diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement,
consistent most likely with diffuse leptomeningoencephalitis. EEG: normal. CSF
VDRL was negative. Dilated fundus exam revealed mild optic nerve edema more
significant to the left than to the right eye, confirmed and measured by
spectral domain OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography). There was an evidence of
posterior uveitis with an early vitreous hemorrhage superficial to the left
optic nerve. Lyme disease serum antibody (IgM) Immunoblotting was positive in 2
bands confirming the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. Conclusion: Optic nerve
involvement in Lyme disease is an uncommon complication that should be
confirmed by specific diagnostic criteria to establish its causal relation.",1422,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Clavanin A (ClavA) is one member of a family of antimicrobial peptides produced by the solitary tunicate Styela clava . In this work, we demonstrate that ClavA utilizes Zn 2+ ions to potentiate its antimicrobial activity not only by reducing the concentration at which the peptide inhibits the growth of bacteria but also by increasing the rate of killing. Membrane depolarization, β-galactosidase leakage, and potassium leakage assays indicate that ClavA is membrane active, forms small pores, but induces cell death by targeting an intracellular component. ClavA and ClavA-Zn 2+ added to Escherichia coli and imaged by confocal microscopy translocate across the cell membrane. E. coli mutants lacking the functional Zn 2+ import system are less susceptible to ClavA, suggesting that the synergistic activity between ClavA and Zn 2+ has a cytoplasmic target, which is further supported by its nucleolytic activity. Overall, these studies identify a remarkable new mechanism by which zinc contributes to the immune response in the tunicate S. clava .",1149,0,0,1,0,de,en,

The pathogenic mechanism that underlines this condition, referred to as post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS), is currently unknown. A debate exists about whether PTLDS is due to persistent infection or to post-infectious damages in the immune system and the nervous system. We present the case of a patient with evidence of exposure to Borrelia burgdorferi sl and a long history of debilitating fatigue, cognitive abnormalities and autonomic nervous system issues. The patient had a positive Western blot for anti-basal ganglia antibodies, and the autoantigen has been identified as γ enolase, the neuron-specific isoenzyme of the glycolytic enzyme enolase. Assuming Borrelia own surface exposed enolase as the source of this autoantibody, through a mechanism of molecular mimicry, and given the absence of sera reactivity to α enolase, a bioinformatical analysis was carried out to identify a possible cross-reactive conformational B cell epitope, shared by Borrelia enolase and γ enolase, but not by α enolase. Taken that evidence, we hypothesize that this autoantibody interferes with glycolysis in neuronal cells, as the physiological basis for chronic symptoms in at least some cases of PTLDS. Studies investigating on the anti-γ enolase and anti-Borrelia enolase antibodies in PTLDS are needed to confirm our hypotheses.",1516,0,0,1,0,en,en,

NICE guidance suggests an approach to diagnosis resting on clinical presentation, presence in an epidemiologically plausible area, and positive serology. It is however, well documented that serological diagnostics in European Lyme disease is problematic. There is a movement for Lyme advocacy, a voice that emphasises the poor diagnostics in this infection. With the spotlight on Lyme disease, we are increasingly seeing patients presenting in Northern Ireland across a broad range of specialities. Currently there is minimal data looking at the local epidemiology of Lyme disease. We present previously unpublished data looking at the demographics of those testing positive for Borrelia burgdoferi antibodies. Methods We collected data from all patients tested for Lyme disease in Northern Ireland from 2013–2018. We excluded negative results. A randomised selection of 300 cases were chosen. We recorded patient age, gender, origins of testing, home postcode, tick bite history, relevant travel history, duration of symptoms, timings of testing, antibody results including confirmatory testing and treatment. Results Of the 300 selected patients 241 (80 %) were IgM positive and 83 (30 %) IgG positive using DiaSorin, Liason CLIA. The average age of presentation was 39 years old. There was a predominance of females tested (62%). 32 % of tests originated in primary care. Of the IgM positives only 41 (17 %) were confirmed by C6 peptide or lineblot in the reference laboratory (RIPL, Porton Down). The results highlight the likely low seroprevalence of Lyme disease in Northern Ireland.",1675,0,0,1,0,en,en,

UK and US laboratory diagnosis of LD involves the two-tier serological approach. The negative predictive value of the test has been challenged, particularly in early stage LD. There is considerable interest, therefore, in the development of improved diagnostic tests. The main aim of the project is to identify new markers that could form the basis for improved tests. A mass spectrometry biomarker discovery study was undertaken on LD positive and negative residual diagnostic samples from UK LD testing by Public Health England and a cohort of patient samples from collaboration with a research group in the Czech Republic. A ‘related-disease control group’ including serum samples from syphilis, leptospirosis and chronic fatigue syndrome was also included. Several proteins were found at a significantly higher or lower in abundance in the ld-positive patients compared with ld-negative. Of particular interest was Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), a protein involved in immunity. LCN2 has previously been found in increased abundance in mice exposed to B. burgdorferi . Further analysis of LD samples using Illumina RNA sequencing revealed further markers of interest. Transcriptomic analysis including Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) gave insights into the host response to LD infection.

Nearly 40 years have elapsed since the discovery of the organism that was named Borrelia burgdorferi . There are thousands of articles in the scientific and medical literature on this organism and the disease that it causes. In the interval since the organism’s discovery, however, misconceptions have arisen regarding not only the disease but the discovery itself. Accordingly, with this paper, we aim to fill in the details of this episode in medical history with a joint introduction, first-person accounts by the two authors, a summary of contemporaneous events, and concluding comments. The history of the discovery of the Lyme disease agent has threads originating in different places in the United States. Studies on Long Island, NY, provided the epidemiological thread of studies on rickettsial diseases and babesiosis, linking the latter with the cutaneous manifestation of Lyme disease, now known as erythema migrans. The Long Island thread intersected Montana’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories thread of studies on a relapsing fever Borrelia and its cultivation and expertise in vector biology. This intersection made possible the discovery of the spirochete and its recovery from patients. This paper stresses that what may seem to have been an individual scientific discovery is actually the product of several threads coming together and is attributable to more people than appreciated.",1512,0,0,1,0,sw,en,

Objectives: To present evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and treatment. Methods: Data were analysed according to levels of evidence as suggested by EFNS. Recommendations: The following three criteria should be fulfilled for definite LNB, and two of them for possible LNB: (i) neurological symptoms; (ii) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis; (iii) Bb -specific antibodies produced intrathecally. PCR and CSF culture may be corroborative if symptom duration is <6 weeks, when Bb antibodies may be absent. PCR is otherwise not recommended. There is also not enough evidence to recommend the following tests for diagnostic purposes: microscope-based assays, chemokine CXCL13, antigen detection, immune complexes, lymphocyte transformation test, cyst formation, lymphocyte markers. Adult patients with definite or possible acute LNB (symptom duration <6 months) should be offered a single 14-day course of antibiotic treatment. Oral doxycycline (200 mg daily) and intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone (2 g daily) are equally effective in patients with symptoms confined to the peripheral nervous system, including meningitis (level A). Patients with CNS manifestations should be treated with IV ceftriaxone (2 g daily) for 14 days and late LNB (symptom duration >6 months) for 3 weeks (good practice points). Children should be treated as adults, except that doxycycline is contraindicated under 8 years of age (nine in some countries). If symptoms persist for more than 6 months after standard treatment, the condition is often termed post-Lyme disease syndrome (PLDS). Antibiotic therapy has no impact on PLDS (level A).",1742,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Facial nerve palsy can be a manifestation of the illness. The aim was to establish how often Lyme is considered as a potential cause in one Scottish health board. Methods Patients, aged four and above, presenting to secondary care with facial nerve palsy from 2016-2018 were identified using ICD-10 codes. A retrospective analysis of case notes and laboratory records was undertaken to establish whether a cause for nerve palsy had been found, whether a potential tick exposure history was taken, and if Lyme testing had been done. Microsoft Excel was used for analysis. Results 173 patients with confirmed facial nerve palsy were identified. Consideration of Lyme disease was made in 9.2% (16/173). Of these, 43.8% (7/16), were asked about possible insect bites (four of whom were asked specifically about tick bites). 43.8% (7/16) were tested based on clinical presentation. 6.3% (1/16) had “no Lyme risks” documented and another 6.3% (1/16) had an occupational risk. Of the sixteen, 50% (8/16) had Lyme serology undertaken, although 2/8 had a confirmed alternative cause. Conclusion Possibility of Lyme disease is not commonly considered when individuals present with facial nerve palsy. This is despite endemnicity in Scotland, and opportunities for tick exposure being common, with outdoor activities and countryside trips.

Transcriptomes were assessed at the time of presentation and also at approximately 1 month (early convalescence) and 6 months (late convalescence) after initiation of an appropriate antibiotic regimen. Comparative transcriptomics identified 335 transcripts, representing 233 unique genes, with significant alterations of at least 2-fold expression in acute- or convalescent-phase blood samples from LD subjects relative to healthy donors. Acute-phase blood samples from LD subjects had the largest number of differentially expressed transcripts (187 induced, 54 repressed). This transcriptional profile, which was dominated by interferon-regulated genes, was sustained during early convalescence. 6 months after antibiotic treatment the transcriptome of LD subjects was indistinguishable from that of healthy controls based on two separate methods of analysis. Return of the LD expression profile to levels found in control subjects was concordant with disease outcome; 82% of subjects with LD experienced at least one symptom at the baseline visit compared to 43% at the early convalescence time point and only a single patient (9%) at the 6-month convalescence time point. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we developed an efficient computational framework to identify sets of 20 classifier genes that discriminated LD from other bacterial and viral infections. These novel LD biomarkers not only differentiated subjects with acute disseminated LD from healthy controls with 96% accuracy but also distinguished between subjects with acute and resolved (late convalescent) disease with 97% accuracy.",1893,0,0,1,0,sw,en,

The framework was applied to the Lyme Bay MPA, southwest England, the site of a controversial fisheries closure, which has subsequently been proposed as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC), as well the location for an NGO-led project focusing on stakeholder engagement. This paper examines a broad range of perspectives on the governance of this MPA, via semi-structured interviews with representatives of different interest groups and document analyses. The MPAG framework found a governance structure with a diversity of incentives, providing for bottom-up stakeholder engagement and awareness-raising coupled with strong top-down legislative structures. Although the fisheries closure and subsequent SAC restrictions have provided the main mechanisms for protecting biodiversity, an NGO-led project has provided a complement to the legislative framework and helped to facilitate a mechanism for adaptive co-management. However, the site is predicted to be subject to external pressures from changes in legislation, state resource restrictions and reduced NGO involvement, which will test the resilience of the structure and whether such a diversity of incentives provides sufficient resilience to maintain MPA effectiveness in the face of these pressures.",1465,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Tick infestation levels were high with more than 1000 members of the public reporting for tick removal at a local clinic. Most of the attached ticks were nymphs (82%) and distinct differences in anatomical sites of attachment were observed in children and adults. Children sustained nymphal bites to the head, neck and axilla region much more frequently than adults (48 vs. 10%), whereas adults were bitten on the lower legs more frequently than children (46 vs. 9%). The vegetation was heavily infested with ticks and high numbers were particularly associated with areas used by deer. The average density of nymphs collected from the vegetation was 14.1 per 10 m 2 (range 5.1–43.6). Infection rates of these nymphs determined by PCR and indirect IFA ranged from 5.2–17.0%, and the genospecies Borrelia valaisiana and B. garinii were detected, suggesting that birds may be important reservoir hosts in this area. It is estimated that, at the level of tick challenge observed here, at least 50 persons per year may be bitten by infected ticks at this site. However, no cases of Lyme borreliosis have been reported through the clinic follow-up procedure, and sera from 19 forest workers were negative for antibody to B. burgdorferi sensu lato. Despite the high challenge from tick bites, this particular recreational forest site poses a low risk of infection to the general public, and prophylactic antibiotic treatment or serological testing following a bite is not justified.",1603,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Borrelia afzelii mono-infected or Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto (ss)/ B. afzelii double-infected nymphs were fixed, embedded in cold polymerizing resin and sectioned. The same sample processing was applied to skin biopsies taken from a Mongolian gerbil after an infectious tick-bite. FISH was carried out using 16S-rRNA-directed, fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes specific for the genus Borrelia and specific within the group of Lyme borreliosis-associated genospecies B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi ss, Borrelia garinii and Borrelia valaisiana . Sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed probes were evaluated using PCR, dot-blot hybridizations and FISH. Despite significant autofluorescence of certain tick tissues (which allowed good histological orientation within the sections), borreliae showing the typical spirochaetal morphotype were clearly visible in five out of six putatively infected ticks. These findings were confirmed by electron microscopy of ticks from the same infected batch as used for FISH. Attempts to produce ticks infected by two different Borrelia genospecies were not successful. FISH on whole-body sections of resin-embedded ticks offers the possibility of visualizing and identifying borreliae within tick tissues. This technique has great potential for the investigation of the transmission of bacteria or other micro-organisms by arthropod vectors. Furthermore, clear visualization of single spirochaetes distributed along subcutaneous fat cell membranes in gerbil skin biopsies suggests that FISH might also be suitable for the detection of borreliae in clinical tissue specimens.",1784,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

The macrophages of low responders produced less tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6 after OspA stimulation and had lower cell-surface expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 as compared to normal cells, but normal expression of TLR2. TLRs activate innate responses to pathogens, and TLR2 recognizes lipoproteins and peptidoglycan (PGN). After OspA immunization, mice genetically deficient in either TLR2 ( TLR2 −/− ) or TLR1 ( TLR1 −/− ) produced low titers of antibodies against OspA. Notably, macrophages from TLR2 −/− mice were unresponsive to OspA and PGN, whereas those from TLR1 −/− mice responded normally to PGN but not to OspA. These data indicate that TLR1 and TLR2 are required for lipoprotein recognition and that defects in the TLR1/2 signaling pathway may account for human hyporesponsiveness to OspA vaccination.",1136,0,0,0,1,it,en,

A putative response regulator, Rrp2, is ostensibly required for activation of the RpoN-dependent transcription of rpoS . However, questions remain regarding the extent to which the three major constituents of this pathway (Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS) act interdependently. To assess the functional interplay between Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, we employed microarray analyses to compare gene expression levels in rrp2 , rpoN and rpoS mutants of parental strain 297. We identified 98 genes that were similarly regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS, and an additional 47 genes were determined to be likely regulated by this pathway. The substantial overlap between genes regulated by RpoS and RpoN provides compelling evidence that these two alternative sigma factors form a congruous pathway and that RpoN regulates B. burgdorferi gene expression through RpoS. Although several known B. burgdorferi virulence determinants were regulated by the RpoN–RpoS pathway, a defined function has yet to be ascribed to most of the genes substantially regulated by Rrp2, RpoN and RpoS.",1232,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

These enzymes are widely distributed across biology, with examples found encoded in the genomes of Mycobacteria, Archaea, Eubacteria, Protozoa, yeast, and invertebrates, but there are none found in mammals. Although recent structural work has improved our understanding of these enzymes, their catalytic mechanism is still not well understood. Recent data show that nicotinamidases are required for the growth and virulence of several pathogenic microbes. The enzymes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Drosophila melanogaster , and Caenorhabditis elegans regulate life span in their respective organisms, consistent with proposed roles in the regulation of NAD + metabolism and organismal aging. In this work, the steady state kinetic parameters of nicotinamidase enzymes from C. elegans , Sa. cerevisiae , Streptococcus pneumoniae (a pathogen responsible for human pneumonia), Borrelia burgdorferi (the pathogen that causes Lyme disease), and Plasmodium falciparum (responsible for most human malaria) are reported. Nicotinamidases are generally efficient catalysts with steady state k cat values typically exceeding 1 s −1 . The K m values for nicotinamide are low and in the range of 2 −110 μM. Nicotinaldehyde was determined to be a potent competitive inhibitor of these enzymes, binding in the low micromolar to low nanomolar range for all nicotinamidases tested. A variety of nicotinaldehyde derivatives were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors in kinetic assays. Inhibitions are consistent with reaction of the universally conserved catalytic Cys on each enzyme with the aldehyde carbonyl carbon to form a thiohemiacetal complex that is stabilized by a conserved oxyanion hole. The S. pneumoniae nicotinamidase can catalyze exchange of 18 O into the carboxy oxygens of nicotinic acid with H 2 18 O. The collected data, along with kinetic analysis of several mutants, allowed us to propose a catalytic mechanism that explains nicotinamidase and nicotinic acid 18 O exchange chemistry for the S. pneumoniae enzyme involving key catalytic residues, a catalytic transition metal ion, and the intermediacy of a thioester intermediate.",2221,0,0,0,1,de,en,

Slit-lamp examination revealed diffuse vascularization of the corneal stroma with surrounding infiltrates bilaterally. In the left eye, corneal thinning and an epithelial defect were present in an area of infiltrate. Our clinical impression at that time was bilateral interstitial keratitis with secondary bacterial keratitis in the left eye. Topical therapy, prednisolone acetate 1% in the right eye, and ofloxacin in the left eye, was instituted. A systemic workup, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, Lyme titer, cytoplasmatic staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, perinuclear staining antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory, rapid plasma reagin, basic metabolic panel, angiotensin-converting enzyme level, and a chest x-ray was negative. Topical steroids were used in the left eye after resolution of the bacterial keratitis. The interstitial keratitis responded to topical steroids and remained in remission after steroid taper. However, bilateral interstitial keratitis recurred coincident with a severe flare of hidradenitis suppurativa within 1 month of discontinuing the topical steroids. A course of subcutaneous adalimumab injections (40 mg/mL every 2 weeks) for hidradenitis suppurativa was implemented. Both her dermatological and ocular conditions responded to this therapy and have remained in remission through 7 months of follow-up. Conclusions: Hidradenitis suppurativa is a rare cause of bilateral interstitial keratitis. Patients may experience simultaneous exacerbations of both dermatological and ocular manifestations. Systemic treatment with adalimumab can improve both dermatological and ocular conditions.",2168,0,0,0,1,it,en,

Disruptions to ecosystems have been found to increase the risk of several diseases, including Hantavirus, Lyme disease, Ross River virus, malaria and Ciguatera fish poisoning. Leptospirosis is a globally important emerging zoonosis, caused by spirochaete bacteria, borne by many mammalian hosts, and also transmitted environmentally. We propose that leptospirosis incidence in humans is also linked to ecosystem disruption, and that reduced biodiversity (the diversity of species within an ecological community) may be associated with increased leptospirosis incidence. To investigate this hypothesis, the relationship between biodiversity levels of island nations and their annual leptospirosis incidence rates (adjusted for GDP per capita) was examined by linear correlation and regression. Supportive, statistically significant negative associations were obtained between leptospirosis incidence and (a) total number of species ( r 2 = 0.69, p < 0.001) and (b) number of mammal species ( r 2 = 0.80, p < 0.001) in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis only the number of mammal species remained significantly associated ( r 2 = 0.81, p = 0.007). An association between biodiversity and reduced leptospirosis risk, if supported by further research, would emphasise the importance of managing the emergence of leptospirosis (and other infectious diseases) at a broader, ecosystem level.",1581,0,0,0,1,en,en,

A total of 30,461 ticks were collected from 30 different hosts and free living stages from the ground. The collection consisted of 22 tick species from 30 different hosts recording 12 tick species from humans, 19 from domesticated animals and 21 from wild animals, with a total of 97 new host records. The most common tick species on humans were Dermacentor auratus and Amblyomma testudinairum , while Haemaphysalis intermedia , Rhipicephalus microplus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus were common in domesticated and wild animals sharing 20 host species. Among the questing ticks, immature D. auratus was the most abundant. Humans and domesticated animals were mostly infested by the nymphal stages while adult ticks were found on wild animals. High number of new host records could be due to domestic animals picking tick species from wildlife and vise versa at the human/animal interface. Habitat destruction due to forest fragmentation has lead to wild animals roaming in urban and semi-urban neighbourhoods increasing the interactions of wild animals with domesticated animals. Wild animals play a significant role as a reservoir of many tick borne infections which can easily be spread to domesticated animals and then to humans via tick infestations.

Knowledge on the incidence and clinical presentation of other tick-borne diseases than Lyme borreliosis and tick-borne encephalitis is minimal, despite the high human exposure to these pathogens through tick bites. Using molecular detection techniques, the frequency of tick-borne infections after exposure through tick bites was estimated. Methods Ticks, blood samples and questionnaires on health status were collected from patients that visited their general practitioner with a tick bite or erythema migrans in 2007 and 2008. The presence of several tick-borne pathogens in 314 ticks and 626 blood samples of this cohort were analyzed using PCR-based methods. Using multivariate logistic regression, associations were explored between pathogens detected in blood and self-reported symptoms at enrolment and during a three-month follow-up period. Results Half of the ticks removed from humans tested positive for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis, Rickettsia helvetica , Rickettsia monacensis , Borrelia miyamotoi and several Babesia species. Among 92 Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. positive ticks, 33% carried another pathogen from a different genus. In blood of sixteen out of 626 persons with tick bites or erythema migrans, DNA was detected from Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis (n = 7), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (n = 5), Babesia divergens (n = 3), Borrelia miyamotoi (n = 1) and Borrelia burgdorferi s. l. (n = 1). None of these sixteen individuals reported any overt symptoms that would indicate a corresponding illness during the three-month follow-up period. No associations were found between the presence of pathogen DNA in blood and; self-reported symptoms, with pathogen DNA in the corresponding ticks (n = 8), reported tick attachment duration, tick engorgement, or antibiotic treatment at enrolment. Conclusions Based on molecular detection techniques, the probability of infection with a tick-borne pathogen other than Lyme spirochetes after a tick bite is roughly 2.4%, in the Netherlands. Similarly, among patients with erythema migrans, the probability of a co-infection with another tick-borne pathogen is approximately 2.7%.

Control and prevention of these diseases require a better understanding of vector distribution. Aim Our aim was to create a model able to predict the distribution of Ixodes ricinus nymphs in southern Scandinavia and to assess how this relates to risk of human exposure. Methods We measured the presence of I. ricinus tick nymphs at 159 stratified random lowland forest and meadow sites in Denmark, Norway and Sweden by dragging 400 m transects from August to September 2016, representing a total distance of 63.6 km. Using climate and remote sensing environmental data and boosted regression tree modelling, we predicted the overall spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs in Scandinavia. To assess the potential public health impact, we combined the predicted tick distribution with human density maps to determine the proportion of people at risk. Results Our model predicted the spatial distribution of I. ricinus nymphs with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 60%. Temperature was one of the main drivers in the model followed by vegetation cover. Nymphs were restricted to only 17.5% of the modelled area but, respectively, 73.5%, 67.1% and 78.8% of the human populations lived within 5 km of these areas in Denmark, Norway and Sweden.

Abstract At some point in active practice, virtually all family physicians will be required to conduct at least an initial evaluation of a patient with peripheral nervous system (PNS) complaints. The authors outline and describe common themes found in the symptoms and diagnoses of PNS dysfunctions. These themes may be useful to physicians when performing initial evaluations of patients with PNS dysfunctions. The authors also discuss diagnostic methods and effective therapeutic interventions for this patient population. The human nervous system is an incredibly complex network of pathways that allows us to interact successfully with our environment. The nervous system can be divided into two parts: the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that consists of the individual cranial, motor, and sensory nerves. Although the autonomic nervous system (ie, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system) is often considered part of the PNS, this review will focus on disorders of the motor and sensory nerves within the PNS. This review will only briefly address cranial neuropathies and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical Presentation Disorders of the PNS present in myriad ways that can make clinical diagnosis challenging. The key to efficient diagnosis lies in being able to recognize certain patterns in patients' personal and family histories and in the results of physical and neurologic examinations. If PNS disorder is suspected, family physicians can request targeted diagnostic evaluations and consider giving their patients referrals to neurologists. In general, patients with PNS dysfunction complain of sensory disturbance, motor weakness, or both. Peripheral nerve pain is often more active at night. Typically, symptoms of sensory disturbance range along a continuum from “negative” phenomena (eg, numbness, loss of sensation) to “positive” phenomena (eg, tingling, burning, “pins and needles,” bands of tightness, and stabbing or shooting pain or both). Sensory symptoms may be subtle and are not always present during physical examinations, particularly when it is early in the progression of PNS dysfunction. Dysesthesia refers to unpleasant sensations perceived in response to normally nonnoxious stimuli. Alternatively, paresthesia is an unpleasant sensation that is perceived despite the absence of external stimuli. Finally, when normal stimuli are perceived as painful, allodynia is the descriptor used. 1 In most cases of injury to the PNS, patients' sensory symptoms are length-dependent, beginning in the distal portions of the lower extremities (toes) and progressing proximally. 1 Occasionally, sensory symptoms may begin in the distal portions of the upper extremities (fingers). This common anatomic distribution of symptoms is referred to as a stocking-glove pattern and is virtually pathognomic for a peripheral neuropathy. Once sensory symptoms have progressed to the midshin, patients may report the involvement of the fingers. 2 Patients may also report difficulties with balance and coordination that may be secondary to a loss of distal sensation. Radiculopathy Radiculopathies are not length-dependent, but there is, once again, a continuum of sensory symptoms that patients may describe. Along this continuum, physicians may receive patient reports of pain levels that range from an “ache” to a “shooting electric-shock–like pain” that radiates toward the periphery of the limb. Patients may also have spasms of the paraspinal muscles, which are often sore and tender to the touch. Radiculopathies are often exacerbated by certain activities that increase intra-abdominal pressure, such as coughing or sneezing. 1 When stationary, patients may naturally favor certain positions (eg, standing versus sitting) to accommodate and minimize their pain. Motor symptoms may include motor weakness or muscle fatigue or atrophy. Patients typically complain about impaired motor abilities after the onset of sensory symptoms, but exceptions are not uncommon. As with sensory symptoms, motor weakness often involves the distal musculature initially, though it may have begun with weakness when the toes were in flexion or extension. Motor weakness is usually more prominent in extensor muscles than in the flexor muscles (ie, walking on one's heels is affected earlier than walking on ones toes). Motor weakness may progress proximally. A loss of muscle mass (atrophy), abnormally frequent and painful cramps, or fasciculations are strongly suggestive of lower motor neuron involvement. Patients with these symptoms may have difficulty in ambulating, problems with manual dexterity, or both. 2 When taking notes on personal and family medical history, it is important to document the age of symptom onset, the progression of symptoms over time, any similarities to other family members, comorbidities, and the anatomic pattern of symptom involvement. Identification of exacerbating and alleviating factors can help physicians localize patient complaints. Symptoms involving a specific dermatome suggest a nerve root problem. Conversely, sensory involvement limited to one limb, in a territory not conforming to a particular dermatome, may suggest the involvement of a particular peripheral nerve. Polyneuropathy Polyneuropathies usually present with a symmetric stocking-glove pattern of symptoms that do not respect individual peripheral nerve or dermatomic areas. Symptoms in children and young adults—particularly if there is a family history suggestive of this dysfunction—may indicate a hereditary neuropathy. A chronic or slowly progressive course may also suggest a hereditary, metabolic, or pathologic cause. Acute onset of symptoms—particularly involving the territory of a specific peripheral nerve or root—may suggest spinal compression or trauma, or an ischemic injury. Physical Examination All patients presenting with the complaints detailed in the previous section should receive a complete physical examination to identify comorbid conditions that may be causative of sensory or motor symptoms. In particular, findings that suggest the source of dysfunction might be an underlying metabolic disease (eg, thyroid condition, diabetes mellitus), nutritional deficiency (alcoholism), malignant disease, or inflammatory disorder (eg, lupus, sarcoidosis, Sjögren's syndrome) can quickly narrow the focus of the differential diagnosis. Early in the course of certain PNS disorders, sensory symptoms are prominent and signs of peripheral neuropathy may be subtle. However, most patients with sensory neuropathies will have some degree of neurologic dysfunction when diagnostic testing is performed. When noting personal and family medical history, the goal of the physician should be to define anatomically and chronologically the areas of the body that have been affected. Peripheral neuropathies have a characteristic pattern of findings on physical examination. In mononeuropathy, sensation should be decreased only in that nerve's distribution. Sensory findings owing to a median neuropathy with compression at the wrist (ie, carpal tunnel syndrome), for example, classically involve nocturnal paresthesias with decreased sensation over the palmar surface of the first three fingers—but sparing the thenar eminence. 3 With mononeuritis multiplex (MNM) or multifocal mononeuropathy, sensory deficits localized to multiple individual peripheral nerves will be found simultaneously. In cases of mononeuropathy or MNM, typically all sensory modalities are affected (ie, pinprick, temperature, vibration, and touch). Polyneuropathies can imply systemic illness. Sensation usually is decreased in a stocking-glove pattern, but sometimes there is a disproportionate loss of certain sensory modalities. Patients with small-fiber sensory (unmyelinated) neuropathy (SFSN) may have decreased sensitivity to pinprick and temperature sensory modalities, but their response to vibration remains relatively normal. Conversely, patients with large-fiber neuropathies may first have vibration or proprioception preferentially affected. 1 Deep-tendon reflexes (DTRs) are often decreased or absent in PNS dysfunction. Hyporeflexia implies dysfunction of large myelinated fibers representing the afferent limb of muscle spindle–initiated reflexes. If the pathologic process is limited strictly to small sensory fibers, DTRs may not be affected. 2 As with the sensory examination, documenting DTR abnormalities can help physicians localize the site of PNS dysfunction. Orthopedic findings such as pes cavus (talipes), “hammertoe,” and high arches are seen in many cases of neuropathy that are known to be of hereditary origin. Motor findings on examination imply motor weakness. Affected muscles may be within the myotome of an individual nerve (eg, “foot drop” with a peroneal nerve injury) or they may involve distal muscles in a symmetric fashion. Thus, motor findings suggest a more diffuse dysfunctional progression. Classically, disease of the PNS causes motor weakness, muscle atrophy, and fasciculations to varying degrees of severity. Motor symptoms are usually found in combination with sensory deficits. Isolated motor findings do occur, however, and suggest that the disease process may be limited to the ventral horn or roots. Such findings may represent acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or polio, among other disease entities. 4 In summary, on physical and sensory examination, patients with mononeuropathies usually demonstrate impaired sensation, motor weakness, muscle atrophy, and decreased DTRs in some combination. The site of dysfunction is localized strictly to the area innervated by the dysfunctional peripheral nerve. Alternatively, patients with radiculopathies will usually have paresthesias, sensory and motor findings, and decreased DTRs in a dermatomal or myotomal pattern. Patients with polyneuropathies usually demonstrate a symmetric stocking-glove pattern of sensory deficits, decreased distal DTRs, and sometimes motor weakness. Types of Neuropathy Neuropathies can be defined using any number of classification schemes. The following scheme may be helpful. Anatomic Neuropathies Anatomic neuropathies can be classified based on the location of the causative lesion within the neuroaxis and divided into one of three groups: mononeuropathy, radiculopathy, or polyneuropathy. The differences among these classifications follow. ▪ Mononeuropathy —This classification of anatomic neuropathy implies dysfunction of a single peripheral nerve (eg, median neuropathy). Any peripheral nerve can be affected, but most often those with superficial courses (eg, median, ulnar, radial, and peroneal) are involved. Anatomic mononeuropathies can lead to paresthesias, sensory loss, and motor weakness—with or without atrophy and fasciculations—but they all involve areas specifically innervated by the dysfunctional peripheral nerve. As noted, one special form of mononeuropathy is MNM, in which multiple mononeuropathies occur simultaneously. ▪ Radiculopathy —This classification of anatomic neuropathy implies that a lesion involves the ventral and/or dorsal peripheral nerve roots proximal to their union, which forms the individual spinal nerves. Radicular lesions cause motor weakness, sensory loss, paresthesias, and decreased DTRs in any combination. The characteristic finding with radicular lesions is loss of sensation or physical strength and/or DTRs in a dermatomal and myotomal pattern. Radicular lesions are often painful because of impingement on the dorsal roots as the PNS enters the spinal cord. Certain positions (sitting) and activities (sneezing, straining) often exacerbate symptoms in patients with radiculopathy. As previously noted, radiculopathies are not length-dependent. 1 ▪ Polyneuropathy —This classification of anatomic neuropathy describes the simultaneous dysfunctional involvement of multiple peripheral nerves. Polyneuropathies are usually bilateral and symmetric, demonstrating the classic distal-to-proximal pattern of sensory loss and/or motor weakness. Polyneuropathies are almost always length-dependent and commonly involve the distal portions of the lower extremities first. At the ankles, DTRs may be decreased, a symptom that can also indicate underlying systemic disease. As noted, one special form of polyneuropathy is known as small-fiber sensory neuropathy (SFSN) . This unmyelinated form of polyneuropathy is the most common type of painful neuropathy in patients over the age of 50, 1 and patients typically present with painful, “burning” feet. Although no cause is found for SFSN in a large percentage of patients, known causes include diabetes mellitus, amyloidosis, toxic exposure, and inherited sensory and autonomic neuropathies. 1 Diagnosis of SFSN is made on the basis of the clinical history and neurologic examination, electromyography that includes normal nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS), and abnormal specialized studies of small-fiber function such as quantitative sensory testing (QST), sudomotor index testing, and autonomic testing. 1 , 5 Pathologic Neuropathies Neuropathies can also be classified by the primary pathologic process affecting the nerves. Pathologic neuropathies can be further divided into two broad classes: demyelinating and axonal pathologic neuropathies. The differences between these two classifications and a description of each class' subcategories and specific clinical-diagnostic manifestations follow. ▪ Demyelinating —The classification of demyelinating pathologic neuropathies encompasses those PNS disorders where there is loss of the myelin sheath surrounding nerve axons. Demyelination occurs in a segmental or “patchy” fashion. If the loss of myelin is severe, nerves may be unable to conduct an action potential known as conduction block . There are two subcategories of demyelinating pathologic neuropathies, hereditary and acquired. The differences between these two subcategories follow. □ Hereditary —Demyelinating neuropathies can be categorized as hereditary, as in instances of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1 (CMT 1). In general, the number of inherited disorders described in the literature continues to increase as new genetic mutations are identified and defined. Although a discussion of every disorder of this category of demyelinating pathologic neuropathy is beyond the scope of this review, some general principles may be helpful to the primary care physician who is seeing a patient that is presenting for the first time with symptoms of this type of PNS disorder. As noted, family history of similar motor symptoms is an obvious clue and the first place to begin looking for useful information. Hereditary neuropathies can progress very slowly, but symptom onset usually dates to childhood or young adulthood. Hereditary neuropathies most commonly occur in an autosomal or X-linked fashion, although sporadic cases are not uncommon. Hereditary demyelinating neuropathies result from perturbations in the genetic code for certain neural proteins. Patients may present with atrophy of distal muscles of the calves and feet (peroneal atrophy). These patients may also have a history of orthopedic changes (eg, talipes, “hammertoe,” and high arches). 2 Additionally, because of repeated episodes of demyelination and remyelination, results from nerve biopsies will show “onion bulbs.” In such cases, clinicians may also note palpably enlarged nerves. Diagnosis is made after a consideration of family and personal history, physical examination of the patient and other affected family members, electrodiagnostic (EDX) testing, and genetic testing. Results from EDX testing that are positive for hereditary neuropathy will show diffuse slowing of conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, and increased duration of nerve conduction potentials without conduction block. Nerve action potentials typically have normal or slightly decreased amplitudes in the demyelinating range. 3 Treatment for patients with hereditary neuropathy is mainly supportive. Genetic testing and family counseling may be useful options for certain patients. □ Acquired —Demyelinating neuropathies classified as acquired include acute idiopathic polyneuritis (ie, Guillian-Barré syndrome), 2 , 6 chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), 7 and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) with conduction block. 8 These PNS disorders result from immune-mediated destruction of the myelin sheaths. Four acquired demyelinating neuropathies are detailed in the following paragraphs: AIDP, CIDP, MMN, and demyelinating neuropathies that are the result of monoclonal gammopathy. Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP) is usually monophasic. Its classic presentation is as an acute ascending paralysis with a loss of reflexes. 6 This PNS dysfunction most often occurs 1 to 3 weeks following a nonspecific viral upper respiratory infection or gastroenteritis, at the time of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroconversion, 9 or after vaccinations or surgery. This acquired form of demyelinating neuropathy can be painful because of the involvement of the peripheral nerve's dorsal roots. Additionally, this PNS disorder can be life threatening, as it is accompanied in some patients by severe bulbar, autonomic, and respiratory dysfunction. In patients with AIDP, close monitoring of respiratory function, blood pressure, and heart rate are recommended, as is the need for aggressive pain management. In fact, pain control often requires intensive care unit (ICU)-level observation. Results of EDX testing for patients with AIDP show diffuse slowing of action potential conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, and delayed or absent F waves. Conduction blocks are typically noted, however. Treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or plasma exchange speeds patient recovery, and studies find that, over several months, most patients recover well. 10 Although steroids are considered an effective treatment option for patients with CIDP, that treatment modality is not recommended for patients with AIDP because steroids have not been proven efficacious for that clinical application. 10 , 11 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) can be progressive or polyphasic. 6 Diagnosis can be difficult because of CIDP's varied clinical phenotypes, multifocality, and predilection for proximal nerve segments. 7 , 12 Patients' bulbar and respiratory functions are typically spared. Similar to findings in AIDP, some patients with CIDP usually have progressive—usually distal-to-proximal—motor weakness, loss of DTRs, and sensory loss in stocking-glove pattern. The disease process is considered chronic, and is accordingly diagnosed as CIDP, if symptoms continue for at least 2 months. Results of EDX testing for patients with CIDP indicate diffuse slowing of action potential conduction velocities, prolonged distal latencies, prolongation of F waves, and/or the presence of conduction block or temporal dispersion. 7 An effective treatment option for CIDP is immunosuppressive steroidal agents (eg, prednisone), 13 For maintenance therapy, IVIg or plasma exchange is recommended, though some clinicians may reserved these modalities to treat any exacerbation of symptoms. 10 , 11 Multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is characterized by severe multifocal demyelination of PNS motor nerves. This PNS disorder most often presents as a progressive, mostly distal, asymmetric limb weakness preferentially involving the upper extremities. In fact, MMN differs from CIDP in that it is often asymmetric and affects the upper extremities first. Patients with MMN may have IgM anti-GM1 antibodies in their sera. 8 The results of EDX testing should also show multifocal conduction block. Treatment with IVIg is recommended. 10 , 13 There is no evidence indicating that patients with MMN respond well to treatment with either steroids or plasma exchange. 8 The last demyelinating neuropathies reviewed in this article are those that are the result of a monoclonal gammopathy . Researchers have found that gammopathies may be the result of elevated production of IgM, IgG, or IgA by plasma cell clones. 14 , 15 Approximately two-thirds of cases of gammopathies are initially diagnosed as monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance. 16 The remaining one-third of cases are associated with multiple myeloma, lymphoma, amyloidosis, or other malignant disease. 16 Patients with gammopathies require lifelong care because of the high risk of developing a primary malignancy. Neuropathies secondary to IgM-associated gammopathy are considered to be more severe and typically do not respond well to immunosuppressive therapy, IVIg, or plasma exchange. IgG and IgA gammopathies are not as well studied, but they are thought to be more responsive to therapy than are IgM-associated gammopathies. 14 ▪ Axonal —Although axonal neuropathies may also be inherited, as in CMT type 2 (ie, hereditary motor sensory neuropathy type 2), PNS disorders in this class of demyelinating pathologic neuropathies are characterized by a progressive loss of nerve function because of injury to the neuron cell body or axon. Therefore, this type of PNS dysfunction is classified separately. Most commonly, axonal neuropathies are acquired illnesses that appear as symmetric polyneuropathies secondary to underlying systemic disease. □ Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) —An example of an acquired axonal neuropathy that practitioners may see in the ICU setting is CIP. Sepsis is the main cause of CIP in this clinical setting as it is the result of sepsis-mediated damage to the peripheral nerves and muscles. Critical illness polyneuropathy is characterized by motor weakness, muscle atrophy, and difficulty weaning from ventilatory support. However, CIP is monophasic and self-limited once the underlying condition is adequately treated. 17 , 18 Etiologic Neuropathies Neuropathy can also be defined on an etiologic basis as any of the following types: compressive, traumatic, hereditary, metabolic, nutritional, infectious, autoimmune or inflammatory, and toxin or medication induced. ▪ Compressive —Nerve injury that is the result of compression most often involves nerves that have a superficial course. Virtually any peripheral nerve can be involved. The most common entities likely to be seen include: median neuropathy at the wrist (ie, carpal tunnel syndrome [CTS]), ulnar neuropathy at the elbow, radial neuropathy at the spiral groove or wrist, peroneal neuropathy at the fibular head, and compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve in the inguinal area. Compressive etiologic neuropathy in patients may also be accompanied by paresthesias, sensory loss, motor weakness, and muscle atrophy in the distributions of the affected peripheral nerves. □ Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) —A condition that has received wide media coverage in recent years. This syndrome results from compression of the median nerve as it courses through the carpal tunnel of the wrist. Patients may have CTS as a result of metabolic disease (eg, diabetes, hypothyroidism) or because of structural dysfunction (eg, ganglion cyst). Maintaining the wrist in prominent flexion or extension (eg, when driving, sleeping, or typing) exacerbates symptoms, which include some combination of paresthesias and pain (particularly at night), numbness of the fingers, and weakness in grip strength. Results from physical examinations may be normal or show sensory loss involving the palmar surface of the first three fingers but sparing the thenar eminence . 3 This is an important point. Sensory loss over the thenar eminence implies that the lesion is proximal to the wrist. Weakness of grip, with atrophy of the thenar eminence, is seen later in the progression of this syndrome. Symptoms of CTS may be reproducible by one or both of the following methods: Tinel's sign, with percussion of the median nerve at the carpal tunnel, or Phalen's maneuver, with flexion of the wrists to 90 degrees for more than 1 minute. Sensory fibers of the PNS are often preferentially affected by CTS. Results of EDX testing for patients with CTS will initially show slowing of median nerve conduction velocities across the carpal tunnel with prolonged distal latencies. Axon loss, resulting in decreased amplitudes with subsequent denervation changes, are seen later in the progression of this dysfunction. 3 Conservative treatment includes rest, splinting to maintain the wrist in neutral position, and additional therapeutic modalities under the direction of an experienced occupational therapist that specializes in hand therapy. More aggressive treatment methods include steroid injections and surgical release for the carpel tunnel. □ Ulnar —Compressive neuropathy of the ulnar at the elbow is the second most common compressive lesion of the PNS. The most frequent cause of ulnar neuropathy is cumulative compressive injury caused by leaning or resting on the elbows. 19 The ulnar nerve passes through the ulnar groove formed by the olecranal process laterally, the medial epicondyle of the humerus medially, and a band of fibrous tissue superficially. Inflammation of the fibrous tissue can lead to compression injuries in this area. Ulnar neuropathy at the elbow manifests with paresthesias, numbness, and/or sensory loss of the fourth and fifth fingers of the hand. Motor weakness in finger adduction and wasting of intrinsic muscles of the hand occur later in the progression of this PNS dysfunction. 3 As with CTS, evaluation of ulnar neuropathy requires EDX testing to assist in localizing the lesion. Also, physicians will find EDX testing useful for ruling out ulnar neuropathy at the wrist, polyneuropathy, brachial plexopathy, or cervical radiculopathy. Recommended therapy for ulnar neuropathy at the elbow includes conservative measures such as active avoidance of leaning and resting on the elbows. More aggressive treatment methods include steroid injections into the cubital tunnel and surgical release for the ulnar tunnel. 19 □ Radial —The effects of radial neuropathies can be dramatic depending on the site of compression. Relatively minor sensory symptoms involving the dorsal aspect of the lateral hand can be seen with compression of the superficial radial sensory nerve caused by tight-fitting watches, bracelets, or handcuffs. Complete paralysis of wrist and finger extension appears with more proximal radial nerve lesions. “Saturday night palsy” can result from prolonged compression of the proximal radial nerve at the spiral groove caused by resting the forearm on a hard surface such as the edge of a bathtub or back of a chair. Patients may demonstrate “wrist drop” owing to paralysis of wrist and finger extensors innervated by the peripheral radial nerve. Lesions at, or distal to, the proximal radial nerve's spiral groove will spare elbow extension and the triceps reflex. In contrast, fractures of the humerus or other lesions of the radial nerve proximal to the spiral groove may result in paralysis of the triceps as well. 3 Identification of a Tinel's sign may locate the site of compression injury to the peripheral nerve. 20 The results of EDX testing can be a helpful addition to the findings of physical examinations in confirming the localization of the lesion. Treatment is usually conservative unless a humeral fracture is involved. Splinting of the wrist and the services of an experienced occupational therapist that specializes in hand therapy are often helpful. 20 □ Peroneal —The peroneal nerve is superficial as it courses around the fibular neck. Because of its location, it is highly susceptible to injury. Compression of the peroneal nerve at the fibular head usually manifests as “foot drop.” Weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion may result in patient complaints of falling because they have caught their toes while climbing stairs or walking on thick rugs. Inversion of the foot is preserved. Patients with foot drop have a characteristic gait that requires the proximal leg to be lifted high while the foot slaps onto the ground. 2 Personal medical history is important in diagnosing these patients, as similar findings may be seen with an L5 disk lesion. 5 Electrodiagnostic evaluation, therefore, can be helpful in diagnosis, particularly if the patient has concurrent complains of back pain. Common causes of compressive peroneal neuropathy include sitting with the legs crossed, improper positioning or cushioning of the legs during surgical procedures, poor-fitting casts, significant weight loss in obese patients, and insufficient padding for patients seated in wheelchairs. In most cases, therapy consists of supportive measures. Properly fitted orthotics can significantly improve patients' ability to ambulate. □ Femoral —The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve is part of the lumbar plexus formed by peripheral nerves with roots in the iguinal area (ie, L2 and L3). This nerve provides sensation to the anterior and lateral aspect of the proximal thigh. Patients with compressive femoral neuropathy may complain of numbness or paresthesias (meralgia paresthetica) in the iguinal distribution. As the nerve affected is purely sensory, no motor weakness is seen. This type of neuropathy is most frequently seen in patients who are obese or pregnant. Also affected are those who wear tight-fitting pants that can lead to compression of the femoral nerve as it passes over the inguinal ligament. Electrodiagnostic testing is not necessary in the evaluation of these patients unless physicians note motor weakness or changes in DTRs, both of which suggest the involvement of the lumbar plexus or a radiculopathy. Treatment is mainly supportive as eliminating the offending agent is usually curative. 2 ▪ Trauma —Traumatic nerve injury is usually obvious and can be diagnosed by history alone. Trauma may lead to complete nerve transection or partial peripheral nerve injury. Evaluation with EDX testing is essential for gauging the extent of PNS injury and patients' prognosis for recovery. Because wallerian degeneration can last 4 to 7 days, however, the results of EDX testing performed in the acute phase of traumatic peripheral nerve injury may show only decreased PNS recruitment with otherwise normal findings. Ten to 14 days after the acute phase of traumatic injury, the results of EDX testing are likely to be more revealing and can provide valuable prognostic information. ▪ Hereditary —Hereditary neuropathies are suspected in cases where a family history of similar symptoms is present. In fact, studies suggest that many patients referred to tertiary centers for evaluation of “unclassified neuropathy” are ultimately diagnosed with a hereditary disorder. 3 However, the appearance of hereditary neuropathy can be sporadic and not easily diagnosed. Features of the most common hereditary neuropathies (eg, CMT 1) were discussed previously. Personal and family medical history, neurologic examination, and EDX testing in combination with genetic testing or nerve biopsy evaluation may be required before a suspected diagnosis of hereditary neuropathy can be given. ▪ Metabolic or Nutritional —Metabolic and nutritional derangements can lead to neurologic disease. Diabetes mellitus is the most common cause of metabolic neuropathy in the United States. 21 A slow progressive, usually symmetric, polyneuropathy is often found on neurologic examination when the cause of neuropathy is metabolic or nutritional. The results of neurologic examination usually demonstrate the stocking-glove pattern of sensory changes, distal weakness, and loss of ankle reflexes. ▪ Infectious —Although an in-depth discussion of neuropathies caused by infectious agents is well beyond the scope of this review, we will outline the following infectious causes of neuropathy briefly: Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, varicella zoster virus (VZV), leprosy, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and botulism. Also, as previously noted, CIP secondary to sepsis can lead to diffuse PNS dysfunction. 17 □ Lyme disease (borreliosis) —Lyme disease is caused by the organism Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted by tick bite ( Ixodes scapularis and I pacificus ). Classically, Lyme disease begins with the appearance of a skin lesion (ie, erythema chronicum migrans) at the site of the tick bite. This lesion may be followed by a systemic flu-like illness. The involvement of the CNS is manifested in meningoencephalitis or transverse myelitis. Diagnosis of neuropathy from Lyme disease can be challenging, as many patients do not recall having been exposed. In addition, Lyme disease can manifest as virtually any type of PNS lesion. Lyme disease is one of the more common causes of unilateral facial nerve paralysis (ie, Bell's palsy). A painful polyradiculopathy can result from involvement of multiple peripheral nerve roots. Lyme disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MNM. Diagnosis is made by demonstrating Lyme antibodies in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid, or by locating Lyme DNA through polymerase chain reaction testing. Preferred treatment options for neuropathies caused by Lyme disease include administering a third-generation cephalosporin, amoxicillin, or doxycycline monohydrate. 22 □ Syphilis —A sexually transmitted disease caused by infection with Treponema pallidum . Again, virtually any part of the CNS can be involved. Once considered a neurologic curiosity, the threat of syphilis has reemerged owing to the emergence of the HIV epidemic. 22 , 23 □ HIV infection —The neurologic complications of HIV infection are protean and include opportunistic infections, lymphomas, and peripheral neuropathy. 24 Meningoencephalitis may occur at the time of seroconversion. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) dementia complex is a known CNS complication of that syndrome. 24 , 25 An inflammatory, demyelinating neuropathy may be the first neurologic complication of HIV in cases where CD4 cell counts remain relatively high. 9 A distal, symmetric, sensorimotor polyneuropathy that is often painful becomes more prevalent as the disease progresses. 9 Since many of the available antiretroviral medications used to treat AIDS cause similar symptoms as are found with this type of neuropathy, however, defining the actual causative process of the neuropathy can be complicated. 26 In fact, owing to the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the treatment of patients with AIDS, the incidence of HIV-associated sensory polyneuropathy is decreasing. In contrast, the incidence of antiretroviral drug-induced neuropathy has increased. Overall, because HIV-infected patients are living longer, the prevalence of HIV peripheral neuropathy is increasing. 24 , 25 □ Varicella zoster virus (VZV) —Thought to reside in the dorsal root ganglia, VZV usually manifests as herpes zoster in elderly or immunocompromised patients. Herpes zoster represents the reactivation of latent peripheral nerve infection. Initially, patients with neuropathy caused by VZV complain of painful, erythematous rashes that are usually confined to a thoracic dermatome or trigeminal nerve distribution. After 3 to 5 days, a vesicular eruption occurs in the same areas. The recommended pharmacologic treatment is acyclovir sodium, though prednisone therapy is also often added to patients' treatment plans, particularly for elderly patients, as it is thought to reduce the risk of developing postherpetic neuralgia. 22 □ Leprosy —Also known as Hansen's disease , leprosy is caused by the etiologic agent Mycobacterium leprae and results in the infection of individual Schwann's cells, leading to demyelination. In patients with neuropathy as a result of leprosy, pain fibers are particularly affected and result in the loss of sensation and tissue injury. □ Tuberculosis —Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis , tuberculosis leads to granulomatous inflammation with injury to cutaneous sensory nerves, often in a patchy distribution. Mycobacterial infection can result in MNM. 22 □ Diphtheria —Neuropathy caused by diphtheria results in neurologic damage from exposure to the exotoxin of Corynebacterium diphtheriae . Patients experience a painful, symmetric sensorimotor polyneuropathy. 22 □ Botulism —Caused by Clostridium botulinum , botulism affects the presynaptic neuromuscular junction, inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, which leads to a flaccid paralysis with a loss of reflexes. We note botulism, in particular for this section, because it can mimic a severe polyneuropathy. Botulism in infants (aged ≤12 months old) occurs after the ingestion of certain foods such as honey. Because the intestinal flora in infants is not fully developed, C botulinum germinates and produces a toxin that results in a host of symptoms that, when combined, are described as “floppy baby.” Other symptoms include poor sucking, swallowing, and respiratory difficulty. Among other age groups, botulism occurs after the ingestion of the same toxin when it is already present in foods that are improperly prepared or refrigerated. Classically, botulism results in a descending flaccid paralysis, with involvement of papillary responses and prominent bulbar and respiratory dysfunction. Treatment for both populations consists of supportive therapy. Patients may need ICU management, in some cases, however. 22 ▪ Autoimmune or Inflammatory —Patients can have any number of neurologic complications as a result of an underlying autoimmune disorder. In addition to AIDP, CIDP, and MMN, other connective tissue processes (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren's syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis) can cause a mononeuropathy, radiculopathy, or polyneuropathy. Rheumatologic disease is thought to damage nerves by inducing a vasculitic process. Vasculitis results in patchy areas of ischemic injury through its inflammatory effects on microscopic vessels of the vasa nervorum. 27 Rheumatologic evaluation and referral to a neurologist is warranted in most cases where autoimmune or inflammatory causes of PNS dysfunction are suspected. ▪ Toxin or Medication Induced —Prolonged exposure to certain industrial chemicals, radiation, and medications can result in injury to the peripheral nerves. The causes of PNS disorder usually present as a symmetric polyneuropathy. □ Medication induced —The medications used to treat life-threatening conditions such as HIV/AIDS and cancer are common offenders. Specifically, HAART, which is used in the treatment of HIV infection, adversely affects mitochondrial function and inhibits DNA polymerase activity, inducing neuropathy in some patients. Chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin can induce dose-, length-, and time-dependent axonal polyneuropathies that may have purely sensory symptoms and are often painful. 28 , 29 Administration of tacrolimus can lead to demyelination and can mimic AIDP or CIDP. 28 Vincristine, paclitaxel (Taxol), and suramin hexasodium more commonly cause mixed sensorimotor neuropathies, with or without concomitant autonomic nervous system involvement. Patients with premorbid diabetes or inherited neuropathies probably carry an increased predisposition to chemotherapy-induced neurologic dysfunction. 29 □ Toxin induced —Unfortunately, alcohol abuse is likely the most common cause of toxic PNS dysfunction. Long-term alcohol abuse can produce cognitive difficulties, unstable gait, poor coordination, cramps, and myalgia. Gait and coordination difficulties can result from cerebellar disease alone, though, in many cases, there is a superimposed axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy, an alcoholic myopathy, or both. Alcohol is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis and is toxic to nerves and muscles, independent of the common comorbidities of malnutrition and liver disease found in these patients. 30 Patient Evaluation Most patients with neurologic complaints initially consult with their family physicians. Evaluation of suspected neuropathy begins with a complete personal and family medical history and a physical examination. A thorough interview and examination may reveal stigmata of systemic diseases, exposure to toxic agents, or genetic predisposition. Neurologic examination should focus on defining the pattern of motor weakness, sensory loss, and/or changes in DTRs. This information should assist the evaluating physician in determining the type of neuropathy present (ie, mononeuropathy, radiculopathy, or polyneuropathy). By better defining the general type of neuropathy in this way, physicians can better tailor additional diagnostic evaluations to pinpoint possible causes and appropriate treatment options ( Figure 1 ). Figure 1. Proposed algorithm for evaluation of peripheral neuropathy. Figure 2. Evaluation and treatment of suspected mononeuropathy (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome, ulnar neuropathy at the elbow). In most cases, patients should undergo basic laboratory testing, including complete blood cell count with platelets, electrolyte and glucose levels, renal function tests, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody analysis, urinalysis, thyroid function tests, B 12 and B 6 levels, Lyme antibodies, and rapid plasma reagin. A chest radiograph should also be performed for patients with risk factors for malignancy, infection, or granulomatous disease. Results from these laboratory studies will provide a general screening for underlying metabolic, inflammatory, and autoimmune disorders as well as potential malignant or infectious processes. Abnormalities should be pursued appropriately with additional laboratory studies (eg, hemoglobin A 1c levels, oral glucose tolerance testing, serum protein electrophoresis) or referral to a specialist. Early detection of underlying derangements is important, as treatment methods are probably most effective early in the course of neuropathy. 21 In patients with evidence of mononeuropathy or radiculopathy, imaging the appropriate level of the neuroaxis is warranted. In general, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred diagnostic method as it provides better anatomic resolution. For patients who cannot undergo MRI testing (eg, those with pacemakers or claustrophobia), computed tomographic scanning is a logical alternative. Structural abnormalities identified through imaging necessitate referral to an orthopedist or neurosurgeon. Other useful diagnostic tools in the assessment of PNS dysfunction include those performed in EDX testing, such as electromyography and nerve conduction studies (EMG/NCS) and/or quantitative sensory testing (QST). Of these methods, EMG/NCS is currently the most useful. When performed by experienced and trained neuromuscular specialists, EMG/NCS can define the underlying disease process (ie, axon loss versus demyelination) and can provide helpful data for localizing the site of PNS dysfunction and prognostic purposes. Quantitative sensory testing is usually done in combination with EMG/NCS for patients whose symptoms are consistent with SFSN. 1 Evoked potential testing is usually of little help in the evaluation of peripheral neuropathies. Nerve biopsies may be useful in the evaluation of demyelinating or vasculitic processes. Superficial pure sensory nerves such as the sural nerve or superficial radial sensory nerves routinely undergo biopsy evaluation. Nerve biopsy is a diagnostic method that should be reserved until after a specialist's evaluation in most cases. Treatment Treatment plans should be tailored to the patient and the type of neuropathy discovered. In general, identification and treatment of any underlying systemic disorder is the initial interventional goal. In some cases (eg, neuropathies associated with diabetes mellitus or renal disease), there may be chronic disorders that require long-term care and may respond incompletely to therapy. 1 Mononeuropathies are most commonly the result of compression or trauma. Compressive neuropathies are typically treated initially with conservative therapy. Carpal tunnel syndrome and ulnar neuropathy at the elbow are the two compressive entities most commonly seen. Other compressive neuropathies such as superficial peroneal neuropathy resulting in foot drop and wrist drop owing to radial nerve compression (ie, Saturday night palsy) can be dramatic but are less common. For those with atypical presentations or less than satisfactory improvement, further evaluation by a neurologist may be warranted. Carpal tunnel syndrome may improve with rest and refraining from exacerbating activities. Maintaining the wrist in a neutral position with soft wrist supports is often helpful. For more severe cases of CTS, steroid injections into the carpal tunnel may be considered. Occupational therapy by a therapist specializing in hand therapy is also is beneficial. For patients with CTS who do not respond to these therapies or who have significant muscle wasting, evaluation by a neurologist or an orthopedist for surgical release of the carpel tunnel is warranted. 3 Treatment of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow begins with avoidance of prolonged periods of resting on the elbows or maintaining the elbows in a flexed position. Padding of the elbows may be beneficial. Patients who fail to respond to conservative therapy may require surgical evaluation for ulnar tunnel release. 19 Traumatic mononeuropathies should be evaluated by a neurologist with the assistance of EMG/NCS testing for better localization and prognosis. Again, the results of EDX testing are the most informative as long as the test is performed at least 14 days after the injury. Some patients with traumatic mononeuropathies may benefit from surgical intervention. Radiculopathies are initially treated with bed rest and pain control ( Figure 3 ). As patients' symptoms improve, activity levels can be increased as tolerated. Physical therapy for traction (in cases of cervical radiculopathy), stretching, and other treatment modalities may be beneficial. Patients with severe pain and/or compromised neurologic function should be referred to a neurologist and orthopedist for surgical evaluation. Figure 3. Evaluation and treatment of suspected radiculopathy. Polyneuropathies, including SFSN, are likely to be the most commonly encountered form of neuropathy for physicians practicing in the family care setting ( Figure 4 ). Figure 4. Evaluation and treatment of suspected polyneuropathy (eg, multifocal mononeuropathy). Polyneuropathies are often secondary to underlying metabolic derangements, with diabetes mellitus being far and away the most common cause. Early detection of abnormal glucose metabolism is critical, as strict glycemic control may slow disease progression. 31 Polyneuropathies present with symmetric stocking-glove pattern sensory deficits, decreased DTRs, and/or motor weakness. Identification and treatment of the underlying condition offers the only potential cure. Treatment of acquired immune-mediated neuropathies can speed recovery. As noted, AIDP is not responsive to steroid therapy 10 and should be treated with IVIg or plasma exchange. 32 Patients with AIDP may have significant bulbar, respiratory, or autonomic insufficiency requiring ICU-level management. Data is insufficient to support the use of immunosuppressive agents in the management of MMN, 32 and IVIg remains the only proven treatment. 13 , 32 Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is best managed with long-term immunosuppression using steroids or other agents. 32 As noted, IVIg may be used for maintenance therapy or reserved for exacerbations. 10 , 32 Although paraproteinemic demyelinating neuropathies have been little studied, small trials have shown some benefit for patients who receive plasma exchange and IVIg. 32 Neuropathies caused by infectious agents require identification of the inciting organism and institution of an appropriate antibiotic or antiviral therapy. Use of recombinant human nerve growth factor and reduction of viral load may improve nerve function in patients with HIV. 26 Control of neuropathic pain can be difficult and, unfortunately, often incomplete. Most patients require long-range treatment and may benefit from evaluation by a pain management specialist. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the most thoroughly studied pharmacologic treatment modality and have been the first-line therapy for neuropathic pain for many years. 1 , 33 , 34 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), while better tolerated, have been found to be less efficacious than TCAs for most patients. 1 , 35 – 37 Many anticonvulsant medications are currently being used in combination with TCAs for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Carbamazepine has been studied the longest; however, its benefit has primarily been limited to trigeminal neuralgia. 38 Administering gabapentin starting at 100 mg to 300 mg twice daily with titration to effect is a reasonable starting regimen, particularly in painful diabetic and postherpetic neuralgia. 39 – 41 Daily doses in excess of 1600 mg are usually necessary. 1 Lamotrigine and bupropion hydrochloride 42 represent other treatments that may be useful in neuropathic pain. 21 , 43 Lamotrigine has proven efficacy for the treatment of refractory trigeminal neuralgia, HIV neuropathy, and central post-stroke pain. 39 , 43 A common mistake physicians make in prescribing anticonvulsant medications for pain control is in not treating patients long enough and in sufficiently high doses. Other alternatives for pain management include topical agents such as over-the-counter creams, lidocaine patches, and capsaicin cream. Lidocaine patches are usually cut to the appropriate size and applied to the skin over particularly painful areas. Applied topically, capsaicin depletes sensory nerves of substance P. Symptoms may worsen upon initiation of topical capsaicin treatment, however, and the time investment required from the patient to achieve effective treatment can make this a less attractive therapeutic option. 1 In general, narcotics are often ineffective and typically are not first-line agents for neuropathic pain. Narcotic medications have many complicating adverse effects, such as dependence, tolerance, constipation, sedation, and confusion. One exception is oxycodone hydrochloride, which has proven effectiveness in postherpetic neuralgia. 44 Additionally, tramadol hydrochloride is well tolerated and has shown efficacy similar to that of TCAs. Tramadol demonstrates low-affinity binding to opioid receptors and is considered less likely to induce dependence. 1 Alternative therapies, including acupuncture and transcutaneous nerve stimulation, have shown mixed results. 1 From the Department of Neurology at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine in Hershey.

The increasing incidence of new diseases as well as changing features of known diseases has partly been attributed to the impact of environmental changes. As a result, there have been calls from health experts for proper surveillance and monitoring of these changes. This is a report of mopane worm allergy in a 36 year old female from the Tswana tribe in Botswana. Mopane worm, the caterpillar stage of Gonimbrasia belina moths, is a seasonal delicacy to people in many communities in southern Africa. As a result, by adulthood, many residents of these communities have had substantial exposure to the worm. Gonimbrasia belina moths belong to the Lepidoptera order of insects. Though some members of this order are known to induce contact allergy, there is no reported incidence of ingestion allergy from mopane worm. Therefore, it is important to track this case for its epidemiological significance and to alert both clinicians and the vulnerable public on the incidence of mopane worm allergy in this region. Case presentation. This is a case of a 36 year old woman from the Tswana ethnic group in Botswana, who was diagnosed with food allergy. She presented with itchy skin rash, facial swelling, and mild hypotension after eating mopane worm. She had no previous history of allergic reaction following contact or ingestion of mopane worm and had no atopic illness in the past. She was treated and her symptoms resolved after 4 days. Conclusion. The proper management of allergy involves patients' avoidance and clinicians' predictability. Though hypothetical, this report is expected to sensitize clinicians to anticipate and properly manage subsequent occurrence, as well as educate the public in these communities. In addition, tracking new disease patterns, with relationship to environmental changes, will compliment existing evidence in validating the importance of proper environmental surveillance and management.",1940,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Spirochetes were still alive after 4 hr in lizard serum that had been preheated at 56 C for 30 min to inactivate complement. Furthermore, when lizard serum was chelated with 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid to block all complement activation, borreliacidal activity was arrested.

This study examined factors that discriminate between parents who regularly inspect their children for ticks and those who do not do so. Methods. Knowledge, cognitive and emotional attitudes, social influences, and self-efficacy expectations were assessed in 230 parents living in high endemic regions. Results. Regression analysis showed that moral norms, emotional attitude, anticipated regret, role models, and stress self-efficacy were positively associated with inspection behavior. Conclusions. Health education programs not only need to stimulate parental knowledge and discuss the health effects of tick bite prevention, they also need to stress the emotional benefits of tick bite prevention for children and parents and induce positive norms toward inspecting others. Furthermore, they need to stimulate openness about inspection behaviors, since the modeling examples of partners, relatives, and grandparents and the behavior of friends discriminate between inspecting and noninspecting parents. Finally, education programs should clearly indicate how tick inspection works, how the need for it should be communicated to the children, and how to take enough time to do it.",1195,0,0,1,0,it,en,

DNA microarrays were used to survey the adaptive genetic responses of Borrelia burgdorferi ( Bb ) B31, the Lyme disease spirochete, when grown under conditions analogous to those found in unfed ticks (UTs), fed ticks (FTs), or during mammalian host adaptation ( Bb in dialysis membrane chambers implanted in rats). Microarrays contained 95.4% of the predicted B31 genes, 150 (8.6%) of which were differentially regulated (changes of ≥1.8-fold) among the three growth conditions. A substantial proportion (46%) of the differentially regulated genes encoded proteins with predicted export signals (29% from predicted lipoproteins), emphasizing the importance to Bb of modulating its extracellular proteome. For B31 cultivated at the more restrictive UT condition, microarray data provided evidence of a bacterial stringent response and factors that restrict cell division. A large proportion of genes were responsive to the FT growth condition, wherein increased temperature and reduced pH were prominent environmental parameters. A surprising theme, supported by cluster analysis, was that many of the gene expression changes induced during the FT growth condition were transient and largely tempered as B31 adapted to the mammalian host, suggesting that once Bb gains entry and adapts to mammalian tissues, fewer differentially regulated genes are exploited. It therefore would seem that although widely dissimilar, the UT and dialysis membrane chamber growth conditions promote more static patterns of gene expression in Bb . The microarray data thus provide a basis for formulating new testable hypotheses regarding the life cycle of Bb and attaining a more complete understanding of many aspects of Bb 's complex parasitic strategies.",1747,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The Lyme BAT is indicative of protection by borreliacidal antibodies arising from effective vaccination or previous infection. The Lyme C6 EIA detects active infection and is very promising for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment. The PepC 10 may be a valuable test for early Lyme disease.

Follow-up-studies are sparse, especially including a thorough otoneurological re-examination. The aim of this study was to examine children with a history of facial palsy in order to register the incidence of complete recovery and the severity and nature of sequelae. We also wanted to investigate whether there was a correlation between sequelae and Lyme Borreliosis, treatment or other health problems. Methods: Twenty-seven children with a history of facial palsy were included. A re-examination was performed by an Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) specialist 1–2.9 years (median 2) after the acute facial palsy. The otoneurological examination included grading the three branches of the facial nerve with the House-Brackman score, otomicroscopy and investigation with Frenzel glasses. A paediatrician interviewed the families. Medical files were analysed. Result: The incidence of complete recovery was 78% at the 2-year follow-up. In six out of 27 children (22%), the facial nerve function was mildly or moderately impaired. Four children reported problems with tear secretion and pronunciation. There was no correlation between sequelae after the facial palsy and gender, age, related symptoms, Lyme neuroborreliosis (NB), treatment, other health problems or performance. Conclusion: One fifth of children with an acute facial palsy get a permanent dysfunction of the facial nerve. Other neurological symptoms or health problems do not accompany the sequelae of the facial palsy. Lyme NB or treatment seems to have no correlation to clinical outcome. Factors of importance for complete recovery after an acute facial palsy are still not known.",1738,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Shukla']",10.3121/cmr.1.1.5,2003.0,287,journal-article,"Abstract. Wild birds are important to public health because they carry emerging zoonotic pathogens, either as a reservoir host or by
                     dispersing infected arthropod vectors. In addition, bird migration provides a mechanism for the establishment of new endemic
                     foci of disease at great distances from where an infection was acquired. Birds are central to the epidemiology of West Nile
                     virus (WNV) because they are the main amplifying host of the virus in nature. The initial spread of WNV in the U.S. along
                     the eastern seaboard coincided with a major bird migration corridor. The subsequent rapid movement of the virus inland could
                     have been facilitated by the elliptical migration routes used by many songbirds. A number of bird species can be infected
                     with Borrelia burgdorferi , the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, but most are not competent to transmit the infection to Ixodes ticks. The major role birds play in the geographic expansion of Lyme disease is as dispersers of B. burgdorferi -infected ticks. Aquatic waterfowl are asymptomatic carriers of essentially all hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations
                     of influenza A virus. Avian influenza strains do not usually replicate well in humans, but they can undergo genetic reassortment
                     with human strains that co-infect pigs. This can result in new strains with a marked increase in virulence for humans. Wild
                     birds can acquire enteropathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter spp., by feeding on raw sewage and garbage, and can spread these agents to humans directly or by contaminating commercial
                     poultry operations. Conversely, wild birds can acquire drug-resistant enteropathogens from farms and spread these strains
                     along migration routes. Birds contribute to the global spread of emerging infectious diseases in a manner analogous to humans
                     traveling on aircraft. A better understanding of avian migration patterns and infectious diseases of birds would be useful

We undertook to study the inheritance of five microsatellite loci in the European Lyme disease vector, the tick Ixodes ricinus . Only two loci appeared fully Mendelian while the three others displayed non-Mendelian patterns that highly frequent null alleles could not fully explain. At one locus, IR27, some phenomenon seems to hinder the PCR amplification of one allele, depending on its origin (maternal imprinting) and/or its size (short allele dominance). DNA methylation, which appeared to be a possible explanation of this amplification bias, was rejected by a specific test comparing the amplification efficiency that did not differ between unmethylated and experimentally methylated DNA. The role of allele size in heterozygous individuals was then revealed from the data available on field collected ticks and consistent with the results of a theoretical approach. These observations highlight the need for prudence while inferring reproductive systems (selfing rates), parentage or even allelic frequencies from microsatellite markers, in particular for parasitic organisms for which molecular approaches often represent the only way for population biology inferences.",1270,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Walsh', 'John N. Aleinikoff', 'Robert P. Wintsch']",10.2475/01.2007.06,2007.0,4,journal-article,"Abstract. Geologic mapping, structural analysis, and geochronology in the area of the Lyme dome, southern Connecticut provides constraints on the origin of the rocks in the core of the dome, the absolute timing of the principal deformational and thermal events attributed to Alleghanian orogenesis, and the processes that generated the dome. Detrital zircon geochronology in combination with ages on intrusive rocks brackets the deposition of quartzite in the core of the dome sometime between ca. 925 and 620 Ma. Granite and granodiorite intruded the Neoproteorozic metasedimentary rocks in the core of the dome at ca. 620 to 610 Ma. Four major early Permian events associated with the Alleghanian orogeny affected the rocks in the Lyme dome area. Syn-tectonic migmatization and widespread penetrative deformation (D1, ca. 300 –290 Ma) included emplacement of alaskite at 290 ± 4 Ma during regional foliation development and aluminosilicate-orthoclase metamorphic conditions. Rocks of the Avalon terrane may have wedged between Gander cover rocks and Gander basement in the core of the Lyme during D1. Limited structural evidence for diapiric uplift of the Lyme dome indicates that diapirism started late in D1 and was completed by D2 (ca. 290 –280 Ma) when horizontal WNW contractional stresses dominated over vertical stresses. Second sillimanite metamorphism continued and syn-tectonic D2 granite pegmatite (288 ± 4 Ma) and the Joshua Rock Granite Gniess (284 ± 3 Ma) intruded at this time. North-northwest extension during D3 (ca. 280 –275 Ma) led to granitic pegmatite intrusion along S3 cleavage planes and in extensional zones in boudin necks during hydraulic failure and decompression melting. Intrusion of a Westerly Granite dike at 275 ± 4 Ma suggests that D3 extension was active, and perhaps concluding, by ca. 275 Ma. Late randomly oriented but gently dipping pegmatite dikes record a final stage of intrusion during D4 (ca. 275 –260 Ma), and a switch from NNW extension to vertical unloading and exhumation. Monazite and metamorphic zircon rim ages record this event at ca. 259 Ma. The evolution of the Lyme dome involved D1 mylonitization, intrusion, and migmatization during north-directed contraction, limited late D1 diapirism, D2 migmatization during WNW contraction with associated flexural flow and fold interference, D3 NNW horizontal extension and decompression melting, and final D4 vertical extension and rapid exhumation. Late regional uplift, extension, and normal faulting at higher crustal levels may have been caused by diapiric rise of the lower crust, below the structural level of the Lyme dome. The rocks record no evidence of Acadian metamorphism or deformation, suggesting that the Gander zone here was not tectonically juxtaposed with Avalon until the Alleghanian orogeny.",2810,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Borrelia burgdorferi ( B.b. ) enters the host through a tick bite on the skin and may disseminate from there to secondary organs, including the central nervous system. To achieve this, B.b. first has to evade the hostile immune system. In a second step, the borrelia have to reach the central nervous system and cross the blood-brain barrier. Once in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the spirochetes elicit an inflammatory response. We describe current knowledge about the infiltration of leukocytes into the CSF in LNB. In the final section, we discuss the mechanisms by which the spirochetal infection leads to the observed neural dysfunction. To conclude, we construct a stringent concept of the pathogenesis of LNB.",880,0,0,1,0,ro,en,

In Lyme disease diagnostic problems are still discussed extensively as the laboratory workup is not standardized and a positive antibody result is not proof of active infection. It is therefore important to appreciate all clinical signs that can prompt us to the diagnostic investigation of Lyme borreliosis. We present a case of a woman with Lyme borreliosis and recurrent unilateral anterior uveitis in her right eye for 2 years, who developed cotton wool spots (CWS) in her left eye, followed by acute and recurrent anterior uveitis in this second eye. An extensive general examination, including blood coagulopathies and ultrasound of the carotid arteries, did not reveal any pathology. The CWS resolved within a few months. The recurrent anterior uveitis could be controlled by topical steroids. After treatment with 2 g of i.v. ceftriaxone for 3 weeks, she remained free of recurrences for 1 year of observation time. CWS can be the first clinical sign of ocular vascular pathology and/or uveitis. Further investigation will be necessary to confirm the relationship between CWS and ocular borreliosis.

In Slovakia, significantly higher seroprevalence was recorded in dogs (33.5%) than in horses (26.5%), cattle (22.5%), sheep (16.6%) and rodents (17.8%) by using a mixture of Borrelia garinii, B. afzelii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (s.s.) antigens in ELISA. Seroprevalence in horses was significantly higher than in sheep and rodents, and seroprevalence in cattle was significantly higher than in rodents. By using IHA in free-living species, the highest seropositivity rates were detected in fallow deer (40.7%) compared with moufflons (16.6%), pheasants (8.0%) and pigeons (1.2%). When testing sera of horses, dogs and cattle from Slovakia by using different Slovak B. burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) isolates as antigens in ELISA, significantly higher seroprevalence of anti- Borrelia IgG antibodies and consistency of positive and negative findings was detected in comparison when American isolates were used. In WB analyses using the Eurocarpathian antigens, dog sera from Eastern Slovakia and Southern Moravia showed statistically insignificant differences in sensitivity and consistency of positive and negative findings. By using different methods and antigens in the same group of dog sera, significant differences in seroprevalence were only found in IHA with a mixture of Euroamerican B.b. s.l and WB CB26 B.b. s.s.

Distribution of the disease depends on the annual activity of ticks and on temperature changes. Our aim was to assess the temperature dependence of the disease. Methods: The weekly LD data and the site of infection on county level for 1998-2010 were gained from the National Epidemiologic and Surveillance System. The temperature data were retrieved from the National Meteorological Service. Regional differences in the weekly incidence were studied in two north-eastern and 3 south-western counties. Descriptive statistics and linear regression models were applied. Results: For 100 000 inhabitants the incidence was 11.597 in 1998-2003 resp. 15.268 in 2004-2010. The spring mean temperature showed an increase by a 0,052°C/ year during 1998-2010. LD incidence increased more steadily in spring than in summer. The first day with mean temperature of 10°C followed by days with mean temperature >8°C was chosen as start of spring. Based on this criterium spring started by 1.5-2 weeks earlier during the period. Similar shift of 2-3 weeks was observed in the detection of 10 cases/week from week 16 to 14-13. 80% of the increase of incidence was reported in weeks 18-28 with a maximum in weeks 23-24. The season was longer by 1-2 weeks in warmer years. Heatwaves decreased the incidence during summer months. Regional climatic conditions resulted 2-3 weeks difference in the onset and peak of the incidence. Conclusions: Based on the climatic dependence of LD we can predict the future changes in the annual distribution and increase of the incidence. The study was funded by the Research group “Adaptation to climate change” of the Hungarian Academy of Science (2006TKI246).",1829,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This article presents the initial findings from this study. The aim was to understand the costs and benefits to fishermen and fish merchants of establishing the MPA. These were assessed using a combination of primary and secondary data. The results indicate that the impacts of the closure differ according to the gear type and the fishing location used by the fishermen. Static gear fishermen who fish inside the closed area have seen changes in terms of increased fishing effort, mostly because they have been able to increase the number of crab and whelk pots they deploy. The effects of the closure on static gear fishermen who fish outside the closed area has been reported in terms of increased conflicts with towed gear fishermen who now fish regularly in their traditional grounds. Fishermen using towed gear on the other hand have been impacted through displacement effects as they have been forced to look for other fishing grounds outside the closed area. Most fish merchants and processors initially claimed that they were heavily impacted by the closure but when they were interviewed 1 year after the closure they suggested a more stable picture. Preliminary analyses of landings data indicate that the introduction of the MPA has so far had minimal impacts on the average incomes and financial profits of fishermen and fish merchants. This conclusion, however, reflects a short-term view as the impacts of the closure of Lyme Bay are likely to be felt for a long time to come.",1693,0,0,1,0,sw,en,

In the Abstract (page 252), Table I (page 254), and the Results section (page 257), the conversion of Fahrenheit into Celsius was incorrect. In all locations, the values that had previously read “>101.5°F (>40.6°C)” now read “>101.5°F (>38.6°C)”. Background: The present study was designed to evaluate the prevalence of Lyme arthritis in children who had a joint aspiration at a tertiary care children’s hospital in an endemic area and to identify clinical factors useful to differentiate Lyme arthritis from septic arthritis at the time of the initial presentation. Methods: The records of all children with an age of eighteen years or less who were managed with aspiration for joint effusions at our institution from 1992 to 2009 were reviewed. Data collection included a review of aspirates; an analysis of cell count, culture results, and hematological inflammatory markers; and a review of surgical intervention. Results: A total of 506 joint aspirations were analyzed. One hundred and fifteen aspirations were excluded. In the remaining group of 391 patients, 123 (31%) were subsequently diagnosed with Lyme arthritis. Fifty-one patients had culture-positive septic arthritis. The two cohorts were significantly different in terms of the presence of a fever of >101.5°F (>38.6°C) at the time of presentation, the refusal to bear weight, the peripheral white blood-cell count, and joint fluid cell count. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and the C-reactive protein level were not significantly different between the two cohorts. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that refusal to bear weight was the strongest predictor of the diagnosis of septic arthritis over Lyme arthritis. Conclusions: For any child presenting with a joint effusion in a Lyme-endemic area of the Northeastern United States, the likely prevalence of Lyme arthritis is 31% overall and 45% in the presence of knee effusion. Children with joint effusions resulting from Lyme disease are more likely to have knee involvement, a lower peripheral white blood-cell count, and a lower joint fluid cell count, and they are less likely to have fever or complete refusal to bear weight, when compared with children with septic arthritis.

Briggs']",10.1098/rspb.2010.2402,2011.0,64,journal-article,"The distribution of vector meals in the host community is an important element of understanding and predicting vector-borne disease risk. Lizards (such as the western fence lizard; Sceloporus occidentalis ) play a unique role in Lyme disease ecology in the far-western United States. Lizards rather than mammals serve as the blood meal hosts for a large fraction of larval and nymphal western black-legged ticks ( Ixodes pacificus —the vector for Lyme disease in that region) but are not competent reservoirs for the pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi . Prior studies have suggested that the net effect of lizards is to reduce risk of human exposure to Lyme disease, a hypothesis that we tested experimentally. Following experimental removal of lizards, we documented incomplete host switching by larval ticks (5.19%) from lizards to other hosts. Larval tick burdens increased on woodrats, a competent reservoir, but not on deer mice, a less competent pathogen reservoir. However, most larvae failed to find an alternate host. This resulted in significantly lower densities of nymphal ticks the following year. Unexpectedly, the removal of reservoir-incompetent lizards did not cause an increase in nymphal tick infection prevalence. The net result of lizard removal was a decrease in the density of infected nymphal ticks, and therefore a decreased risk to humans of Lyme disease. Our results indicate that an incompetent reservoir for a pathogen may, in fact, increase disease risk through the maintenance of higher vector density and therefore, higher density of infected vectors.",1579,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This study was aimed to assess the correlation between the expression of fH binding proteins (FHBPs) during the early phase of infection (48 h after the entry of Borrelia into the blood circulation) and complement resistance of the Borrelia genus. As expected, B. afzelii , B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. garinii (Serotype 4, PBi) showed resistance to complement mediated lysis when incubated with human and dog complement, which coincided with the significantly higher expression ( P < 0.05) of the FHBPs. Similarly, B. coriaceae showed resistance to cattle complement. In non-reservoir hosts borreliae failed to induce expression of FHBPs within 48 h of complement challenge, and did not survive. It is important to note that not only the expression of FHBP but also their binding to fH is required for borrelial resistance to the complement. fH binding may depend on the coiled-coil (CC) motifs observed in the FHBPs, especially at the C terminus. A loss of the C-terminal CC motif in BgCRASP-1 of SKT-1 strain was found in in-silico CC prediction, and may be coupled with SKT-1's inability to bind factor H and evade complement-mediated attack. In contrast, the C-terminal CC motif was observed ( P – 1.0) in BgCRASP-1 of PBi that may contributed to its factor H binding and human complement resistance.",1415,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Borrelia-specific antibodies are not detectable until several weeks after infection and even if they are present, they are no proof of an active infection. Since the sensitivity of culture and PCR for the diagnosis or exclusion of borreliosis is too low, a method is required that detects an active Borrelia infection as early as possible. For this purpose, a lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) using lysate antigens of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii and recombinant OspC was developed and validated through investigations of seronegative and seropositive healthy individuals as well as of seropositive patients with clinically manifested borreliosis. The sensitivity of the LTT in clinical borreliosis before antibiotic treatment was determined as 89,4% while the specificity was 98,7%. In 1480 patients with clinically suspected borreliosis, results from serology and LTT were comparable in 79.8% of cases. 18% were serologically positive and LTT-negative. These were mainly patients with borreliosis after antibiotic therapy. 2.2% showed a negative serology and a positive LTT result. Half of them had an early erythema migrans. Following antibiotic treatment, the LTT became negative or borderline in patients with early manifestations of borreliosis, whereas in patients with late symptoms, it showed a regression while still remaining positive. Therefore, we propose the follow-up monitoring of dis-seminated Borrelia infections as the main indication for the Borrelia-LTT.",1534,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In recent years, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis has been on an upward trend also as a result of global warming, not only in our region. In the prospective and also retrospective study we have monitored the representation of individual forms of borreliosis in the set of 476 patients treated for this disease for the period of 22 years (1989-2010). From the total set of 476 patients, the treatment was initiated in the early localized stage in 50.84 % (n = 242), and the disease was diagnosed in the early disseminated stage of Lyme disease in 48.32 % (n = 230). The late disseminated stage of the disease has developed only in 4 cases (0.84 %). We focused on the epidemiological history- information about the tick acquisition was confirmed in 47.68 % (n = 227), the vector of the disease transmission, which is a tick in most cases, the seasonality- the highest number of cases of the disease development was in July and August: 39.92 % of the cases (n = 190), and the locality of the disease development with creating the map of sources of Lyme borreliosis in the northern region of Slovakia.

The transmission cycle involves ticks, deer, small mammalian hosts such as mice, and numerous other species. Levi et al. ( 2012 ) suggested that Canis latrans (Coyote) abundance and Vulpes vulpes (Red Fox) scarcity are strong predictors of Lyme disease cases in eastern North America, with Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) abundance being less important. This suggestion was based on correlations of disease dynamics with human harvests of canids, as it has been suggested that Red Foxes occur at a lower abundance because of Coyote predation. Because Red Foxes are more effective predators of small mammals, the authors of that work contend that the lower Red Fox abundance results in an increase in the incidence of Lyme disease. This paper re-examines the evidence used by Levi at al. ( 2012 ) to reach their conclusions. We address the following points: 1) Levi et al. did not provide data on rodent populations or Lyme disease incidence; 2) Coyotes eat rodents, so a Coyoteinduced reduction of Red Fox populations might not result in increased rodent populations; 3) Coyote harvests are poor indicators of Coyote abundance; 4) both Red Fox numbers and rodent numbers fluctuate dramatically due to factors such as disease and weather; 5) some of the data used by Levi et al. ( 2012 ) were from regions with western Coyotes, while other data were from areas with hybrid eastern Coyotes, thus confounding the situation; and 6) Levi et al. did not consider important alternative hypotheses, such as habitat fragmentation and climate change. Additionally, the historical dynamics of the Lyme disease system are unknown given that Canis lupus lycaon (= Canis lycaon ) (Eastern Wolf) and Urocyon cinereoargenteus (Gray Foxes) originally lived m most of the northeast, while Red Foxes and Coyotes were historically absent from most of the area. We suggest proceeding with caution before concluding that the presence of Coyotes (or the reduction of Red Foxes) is the primary cause of increased incidence of Lyme disease cases m the eastern United States.",2223,0,0,1,0,en,en,

However, the influence of tick-borne pathogens on the energy reserves of the tick vector has not been well studied. The relationship between Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) infection status and fat content in questing Ixodes ricinus nymphs was examined. Nymphs were sampled from the field. Their body mass and fat content were measured, and their Borrelia genospecies infection status (using reverse line blot analysis), and spirochete load (using quantitative PCR) were analysed. Of the 900 nymphs tested, 21.2% were infected with a variety of Borrelia genospecies. Borrelia -infected nymphs had 12.1% higher fat content than uninfected ticks after correcting for body size. For the subset of Borrelia -infected nymphs, no relationship was found between spirochete load and fat content and bioenergetics calculations suggest that Borrelia spirochetes consume a negligible fraction of the tick energy reserves. While the mechanism that causes the association between Borrelia infection and higher fat content in I. ricinus nymphs remains unknown, the present study complements our previous findings that Borrelia -infected nymphs had higher survival times under desiccating conditions and walked less within a humidity gradient.",1352,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Two well-known examples in Western Europe are nephropathia epidemica and Lyme borreliosis.

The causal agents of these diseases are the Puumala hantavirus and the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , respectively. Each disease has a specific transmission mechanism, but there are commonalities in the pathways of these two pathogens. The dynamic nature of vegetated areas and frequent weather anomalies increase the need to understand the links between climate, vegetation and disease. There is a need for innovative ways of monitoring vegetation as determinant of disease risk. This study aims to identify time-variant indicators of vegetation conditions as potential predictors to be used in spatio-temporal disease risk models. The candidate predictors include seasonal growing degree days and vegetation phenology metrics extracted from time series of remotely sensed vegetation indices after the conduction of a wavelet-based multiresolution analysis. The response variable is a local Bayesian estimator of disease risk, calculated from epidemiological data with consideration of spatial stationarity.

Keywords Early localized stage; Early disseminated stage; Tick ; Seasonality; Recreational activity Introduction Lyme borreliosis is the most common disease transmitted by ticks in Slovakia. The number of cases is growing and chronic stages are a menace not only to the patients and physicians, but also to the epidemiologists. Therefore, everybody concerned should try to make the nationwide surveillance of the disease, which we attempted to do also in our region, and it was the result of our 22-year study. The disease is divided into the early stage  localized and disseminated, and the late disseminated stage. The disseminated stages are imitators of many other diseases, so the diagnosis and treatment are more difficult. Objective To divide the set of patients treated with the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis from 1989 to 2010 in the Liptov region by: 1) Individual clinical stages of the disease, 2) Stated vector of the disease, 3) Seasonality of the disease, 4) Activity related to the commencement of the disease, 5) Geographic location of the vector acquisition, i.e. to identify natural sources with creating the map of risk areas in the districts of Ruomberok and Liptovský Mikulá. Material and Methods The Liptov region consists of the districts of Liptovský Mikulá and Ruomberok, with the area of 1,970 square kilometers. Approximately 140,000 inhabitants live in three towns: Liptovský Hrádok, Liptovský Mikulá and Ruomberok, also in 74 villages (the largest are Vaec, Východná, Hybe and Bobrovec). Liptovská Basin (Liptovská kotlina), with a length of 50 km and a maximum width of 15 km, which is enclosed in the mountain rim of surrounding mountains, is the core of the area of Liptov. The northern part of the basin is bordered by the Western Tatras (Západné Tatry) (Roháce), whose ridge to the east from Volovec forms the state border with Poland. Low Tatras (Nízke Tatry) form 80 kms long barrier that separates the Liptov region from the Pohronie region. In the northwest, Liptov is separated from Orava by Chocské Mountains (Chocské vrchy). Liptov altitude ranges from 430 meters (at the confluence of Orava and Váh) to 2,248 meters  the Bystrá mountain in the Western Tatras. In the Liptov region, forests represent a basic landscape and environment stabilization element of the area with 60 % forest cover. The forests cover 130,000 hectares of Liptov. The range of uplands is represented minimally only in the western part of the region  the village Stankovany with oak-hornbeam forests. The submontane zone from 500 to 1,000 m a.s.l., originally covered by beech or beech-fir forests, preserved originally only in the area of Chocské Mountains (Chocské vrchy), is replaced by spruce monocultures in the rest of the area. The forest communities of Chocské Mountains (Chocské vrchy) are composed of 20 % spruce forests, 40% mixed forests and the beech forests only 8% of the protected reserve. Greater incidence of the beech trees is especially in Lubochnianska Valley (Lubochnianska dolina)  up to about 30%. On the southern edges of the mountains, there are submontane meadows, pastures and urbane biotopes (to the north from the town of Ruomberok). With regard to the location and high elevation differences, the climate of the region is very diverse. The warmest part of the Liptovská Basin is near the Váh river, which belongs to the temperate climate with an average annual temperature 6°C. Towards to mountains, the temperature decreases and in the top parts of the mountain ranges it drops to 2 up to -30 degrees Celsius. The area is characterized by a small number of summer days, whose average number per year in the warmest part of the basin is 30. The average rainfall is 737 mm. Lyme borreliosis in Liptov region was diagnosed for the first time in 1989, since then not only diagnostic methods, but also knowledge about the disease itself have undergone a major development. The Ministry of Health of the Slovak Republic determined the procedure of diagnosing and reporting the disease by the Methodical Letter in 1990. From the obtained set of patients we excluded cases with other diagnoses for the possible cross positivity of antibodies (chlamydial infection, herpes simplex, Helicobacter pylori, as well as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis ). We obtained a set of 476 patients treated for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis according to medical documentations of the departments of infectious diseases of the hospitals in the region. We divided the set according to the diagnosed stage of the disease, seasonality, locality of the disease development and work activity of the patient. The diagnosis of borreliosis was established on the basis of comprehensive assessment of epidemiological anamnesis, clinical symptoms and serology of antibody against antigen Borrelia burgdorferi using immune fluorescent method (1989-1995), from 1996 by method ELISA and from 2008 by methodology Western blot. For achieving the objectives of work, we used the following mathematical and statistical methods of data evaluation. Besides the classical calculation of percentage of the observed phenomenon, the frequency of disease is expressed by pro-rata number calculated per 100,000 inhabitants  total morbidity. In assessing the individual morbidity of individual age groups or sexes, the morbidity was calculated per 100,000 inhabitants of the respective age group or sex  specific morbidity. The average annual morbidity was calculated from the average number of diseases calculated for the average number of inhabitants in the respective district. The results of the calculations are numerically presented in the table, graphs and map. In the graphical presentation of the results, the trend is shown in time series of values by a regression line. It expresses the dependence of total morbidity from time with the use of the method of linear regression, where linear dependence of the changes of a dependent variable (morbidity) from the changes of an independent variable (years 1989-2010) was presumed. We compared the values of incidence of the early localized and the early disseminated stage by the two-phase variance t-test. Results Lyme borreliosis is disease with a relatively short history, especially in Slovakia. In the district of Liptovský Mikulá the first case of Lyme borreliosis was diagnosed as late as in 1989, in Ruomberok 2 years later. For the next 22 years the number of cases stopped at the number 476 for both districts, 280 patients in Liptovský Mikulá and 196 cases of the disease in Ruomberok. From the original set we excluded 195 patients with a different disease, for the possible cross positivity of antibodies. Morbidity according to gender was higher in women than in men. From the total number of diagnosed disease women accounted for 62.48% (n=305) and men 37.52% (n=171). The age-specific morbidity analysis for 1989-2010 shows that the most exposed groups were 45 to 54 year old and 35 to 44 year old adults. The average annual morbidity was 21.1 and 18.21. The lowest morbidity was among 0 to 4 years old children. From all clinical stages of the disease on LB we recorded a downward trend in the stage of early localized infection; on the other hand early disseminated stage has a slight upward trend. Both groups have the same mean values (p=0.05). The late disseminated stage is on significant decline, since 1998 was not recorded any disease in this clinical stage (Figure 1). The stage of the early localized infection was the most common and it occurred in 50.84 % (n=242). The early disseminated stage occurred in 48.32% (n=230) of the cases of Lyme borreliosis (p=0.05), the stage of the late disseminated infection only in 0.84 % of the cases (n=4). From the clinical forms of the individual stages, in the stage of the early localized infection erythema migrans occurred in 71.07% (n=172), and the early form was determined in 28.93 % of the cases of the disease (n=70) without the occurrence of erythema with only nonspecific symptoms (Figure 1). From the total number of the early disseminated stages of Lyme borreliosis the musculoskeletal form accounted for 56.09% (n=129) and the neurological form 40.43% (n=93). The articular and neurological form of the early disseminated stage predominated in women, the ocular form occurred only in women. The cutaneous form of the late disseminated stage occurred only in men. The cardiological and ocular form accounted for 1.74% of the diseases of the early disseminated stage of Lyme borreliosis. Affecting the cardiovascular system with Borrelia infection in two men (13-year-old boy, 50-year-old man) and two women clinically manifested itself as myocarditis , pericarditis , then extrasystolia and tachycardia. The ocular form of the infection was in 3 cases caused by chorioretinitis and once by uveitis. Among the neurological forms the most common was cranial nerve paresis  38.70% of the cases (n=36), of which mostly facial nerve paralysis 66.66% (n=24). From other cranial nerves the affected ones were 3 rd cranial nerve (diplopia), trigeminal nerve and statoacoustic nerve. Post-Lyme syndrome with persisting symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, muscle and joint pain, sleep disturbances, cognitive impairment lasting more than one year after an adequate treatment occurred in 10.29% (n=49) (Table 1). In 47.68% (n=227) the tick acquisition was reported, in 4.28 % (n=20) the mosquito bite, in 10.86% (n=51) bite of another biting insect, but up to 36.51% (n=174) of patients did not state the type of the vector (Figure 2). The highest number of cases in the monitored period from 1989 to 2010 was recorded in July and August, 120 manifest diseases, which represented 25,21% of all diseases (Figure 3). In terms of geographic localities, the rural population was most exposed to the assumed infection 56.02% (n=267). (Map) In towns and the nearby area, 31.94 % (n=152) of patients became infected. According to data obtained from medical histories, the majority of tick acquisitions were reported in the town of Liptovský Mikulá (37.89%) and in the town of Liptovský Hrádok (11.58%). From other villages, the percentage of localities of acquisition ranged from 1.05 to 6.32% in Liptovská Sielnica. In the district of Ruomberok, the inhabitants of the town of Ruomberok were most exposed (34.25%). From other villages, the percentage of localities of acquisition ranged from 1.37 to 9.59% in Lubochna and 10.96% in Liptovská Lúna. The acquisition of the tick or other insect in the monitored period according to data from the medical histories of patients occurred during activities related to recreational activity 94.08% (n=448) and work activity in 5.92% (n=28). (Figures 4 and 5). His analysis of morbidity of Lyme borreliosis according to the permanent address of the patients showed the highest average annual morbidity in the district of Liptovský Mikulá - in the villages Prosiek, Malé Borové and Bukovina (92.39; 85.43; 83.97/100,000 inhabitants). In the district of Ruomberok the average annual morbidity was 37.50/100,000 inhabitants in the villages Lubochna and Valaská Dubová 21.85/100,000 inhabitants (Map). Discussion The upward trend of the diseases from 1989 to 2010, i.e. from the beginning of monitoring of the disease in Slovakia as well as the Czech Republic, is confirmed also by monitoring in the catchment area of Liptovský Mikulá [ 1 ]. In the Slovakia-wide scale, this fact was influenced by several factors  improvement of physicians awareness about the new disease, improvement of the warning duty, introduction of new methods, but also by global warming. In 1980s ticks occurred only to the altitude of 800 meters a.s.l. Nowadays they occur also in the altitude of 1200 meters a.s.l. Thanks to the research of the Slovak Academy of Sciences and the Slovak Institute of Parasitology in Koice we have data about ticks infected with Borrelia in mountainous regions of Slovakia [ 2 , 3 ]. The highest detection rate of the disease is in the early stage, which is the most optimistic in terms of success of treatment as well as prognosis of Lyme borreliosis. From clinical stages, in Liptov region the stage of the early localized infection is represented with the highest percentage, which prevails over the early disseminated stage by 2%. In the early stage the prevailing form is erythema migrans in 71%, which corresponds to experience from the published scientific works of domestic as well as foreign authors [ 4 , 5 ]. European countries, also the Czech Republic [ 6 ] are reported in the first place of occurrence of the erythematous form of borreliosis. From the total number of patients treated for Lyme borreliosis, the patients with erythema migrans had the highest representation, and the patients with the musculoskeletal form of the disease in the early disseminated stage were in the second place. The early disseminated stage is on a moderately upward trend also thanks to improvement of diagnostic methods and education of physicians. In the past, the manifestations of the disease were treated as polyarthralgia by other specialists, not by infectologists. In recent years, especially the musculoskeletal form of the early disseminated infection is on an upward trend in women. The actual number of diseases with this diagnosis was twice as high, but for the possible cross positivity of antibodies against other originators of diseases (especially antibodies against chlamydia) we excluded the female patients from the set. In the early disseminated stage of infection, articular symptoms occurred most frequently, contrary to literary quotations, which state that neurological symptoms have a priority representation [ 7 ]. This difference may be due to the occurrence of individual Borrelia genospecies. More than a half of musculoskeletal forms of the disseminated stage of Lyme borreliosis occurred in women. Bennet et al. in the prospective study in Sweden assume the occurrence of unknown mechanisms that determine sex differences in the incidence of the disease, and they explain this difference by the type of an immunological response in postmenopausal women [ 8 ]. A German study also states a higher incidence of neuroborreliosis in females [ 7 ]. In Liptov region the neurological symptoms occurred in the third place, with the highest representation in the male population. In younger age groups the manifestation was especially facial nerve palsy (4-year-old and 9-year old child, 20 to 35-year-old men), whereas older patients experienced symptomatology of vascular encephalopathy (vertigo, hemiparesis). A Swedish study states the proportion of Borrelia infection 65% of all cases of facial nerve palsy in children [ 9 ]. The increased incidence of neuroborreliosis in children is caused by the vector acquisition in the upper part of the body and a quicker dissemination of the pathogen than in adult patients [ 10 ]. There was also an occurrence of 2 nd and 3 rd cranial nerve palsies, and rare auditory nerve palsy, which was also underdiagnosed like the ocular forms of the disease. A case of 20-year-old man was interesting, in whom the infection manifested itself by a sudden psychotic state, which completely disappeared after parenteral administration of 3 rd generation cephalosporins. The ocular forms were recorded only in 4 cases, and certainly their number in the ophthalmology outpatient departments is underdiagnosed and they escape the attention. The late disseminated stage is declining significantly, no case has been recorded since 1998, and this downward trend is an optimistic confirmation especially of the higher level of laboratory and clinical diagnostics of the disease in earlier stages. Only 5 patients were treated in the stage of the late persistent infection, with the cutaneous form of ACA only men, and neurological manifestations occurred in both sexes. The severity of Lyme borreliosis is conditioned by the variability of genetic information of Borrelia and long persistence in the body. The persistence of symptoms may be caused also by a late diagnosis of the disease, insufficient duration of treatment, bacterial persistence and autoimmune mechanisms (molecular mimicry) [ 11 ]. The picture of the disease is induced by taxonomically distinct types of Borrelia, of which there are several species in Europe. Data from European studies point out the correlation of three genotypes of B. burgdorferi s.l. with clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Infections caused by B. burgdorferi s.s. are associated with specific arthritic symptoms, B. afzeli with cutaneous manifestations and B. garinii with neurological manifestations. Generally speaking, all Borrelias can produce all known manifestations of this infection [ 2 ]. A dominant marker of epidemiology of Lyme borreliosis is a tick Ixodes ricinus, in which infection with Borrelia varies considerably in different localities which can explain the cause of differences in morbidity also within the districts of the Liptov region. Moreover, an important role is played also by geographical conditions of the country (Liptovský Mikulá is a town built directly in the natural scenery) and activities of the population. Liptov region is known for its attractive leisure activities, and thanks to high attendance there is also a good chance of the disease transmission to other districts of Slovakia. The geographical conditions of our region have undergone major changes not only due to the change of climatic conditions (higher incidence of windstorms in recent years due to climatic changes). As a result of the political changes and the change of the ownership of forests and land, many areas are no longer maintained and they overgrow with bushes where ticks have an increased all-season activity. Slovak authors mention 16 kinds of animals as reservoirs of Borrelia burgdorferi in Europe. They include also domestic animals (dogs, cats, horses, cattle and other) [ 12 ]. At least in two cases the medical history included data about the possibility of Borrelia transmission during the contact with domestic animals. Due to the retrospective study, the objectivity of data is limited by details recorded in the medical history. In recent years, there is a growing number of dog breeders who may also became infected with borreliosis when removing insected ticks (in 2010 and 2011 we recorded the repeated incidence of 1st stage of Lyme borreliosis acquired in this way). Another possibility of a greater exposure of women to infected ticks is using the cosmetic products with a higher insect affinity and spending time in nature with children. Data from the medical histories of patients in our region are consistent with the data of various authors about the dominant role of ticks as vectors of Lyme borreliosis transmission. Exposure to ticks was reported by nearly a half of the patients with Lyme borreliosis (47.7%). The contact with other species of hematophageous insects in 15.14% is not insignificant as well. Several authors state the possible transmission of Lyme borreliosis by mosquitos, horseflies, Stomoxyidae, etc. [ 12 ]. The high percentage of patients with a diagnosed Lyme borreliosis did not state the vector of transmission (36.51%), Borrelias could be transmitted by an unnoticed vector (nymphs and larvae of Ixodes ricinus, Stomoxyidae), but also through other possible routes of transmission which are still in the stage of scientific research. The possibility of incomplete epidemiological history data in the retrospective part of the study is not insignificant as well. Relaxation of people in the natural environment is one of the most common activities associated with the risk of exposure to the vector of Lyme borreliosis transmission. This information is confirmed by the transmission of infection during the relaxation activity in 94.08%. The occupational exposure accounts for 5.92% of the cases of the disease. Low values correspond to the composition of the forests in our region, which are predominantly coniferous. Broad-leaved forests are mainly in the western part of the district of Ruomberok, and the occupational exposure was confirmed exactly in this area (forest worker, woodsman). Information about the possibility of exposure in the urban environment in Liptov region is also in accord with experience of domestic and foreign authors, which is proved by 31.94% of diseases with a history of an insect (tick) acquisition in the town. The diffuse character of Borrelia expansion in the urban environment has been confirmed also by other authors [ 10 , 13 ]. The high incidence of Borrelia was recorded also by the employees of the Slovak Institute of Parasitology in Koice under the supervision doc. Petko in Koice town parks [ 2 ]. The seasonal influence on the incidence of the diseases was also confirmed in the districts of Liptovský Mikulá and Ruomberok. The highest Lyme borreliosis morbidity was in July and August. Especially the incidence of the early localized stage is subject to the seasonal influences. In the past 10 years, due to the climatic changes, ticks are active already in March, and their activity lasts until November in bushes that are not maintained, without a drop in activity in the summer months observed in the past. The high incidence of the disease in the summer months closely correlates with leisure activities recreational activities during the summer holidays. Regional differences in the incidence of the individual genospecies were found in the studies focused on detection of B. burgdorferi s.l. in the city park in Prague, in South Bohemia, Moravia and the Carpathians in Slovakia [ 2 , 12 ]. The endemic genospecies in Bohemia is B. garinii [ 12 ]. In Slovakia, 71% infectedness of ticks with one genospecies prevails, and the most common is B. garinii (42.4%), then B. burgdorferi s.s. (15.2%). Similarly, B. garinii prevails in Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Scandinavia or Belgium. B. afzeli was documented most frequently in Austria, Russia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic. These results confirm the significant geographic variability of distribution of Lyme borreliosis originators in Europe [ 5 , 14 ]. The European form of this infection is quite significantly different from the American form, where infections are caused by B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, which is homogeneous, while in Europe the complex B. burgdorferi sensu lato is genetically divergent [ 12 ]. The picture of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is not known in the USA, differences are also in frequency and spectrum of neuroborrelioses. In Europe, Borrelias are more disseminated, the infection may arise already 7 hours after a tick bite, especially in the areas where ticks are highly infected with Borrelia [ 13 ]. We know from our own experience that Lyme borreliosis is significantly underdiagnosed. In the mountainous areas, where medical care is remote, patients do not visit a physician and they are treated symptomatically by a natural therapy. Often they do not notice erythema on the skin, they attribute joint pain to rheumatism and they use phytotherapy. By education of the primary care physicians, we can significantly contribute to reduction of the disseminated forms of the disease. Conclusion In the region of northern Slovakia, the most common form of Lyme borreliosis is the early localized stage-erythema migrans and musculoskeletal form of the early disseminated stage. The vector of transmission of the disease is a tick Ixodes ricinus, but other vectors are not insignificant as well. Most frequently the disease developed in July and August, during the recreational activities of persons. The sources of the infection are in the north and west of Liptov region.

Johnson, Schmid, Hyde, Steigerwalt, and Brenner (hereafter B. burgdorferi ).

Many neurological diseases show differences between genders. We studied gender differences in childhood Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) in an endemic area of Lyme borreliosis in Norway. Methods . In a population based study, all children (<14 years of age) with symptoms suspicious of LNB, including all children with acute facial nerve palsy, were evaluated for LNB by medical history, clinical examination, blood tests, and lumbar puncture. LNB was diagnosed according to international criteria. Results . 142 children were diagnosed with LNB during 2001–2009. Facial nerve palsy was more common in girls (86%) than in boys (62%) , but headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom was more common in boys (30%) than in girls (10%) . The girls were younger than boys and had a shorter duration of symptoms, but boys had a higher level of pleocytosis than girls. In a multivariate analysis, both gender and having headache and neck stiffness were associated with a higher level of pleocytosis. Conclusion . Girls and boys have different clinical presentations of LNB, and boys have a higher level of inflammation than girls independent of the clinical presentation. 1. Introduction. Lyme borreliosis (LB) is caused by the infection of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (BB) transmitted to humans during bites of BB infected Ixodes ticks. BB has strong invading properties into different human tissues and LB is a multisystem disorder with three clinical time related stages including dermatological, neurological, and rheumatological symptoms [ 1 ]. The three main human-pathogen BB genotypes identified in European Ixodes ticks, B. afzelii , B. garinii , and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, are found to have specific tissue preferences in humans. B. afzelii is mainly dermatotropic, B. garinii is mainly neurotropic, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is mainly arthrogenic. In US, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto is the only genotype identified. However, all organ manifestations may develop in LB infected patients with any of the different BB human-pathogen genotypes [ 2 ]. LB is the most frequent tick borne infection in Europe and the northern hemisphere. Erythema migrans (EM), the local and first stage of LB, is the most prevalent LB manifestation [ 1 , 3 ]. Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) develops when the BB spirochete disseminates from the tick bite area and invades and affects the nerve system and is the most frequent second stage manifestation of LB in Europe [ 1 , 4 ]. The incidence of LNB is higher in children than in adults [ 3 ], and, in a European region endemic for LB, LNB was the most common reason for childhood infectious meningitis [ 5 ]. In USA, a male predominance has been reported in adult LB [ 6 ]. This male predominance has been even more accentuated in children. In an early epidemiological study from the east coast of USA, LB was named the disease of “little boys” [ 7 ]. In Europe, with a more variety of BB genotypes, a slightly female predominance has been reported in LB in general and in EM in particular [ 8 , 9 ]. However, in a recent comprehensive study of Slovenian adults focusing on different organ manifestations, a male predominance was found in Lyme arthritis and LNB [ 9 ]. There are few strict population based studies reporting on LNB and gender in children. However, in a comprehensive German study from 1993, the prevalence of LNB in children was twice as high in boys than in girls [ 10 ]. South Rogaland, Norway, is an endemic area of LB suitable for epidemiological studies of LNB in children. In population based single centre studies, we have previously reported epidemiological and clinical findings in children with LNB [ 11 , 12 ], facial nerve palsy (FNP) [ 13 ], and Lyme meningitis [ 5 ]. The aim of this present study was to study the impact of gender on clinical and laboratory characteristics of LNB in children. 2. Material and Methods. 2.1. Study Area. The coastal area of Rogaland County of the southwest part of Norway is an endemic area of LB, and the incidence of LNB in children is earlier reported among the highest in Europe [ 11 ]. The population of South Rogaland, Norway, includes approximately children less than 14 years of age, and the Paediatric Department at Stavanger University Hospital receives all hospital admissions for acute childhood disease in this area (with an upper age limit of 14 years). 2.2. Patients and Testing Procedures. Prior to the study period, all general practitioners and otorhinolaryngologists in the region received a letter recommending that all children under 14 years of age with acute facial nerve palsy (FNP) should be referred immediately to the Paediatric Department. All children aged 3 months to 14 years during the study period 2001–2009 with symptoms suspicious of LNB, including all children with FNP were evaluated systematically, including medical history, clinical examination, blood tests, and lumbar puncture. In addition, medical records from all children admitted to the hospital during the study period with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis were identified from the hospital records and studied retrospectively. Data regarding gender, age at diagnosis, year and month of admission, number of days from onset of symptoms to admission, clinical symptoms, and results of blood and CSF tests were registered. Clinical symptoms were considered as not present if not mentioned in the medical record. The study was population based, and only children living in South Rogaland were included. During the whole study period, in all children with symptoms suspicious of LNB, serum and CSF were analysed for BB IgM antibodies using the Enzygnost Lyme Borreliosis ELISA test (Dade Behring, Siemens, Germany). BB IgG antibodies were measured by the Enzygnost Borrelia IgG test from 2001 to July 2006 and thereafter by Enzygnost LymeLink IgG (Dade Behring, Siemens, Germany). We used the Lyme neuroborreliosis Dako test for detection of intrathecal antibody production defined as antibody index (AI) (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Additional microbiological tests were performed when clinically indicated. White blood cell (WBC) count in CSF was analysed by Adiva 120 (Bayer) or Fuchs Rosenthal chamber (<30 × 10 6 /L) from 2001 to July 2007 and thereafter by XE-5000 (Sysmex). CSF proteins were analysed by Modular (Roche). The registry data used in this study were anonymous, and therefore a separate ethical license for the study was not obtained. The study was approved by the Privacy Protection Supervisor of the Hospital. 2.3. Definitions. Pleocytosis was defined as CSF WBC count >7 × 10 6 /L, according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines [ 14 ]. LNB was diagnosed in children with neurological symptoms suggestive of LNB with the presence of CSF pleocytosis and BB antibodies and/or EM. Confirmed LNB was defined when intrathecal BB antibody production was proven. Probable LNB was defined if BB antibody in serum and/or EM were found in addition to typical symptoms. Definitions were in accordance with the updated European recommendations [ 15 ]. FNP was defined as an acute palsy involving the facial muscles in both upper and lower parts of the face, either unilateral or bilateral. Children were diagnosed with headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom if they had no other signs of neurological involvement, anorexia or fever. 2.4. Statistics. Differences in numbers between groups were analysed by the Chi-square test. Comparisons of continuous data between groups were done by the nonparametric Mann-Whitney -test, and the results are presented as median and quartiles. Variance was tested by Levene’s test for equality of variances. The influence of gender and covariates on clinical and laboratory outcomes were analysed by linear regression analyses. Each explanatory variable was first analyzed in simple regression models and in a fully adjusted model. All variables were further included in a backward stepwise multiple regression analyses. The final model included variables significant at the 5% level and interaction was tested for. All analyses were 2 tailed, and data were analysed using the IBM-SPSS statistical package (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 22.0, Armonk, NY; IBM Corp.). 3. Results. As published earlier, in total, 142 children aged 3 months to 14 years were diagnosed with LNB and included in the study, giving an annual incidence of [ 5 ].

There was no difference in the total rate between genders, neither for all children nor for children with confirmed or probable LNB (Table 2 ). However, FNP was more common in girls than in boys with LNB. The total rate of children with headache and neck stiffness did not differ between genders, but headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom was more common in boys than in girls (Table 2 ).

Table 2 Differences in numbers and clinical and laboratorial characteristics between boys and girls in 142 children hospitalized with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) at Stavanger University Hospital during 2001–2009. The girls diagnosed with LNB were younger than the boys, but the distribution of age did not differ between genders (Table 2 ). The girls had a shorter duration of symptoms before admission than boys. The CSF cellular pattern was available in 139/142 children, and 137/139 had predominantly mononuclear cells. All children with LNB were diagnosed from April to December and there was no difference in the monthly distribution between genders. The median levels of CSF WBC were higher in boys than in girls, whereas the levels of CSF protein and CSF glucose did not differ between genders. Further, the proportion of children with positive BB antibodies in serum or CSF or with a positive BB index did not differ between genders (Table 2 ). By univariate linear regression analyses, gender, having facial palsy, or having headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom was associated with the level of WBC in CSF, whereas duration of symptoms and age were not associated with the level of WBC (Table 3 ). In the multivariate analysis, both gender and having headache and neck stiffness remained associated with the level of CSF WBC in the final model (Table 3 ).

Table 3 Linear regression model with cerebrospinal fluid white blood count as dependent variable in 142 children hospitalized with Lyme neuroborreliosis at Stavanger University Hospital during 2001–2009. In a multivariate analysis with duration of symptoms before admittance as outcome, FNP was associated with the duration of symptoms ( (−18.9, −10), ), whereas gender and headache and neck stiffness were not associated with the duration of symptoms (data not shown), meaning that gender did not have an independent effect on the duration of symptoms before admittance. 4. Discussion. In this single centre population based study which is among the largest studies of childhood LNB in Europe, we found genders differences in childhood LNB not reported earlier. There was no difference in the total incidence between genders, but there were significant differences in the clinical presentation of LNB between girls and boys. A striking finding was that girls more often had FNP than boys, whereas boys more often had headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom. Boys had a higher level of inflammation in CSF, and gender and headache and neck stiffness were associated with the level of CSF WBC in a multivariate regression analyses. Girls were younger and had a shorter duration of symptoms before admission, but only FNP was associated with the duration of symptoms before admission in the multivariate regression analyses. The epidemiological results and conclusions in our study depend on a correct diagnosis of LNB. We based the diagnosis on the most updated European case definitions [ 15 ]. According to these case definitions, demonstration of CSF pleocytosis is mandatory for the diagnosis of LNB. In contrast to our results, several other studies report LNB to be more common in boys than in girls [ 3 , 10 , 16 , 17 ]. A male predominance in LNB was recently reported in a comprehensive study in adult patients from Slovenia, where 61% of patients with LNB were male [ 9 ]. In a Swedish study of patients of all ages, 62% were male; however, the proportion among children was not specified [ 18 ]. Compared to other studies, we found a higher proportion of girls with LNB and they had FNP more commonly. The female predominance of FNP in children with LNB in the present study has not been reported previously to our knowledge. The opposite was reported in a small prospective German study, with 11 of 16 consecutive children with FNP and LNB being boys [ 19 ]. We have previously reported the highest incidence of FNP in children in Europe [ 5 ]. Children in the study area with FNP were admitted to the Paediatric Department without delay, and a lumbar puncture was performed. To our knowledge, no other studies have used this diagnostic approach [ 17 ]. The need for a lumbar puncture for the diagnosis of LNB in children with FNP is still under debate [ 20 , 21 ]. However, depending on serological blood tests only, high numbers of false negative tests are likely [ 11 , 22 ]. With our diagnostic routine, we consider the number of children diagnosed with LNB to be close to the true incidence. In general, LNB is more common in children than in adults, and the frequency of FNP is more common in children than in adult patients with LNB in Europe [ 3 , 23 ]. Furthermore, Berglund et al. observed that children more often had tick bites in the head and neck region compared to adults, possibly explaining these findings [ 3 ]. This may relate to the tick behaviour, questing on average 50 cm above the ground [ 24 ]. When playing, children may expose their head and neck to grass and bushes in a different way than adults, and a tick bite in this region may have a higher tendency to result in FNP. Possibly, due to longer hair, girls may be more exposed to BB by catching up questing ticks and thereafter cover the ticks more effectively than in boys with short hair. This may contribute to a higher proportion of girls presenting with FNP due to LNB, but this needs to be further studied. If LNB with FNP is more common in girls as our results suggest, our aggressive approach to children with FNP may have included more girls with LBN compared to other studies, thereby equalizing the male predominance in children with LNB found in other studies. Headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom with absence of other neurological signs has also been shown by others to be a common presentation of childhood LNB [ 17 ], which may represent symptoms of meningeal inflammation. This is the first study to show a male predominance in this clinical subgroup of childhood LNB, but the reason for this is not known. Different genospecies of BB may give different clinical presentations of LNB, and all of the human pathogenetic BB gene-species have been detected in questing ticks from a nearby area to the study area [ 25 ]. Strle and his group have reported a male predominance in B. garinii skin infections [ 9 ]. Furthermore, different gene-species of BB are reported to give different clinical presentations of LNB as demonstrated in a study of adult patients with LNB [ 2 ]. In that study, B. garinii was more common in CSF in patients with typical early LNB with painful meningoradiculoneuritis (Bannwarth syndrome), whereas B. afzelii was more common in patients with less specific manifestations of LNB. A speculation could be that the difference in clinical presentation between girls and boys in our study could to some extent be due to different gender disposition for infection with different BB genospecies. However, it has not yet been studied if different genospecies of BB have any gender preferences in children with LNB. We also found a higher level of CSF inflammation in boys, independent of the clinical presentation. BB produces no toxins and the manifestations of LB and LNB are probably mainly a result of the immune response of the host [ 26 , 27 ]. In general, the immune system may show differences between genders on a DNA sequence level and on a secondary epigenetic genome regulation level [ 28 ]. Furthermore, specific immune responses differ between genders with age, as a result of changing levels of sex steroid hormones through the dynamic interaction with the immune system [ 29 ]. Possibly, this could partly explain the observed sex-specific infection rates in humans, even in LNB. In postmenopausal women, a T-helper lymphocyte type 2 (Th2) pattern was associated with a higher tendency for reinfection with borreliosis, compared to men [ 30 ]. Also, the CSF cytokine pattern beyond the acute stage of LNB is associated with a Th2 response [ 31 ]. Atopy is considered to be a Th2-driven immunopathy, and during childhood atopic disease is more common in boys. We could speculate if this may be related to a more generalised and stronger immune response in boys with LNB, but this has to be further studied. Further, headache and/or neck stiffness as the only clinical presentation was also independently related to the level of CSF inflammation, suggesting a pathophysiological link. It has been speculated that the dissemination of BB in LNB may differ between meningoradiculitis and more diffuse meningitis [ 4 ]. Both Bannwarth’s syndrome and FNP may be the result of a local invasion of the spirochete in the nerve root, whereas general meningitis may be the result of haematogenous spread [ 4 , 32 ]. This may result in differences both in clinical presentation and in laboratory results, as shown in our study. How this is related to gender needs further studies. The retrospective design of the study may to some extent weaken the quality of the clinical characteristics recorded in the medical records. Data about clinical symptoms are based on parents’ and physicians’ observations, and some of these variables may be less reliable in younger children. However, we focused on objective variables as FNP, and laboratory results are independent of the retrospective design. It is in our opinion a strength of the study that uniform and extensive procedures to identify and diagnose children with LNB were introduced in the region before the study period and were performed consistently during this period. 5. Conclusion. In this single centre population based study of children with LNB, we found that FNP was a more common presentation in girls, whereas headache and/or neck stiffness as the only symptom was more common in boys. Boys had a higher level of CSF inflammation, independent of the clinical presentation. The interplay between the properties of ticks and BB genospecies and children causing Lyme borreliosis is complex. The observed differences between genders may be of importance for the understanding of the pathophysiology in LNB. Conflict of Interests.

The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) in Europe is based on clinical symptoms and laboratory data, such as pleocytosis and anti- Borrelia antibodies in serum and CSF according to guidelines. However, the decision to start antibiotic treatment on admission cannot be based on Borrelia serology since results are not available at the time of lumbar puncture. Therefore, an early prediction test would be useful in clinical practice. The aim of the study was to develop and evaluate a clinical prediction test for children with LNB in a relevant European setting. Method. Clinical and laboratory data were collected retrospectively from a cohort of children being evaluated for LNB in Southeast Sweden. A clinical neuroborreliosis prediction test, the NeBoP score, was designed to differentiate between a high and a low risk of having LNB. The NeBoP score was then prospectively validated in a cohort of children being evaluated for LNB in Central and Southeast Sweden ( n = 190) and controls with other specific diagnoses ( n = 49). Results. The sensitivity of the NeBoP score was 90 % (CI 95 %; 82–99 %) and the specificity was 90 % (CI 95 %; 85–96 %). Thus, the diagnostic accuracy (i.e. how the test correctly discriminates patients from controls) was 90 % and the area under the curve in a ROC analysis was 0.95. The positive predictive value (PPV) was 0.83 (CI 95 %; 0.75–0.93) and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 0.95 (CI 95 %; 0.90–0.99). Conclusion. The overall diagnostic performance of the NeBoP score is high (90 %) and the test is suggested to be useful for decision-making about early antibiotic treatment in children being evaluated for LNB in European Lyme endemic areas.",1711,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi . When untreated, infection may spread to the heart, nervous system, and joints. Cardiac involvement usually manifests as abnormalities of the conduction system and bradycardia. Treatment of Lyme disease is generally effective, with a subset of patients experiencing persistent, sometimes long-term symptoms called posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome. 1. Background. Lyme disease is a multistage infectious disease caused by infection with the spirochete bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi [ 1 ]. Early Lyme disease is characterized by the hallmark skin lesion called erythema migrans (EM) [ 1 ]. In approximately 20% of patients, the EM rash may not be present or may not be recognized [ 2 ]. Without the typical skin lesion, the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease overlap with a nonspecific viral infection that includes fatigue, fever, chills, and malaise. If untreated, B. burgdorferi may disseminate through the bloodstream resulting in joint, neurologic, and cardiac involvement. Objective manifestations of early dissemination may include multiple skin lesions, joint synovitis, meningitis, or carditis [ 1 ]. However, in the absence of objective organ system involvement, a subset of patients may only present with fatigue, sweats, malaise, and arthralgia [ 3 ]. The prognosis of Lyme disease is generally very good, especially when treated in the localized EM stage. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS) may occur after antibiotic treatment of any stage of Lyme disease and is associated with ongoing symptoms of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints. These symptoms may wax, wane, and persist for years and may be mild or, in other cases, can result in a significant decline in health-related quality of life [ 4 ]. The known risk factors for PTLDS include greater severity of initial disease, presence of initial neurologic involvement, delay in diagnosis and treatment, and the persistence of symptoms after the completion of initial antibiotic therapy [ 5 , 6 ]. The pathophysiology of and effective therapy for PTLDS is the subject of ongoing research [ 7 , 8 ]. 2. Case Presentation. A previously healthy 48-year-old woman living in rural Maryland presented in early June with a two-week history of neck pain, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, and intermittent fevers and chills. She was concerned that she might have Lyme disease because of tick bites in the past and ongoing recreational exposure to ticks but did not recall a tick bite in the weeks preceding the onset of her illness. A tentative diagnosis of a viral illness, possibly mononucleosis, was made during an initial visit to her primary care physician. She presented to the emergency room the following day with worsening neck pain, stiffness, and myalgia and was admitted for dehydration and further evaluation. Physical exam showed a temperature of 101.1°F, pulse 101 beats per minute, and a new oval nonpainful red rash on her left hip which was attributed to a drug reaction (Figure 1 ). Laboratory evaluation of complete blood count (CBC) showed a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 4.9·10 3 U/L with 8% lymphocytes and a low absolute lymphocyte count of 400 U/L. A comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) showed an abnormal AST of 245 U/L, ALT of 218 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase of 215 U/L. A CT scan of the head without contrast was negative. A lumbar puncture showed one white blood cell, normal protein, a normal glucose level, negative bacterial culture, and negative Lyme antibodies in the CSF. Her blood cultures, hepatitis serology, and influenza A and B were also negative. The Epstein-Barr virus serology was interpreted as consistent with either late primary infection or reactivation of mononucleosis with a (+) IgG antibody, (−) IgM, and (+) EBNA. She was discharged with a diagnosis of mononucleosis due to EBV and recommendations for symptomatic care. A Lyme serology was sent with pending results at the time of discharge that subsequently showed no ELISA done, (+) IgM Western blot, and (−) IgG Western blot. Figure 1 The patient noted an oval nonpainful red skin lesion on her left hip which was attributed to a drug reaction. Over the next 4 weeks, she had waxing and waning symptoms of fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and anorexia. She developed new complaints of difficulty finding words and trouble concentrating, especially with reading. The original skin lesion on her hip enlarged, and new skin lesions appeared on her left lower leg and stomach. She was treated with Keflex for a presumed bacterial cellulitis. The rash did not respond to the antibiotics but eventually resolved over a period of weeks. Over the next week, she developed increasing exertional dyspnea when climbing stairs, anxiety, and chest heaviness. The patient also noted an irregular heart beat and that, on one occasion, her pulse rate was 31 bpm. She felt like she was going to pass out and returned to the emergency department 6 weeks after her initial visit for further evaluation. There, she was noted to be bradycardic with a pulse rate in the 40’s. The admitting EKG showed sinus tachycardia with new onset second-degree AV block with 2 : 1 conduction (Figure 2 ). The chest X-ray was normal, and a transthoracic echocardiogram did not show any valvular or structural abnormalities, with an ejection fraction of sixty percent. Her repeat Lyme ELISA was positive, and WB came back with all three IgM bands positive, and IgG was positive for eight out of ten bands, confirming the diagnosis of Lyme disease with carditis. The AST and ALT were normal at 29 U/L and 44 U/L, respectively. Following treatment with three doses of ceftriaxone, the AV block resolved while in the hospital, and she was discharged on a 3-week course of doxycycline. Figure 2 The patient’s admitting EKG showing sinus tachycardia with second-degree AV block with 2 : 1 conduction. After treatment with 21 days of doxycycline, the patient had resolution of her shortness of breath and palpitations and had gradual improvement in her symptoms of fever, headache, and anorexia. She remained fatigued and had increasing problems with insomnia. There was also ongoing trouble with word finding, focusing, and concentrating. A stress test showed above-average exercise capacity with no arrhythmia. She developed new symptoms of bursitis in hips, coldness in hands, shooting pains in arms, and numbness in hands and feet. She stated that she “feels like a 90-year-old woman” with hip and knee pain and remained out of work from July to September. Ten weeks after completion of her doxycycline, an infectious disease consultation was obtained for evaluation of her ongoing fatigue, hip pain, paresthesias, and difficulty with concentration. The consult felt as though the original EBV serologies were consistent with remote exposure and not an acute infection. Additionally, the patient’s ongoing symptoms following successful treatment of her Lyme carditis were due to slowly resolving symptoms from her previously treated Lyme disease. A repeat convalescent Lyme serology performed by Quest diagnostics was negative, with a positive ELISA and IgM western blot, but a negative IgG western blot with four bands. The CBC, CMP, sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein were normal. Seven months after completion of the antibiotic treatment for her Lyme carditis, the patient sought a second opinion for her continued symptoms and resulting substantial reduction in her ability to function at work and home. The patient had no evidence of other tick-borne infection or other medical causes of her fatigue and musculoskeletal pain. Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America case definition, she was diagnosed with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome. Eighteen months after resolution of her Lyme carditis, she is working full time and continues to report her pain and fatigue levels as a 4/10, which she rates as mildly disrupting her work, social, and family life. 3. Discussion. Posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome is a well-described constellation of symptoms that may follow the treatment of any stage of Lyme disease [ 1 ]. The illness is characterized by symptoms of fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and cognitive complaints that persist for at least 6 months after completion of standard antibiotic therapy of well-documented Lyme disease [ 9 ]. As our case illustrates, complex symptoms such as shooting pains, numbness, and tingling may also occur. A published case definition of PTLDS by the Infectious Diseases Society of America proposes that the symptoms should be of significant severity such that they impact daily functioning [ 9 ]. As was the case for our patient, symptoms may be severe for months, resulting in loss of work and significant social and personal loss in quality of life. Our patient’s manifestations have persisted for over 18 months, which is consistent with other reports of chronic symptoms lasting over a decade, especially in patients with disseminated infection and a delay in initial antibiotic therapy [ 10 ]. The diagnosis of PTLDS is made by recognizing the onset of symptoms of fatigue, pain, and cognitive difficulties following a documented case of appropriately treated Lyme disease. Persisting symptoms for 6 months or longer that interfere with quality of life are consistent with PTLDS [ 9 ]. Serology at the time of the PTLDS diagnosis may be negative, as immune memory for remote infection wanes over time after treatment [ 11 ]. Because serology is not diagnostic for PTLDS, other conditions that may explain the patient’s symptoms must be excluded by a complete evaluation. Risk factors for PTLDS include greater severity of initial disease prior to treatment of Lyme disease, delay in diagnosis, and the presence of neurologic manifestations [ 6 ]. Our patient is one of the first reported cases of PTLDS following Lyme carditis. The patient’s carditis was well documented with a presentation of heart block that resolved quickly after the administration of appropriate antibiotics. In a prospective study of patients with EM who were not treated, 1% of patients developed carditis with evidence of AV nodal block [ 12 ]. Clinical symptoms that are most commonly reported with Lyme carditis other than conduction disturbances are lightheadedness, palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain, and syncope. The manifestations of carditis, including heart block, respond quickly to antibiotic therapy. The development of carditis is hypothesized to be a risk factor for PTLDS because it ensues during the disseminated phase of infection, which is more likely to occur when there is a delay in diagnosis. This expectation is consistent with other recently reported cases of carditis, in which a delay in diagnosis resulted in death [ 12 , 13 ]. The delayed diagnosis in our patient points out several pitfalls in the diagnosis of early Lyme disease. The EM rash is a single or multiple expanding round or oval lesion that does not have the typical diffuse maculopapular rash seen in EBV or viral exanthems. The diagnosis is challenging when the diagnostic rash either does not develop or lacks the stereotypical bull’s eye appearance and is misattributed to other causes, such as a drug reaction as was seen in our patient. In these instances, which account for approximately 20% of cases, flu-like symptoms may be attributed to a viral illness [ 14 ]. One often overlooked clue in the diagnosis of atypical presentations of early Lyme disease are seasonal and geographic hints in the presenting history. For example, viral respiratory illnesses concentrate in the winter months, while tick-borne illnesses occur primarily in the warm months of the year [ 15 ]. Geographic risk factors are especially important in consideration of zoonosis and vector-borne infections where the geographic resident or travel history often points to a specific differential diagnosis. In the United States, Lyme disease is highly endemic in the Great Lakes region and the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States. Laboratory findings, especially CBC results, can be helpful in narrowing the diagnosis of viral-like symptoms. In the case presented, there should have been a degree of caution in attributing the patient’s initial illness to EBV, given the lack of lymphocytosis and absence of atypical lymphocytes. While false-positivity can occur with Lyme disease assays when a patient has an infection with EBV, in retrospect, this patient did not have evidence of acute EBV infection. Conversely, a recent report documents two cases where early disseminated Lyme disease caused false-positive serology for EBV infection [ 16 ]. The presence of a normal total WBC count is typical for Lyme disease, a distinction from other bacterial infections where leukocytosis and increased polymorphonuclear cells are characteristically seen [ 17 ]. However, prolonged nonrespiratory symptoms are atypical in uncomplicated viral infections and, in the appropriate geographic setting, should suggest Lyme disease. Conflicts of Interest.

Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is carried to human hosts by infected ticks. There are nearly 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC each year, with 3-4% of those cases reporting Lyme carditis. The most common manifestation of Lyme carditis is partial heart block following bacterial-induced inflammation of the conducting nodes. Here we report a 45-year-old gentleman that presented to the hospital with intense nonradiating chest pressure and tightness. Lab studies were remarkable for elevated troponins. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with mild ST elevations. Three weeks prior to hospital presentation, patient had gone hunting near Madison. One week prior to admission, he noticed an erythematous lesion on his right shoulder. Because of his constellation of history, arthralgias, and carditis, he was started on ceftriaxone to treat probable Lyme disease. This case illustrates the importance of thorough history taking and extensive physical examination when assessing a case of possible acute myocardial infarction. Because Lyme carditis is reversible, recognition of this syndrome in young patients, whether in the form of AV block, myocarditis, or acute myocardial ischemia, is critical to the initiation of appropriate antibiotics in order to prevent permanent heart block, or even death. 1. Case Presentation. A 45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the hospital with left sided chest pain that did not radiate. For the four days prior to admission, patient had a nondocumented fever, diffuse muscle aches, neck and back stiffness, headache, chills, diaphoresis, and nausea. He denied photophobia, blurry vision, sore throat, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. On the morning of hospital admission, he woke up with intense chest pressure, relieved with nitroglycerin given in the Emergency Department. On examination, patient was in no acute distress and alert and oriented to person, place, and time. His temperature was 37.7°C, pulse 95 beats/minute, blood pressure 135/74, respiratory rate 24 per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Cardiac examination demonstrated normal rate, with no murmurs rubs or gallops. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. Skin exam revealed a 4 × 3 cm erythematous, targetoid bulls-eye lesion on his right shoulder (Figure 1 ). Figure 1 Bulls-eye targetoid rash on patient’s right shoulder. Labs were obtained and were remarkable for creatine kinase 113 U/L (normal 52–336 U/L), CK-MB 4.6 ng/mL (normal < or = 7.7 ng/mL), and troponin T 0.091 ng/mL (normal < 0.01 ng/mL). CBC and LFTs were within normal limits. EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm with mild ST elevations in the inferior and high lateral leads and Q waves in III and aVF (Figure 2 ). Following EKG, he was taken for left heart catheterization. Left coronary angiogram revealed normal coronaries. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed normal ejection fraction and no wall motion abnormalities or effusion. Further laboratory workup included Lyme titers and confirmatory Western blot analysis which were positive with Lyme IgG/IgM = 1.30 (normal < 0.90). Figure 2 EKG showing normal sinus rhythm, inferior infarct, and ST elevation in inferior leads. Three weeks prior to hospital presentation, the patient had gone hunting near Madison. One week prior to admission, he noticed an erythematous lesion on his right shoulder. It had progressed from a small bug bite to a larger, 4 × 3 cm erythematous, painless, nonpruritic, targetoid bull-eyes rash. Because of his constellation of history, arthralgias, and carditis, Infectious Disease was consulted and he was treated empirically for Lyme carditis with ceftriaxone 2.0 grams IV daily. He was also followed with repeat EKG every two days to monitor AV blocks. Prior to discharge, he was switched to oral doxycycline therapy as recommended by Infectious Disease. His symptoms improved and his liver function tests normalized after treatment. 2. Discussion. Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is carried to human hosts by infected ticks. Borrelia burgdorferi is a member of the spirochete family and survives within a vector, the Ixodes tick. There are nearly 30,000 cases of Lyme disease reported to the CDC each year, with 3-4% of those cases reporting Lyme carditis [ 1 ]. Lyme disease is notoriously known as the “great imitator” because of its ability to mimic other nonspecific diseases, often leading to delayed or incorrect diagnoses [ 2 ]. The goal of this discussion is to identify the pathology and presentation of various forms of Lyme carditis, focusing on the least reported, and perhaps the most rare, presentation, which is of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. There are three described stages of Lyme disease: acute illness, dissemination, and the chronic phase [ 3 ]. Acute Lyme disease is characterized by erythema migrans . Dissemination phase presents with arthralgias, myalgia, and carditis. In the final and chronic stage of Lyme disease, the host often suffers debilitating arthritis. This discussion will focus on the cardiac implications of Lyme disease inoculation. As stated earlier, Lyme carditis affects only 3-4% of people with Lyme disease. Interestingly, there is a reported 3 : 1 male : female ratio in patients contracting Lyme carditis [ 4 ]. Lyme carditis falls into two distinct categories: conduction disturbances and other complications. The most common conduction disturbance is third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, with 49% of patients with Lyme carditis reporting a 3rd-degree AV block [ 4 ]. These tend to resolve within 6 weeks when inflammation of the myocardium subsides. While AV blocks are the most common presentation of Lyme carditis, other cardiac complications have been described including pericarditis [ 5 ], pericardial effusion [ 6 ], dilated cardiomyopathy [ 7 ], ischemia, and degenerative cardiac valvular disease [ 8 ]. Here is a case of a 45-year-old gentleman who presented with left sided chest pain, biomarkers, and electrocardiographic findings consistent with myocardial infarction who was later diagnosed with Lyme carditis. Diagnosis of Lyme carditis can be difficult as the disease can present in a variety of ways. Serologic examination in two steps is the recommended method of disease detection. The first test is a screening assay with an ELISA followed by an immunoassay Western blot. Early stages of the disease can result in false negatives and clinical presentation, with a compelling history for potential tick-borne disease, must be weighed heavily when making a diagnosis. This case illustrates the importance of thorough history taking and extensive physical examination when assessing a case of possible acute myocardial infarction. Lyme carditis is an uncommon cause of a comparatively common hospital presentation of acute myocardial infarction. Because Lyme carditis is reversible, prompt recognition, whether in the form of AV block, myopericarditis, or ischemia, is of upmost importance to prevent complications such as permanent heart block, or even death.

Epileptic seizures and cerebral vasculitis with stroke or aneurysms are very rare complications. Case presentation. We describe a paediatric patient with sensorineural auditory dysfunction, headache, fatigue and epileptic seizures as sequelae of meningoencephalitis/Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) caused by B. burgdo rferi .

The patient was treated with ceftriaxone for 2 weeks. Two years later, the patient had an ischemic stroke. Brain magnetic resonance angiography revealed multiple aneurysms, which were not present previously. The largest aneurysm was operated rapidly. The patient was treated with another course of intravenous ceftriaxone for 4 weeks and pulse therapy with corticosteroids. He recovered well. Conclusion .

Lyme disease (LD) is a tick-borne illness caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto . An 80-year-old female from Pennsylvania, USA, presented to an outside hospital with fever, confusion, lower extremity weakness, and stool incontinence. CT head and MRI spine were unremarkable. An infectious work-up including lumbar puncture was negative. She was transferred to our tertiary care hospital. Patient was noted to have mild unilateral right-sided facial droop and a diffuse macular rash throughout the body. She denied any outdoor activities, tick bites, or previous rash. Intravenous ceftriaxone was started for suspected LD. The patient’s symptoms including facial droop resolved within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. Polymerase chain reaction of the blood, IgM ELISA, and IgM Western blot testing for LD came back positive a few days after initiation of therapy. She was treated for a total of 21 days for neurological LD with complete symptom resolution. Not all patients have the classic “targetoid” EM rash on initial presentation, rash could develop after neurological manifestations, and prompt initiation of antibiotics without awaiting serology is paramount to making a quick and a full recovery. There should be a high index of suspicion for early disseminated LD, as presentations can be atypical. 1. Introduction. Lyme disease (LD) was originally identified in Lyme, Connecticut, when a cluster of patients presented with an apparent juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. Previously known as Lyme arthritis, the entity is now called LD because of its wide variety of clinical manifestations including cardiac, dermatological, and neurological findings [ 1 ]. LD is the most common tick-borne infection in the northern hemisphere. In North America, LD is predominantly caused by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto . Since it was first recognized as a clinical entity in 1975, the number of cases in the United States has increased [ 2 ]. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the actual number of annual cases is close to 300,000 [ 3 ]. Transmission occurs secondary to a tick bite containing a spirochete in a genetically susceptible host [ 1 ]. Prolonged attachment allows time for the spirochete to transmit from tick to the human body [ 4 ]. LD classically begins with an erythematous rash called erythema migrans (EM). The rash may have centrally located vesicles or necrotic areas [ 5 ]. Although EM lesions may occur anywhere on the body surface, common sites are the groin and axilla and, in children, the head and neck [ 5 ]. In children, the lesion can even occur periorbitally [ 6 ]. The rash is classically described as targetoid or bull’s eye appearance, with an area of erythema surrounded by central clearing [ 7 ]. Hematogenous dissemination from the initial skin lesion is thought to cause secondary skin lesions and extracutaneous manifestations. The most common sign of early disseminated infection is multiple, often smaller EM lesions. The time duration at which hematogenous dissemination occurs remains unknown [ 8 ]. Approximately 4–8% of patients develop cardiac symptoms and 11% develop neurologic symptoms [ 1 ]. Arthritis is usually seen in late disease and occurs in 45–60% of untreated patients [ 1 ]. Patients typically present approximately six months after infection with joint pain and swelling which primarily involves the knees and hips [ 9 ]. We present a case of LD at our institution where the patient presented with nonspecific neurological symptoms followed by an atypical macular rash later in the clinical course. 2. Case Presentation. An 80-year-old Caucasian female, resident of the state of Pennsylvania, USA, with a past history of hypertension, right-sided thyroidectomy, and stroke without residual deficits presented to an outside hospital in the month of June 2015 with fever, confusion, headaches, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and an episode of stool incontinence. Basic lab work-up including total white count was within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head did not show any acute abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the thoracic and lumbar spine performed for concerns of spinal cord compression was unremarkable. An infectious work-up including chest X-ray and urine and blood cultures was negative. Lumbar puncture was performed and it did not show any lymphocytic pleocytosis or findings suggestive of an infectious process. Due to the complexity of her presentation, she was transferred to our tertiary care hospital after spending 3 days at the outlying facility. On presentation to our hospital, the patient continued to complain of severe headaches and was noted to have mild unilateral right-sided facial droop and a diffuse macular rash throughout the body (Figures 1 and 2 ). She denied any outdoor activities, recent tick bites, or noticing any previous rashes. There was no neck stiffness or photophobia. She was started on intravenous ceftriaxone for suspected LD as she comes from an endemic region and has an uncharacteristic rash with neurological manifestations. Unfortunately, cerebrospinal fluid testing for LD was not performed at the outside facility. The patient’s headache, fever, lethargy, and her neurological manifestations including facial droop resolved within 24 hours of antibiotic therapy. Figure 1 Macular rash over the right knee. Figure 2 Macular rash over the left knee. Due to high suspicion of early disseminated LD in our patient, Lyme serology was ordered. Testing included screening ELISA, which was positive for IgM antibody, confirmed by IgM positive Western blot test (IgM positive for 39, 41; IgG positive for 23 and 41). Western blot testing was negative for IgG as only two of the 10 bands came back positive, the required being five out of ten. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the blood sample tested positive for DNA of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto. Of note, results of the Western blot were available a few days after the discharge of the patient from the hospital. Our patient did not have the classic “targetoid” EM rash on initial presentation. Another unique feature was development of the rash after initial neurological manifestations. She was treated for a total of 21 days for neurological LD. The patient’s rash and her neurological manifestations had completely resolved. At a 3-month follow-up, the patient reported no further episodes of headaches, rash, and fevers. 3. Discussion. LD is the most common tick-borne infectious disease in North America and in countries with temperate climates in Europe and Asia [ 10 ]. Early LD is a clinical diagnosis in endemic areas in patients presenting with EM rash, predominantly in the months of May through August. Serologic testing can be misleading because the false negative rate is as high as 60% in the first 2–4 weeks of infection [ 11 ]. The LD cases are concentrated in the Northeast and upper Midwest of USA, with 14 states accounting for over 96% of cases reported to CDC. Of the cases reported to CDC, it is most commonly seen among boys aged 5 to 9 years. LD patients are most likely to have illness onset in June, July, or August and less likely to have illness onset from December through March. As per CDC estimates from the years 2001 to 2015, in USA, on an annual basis, there are more than 300,000 cases of LD with the months of June and July being the highest with greater than 75,000 LD cases each. The clinical manifestations of LD can be divided into three stages: early localized infection, early disseminated disease, and late infection [ 10 ]. Early localized infection of LD occurs 7–10 days after a tick bite and the most typical presentation is the characteristic EM rash. It is present in up to 80% of the patients during early localized stage. Early disseminated disease occurs weeks to months later; patients can have secondary skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, migratory joint and muscle pain, meningitis with cranial nerve involvement, and Lyme carditis. Late infection in the United States is characterized by arthritis as a common feature; neurologic manifestations such as a subtle encephalopathy or polyneuropathy can also occur [ 10 , 12 ]. In Europe, cutaneous manifestations such as acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans are commonly reported [ 13 ]. Lyme carditis may present very early as a part of early disseminated disease. It can cause self-limited conduction abnormalities with varying degrees of atrioventricular block with 3rd-degree heart block being the most common. Rarely, it can cause fatal ventricular arrhythmias. The likely pathogenesis here is direct invasion of myocardial tissue and inflammatory reaction caused by Borrelia burgdorferi . It may manifest as pericarditis, myocarditis, and endocardial fibrosis [ 10 ]. Most patients with LD have normal blood counts like in our patient. The presence of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and high-grade fever should raise suspicion for anaplasmosis, while the presence of severe anemia alone should raise suspicion of babesiosis [ 11 ]. When there is a suspicion of either babesiosis or anaplasmosis, PCR test can be used for confirmation [ 11 ]. Mehrzad and Bravoco reported a unique case of pancytopenia in a patient with LD. Coinfection with ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis was ruled out. This case illustrated that Borrelia burgdorferi has the potential to induce hemolytic anemia. Oxygen labile hemolysin enzymes are associated with certain strains of leptospirosis [ 14 ]. This gives credence to the finding of pancytopenia in the case reported by them. Atypical presentation of LD can pose a diagnostic challenge. Early neurologic presentations typically include cranial neuritis, radiculitis, and meningitis. Horner syndrome is a rare manifestation of neurologic Lyme [ 11 ]. A case of pseudotumor cerebri was reported by Kan et al. In this patient, impaired CSF flow and raised intracranial pressure could have resulted as a consequence of direct infective or inflammatory process. There were around 12 such cases reported. However, the prognosis of pseudotumor cerebri when associated with LD appears to be good when treated appropriately [ 15 ]. Lyme meningitis is indistinguishable from viral aseptic meningitis. On lumbar puncture, the expected finding would be lymphocytic pleocytosis; however, our patient had neither an increase in CSF lymphocytes nor peripheral leukocytosis. He presented with nonspecific neurological symptoms like headaches, confusion, and unilateral facial droop and features suggestive of spinal cord compression such as bilateral lower extremity weakness and bowel incontinence. There was also an initial concern for cerebrovascular accident such as stroke but imaging did not provide any such evidence. The development of diffuse rash along with the neurological symptoms made us consider the possibility of LD. Our patient did not have the classic “targetoid” EM rash on initial presentation. Another unique feature was development of the rash after initial neurological complaints. Given the symptomatology and patient being from an endemic area of the United States, there was a high suspicion of early disseminated LD. Lyme serology was ordered and the patient was started on intravenous ceftriaxone. The symptomatology immediately improved with appropriate antibiotic treatment. A few days after discharge of the patient from the hospital, the confirmatory Western blot test for LD came back positive. Our case highlights the fact that the suspicion of LD should be very high in endemic areas. The lack of the classic bull’s eye appearing rash and typical symptoms should not completely exclude the presence of LD. Serologic testing for antibodies is an adjunct to the clinical diagnosis and can neither establish nor exclude the diagnosis of LD. A positive or negative serologic test simply changes the probability that a patient has been infected with Borrelia burgdorferi . This has to be interpreted in clinical context. In suspected early disseminated LD, the treatment with intravenous antibiotics should be started immediately without waiting for serology as prompt initiation of antibiotics is paramount to making a quick and a full recovery. Our case is peculiar due to the atypical nature of the rash and occurrence of early disseminated neurological disease before the development of diffuse rash. There are a few such other atypical cases reported in the literature (Table 1 ).

A retrospective descriptive analysis was also carried out on human Lyme borreliosis (LB) cases reported to the local hospital (Cabueñes). Samples were screened for B. burgdorferi s.l. presence by a nested PCR assay, and genospecies were confirmed by sequencing. B. burgdorferi s.l. was detected in 1.4% (12/845) of I. ricinus questing nymphs, 9.1% (2/33) of questing adults, and 12.9% (9/70) of small mammals, as well as in the other tick species. PCR positive samples of 17 questing tick and 6 small mammals were sequenced. Four genospecies were identified: B. afzelii , B. garinii , B. lusitaniae , and B. valaisiana . Phylogenetic analyses based on the fla B gene showed the heterogeneity of B. afzelii in this area. The detection of B. burgdorferi s.l. among questing ticks and small mammals in the study area, as well as the abundance of ticks and of large wild and domestic mammals, indicate a high risk of infection by B. burgdorferi s.l. in the area. Reporting of LB cases to the local hospital support this, and shows the need of thorough monitoring of B. burgdorferi infection in ticks and hosts in the area.

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and is widely reported in the USA, Central Europe, South East Asia and Latin America. Until recently, no scientific report regarding Lyme disease in Nepal had been published. Case presentation. A 32-year-old, previously healthy female visited the hospital with a history of joint pains, fatigue, neck stiffness, tingling sensation and headache. She was initially treated for typhoid fever, brucellosis and malaria, but did not show significant improvement. Doxycycline was prescribed empirically for 3 weeks for the treatment of suspected tick-borne illness. A two-tiered immunoglobulin laboratory testing confirmed Borrelia burgdorferi . She developed post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome after completion of antibiotic therapy. Conclusion. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of Lyme disease in Nepal and probably the first documented case of post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome in Asia.

Limited resources hinders proper deployment of this surveillance in Quebec, prompting the exploration of alternatives. A participatory project was therefore developed to explore a new tick sampling scheme based on training of park workers. This training was first implemented in fall 2017 and is also scheduled for spring 2018. OBJECTIVES Develop and validate a training targeting park employees to (1) allow them to carry out tick sampling activities autonomously and (2) inform them about LD prevention. INTERVENTION Training session was developed using governmental material. It combined a theoretical lecture covering basic concepts of LD and a practical segment in which workers carried out a first tick sampling under trainer&#8217;s supervision. Subsequently, participants were asked to carry an unsupervised sampling at the same location but on a different day. Ticks collected during samplings were identified and screened for pathogens. Evaluation of the training was done by phone interviews with park managers. OUTCOME In fall 2017, 64 workers were trained in 8 parks located in health regions with known LD endemic areas (Monteregie, Mauricie-Centre-du-Quebec, Estrie and Outaouais).  All parks were sampled once during the training and half of them managed to carry independent samplings. Overall, 38 LD ticks vector were collected. High appreciation of the training and increased awareness of LD risk among workers were highlighted following evaluation CONCLUSION An innovative tick collection method involving workers was explored and will be validated in spring 2018.  Such approach could potentially improve active tick surveillance activities while promoting occupational preventive measures. Similar initiatives could be implemented on a larger scale in the future to enhance LD surveillance in Canada.",1985,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In the ecology of Lyme disease emergence, it remains unclear to what extent spread of the tick vector ( Ixodes scapularis ) and the pathogen ( Borrelia burgdorferi ) are dependent upon the dispersal of vertebrate hosts in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. Yet, empirical measure of these complex ecologically driven spread processes present conceptual and methodological challenges despite important public health implications. Objectives. To examine the relationship between landscape characteristics and tick-borne disease spread, we modeled the influence of landscape connectivity for a simplified vertebrate host community (white-footed mouse— Peromyscus leucopus , American robin— Turdus migratorius , white-tailed deer— Odocoileus virginianus ) on the potential spread of the tick population compared to the pathogen in a spatially-structured landscape. Methods. We parameterized a hybrid demographic-dispersal connectivity model by combining a series of reported host dispersal and tick burden estimates with empirically-measured tick abundance and pathogen prevalence sampled from a Lyme-endemic island landscape in Thousand Islands National Park (Ontario, Canada) and simulated several tick- and pathogen-spread scenarios. Results. The extent of tick spread by mice [amount of reachable habitat (ARH) = 18.0%] is considerably similar to that of robins (ARH = 18.7%), while deer support the greatest tick spread extent (ARH = 82.0%). Infected mice carrying ticks support the highest pathogen spread (ARH = 19.8%). Short-distance pathogen spread and long-distance tick spread were facilitated by intermediate stepping stone habitat fragments. Conclusions. We provide evidence that host functional connectivity mediates tick spread differently than pathogen spread, and depends strongly on landscape configuration. Our study therefore emphasizes the importance of landscape spatial heterogeneity on the ecological processes that influence regional tick-borne disease spread.",1991,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Children being evaluated for LNB in southeast Sweden during the period 2010–2014 underwent a clinical examination, laboratory testing and filled out a questionnaire regarding duration and nature of symptoms, EM and the child’s health. Children were classified according to European guidelines for LNB. Clinical recovery was evaluated at a 2-month follow-up. Results. The occurrence of EM among children with LNB was 37 out of 103 (36%). Gender, age, observed tick bite, clinical features, duration of neurological symptoms or clinical outcome did not differ significantly between LNB patients with or without EM. However, facial nerve palsy was significantly more common among children with EM in the head and neck area. Conclusion. EM occurred in 36% of children with LNB and the location on the head and neck was more common among children with facial nerve palsy. EM was not associated with other specific clinical characteristics or outcome. Thus, the occurrence of EM in children with LNB cannot be useful as a prognostic factor for clinical outcome. This aspect has not previously been highlighted but seems to be relevant for the paediatrician in a clinical setting.",1700,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

The nature of the famous Bindon Landslide of 1839, which formed Goat Island and the Chasm, has been the subject of much debate since it was first described by Buckland and Conybeare in 1840.

This paper examines the Plateau slip in detail and attempts to apply what can be seen there to Dowlands and Bindon. While Pitts undertook a highly detailed mapping exercise of the landslides throughout the undercliff itself, he did not map the foreshore in any detail. Therefore an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or drone was used to generate a high resolution photomontage of the foreshore in front of all three landslides to enable detailed mapping of the features contained within it.

A common late-stage complication of this disease is oligoarticular arthritis, often involving the knee. In ∼10% of cases, arthritis persists after appropriate antibiotic treatment, leading to a proliferative synovitis typical of chronic inflammatory arthritides. Here, we provide evidence that peptidoglycan (PG), a major component of the B. burgdorferi cell envelope, may contribute to the development and persistence of Lyme arthritis (LA). We show that B. burgdorferi has a chemically atypical PG (PG Bb ) that is not recycled during cell-wall turnover. Instead, this pathogen sheds PG Bb fragments into its environment during growth. Patients with LA mount a specific immunoglobulin G response against PG Bb , which is significantly higher in the synovial fluid than in the serum of the same patient. We also detect PG Bb in 94% of synovial fluid samples (32 of 34) from patients with LA, many of whom had undergone oral and intravenous antibiotic treatment. These same synovial fluid samples contain proinflammatory cytokines, similar to those produced by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with PG Bb . In addition, systemic administration of PG Bb in BALB/c mice elicits acute arthritis. Altogether, our study identifies PG Bb as a likely contributor to inflammatory responses in LA. Persistence of this antigen in the joint may contribute to synovitis after antibiotics eradicate the pathogen. Furthermore, our finding that B. burgdorferi sheds immunogenic PG Bb fragments during growth suggests a potential role for PG Bb in the immunopathogenesis of other Lyme disease manifestations.",1708,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Early identification of disease allowed for effective treatment with no adverse outcomes or sequelae. 1. Introduction. Lyme disease is the most common tick-borne illness in the United States [ 1 ]. Infection is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi which is transmitted to humans via an Ixodes tick bite [ 2 ]. Lyme disease most commonly manifests during the late spring and summer months in the Northeastern United States and Wisconsin with exposure to wooded outdoor areas [ 3 , 4 ]. Early intervention is critical to avoid the devastating sequelae of disseminated Lyme disease such as neurological impairment, chronic arthritis, and infection-induced heart block [ 2 , 5 , 6 ]. 2. Case Presentation. A 20-year-old male patient with no prior medical history presented to the hospital with complaints of skin rash, malaise, and fever. The patient worked as a summer camp counselor and had recently been camping in Wisconsin. Several weeks after returning from a camping excursion, he noticed a nontender, nonpruritic annular rash on his arm with centralized clearing, absent of pain or pruritus. Three days later, he experienced excessive fatigue and accompanying fever (T-max 101°F). The patient presented to the camp clinic with a characteristic rash raising suspicion for Lyme disease. Given his age, symptomatology, recent outdoor exposure, and distinctive rash, a Suspicious Index in Lyme Carditis (SILC) score of 9 gave high suspicion for early Lyme carditis. The patient was sent to a tertiary care center for further evaluation and management. Upon admission, the patient developed intermittent symptomatic bradycardia with an average heart rate of 40 bpm one episode of severe bradycardia with a nadir of 15 bpm over a period of five seconds. The patient complained of accompanying generalized fatigue and intermittent lightheadedness. He denied complaints of arthralgia, myalgia, motor/sensory deficit, headache, altered mental status, or neck pain. Physical exam revealed multiple large targetoid lesions on the lower extremities, upper extremities, and back (Figure 1 ). The lesions had raised borders with centralized clearing consistent with erythema migrans chronicum. Figure 1 Dorsal targetoid lesion with centralized clearing (erythema migrans chronicum). Presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed a second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, Mobitz Type I (Figure 2 ). Inpatient telemetry demonstrated episodes of high-grade AV block (Figure 3 ). Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a normal ejection fraction of 73% with no regional wall motion abnormalities. The valve anatomy and function were also normal. Antibiotic therapy was initiated with 2 g of intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone due to the characteristic presentation of Lyme carditis. Atropine and transcutaneous pacing were deferred due to relative clinical stability. Follow-up Lyme ELISA was reactive for Lyme IgM and IgG, confirmed by Western blot that showed reactivity of IgM to p23, p39, and p41. IgG was reactive to p18, p23, p39, p41, and p93 (Table 1 ). Given the ECG findings and serology, the patient was diagnosed with early disseminated Lyme carditis. Figure 2 ECG demonstrating sinus rhythm with second-degree AV block (Mobitz Type I).

Intravenous ceftriaxone was initiated for 28 days, four days inpatient and 24 days outpatient via a peripherally inserted central catheter. After two days of therapy, the annular skin lesions resolved with coinciding resolution of fever and malaise. Heart block also progressively improved from high-grade AV block to second-degree AV block (Mobitz Type I). On the fourth day of treatment, the predominant rhythm was a first-degree AV block maintaining adequate PR interval control measured at 216 ms upon discharge (Figure 4 ). The patient was discharged on hospital day four. Follow-up appointments with electrophysiology and infectious disease services were arranged for complete resolution of his PR interval and further testing. Figure 4 ECG demonstrating sinus bradycardia with first-degree AV block. On follow-up, the patient reported complete resolution of symptoms and a return to baseline. He did not have any headache, joint pain, fatigue, presyncope, or syncope. Follow-up laboratory panel was also unremarkable with no significant derangement. Patient follow-up ECG showed a normal rate and sinus rhythm with complete resolution of the previous AV block (Figure 5 ). Figure 5 Follow-up ECG demonstrating normal sinus rhythm and resolution of AV block. 3. Discussion. Lyme carditis is the most common vector-borne infection in Northeastern America, yet cardiac manifestations are uncommon [ 2 , 7 ]. Early localized Lyme disease is caused by systemic infection of Borrelia burgdorferi , classically presenting as erythema migrans with or without constitutional symptoms [ 4 ]. If left untreated, late systemic disease can create cardiac complications such as reversible AV block, cardiomyopathy, and myocarditis due to spirochete infiltration of cardiac and pericardial structures [ 8 ]. Given the cardiac tissue irritation in Lyme carditis, a patient’s ECG can exhibit marked derangement including ST-segment changes, t-wave inversion, repolarization abnormalities, and atrioventricular block [ 3 , 9 ]. First-degree AV block is the most common cardiac arrhythmia of Lyme carditis, but some cases have demonstrated second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, and QT prolongation [ 3 , 8 – 12 ]. Fluctuations between first-degree and second-degree conduction block have also been reported [ 2 , 9 ], but first-degree block seldomly fluctuates to the level of complete heart block [ 13 ]. Clinical suspicion of early disseminated Lyme carditis is essential in patients presenting with new-onset high-degree AV block. The absence of appropriate treatment can result in progression of disease and worsening symptomatology [ 14 ]. Failure to recognize early Lyme carditis is associated with an increased need for permanent pacemaker implantation [ 14 ]. To help distinguish etiology of high-degree AV block, an evidence-based scoring system termed the “Suspicious Index in Lyme Carditis” was developed in 2018 [ 15 ]. The parameters contributing to this score incorporate common presentations of Lyme disease, including male sex, age less than 50 years, recent outdoor activity or endemic exposure, constitutional symptomology, known tick bite, and classical erythema migrans rash [ 15 ]. The cumulative score categorizes patients based on level of suspicion for Lyme disease as the etiologic cause of AV block [ 15 ]. Current guidelines for diagnosis and management of Lyme carditis suggest stratifying suspicion of Lyme-induced AV block into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories using an SILC score [ 10 ]. SILC scoring reports a sensitivity of nearly 92.9% for intermediate and high suspicion categories, making it a valuable screening tool for decreasing unnecessary laboratory testing and antibiotic use [ 15 ]. However, the failure of SILC to confer suspicion based on laboratory and histologic findings may warrant additional diagnostic workup outside of its recommendation [ 16 ]. After SILC scoring, individuals with low suspicion receive standard treatment for AV block and those with intermediate or high suspicion begin empiric IV antibiotic therapy and serologic testing [ 15 ]. Patients exhibiting asymptomatic bradycardia are managed with strict cardiac monitoring [ 10 , 17 ], while symptomatic patients require continuous cardiac telemetry to evaluate the need for transcutaneous pacing or inotropic support due to the risk of ischemia or death with persistent high-grade AV block [ 13 , 17 – 19 ]. In this case, the patient obtained a SILC score of 9 due to his status as a young male with classic symptomatology, outdoor activity, and pathognomonic erythema migrans rash. This score placed him within the category of high suspicion of early disseminated Lyme carditis. New-onset heart block in a young patient is exceptionally rare (1/15,000 cases) with widely variable etiologies [ 20 – 24 ]. Electrolyte abnormalities such as hyperkalemia, as well as thyroid dysfunction, may induce heart block and should be considered in these cases [ 4 , 25 , 26 ]. Without the pathognomonic rash, the differential diagnosis may have been significantly confounded in this patient. This emphasizes the importance of a thorough integumentary examination and exposure history in patients with heart block of unidentified etiology [ 20 – 24 ]. In the workup of this case, pending Lyme serology resulted in a comprehensive patient evaluation to assess other possible AV block etiologies. Transthoracic echocardiogram, complete blood count (CBC), complete metabolic panel (CMP), thyroid panel, and autoantibody testing were all conducted to rule out the etiology of noninfectious heart block in this patient. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was also considered [ 4 ], but the presence of erythema migrans and absence of renal and hematologic dysfunction were more consistent with Lyme carditis. Inpatient genetic testing was deemed unnecessary for this patient as genetic causes of AV block were ruled out due to the absence of previous personal and/or family cardiac history. Cardiac biopsy for evaluation of infiltrative disease was also deferred given the procedural risk and relative probability of Lyme etiology [ 4 , 27 , 28 ]. With greater than 95 percent specificity, ELISA antibody and Western blot serologic studies were utilized to establish a diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme carditis in this case. Based on the current guidelines, the patient was tested for Lyme serology and started on intravenous ceftriaxone [ 15 , 29 ]. It is recommended that patients with negative serology proceed to standard high-degree AV block management, while patients with positive serology receive IV ceftriaxone for 10-14 days followed by oral antibiotics (preferably doxycycline) to complete a total course of 14-21 days of antibiotic therapy [ 10 , 30 ]. For this patient, positive IgM and IgG serologic markers solidified a primary diagnosis of early disseminated Lyme carditis (Table 1 ) [ 31 ] and IV ceftriaxone was continued. While the CDC recommends an antibiotic course of 14-21 days for Lyme carditis, other manifestations of Lyme disease follow protocols lasting up to 28 days and no clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate appropriate durations of antibiotic treatment [ 10 , 18 , 30 , 32 ]. In this case, a 28-day course of ceftriaxone was considered appropriate to ensure clearance of Lyme infection. Furthermore, the patient was not transitioned to oral doxycycline due to a past history of adverse drug reaction [ 18 ]. Per current guidelines, the patient obtained a follow-up ECG demonstrating 1 : 1 conduction, but did not receive a stress ECG. This demonstrates a limitation in patient management, as follow-up stress testing is recommended to evaluate AV conduction in a noninvasive manner 4-6 weeks after initial resolution of AV block [ 10 ]. Stress ECG testing is critical for appropriate analysis of the point of Wenckebach which can demonstrate cardiac recovery and determine if permanent cardiac pacing, repeat stress testing, or routine ECG follow-up is indicated [ 17 ]. 4. Conclusion. Lyme carditis is a known etiologic cause of cardiac conduction abnormalities, particularly AV block. SILC scoring can be a useful tool in the evaluation and treatment of suspected Lyme-induced heart block. Stratifying suspicion allows for indicated serologic testing and time-sensitive antibiotic treatment.

RECENT FINDINGS The most recent guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease were published in 2020 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American College of Rheumatology. SUMMARY The most common neurologic complications of Lyme disease are cranial neuritis (most often a unilateral or bilateral facial nerve palsy), meningitis, and radiculoneuritis/mononeuropathy multiplex. Testing for Lyme disease begins with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). If the ELISA is positive or borderline, Western blots should be performed for both IgM and IgG antibodies. As a general rule, in infectious diseases, an IgM antibody response is followed by an IgG antibody response. A central nervous system infection has either a CSF pleocytosis or pathogen-specific intrathecal antibody production. Lyme meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or other peripheral nervous system manifestations are treated with oral doxycycline or IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin G. No additional antibiotic therapy is indicated for patients with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome or patients with concern for chronic Lyme disease with no evidence of previous or current Lyme infection.",1358,0,0,1,0,en,en,

This study provides a novel application of geographically weighted regression to explore how the relationship between Lyme disease and land cover varies across the Midwest and Northeast regions of the United States. Results revealed that specific land cover types, namely deciduous forest, evergreen forest and agricultural land, are significant explanatory variables for predicting the location of Lyme disease incidence. However, contrary to previous studies, we show how these relationships vary within each region. The results from this study are important for informing Lyme disease mitigation efforts that have typically treated Lyme disease and land cover relationships as spatially static across this region. As such, we recommend that Lyme disease mitigation efforts not associate a high risk of Lyme disease with specific land cover types without understanding the larger geographic context influencing the presence and spread of the disease.",1135,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The Czech Republic is an endemic country for LB. The disease affects the skin, neurological, musculoskeletal, cardiac or ocular tissue, and the most frequent clinical manifestations are erythema migrans and Lyme neuroborreliosis. In 2018, the EU case definition of Lyme neuroborreliosis was published, and neuroborreliosis has become reportable to the European Surveillance System. In this paper, we describe the LB surveillance system and reporting of human cases in the Czech Republic. Epidemiological characteristics of Lyme borreliosis are presented for 2018 and 2019. Gaps in and limitations of the existing national LB surveillance system were identified with regard to the reporting of neuroborreliosis in accordance with the EU case definition. In the Czech Republic, LB surveillance is nationwide, comprehensive, and mandatory. Case based data on all clinical manifestations of incident LB are reported to the electronic Information System of Infectious Diseases (ISIN). In 2018 and 2019, 4724 and 4102 LB cases, i.e., 44.5 and 38.4 cases per 100,000 population, were reported to ISIN, respectively. Overall, 46.3 % of cases were male and 53.7 % were female. The highest morbidity was observed in adults 50–75 and children 5–9 years old. The most affected regions were Vysočina and Olomoucký. Nine districts recorded more than 100 cases per 100,000 population. Erythema migrans appeared in 3173 (67.2 %) and 2756 (67.2 %) patients in 2018 and 2019, respectively. In 2018, 596 (12.6 %) Lyme neuroborreliosis cases were diagnosed only on the basis of clinical manifestations while in 2019, a total of 567 (13.8 %) cases of neuroborreliosis fully meeting the EU case definition were reported. The Czech Republic is an endemic country for LB with some hotspots, similar to some central, northern and north-eastern European countries. To implement the EU neuroborreliosis surveillance in the Czech Republic, ISIN technical update, addition of required variables to it, preparation of legislation update, and training of health professionals were needed.",2237,0,0,1,0,lt,en,

Study Design Prospective cohort. Setting University-based, tertiary care balance center. Intervention Patients with active unilateral or bilateral Ménière's disease underwent testing, including antinuclear antibodies, anti-DNA antibodies, rheumatoid factor, complement levels, anti-Sjögren syndrome A and B antibodies, sedimentation rate, antiphospholipid antibodies, Western blot for anticochlear antibodies (anti-heat shock protein 70), microhemagglutination test for Treponema pallidum , and Lyme titers. Outcome Measures Results of laboratory tests. Results In patients with unilateral Ménière's disease (n = 40), 27% demonstrated elevated antiphospholipid antibody titers (population norm, 6–9%). The majority of these patients manifested negative assays on the other tests listed above. In patients with bilateral Ménière's disease (n = 18), elevations in antinuclear antibody titers (38%) were the most notable finding. As part of a broader study of patients with progressive hearing loss, four patients with positive syphilis titers were identified; however, none of these patients complained of vertigo . Conclusion In general, the results of this study do not support the hypothesis that immune or infectious pathologies are involved in the pathogenesis of unilateral Ménière's disease. In particular, Lyme disease does not seem to cause labyrinthine disease. However, the potential role of the thrombogenic antiphospholipid antibodies must be further investigated.

Such markers are critical for isolation of B . burgdorferi strains with multiple mutants, for complementation with different cloning vectors, and for methods such as negative selection and reporter genes. To remedy this lack, resistance to various antibiotics of non-infectious (B31, 297) and infectious (N40) B . burgdorferi strains was examined and vectors incorporating appropriate antibiotic resistance genes as selective markers were developed. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for growth of B . burgdorferi on plates and in liquid media for aminoglycosides (kanamycin, gentamycin, sisomycin, amikacin, spectinomycin, neomycin), macrolides-lincosamids (erythromycin, lincomycin), coumarin derivatives (coumermycin A 1 , novobiocin), glycopeptides (vancomycin, ristocetin), peptides (bacitracin, cycloserine), and chloramphenicol were found to differ significantly. There were also striking differences in resistance to these antibiotics between non-infectious and infectious B . burgdorferi strains. Antibiotic-resistance genes aph ( 3 ′) -IIIa from Streptococcus faecalis , aad9 from Staphylococcus aureus Tn 554, linA ′ from Staphylococcus aureus , and aac ( 3 )- VIa from Enterobacter cloacae (conferring resistance to kanamycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin, and gentamycin/sisomycin, respectively) were subcloned either with their own promoters or under the control of the B . burgdorferi flaB promoter into pGK12 or its derivative pED1 to develop new cloning vectors for B . burgdorferi with the rationale that the absence of homologous regions between derived recombinant plasmids lacking the flaB promoter and the B . burgdorferi genome would permit avoidance of possible recombination with target DNA. Resistance to the corresponding antibiotic was conferred by vectors containing aph ( 3 ′) -IIIa , aad9 , linA ′ or aac ( 3 )- VIa whether under the control of their own promoters or under the control of the flaB promoter. We conclude that these markers can be used for genetic study of B . burgdorferi and suggest they will be an important addition to the previously used coumermycin A 1 , erythromycin and kanamycin in these studies.",2297,0,0,0,1,nl,en,

Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia infiltrates were dense, composed mainly of B cells forming follicles with germinal centers (GC). Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia frequently showed features suggesting a malignancy as coalescing follicles with non-polarized germinal centers lacking mantle zones, and smudged infiltrates of lymphoid cells spreading into collagen (often as “Indian files”), smooth muscle, vessel walls, and nerve sheaths. Only two cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias recurred; otherwise all patients are without disease (mean follow-up 62 months). Monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected in five, and of T-cell receptor γ gene in two cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasias using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the patients fared well too. In 47% of cases Borrelia burgdorferi was detected by polymerase chain reaction and/or serology, of which one was monoclonal.

Study Design: Open, controlled prospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center (University Hospital). Patients: The study was conducted on twenty-four patients with clinically manifest neuroborreliosis and facial palsy 3 to 5 years prior to the investigation. Main Outcome Measures: Results of the clinical examination using the House-Brackmann scale were compared to results from two neuro-physiological examinations (qEMG and ENoG). Results: Approximately one-half of the patients with reported subjective symptoms of residual facial palsy had signs of slight dysfunction in the clinical examination using the House-Brackmann scale. There was no correlation between the subjective feeling of facial dysfunction and presence of clinical signs. Likewise, about one-half of the subjective facial dysfunction group, as well as the control group, were found to demonstrate pathological values in their neurophysiological examinations using qEMG and ENoG. Conclusions: This study shows that the assumption is not true that all children who had neuroborreliosis with facial palsy will heal 100%. A small proportion of the children claim that several years after the infection, they have subjective symptoms of slight facial weakness on the affected side. Our study shows that some of these children, as well as some children without subjective symptoms of facial palsy, demonstrate a slight facial weakness when examined clinically. Likewise, signs of slight-to-moderate facial motor dysfunction were revealed in about half of the children with the two neurophysiological methods utilized in this study. It is interesting to note that there was no clear correlation between the presence of subjective symptoms, objective signs, and neurophysiological results.",1995,0,0,0,1,en,en,

This unusual rRNA gene organization has been speculated to be involved in the slow growth of this organism. Because we were repeatedly unable to isolate a 23S ribosomal mutant in B. burgdorferi by allelic exchange, we developed a transposition mutagenesis system for this bacterium. To this end, Himar1 transposase is expressed in B. burgdorferi from a resident plasmid containing an erythromycin resistance marker, and this strain is then electroporated with suicide plasmids containing mariner transposons and kanamycin resistance genes expressible in B. burgdorferi . This system permitted us to generate hundreds of erythromycin/kanamycin-resistant B. burgdorferi clones with each of three suicide plasmids. DNA sequencing of several kanamycin-resistant clones generated with one of the suicide plasmids showed stable and random insertion of the transposon into the B. burgdorferi chromosomal and plasmid genome. One mutant was inactivated in rrlA (23S rRNA), another in ftsJ ( rrmJ ). rrlA disruption had no effect on growth rate under a wide range of culture conditions, but disruption of ftsJ interfered significantly with growth rate and bacterial morphology. These data show it is possible to isolate random and stable B. burgdorferi transposition mutants for physiological analysis of this pathogenic spirochete.",1455,0,0,0,1,nl,en,

The human immune system exhibits sexual dimorphism, which is most evident in the female predominance of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Female sex steroids are strongly implicated in mediating immune sexual dimorphism, in part because estrogen accentuates disease in several models of lupus autoimmunity. In contrast, progesterone may prevent disease development. While much investigation has focused on the effects of estrogen and progesterone on lymphocyte functions, far less attention has been paid to the effects of these hormones on DCs. Current evidence now indicates estrogen can activate DCs, while in contrast, progesterone inhibits DC functions. Thus, we hypothesize that the opposite effects these two hormones have on lupus autoimmunity reflect opposing effects on DC functions.

The aims of this study were to identify associations between natural exposure to B. burgdorferi and the presence of microalbuminuria in nonclinical young Labrador and Golden Retrievers and to compare two commonly used serologic tests available to document B. burgdorferi exposure: the Western blot and the commercial point-of-care C6 peptide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. Microalbuminuria was assessed using a commercial point-of-care ELISA specific for canine albumin. Blood and urine samples from 268 asymptomatic Labrador and Golden Retrievers were included. Of these, 18.7% were positive for B. burgdorferi exposure according to the C6 ELISA; 21.2% were positive for natural exposure to B. burgdorferi and 11.5% for vaccinal antibodies according to the Western blot. The agreement rate was 93% between the two tests (kappa = 0.78, P < 0.0001) for natural exposure. Urine from 6.1% of the dogs was positive for microalbuminuria.

In the first study, 7 ponies were exposed to B. burgdorferi –infected ticks; 4 ponies served as uninfected controls. Serum samples were obtained bimonthly for 9 months. In the second study, 16 ponies were exposed to B. burgdorferi –infected ticks. After confirmation of infection by skin culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and serology, the ponies were allocated to 4 groups that received tetracycline, doxycycline, ceftiofur, or no treatment.

Here, we used two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE/mass spectrometric analysis for a global characterization of protein–protein interactions as well as to identify protein complexes in OM vesicles isolated from multiple infectious sensu stricto isolates of B. burgdorferi. Although we uncovered the existence of at least 10 distinct OM complexes harboring several unique subunits, the complexome is dominated by the frequent occurrence of a limited diversity of membrane proteins, most notably P13, outer surface protein (Osp) A, -B, -C, and -D and Lp6.6. The occurrence of these complexes and specificity of subunit interaction were further supported by independent two-dimensional immunoblotting and coimmunoprecipitation assays as well as by mutagenesis studies, where targeted depletion of a subunit member (P66) selectively abolished a specific complex. Although a comparable profile of the OM complexome was detected in two major infectious isolates, such as B31 and 297, certain complexes are likely to occur in an isolate-specific manner. Further assessment of protein complexes in multiple Osp-deficient isolates showed loss of several protein complexes but revealed the existence of additional complex/subunits that are undetectable in wild-type cells. Together, these observations uncovered borrelial antigens involved in membrane protein interactions. The study also suggests that the assembly process of OM complexes is specific and that the core or stabilizing subunits vary between complexes. Further characterization of these protein complexes including elucidation of their biological significance may shed new light on the mechanism of pathogen persistence and the development of preventative measures against the infection.",2040,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The prevalence of anti- B. miyamotoi antibodies among forestry workers was 10% (5.3–16.8%) and in patients with serologically unconfirmed but suspected human granulocytic anaplasmosis was 14.6% (9.0–21.8%); these were significantly higher compared with the seroprevalence in blood donors. Our findings indicate that infections with B. miyamotoi occur in tick-exposed individuals in the Netherlands. In addition, B. miyamotoi infections should be considered in patients reporting tick bites and febrile illness with unresolved aetiology in the Netherlands, and other countries where I. ricinus ticks are endemic.",1797,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Both markers, located on chromosomes 16 and 3, respectively, are within or close to genes previously connected to spinocerebellar ataxia.

ANO10 augments volume-regulated Cl − currents (I Hypo ) in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, lymphocytes and macrophages and controls volume regulation by enhancing regulatory volume decrease (RVD). ANO10 supports migration of macrophages and phagocytosis of spirochetes. The R263H variant is inhibitory on I Hypo , RVD and intracellular Ca 2+ signals, which may delay spirochete clearance, thereby sensitizing adaptive immunity.

Miklossy', 'affiliation': 'Prevention Alzheimer International Foundation, Switzerland'}]",10.3233/jad-160451,2016.0,53,Article,"Abstract. It has long been known that spirochetes form clumps or micro colonies in vitro and in vivo. Cortical spirochetal colonies in syphilitic dementia were considered as reproductive centers for spirochetes. Historic and recent data demonstrate that senile plaques in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are made up by spirochetes. Spirochetes, are able to form biofilm in vitro . Senile plaques are also reported to contain elements of biofilm constituents. We expected that AβPP and Aβ (the main components of senile plaques) also occur in pure spirochetal biofilms, and bacterial DNA (an important component of biofilm) is also present in senile plaques. Histochemical, immunohistochemical, and in situ hybridization techniques and the TUNEL assay were used to answer these questions. The results obtained demonstrate that Aβ and DNA, including spirochete-specific DNA, are key components of both pure spirochetal biofilms and senile plaques in AD and confirm the biofilm nature of senile plaques. These results validate validate previous observations that AβPP and/or an AβPP-like amyloidogenic protein are an integral part of spirochetes, and indicate that bacterial and host derived Aβ are both constituents of senile plaques. DNA fragmentation in senile plaques further confirms their bacterial nature and provides biochemical evidence for spirochetal cell death. Spirochetes evade host defenses, locate intracellularly, form more resistant atypical forms and notably biofilms, which contribute to sustain chronic infection and inflammation and explain the slowly progressive course of dementia in AD. To consider co-infecting microorganisms is equally important, as multi-species biofilms result in a higher resistance to treatments and a more severe dementia.",1761,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The castor bean tick ( Ixodes ricinus ) transmits infectious diseases such as Lyme borreliosis, which constitutes an important ecosystem disservice. Despite many local studies, a comprehensive understanding of the key drivers of tick abundance at the continental scale is still lacking. We analyze a large set of environmental factors as potential drivers of I. ricinus abundance. Our multi-scale study was carried out in deciduous forest fragments dispersed within two contrasting rural landscapes of eight regions, along a macroclimatic gradient stretching from southern France to central Sweden and Estonia. We surveyed the abundance of I. ricinus, plant community composition, forest structure and soil properties and compiled data on landscape structure, macroclimate and habitat properties. We used linear mixed models to analyze patterns and derived the relative importance of the significant drivers. Results. Many drivers had, on their own, either a moderate or small explanatory value for the abundance of I. ricinus , but combined they explained a substantial part of variation. This emphasizes the complex ecology of I. ricinus and the relevance of environmental factors for tick abundance. Macroclimate only explained a small fraction of variation, while properties of macro- and microhabitat, which buffer macroclimate, had a considerable impact on tick abundance. The amount of forest and the composition of the surrounding rural landscape were additionally important drivers of tick abundance. Functional (dispersules) and structural (density of tree and shrub layers) properties of the habitat patch played an important role. Various diversity metrics had only a small relative importance. Ontogenetic tick stages showed pronounced differences in their response. The abundance of nymphs and adults is explained by the preceding stage with a positive relationship, indicating a cumulative effect of drivers. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that the ecosystem disservices of tick-borne diseases, via the abundance of ticks, strongly depends on habitat properties and thus on how humans manage ecosystems from the scale of the microhabitat to the landscape. This study stresses the need to further evaluate the interaction between climate change and ecosystem management on I. ricinus abundance.",2323,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

Therefore, there is a need to understand how infection risk is related to green space characteristics, wildlife communities and connectivity with rural areas hosting reservoir populations of hosts. Our hypothesis is that wildlife hosts in urban green spaces, and thereby the prevalence of questing ticks and their Lyme disease causing pathogens ( Borrelia burgdorferi s.l.), can be partly predicted based on green space characteristics as well as measures of connectivity to known source areas. We sampled ticks in twenty-two green spaces during Spring (2014 and 2016) and Autumn 2016, located along an urbanization gradient in Antwerp (Belgium). More than 18,000 m 2 was sampled, with tick densities ranging from 0 to 386 individuals/100 m 2 . We estimated connectivity using the least-cost algorithm as either the cost distance to the nearest green space, or to a known population of roe deer ( Capreolus capreolus ), known to be an important tick propagation host. Both connectivity measures turned out to be correlated, reflecting a gradient in green space isolation from the periphery to the urban center. In 87% of plots where ticks were trapped, at least one Borrelia -infected tick was found. The overall Borrelia -prevalence in nymphs was 17.8%, in adults 32.6%. Density of infected ticks decreased with urbanization and increased with connectivity. Nymphs in larger green spaces were more likely to be infected. While density and infection prevalence for adults increased with the amount of neighboring agricultural land, the larval density and nymphal infection prevalence decreased. Interestingly, the proportion of Borrelia genospecies associated with birds or mammals was comparable in rural and (sub)urban areas (bird/mammal: 0.38), suggesting that even in small green spaces Borrelia infections can persist in local host populations.",1988,0,0,0,1,en,en,

In the absence of definitive diagnosis, healthcare providers are likely to prescribe empirical antibacterials to those who test negative for malaria. This problem is of critical importance in Southern Asia (SA) and South-eastern Asia (SEA) where high levels of antimicrobial consumption and high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance have been reported. To improve management and guide further diagnostic test development, better understanding is needed of the true causative agents of fever and their geographical variability. Methods. We conducted a systematic review of published literature (1980–2015) to characterise the spectrum of pathogens causing non-malarial febrile illness in SA and SEA. We searched six databases in English and French languages: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health (CABI) database, WHO Global Health Library, PASCAL, and Bulletin de la Société Française de Parasitologie (BDSP). Selection criteria included reporting on an infection or infections with a confirmed diagnosis, defined as pathogens detected in or cultured from samples from normally sterile sites, or serological evidence of current or past infection. Results. A total of 29,558 records from 19 countries in SA and SEA were screened, of which 2410 (8.1%) met the selection criteria. Bacterial aetiologies were reported in 1235 (51.2%) articles, viral in 846 (35.1%), parasitic in 132 (5.5%), and fungal in 54 (2.2%), and 143 (6.0%) articles reported more than one pathogen group. In descending order of frequency, Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and coagulase negative Staphylococcus were the commonly reported bacteria, while dengue virus, chikungunya virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus were common viral pathogens reported. Reports of rarely reported or emerging pathogens included a case report of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) in India in 2010 and reports of Nipah virus in Singapore and India. Conclusions. This review summarises the reported non-malaria pathogens that may cause febrile illness in SA and SEA. The findings emphasise the need of standardising the reporting of aetiological studies to develop effective, evidence-based fever management and improved surveillance.

Small fiber neuropathy develops due to the selective damage of the thin fibers of peripheral nerves. Many common diseases can cause this condition, including diabetes, infections, autoimmune and endocrine disorders, but it can occur due to genetic alterations, as well. Eighty-five skin biopsy-proven small-fiber neuropathy cases were analyzed. Forty-one (48%) cases were idiopathic; among secondary types, hypothyreosis (9.4%), diabetes mellitus (7%), cryoglobulinemia (7%), monoclonal gammopathy with unproved significance (4.7%), Sjögren’s disease (3%), and paraneoplastic neuropathy (3%) were the most common causes. Two-thirds (68%) of the patients were female, and the secondary type started 8 years later than the idiopathic one. In a vast majority of the cases (85%), the distribution followed a length-dependent pattern. Intraepidermal fiber density was comparable in idiopathic and secondary forms. Of note, we found significantly more severe pathology in men and in diabetes. Weak correlation was found between patient-reported measures and pathology, as well as with neuropathic pain-related scores. Our study confirmed the significance of small fiber damage-caused neuropathic symptoms in many clinical conditions, the gender differences in clinical settings, and pathological alterations, as well as the presence of severe small fiber pathology in diabetes mellitus, one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy. 1. Introduction. The majority of cases with peripheral neuropathy has a combined involvement of large and small nerve fibers, but sometimes, the damage of different types of fibers are unequal. Certain diseases cause predominantly large fiber damage (e.g., B12 vitamin deficiency), others prefer a small fiber lesion (e.g., Fabry’s disease). Furthermore, special structures, such as axons and myelin, are usually differently involved [ 1 ]. Small fiber neuropathy (SFN) develops due to the lesion of peripheral nerve fibers with a thin myelin sheath (A δ ) and without myelin (C fibers). These fibers are responsible for the mediation of temperature and pain sensations, as well as the control of autonomic functions; they build up to 80-90% of the peripheral nerves [ 2 – 4 ]. Patients suffering from SFN usually develop somatic symptoms, but autonomic dysfunctions might occur as well. Somatic symptoms can include numbness, paraesthesia, hypo- or hyperalgesia, allodynia, and neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is debilitating; it is characterized by burning, prickling, itching, stabbing, and “lightning-like” sensations; therefore, it has a considerable impact on quality of life [ 5 ]. Autonomic disturbances include dry eyes and mouth, abnormal sweating, altered gastrointestinal motility and bladder control, abnormal heart-rate variability, and orthostatic issues such as hypotension and tachycardia [ 5 , 6 ]. Recently, a subclassification was suggested according to the dominant symptoms [ 7 ]. The frequency of SFN is not exactly known. A recent Dutch study showed an incidence rate of 11.7/100,000 and a prevalence rate of 52.9/100,000 [ 8 ]. SFN might be idiopathic, when the underlying cause cannot be identified, but several common diseases might cause it; therefore, patients with SFN have to undergo many diagnostic tests to identify or exclude metabolic, malignant, infectious, or genetic diseases [ 9 , 10 ]. A further difficulty is that SFN might be an initial phase of neuropathy, and it can later progress to thick-fiber involvement as well. Further studies with long-term follow-up are required to characterize the natural evolution of SFN [ 11 ]. 2. Materials and Methods. We performed a cross-sectional, single-institution, prospective study including a cohort of patients investigated with SFN between the years of 2012 and 2018 at the Neurology Department, University of Pécs, Medical School, Pécs, Hungary. All patients provided written informed consent before enrollment, and the study was approved by the institutional Review Board of University of Pécs, Hungary. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) typical complaints related to small-fiber involvement, such as neuropathic pain; (2) physical signs of SFN, including loss of pain and/or temperature sensation, and/or autonomic signs, hyperalgesia, and allodynia, and (3) abnormal skin biopsy findings with reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). According to the diagnostic criteria, all of our patients belonged to the definite SFN category [ 12 ]. 2.1. Skin Biopsy. All patients underwent skin biopsy. The biopsy was performed according to a standardized technique. Briefly, skin biopsy specimens were obtained using a 3 or 4 mm punch from the leg, 10 cm above the lateral malleolus in local anesthesia. The samples were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24-48 hours, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose phosphate-buffered saline for 24 hours, and frozen to -80°C embedded into OCT freezing compound overnight. Fifty-micrometer-thick cryostat-cut frozen slides were used when proceeding to immunohistochemistry. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin, 1% lysine and 5% goat serum immunostaining of axons was performed against the panaxonal marker, PGP 9.5, with a polyclonal rabbit anti-human PGP 9.5 antibody (DAKO, Z511601-2, in a dilution of 1 : 1000 in 4°C). After a 48- to 72-hour incubation with a primary antibody, further steps with a biotinylated secondary antibody and development were carried out with the VECTASTAIN Elite ABC HRP Kit and the Vector SG substrate, respectively (Vector Laboratories). Those fibers which crossed the dermal/epidermal border were counted. The subepidermal network and the autonomic fibers supplying the sweat glands were also assessed. The integrity of the specimen was judged before the immunohistochemical procedure on a hematoxylin-eosin-stained routine slide. A minimum of 5 sections of a specimen were evaluated and averaged. Results were expressed as the number of IENF/mm according to the EFNS guidelines [ 13 ]. Values below the 0.05 quantile per age span for females and males were considered pathological as recommended [ 10 , 14 ]. Subepidermal nerve fiber density (SENFD) and autonomic fiber density (ANFD) around sweat glands were semiquantitatively evaluated on all slides from all cases with a 3-grade system: 0=no fibers; 1=moderate amount of fibers; and 2=abundant fibers. In each case, the result of the best specimen was recorded, but generally, no remarkable differences were found among slides prepared from one subject. 2.2. Clinical Test. Detailed neurological physical examination was performed in each case, including sensory tests for tactile stimuli (monofilament), pain (pinprick), temperature (standardized temperatures), joint position sensation, vibration (tuning fork), and recording of allodynia and hyperalgesia. All patients underwent extensive laboratory testing to exclude or prove the underlying cause, such as diabetes mellitus, renal and hepatic dysfunction, hypothyroidism, infections (hepatitis B and C and Lyme disease), autoimmune disease (immune serology for Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematodes, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis), paraproteinemia (serum electrophoresis), paraneoplastic syndromes (onconeural antibodies, chest X-ray, or CT, abdominal ultrasonography, or CT), and vitamin B12 deficiency. The patients’ alcohol abuse and family history of SFN were also recorded. A blood spot test was applied for Fabry’s disease. All patients underwent detailed electrophysiology such as sensory and motor nerve conduction studies of the upper and lower extremities and electromyography of deltoid, abductor pollicis brevis, and anterior tibial muscles. According to the results, patients were classified as (1) idiopathic SFN (iSFN, when the underlying cause was not found, electrophysiology was negative, and IEFD was decreased); (2) secondary, pure SFN (sSFN, when the underlying cause was identified, electrophysiology was negative, and IEFD was decreased); (3) SFN with axonal neuropathy; and (4) SFN with demyelinating neuropathy (regardless of the underlying cause, but with decreased IEFD and positive electrophysiology). A detailed analysis was only performed for the isolated SFN groups (1 and 2). 2.3. SFN-Related Tests. The Toronto clinical neuropathy scoring system (TCNS) was recorded for each case to assess the severity of neuropathy. It is a weighted scoring system for symptoms of neuropathic pain, sensory loss, motor functions, and deep tendon reflexes of the lower limb; therefore, large and small fiber functions are included as well [ 15 ]. The Douleur neuropathique 4 questionnaire (DN4) was applied for the screening of neuropathic pain (NP) [ 16 ]. The Pain Detect Questionnaire (PD-Q9) and The Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) were used to evaluate different pain qualities associated to NP [ 17 , 18 ]. Both are simple, self-administered tests, allowing the detection dimensions and different qualities of NP on a quantitative scale [ 19 ]. A Hungarian form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered for the assessment of depression [ 20 ]. Finally, the pain intensity was recorded on an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS). 2.4. Statistics. Differences were compared by Student’s - test for continuous variables and by chi-square test or ANOVA for categorical variables. Normality test was performed for all continuous variables. The data analysis was performed using the SPSS v.25 statistical program (IBM Inc., Chicago, USA). The level of significance was set as 0.05. 3. Results. Between the years of 2012 and 2018, we found 117 patients fulfilling the criteria of biopsy-proven small-fiber involvement. Eighty-five of them were pure SFN (35% idiopathic, 37.6% secondary), 23 patients (19.7%) had SFN associated with axonal neuropathy, and 9 patients (7.7%) with demyelinating large fiber neuropathy. For further analysis, we included only the isolated SFN patients. Forty-one patients (48%) of the pure SFN group were idiopathic. Table 1 shows the comparison of the basic characteristics of patients with iSFN or sSFN. Two thirds (68%) of the study population were female, and this predominance was even significantly higher in the sSFN group. The disease started 8 years later in the sSFN ( ). The distribution of clinical symptoms followed a length-dependent pattern in the vast majority of the cases (85%), and only occasional patients were found with burning mouth and vulvodynia or with diffuse complaints. Typical complaints of neuropathic pain were found, but the quantitative evaluation was limited because almost all patients were under treatment. iSFN ( ) sSFN ( ) Sign.

Although the ratio of females and the onset of the disease was significantly higher in the secondary SFN (sSFN) group, all other parameters were not statistically different from idiopathic SFN (iSFN). LD: length dependent; NLD: nonlength-dependent; ns.: nonsignificant. Table 1 Basic characteristics of the study population. The results of NP-related scoring are presented in Table 2 . All recorded parameters were in the middle range, including VAS, DN4, PD-Q9, and NPS. DN4, PD-Q9, and NPS were positive in 68, 81, and 42%, respectively. TCNS results were in the lower middle range, because it measures small- and large-fiber involvement as well. It showed a mild, moderate, or severe neuropathy in 19, 10, and 2%, respectively. BDI was normal in the majority of the cases, and a mild to moderate depression was only detected in 20% of the iSFN group. iSFN ( ) sSFN ( ) Sign. BMI (kg/m 2 ) 26.0 (4.3) 27.4 (4.9) ns.

There were no significant differences between idiopathic (iSFN) and secondary SFN (sSFN) in respect of the majority of the investigated parameters. ANFD: autonomic nerve fiber density; IENFD: intraepidermal nerve fiber density; NPS: Neuropathic Pain Scale; SENFD: subepidermal nerve fiber density; TCNS: Toronto Clinical Neuropathy Scoring System; VAS: visual analogue scale; ns.: not significant difference. Table 2 The main findings of pain-related tests in the study population. IENFD was fibers/mm ( ), but it varied in a large scale from 0 to 11. Figure 1 demonstrates that the results were comparable in idiopathic and secondary SFN patients, but the distribution did not follow the normal pattern (not shown). Figure 1 Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) in idiopathic (iSFN) and secondary SFN (sSFN). No significant differences were found between the two cohorts. The analysis of the subgroups showed more severe small fiber loss in men compared to women (IENFD was fibers/mm and fibers/mm, respectively, ). Patients with diabetes had lower IENFD compared to nondiabetic patients (IENFD was fibers/mm and fibers/mm, respectively, ). Compared to those patients whose IENFD was below or above 5 fibers/mm, we found that DN4 was significantly higher ( and , respectively, ) and patients were more depressed, as BDI showed ( and , respectively, ) in the group with more severe pathology. IENFD showed significant negative correlation with the age of patients ( , ) (Figure 2 ). Figure 2 Relationship of the IENFD and age. Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) showed negative correlation with the age of the investigated subjects. Subepidermal nerve fiber density was variable, but it was usually comparable to IENFD. Grades 0, 1, and 2 were found in 29%, 59%, and 12%, respectively; therefore, the majority of the cases presented moderate fiber loss. In opposite, the autonomic innervation was usually spared (cases with grade 0, 1, and 2 were 15%, 36%, and 49%, respectively). Statistical analysis resulted in significant association between IENFD, SENFD, and ANFD, but it was absent when the histological findings were compared to clinical variables. Generally, low SENFD and ANFD were associated with low IENFD. Significant differences in IENFD were found between grade 0 and grade 2 of SENFD ( ), and it was also significant when we compared grade 0 to grade 1 or 2 of ANFD ( and , respectively) (Figure 3 ). Figure 3 Correlations of intraepidermal, subepidermal, and autonomic fiber densities. Although, subepidermal nerve fiber density (SENFD) and autonomic nerve fiber density (ANFD) were assessed semiquantitatively, the amount of these fibers was comparable to intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD). Asterisks mark significant differences from grade 0. The most common causes of sSFN were hypothyroidism (Hashimoto’s disease), diabetes mellitus, and cryoglobulinemia. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), Sjögren’s syndrome, and paraneoplastic process were rare, as well as Lyme disease (Table 3 ). Among the remaining secondary cases, routine laboratory tests resulted in renal dysfunction (1 case) and antinuclear antibody positivity without systemic autoimmune symptoms (3 cases). Vitamin B12 levels, viral serology, and the Fabry tests were all normal. Disease Frequency (%) Hashimoto 8 (9.4) Diabetes 6 (7) Cryoglobulinemia 6 (7) MGUS 4 (4.7) Sjögren’s syndrome 3 (3.5) Malignancy 3 (3.5) Lyme disease 2 (2.3) MGUS: monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance; N: number of cases. Table 3 The most common diseases associated with SFN. Pain-killing medication was administered to 64 patients (75%), and half of them received combined treatment. The most common medications were benzodiazepines (32%), tricyclic antidepressants (23%), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (17%), gabapentin (17%), pregabalin (15%), and tramadol-opioids (14%). Four patients received immune modulatory treatments. We found significant gender differences in pain scores. Mean of DN4, PD-Q9, NPS, and VAS was significantly higher in cases of female patients compared to males (all ). Although the minority of patients had depression, a significant correlation was found among BDI score and VAS or PD-Q9 ( , and , , respectively). 4. Discussion. The clinical presentation of SFN is heterogeneous, and the most frequent pattern is a length-dependent polyneuropathy, characterized by the typical symptoms appearing on the distal part of the extremities, mostly on feet; rarely, a non-length-dependent neuropathy can appear, mainly with patchy symptoms in a certain part of the body, such as the face, tongue, and trunk, as well as multiple mononeuropathy [ 6 , 21 ]. In our cohort, the non-length-dependent SFN occurred in 15%, according to the clinical findings. We did not find differences in either IENFD or other clinical data, regarding the distribution. In opposite, Khan and Zhou reported a lower frequency of diabetes mellitus and a higher frequency of autoimmune diseases in the non-length-dependent group. The ratio of females was higher, and the onset was earlier among those patients [ 21 ]. The diagnosis of SFN is still challenging despite of increasing knowledge and available diagnostic tools. Clinical criteria were established only for the length-dependent form; in other cases, the diagnosis is more difficult. The assessment of the IENFD is a noninvasive and sensitive method to prove the disease; it was recommended by the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) and the Peripheral Nerve Society (PNS) in 2010 with level A evidence. Additionally, the assessment of intraepidermal nerves results not only in quantitative measures but prognostically important morphological changes can also be observed, such as length, branching, and axonal swelling [ 13 , 22 , 23 ]. Here, we did not assess morphological changes other than the count of intraepidermal fibers, because this parameter was accepted as the evidence of SFN. Generally, alternative assessments for evidence of SFN quantitative sensory testing (QST) [ 24 ] and contact heat-evoked potential test (CHEP) are recommended; however, the first one is time consuming and contains subjective domains, and the latter is not widely available [ 24 , 25 ]. Based on the extensive investigations, less than half of the patients were classified as idiopathic SFN in our study. This is slightly lower than was reported in previous publications (53-76%) [ 9 , 21 , 26 – 28 ]. One possible explanation is that many patients had hypothyreosis in our cohort. In these cases, the causality was not proven, but they were classified as sSFN. Mild gender differences were common in previous studies with a ratio of females between 41 and 58% [ 21 , 26 , 28 ], but it was 71% in a study [ 27 ]. Our cohort was similar to the latest one with 68% female predominance. A battery of neuropathy tests was used, because physical examination was reported having a low diagnostic accuracy [ 28 ]. Variable results were published about correlations of physical alterations, neuropathy scores, and IENFD. Loss of pain sensation and pain intensity on VAS were reported to be related to IENFD [ 29 , 30 ]. In our study, the DN4 score was the only finding that was significantly related to the severity of the intraepidermal fiber loss. Comparing iSFN and sSFN, significant differences were found in the ratio of genders, age of the patients, and disease onset. None of the remaining investigated parameters was significantly different between the above groups, including distribution of symptoms and types of pain qualities, as well as pain intensity and results of neuropathy scoring. These data might indicate that loss of intradermal thin fibers results to similar clinical symptoms regardless of the underlying causes. We found a significant effect of gender on IENFD, but it was not related to the age and the type of lesion, as well as the etiology. Interestingly, higher IENFD (less severe pathology) and higher pain scores (more severe clinical appearance) were found in female patients, but close correlation was not found between them, with the exception of DN4 score. In previous studies, variable gender effects have been reported. The gender difference in IENFD in a healthy population is well known, and it seems the pathology follows this trend. The second important finding of our study is the effect of diabetes on SFN. Diabetes-induced SFN has earlier been found to be associated with more severe pathological changes [ 28 , 31 , 32 ], which we confirmed here. Although TCNS was reported with the highest diagnostic yield in diabetic neuropathy [ 33 ], here we found positive results in only 30.7% of the cases, which can be explained by the absence of large-fiber involvement. Recently, corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) has been proven to be a sensitive and comparable method to skin biopsy in the diagnostics of diabetic SFN [ 24 , 34 ]. Further studies in large cohorts of SFN with a different etiology are necessary to confirm the reliability of CCM as a diagnostic tool in SFN and its comparison to histological methods. Because of the limited availability of pain-related evoked potential tests and CCM, QST and skin biopsy remain the standard diagnostic procedures in case of SFN. Precise procedure and strict usage of normal values are necessary for reliable results. A limited number of studies investigated SENFD and ANFD, and no clear clinical importance of their changes was determined. Furthermore, less clear-cut diagnostic criteria were established for these pathological changes, and the quantification is more difficult. Although in our study low IENFD was statistically associated with low SENFD and ANFD, in our practice, the autonomic innervation of sweat glands has remained intact or minimally involved even in severe SFN cases, and therefore, staining of nerve fibers around sweat glands might serve as a quality control of immunohistochemistry. The therapy of our patients was conducted according to the guidelines of neuropathic pain treatment [ 35 ], but, somehow, benzodiazepine usage was common. It can be explained by the anxiety of patients due to the sort of investigations and the chronic troublesome pain. Our study was limited because we applied only a cross-sectional investigation, and it is known that IENFD may change in time and due to clinical conditions; therefore, a long-term follow-up study would be recommended. Furthermore, no additional clinical tests, such as QST or CCM were systemically carried out for comparison because of limited time and availability of the tools. The pain intensity assessment was also limited, because the majority of patients was on pain medication. A genetic survey was not conducted, either. In summary, our results are in line with previous publications. We found significant differences of IENFD in SFN regarding gender and the presence of diabetes. Although, the frequency of SFN is nor clearly known, it can be variable according to race and gender. The number of possible underlying conditions is significant, and we have to perform all recommended tests to exclude the potentially treatable forms, otherwise only symptomatic therapy is available for patients.

The evaluation of these patients can often be overwhelming due to the vast and complicated etiologies as well as the potential for devastating neurologic outcomes. Dysfunction of the cranial nerves can occur anywhere in their course from intrinsic brainstem dysfunction to their peripheral courses. The focus of this review will be on the extramedullary causes of multiple cranial neuropathies as discussion of the brainstem syndromes is more relevant when considering intrinsic disorders of the brainstem. The goals are to provide the reader with an overview of those extramedullary conditions that have a predilection for causing multiple cranial nerve palsies. In turn, this will serve to provide a practical and systematic approach to allow for a more targeted diagnostic evaluation of this, often cumbersome, presentation.

3306,bmc medicine,"Vocation and avocation: leisure activities correlate with professional engagement, but not burnout, in a cross-sectional survey of UK doctors","['IC McManus', 'H Jonvik', 'P Richards', 'E Paice']",10.1186/1741-7015-9-100,2011.0,64,HTML,"Background. Sir William Osler suggested in 1899 that avocations (leisure activities) in doctors are related to an increased sense of vocation (professional engagement) and a decreased level of burnout. This study evaluated those claims in a large group of doctors practicing in the UK while taking into account a wide range of background variables. Methods. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 4,457 UK-qualified doctors who had been included in four previous studies of medical school selection and training, beginning in 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1989/1991. A total of 2,845 (63.8%) doctors returned the questionnaire. Questions particularly asked about work engagement, satisfaction with medicine as a career, and personal achievement (Vocation/engagement), stress, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (BurnedOut), and 29 different leisure activities (Avocation/Leisure), as well as questions on personality, empathy, work experience, and demography. Results. Doctors reporting more Avocation/Leisure activities tended to be women, to have older children, to be less surface-rational, more extravert, more open to experience, less agreeable, and to fantasize more. Doctors who were more BurnedOut tended to be men, to be more sleep-deprived, to report a greater workload and less choice and independence in their work, to have higher neuroticism, lower extraversion and lower agreeableness scores, and to have lower self-esteem. In contrast, doctors with a greater sense of Vocation/engagement, tended to see more patients, to have greater choice and independence at work, to have a deep approach to work, to have a more supportive-receptive work environment, to be more extravert and more conscientious, and to report greater self-esteem. Avocation/Leisure activities correlated significantly with Vocation/engagement, even after taking into account 25 background variables describing demography, work, and personality, whereas BurnedOut showed no significant correlation with Avocation/Leisure activities. Popular Culture and High Culture did not differ in their influence on Vocation/engagement, although there was a suggestion that Depersonalization was correlated with more interest in Popular Culture and less interest in High Culture. Conclusion. In this cross-sectional study there is evidence, even after taking into account a wide range of individual difference measures, that doctors with greater Avocation/Leisure activities also have a greater sense of Vocation/Engagement. In contrast, being BurnedOut did not relate to Avocation/Leisure activities (but did relate to many other measures). Osler was probably correct in recommending to doctors that, 'While medicine is to be your vocation, or calling, see to it that you also have an avocation'.",2767,0,1,0,0,it,en,

Approaches to epidemiological surveillance and control to the spread of the agents of especially dangerous diseases on endemic areas are described for zoonosis that has a medical value. The knowledge of specific design of tools for the implementation of epidemiological surveillance, monitoring and evaluation of natural foci diseases in developing countries is low; accordingly, little is known on the ecology and transmission dynamics for the agents of especially dangerous diseases. Important is to know the effectiveness of serological monitoring of the indigenous population to determine the activity of natural foci of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, tick-borne encephalitis, tularemia, Q-fever, Lyme disease and West Nile disease. The main species of reservoirs and vectors for these agents have been determined in different regions of Ukraine. New tick-borne agents that were unknown for certain regions have been detected. These data indicate the spreading of different pathogens in combination with natural foci.",1145,0,1,0,0,it,en,

With the resurgence of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease and the emergence of new tick-borne pathogens such as Powassan virus, understanding what distinguishes vectors from non-vectors, and predicting undiscovered tick vectors is a crucial step towards mitigating disease risk in humans. We aimed to identify intrinsic traits that predict which Ixodes tick species are confirmed or strongly suspected to be vectors of zoonotic pathogens. Methods. We focused on the well-studied tick genus Ixodes from which many species are known to transmit zoonotic diseases to humans. We apply generalized boosted regression to interrogate over 90 features for over 240 species of Ixodes ticks to learn what intrinsic features distinguish zoonotic vectors from non-vector species. In addition to better understanding the biological underpinnings of tick vectorial capacity, the model generates a per species probability of being a zoonotic vector on the basis of intrinsic biological similarity with known Ixodes vector species. Results. Our model predicted vector status with over 91% accuracy, and identified 14 Ixodes species with high probabilities (80%) of transmitting infections from animal hosts to humans on the basis of their traits. Distinguishing characteristics of zoonotic tick vectors of Ixodes tick species include several anatomical structures that influence host seeking behavior and blood-feeding efficiency from a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vectors. Conclusions. Overall, these results suggest that zoonotic tick vectors are most likely to be those species where adult females hold a fecundity advantage by producing more eggs per clutch, which develop into larvae that feed on a greater diversity of host species compared to non-vector species. These larvae develop into nymphs whose anatomy are well suited for more efficient and longer feeding times on soft-bodied hosts compared to non-vectors, leading to larger adult females with greater fecundity. In addition to identifying novel, testable hypotheses about intrinsic features driving vectorial capacity across Ixodes tick species, our model identifies particular Ixodes species with the highest probability of carrying zoonotic diseases, offering specific targets for increased zoonotic investigation and surveillance.",2324,0,1,0,0,cy,en,

This review describes mosquito- and tick-borne diseases found in the Western Hemisphere. It focuses on emerging diseases and recent geographic shifts in the presence of disease vectors. Recent Findings. Mosquito and tick vectors have become more widespread as environmental conditions have become more favorable. Zika recently has emerged as a concern for fetal anomalies. West Nile Virus has become widespread. Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases are more prevalent in areas previously inhospitable to these ticks. Summary. Healthcare providers must consider the possibility of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases in broader geographic areas and council patients traveling to endemic areas on precautions against these diseases.

However, based on current knowledge about drivers of disease emergence, we show that High Asia is rapidly developing conditions that favor increased emergence of infectious diseases and zoonoses. This is because of the existing prevalence of potentially serious pathogens in the system; intensifying environmental degradation; rapid changes in local ecological, socio-ecological, and socio-economic factors; and global risk intensifiers such as climate change and globalization. To better understand and manage the risks posed by diseases to humans, livestock, and wildlife, there is an urgent need for establishing a disease surveillance system and improving human and animal health care.

Each woman experienced symptoms that are not usual in panic disorder but are typical of neurological Lyme disease, including exquisite sensitivity to light, touch, and sounds, joint pain often in combination with cognitive changes including mental fogginess and loss of recent memory, and some degree of bizarre, shifting, and often excruciating neurological pain. Because these symptoms are atypical of primary panic disorder, they were very helpful in alerting the clinician to suspect an underlying physical illness. In each case, the results of testing revealed positive hallmarks of disseminated Lyme and other tick-borne diseases, including Lyme borreliosis caused by the spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, babesiosis , and ehrlichiosis. Since beginning treatment with intensive doses of appropriate antimicrobial medications for their tick-borne infections, all three patients have become free of panic attacks. Treatment of their infections by a specialist in Lyme disease allowed one of the women to discontinue anti-anxiety medication completely and another to reduce the dose of medication to occasional use only. The third patient is no longer anxious but her depression is resolving more slowly despite the ongoing use of an antidepressant. Two of the patients have also needed ongoing medication for pain and other symptoms of late-stage, neurological Lyme disease.",1545,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A thalassi‐noides‐Chondrites‐Arenicolites assemblage (diversity up to 7 ichnogenera) is typical of pale marls or limestones. Blue Lias limestones are diagenetic: dark laminated limestones and pale bioturbated limestones are cemented equivalents of laminated black shales and pale marls, respectively. However, pale burrow fills in darker sediments and vice versa confirm the rhythms are primary. Rhythms represent redox cycles, fluctuating from anoxic laminated black shales lacking mac‐robenthos or infauna (bioturbation index = 0) to oxic, bioturbated, pale marls or limestones with large mac‐robenthos such as Gryphaea or Plagiostoma and diverse infauna (bioturbation index = 5).",1336,0,0,1,0,de,en,

Four patients fulfilled the criteria for Lyme borreliosis. No specific risk factors were found with which to predict the occurrence of Lyme borreliosis among patients with hearing loss. In logistic regression modeling the poor outcome of hearing loss was best explained by advanced age, high-frequency or flat-type hearing loss, and absence of positive levels of antibodies against B. burgdorferi . Although the causal relationship between Lyme borreliosis and sensorineural hearing loss is difficult to verify, we suggest that Lyme borreliosis is a rare but potentially treatable cause of sudden deafness.

Vaccination with OspA generates an immune response that can prevent bacterial transmission to a mammalian host during the attachment of an infected tick. However, the protective capacity of immune sera cannot be predicted by measuring total anti-OspA antibody. The murine monoclonal antibody LA-2 defines an important protective B-cell epitope of OspA against which protective sera have strong levels of reactivity. We have now mapped the LA-2 epitope of OspA using both NMR chemical-shift perturbation measurements in solution and X-ray crystal structure determination. LA-2 recognizes the three surface-exposed loops of the C-terminal domain of OspA that are on the tip of the elongated molecule most distant from the lipid-modified N terminus. The structure suggests that the natural variation at OspA sequence position 208 in the first loop is a major limiting factor for antibody cross-reactivity between different Lyme disease-causing Borrelia strains. The unusual Fab-dominated lattice of the crystal also permits a rare view of antigen flexibility within an antigen:antibody complex. These results provide a rationale for improvements in OspA-based vaccines and suggest possible designs for more direct tests of antibody protective levels in vaccinated individuals.",1404,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The involvement of the temporal lobes in both patterns is likely associated with the memory disturbances described in many of these patients.

This project develops a theory describing how physicians learn and formulate decisions in the context of diagnosing Lyme disease in order that educational programs can be designed to improve accuracy in diagnosis of this disease. Methods: A qualitative study using grounded theory methodology was performed to explore the learning process of physicians when diagnosing Lyme disease. Nine physicians were interviewed, and the interview transcripts were coded into categories to form a theory about how physicians learn in practice. Results: Patient–physician interactions initiate the learning process by setting a context for which physicians frame a problem according to familiarity. Repetitive, similar, and counter-experiences, combined with cognitive knowledge, contribute to that framework and influence how the problem is framed along a continuum of familiarity. Furthermore, these experiences serve as information that influences diagnostic decisions and physicians' behaviors. Discussion: For teaching and learning, cases and examples should include sufficient variety, repetition, and counterexperiences that allow a physician to appropriately recognize and categoize a patient's signs and symptoms into a disease category. Resources for information should be readily available and current. Preceptors and physician colleagues should provide timely feedback on diagnostic accuracy, and case studies should be presented with contextual elements that facilitate the diagnosis of Lyme disease.",1731,0,0,1,0,en,en,

We found highly significant genetic differentiation between Swiss and Tunisian samples but detected almost no differentiation within Switzerland, even between those samples separated by the Alps. Interestingly, we found that I. ricinus females were more genetically related to one another than were males at a local scale, which would indicate a higher dispersal rate of immature males.

Method: Case report. Background: A 7 4-year-old man presented with rapid onset of weakness, numbness, and tingling in his legs, with symptoms ascending to his hands and forearms within days. He recalled an insect bite to his scapular area 2 weeks earlier. Findings: T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated diffuse hyperintensity from T1 through T1 2. Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay identified infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete responsible for Lyme disease. Giemsa-stained blood smears identified ring forms later recognized by polymerase chain reaction as Babesia microti, the piroplasm responsible for babesiosis. Initial examination revealed C7 motor and T3 sensory complete tetraplegia, with recovery to T 4 paraplegia by 2 months. Conclusion: The history, physical examination, imaging, and serologic studies were consistent with transverse myelitis related to Lyme disease and babesiosis. The severity and permanence of this patient’s deficits were greater than those reported in the majority of previous cases of transverse myelitis due to Lyme disease alone, suggesting a possible role for coinfection with babesiosis.",1280,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Although it is the most common arthropod-borne disease in the U.S. and Europe, reports of the clinical cases have been relatively rare in Korea. The disease may affect different organs, such as nervous system, joints, heart or eyes, and the clinical pictures include meningitis, cranial neuritis, arthritis, temporary atrioventricular block, and conjunctivitis. The cutaneous manifestations are erythema(chronicum) migrans, borrelial lymphocytoma, and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans. Early localized infection occurs a few weeks after a tick bite, and erythema migrans is a classic cutaneous manifestation at this stage of infection. Several weeks later, early disseminated infection occurs with bacterial dissemination. Multiple erythema migrans-like skin lesions, neuroborreliosis, arthritis, and carditis can develop. Without treatment, the disease can progress to late or chronic infection, and then acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans may develop in addition to the systemic manifestations. The disease can be diagnosed with serologic tests such as indirect immunofluorescence test or ELISA. The recommended treatment is oral doxycycline or amoxicillin, and the treatment period is variable depending on the organ involved and the duration of the disease. A vaccine for the Lyme disease is approved for adults and commercially available in the Unites States. However, protection from tick bites by the use of protective clothing in risk areas and body inspection and removal of any attached ticks as soon as possible are the most important prophylactic methods. Chemoprophylaxis after a tick bite is also available.",1788,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Materials and methods. – Studied sera were those received by the Pasteur-Cerba laboratory in 2003. IgG and IgM isotypes were detected using the Dade Behring kits. Antibody specificity was analysed with the Meridian's western blot. Results. – 1504/16 176 (9%) sera were positive for IgG isotype, and 978/3298 (29%) for IgM. The specificity was confirmed by western blot in 49% cases for IgG and in 54% for IgM. The highest positive serology rates were found in eastern and centre regions and in Aquitaine. Forty-two cases have been investigated leading to the identification of 16 borreliosis cases, each suffering of an erythema migrans. Five of them had neurological signs. Patient mean age was 40 years. 87% of patients had risk factors and 69% reported previous tick bites, mainly on lower limbs. Conclusion. – A low rate of positive borreliosis sera was found, suggesting that serology prescription should be limited to patients suffering of compatible clinical signs, as recommanded by the EUCALB. Erythema migrans was the most frequent clinical manifestation and neurological signs were present in 30% of cases.

We have hypothesized that, as with some neurodegenerative diseases, the pathogenesis of the neurocognitive deficiencies associated with Lyme neuroborreliosis of the central nervous system also has an inflammatory component. Dysregulated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α can lead to neuronal damage. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) play a key role in the regulation of neuronal development, growth, and survival, as well as that of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. As a model, we explored the possibility that MAPK-mediated lipoprotein-induced apoptosis and gliosis of rhesus monkey astrocytes stimulated in vitro. Lipoproteins are the key inflammatory molecule type of Borrelia burgdorferi , the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, and we had previously shown that lipoprotein-induced TNF-α production in astrocytes caused astrocyte apoptosis, and IL-6 enhanced proliferation of these cells. Lipoproteins readily activated p38 and Erk1/2 MAPK, thus enlisting these pathways among the kinase pathways that spirochetes may address as they invade the central nervous system. We also investigated whether specific inhibition of p38 and Erk1/2 MAPK would inhibit TNF-α and IL-6 production and thus astrocyte apoptosis, and proliferation, respectively. Lipoprotein-stimulated IL-6 production was unaffected by the MAPK inhibitors. In contrast, inhibition of both p38 and Erk1/2 significantly diminished TNF-α production, and totally abrogated production of this cytokine when both MAPK pathways were inhibited simultaneously. MAPK inhibition thus may be considered as a strategy to control inflammation and apoptosis in Lyme neuroborreliosis.",1828,0,0,1,0,fr,en,

C3H Stat1 –/– mice exhibited increased inflammation in the heart, whereas carditis was unchanged in DBA Stat1 –/– mice.

Hassler'],10.1055/s-2006-958722,2007.0,0,journal-article,"Buy Article Permissions and Reprints Zusammenfassung Borrelieninfektionen sind die häufigsten zeckenübertragenen Infektionen überhaupt. Etwa 4% aller Zeckenstiche verursachen eine derartige Infektion. In aller Regel wird diese Infektion zunächst durch ein Erythema migrans an der Stichstelle sichtbar, bevor es zu einer Erregergeneralisation kommt. Durch adäquate Zeckenentfernung lassen sich viele Infektionen verhindern. Die Klinik der Borrelieninfektion ist äußerst vielfältig, im Spätstadium ist eine Kombination von Allgemeinsymptomen wie Nachtschweiß und Abgeschlagenheit mit Symptomen am Bewegungsapparat (Myalgien, Arthralgien) typisch. Die Diagnostik stützt sich neben der klinischen Symptomatik vor allem auf serologische Testverfahren, deren Durchführung und Interpretation inzwischen standardisiert sind. Die Borreliose kann in jedem Stadium erfolgreich therapiert werden. Bei der frischen Infektion genügt eine orale Therapie, im chronischen Stadium sind intravenöse Therapieregime notwendig.

A number of other spirochetal diseases, if contracted in pregnancy, have been shown to cause fetal harm and there is concern over a similar effect with gestational borreliosis. Previously published individual case reports have suggested a possible association between gestational borreliosis and adverse pregnancy outcome; however, no specific pattern of teratogenicity has been shown, and a causal relationship has never been proven. In addition, larger epidemiological and serological series have consistently failed to demonstrate an increased risk to pregnant women who develop Lyme disease if they receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. We describe a favorable outcome in a 42-year-old woman who developed Lyme disease in the third trimester and was treated with a full course of oral amoxicillin. In addition, we offer a review of the relevant literature regarding Lyme disease and pregnancy. The appropriate investigation and management of a woman with gestational borreliosis are discussed. Target Audience: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians Learning Objectives: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to recall that Lyme disease is not an uncommon disease during pregnancy and can occur in states outside of the Northeast, explain that the diagnosis is made clinically and may be confirmed by laboratory tests, state that treatment is recommended during pregnancy, and summarize that there is no consistent data of adverse fetal effects even though the placenta is infected.",1598,0,0,1,0,ro,en,

To describe the outcome in a patient with macular edema caused by Lyme disease treated with injection of 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone. Methods. The patient, 2 years after systemic Lyme disease treated with doxycycline for 4 weeks, developed macular edema with serous retinal detachment in one eye (visual acuity: 0.6). After unsuccessful therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone, indomethacin and acetazolamide, 4 mg intravitreal triamcinolone (IVTA) was injected via the pars plana. Results. Visual acuity improved to 1.0 and macular thickness recovered over 1 month. No changes were found in intraocular pressure. No recurrence of macular edema was seen after 2 years. Conclusions. IVTA can restore visual acuity and reduce macular thickness in macular edema caused by Lyme disease. However, since borreliosis is a systemic disease, previous systemic antibiotic treatment is recommended.",900,0,0,1,0,en,ro,

It is generally considered that provincial brick production before 1760 was traditional in operation, hindered by transport costs and serving a market which was too small to act as a spur to capital investment. How did would-be builders therefore obtain bricks in communities which did not possess a resident brickmaker? A unique response by the authorities of Newcastle-under-Lyme was the financing of a municipal brick kiln. Paradoxically, this civic enterprise, together with the corporation's policy of restrictive housing leases and the lack of investment by the town's other major landowner, Lord Gower, proved disincentives to the employment of brick and coincided to restrict fashionable brick buildings to a small minority of independent townsfolk. In Newcastle therefore the transformation from timber-framed vernacular styles to the more uniform, brick-built, classically inspired style which nationally characterises so much urban building in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was a slow and hesitant process.",1201,0,0,1,0,en,en,

C. 8592 is here described. Discovered in 1824 by the first palaeontologist woman, Mary Anning, the specimen was sold by her to Constant Prévost who took it to Paris. This specimen is the second ever discovered plesiosaur and is here described for the first time even though it was figured by Cuvier ( 1825 ). The specimen is preserved in articulation and retained almost the entire post cranium but lacks the skull and most part of the neck. It preserves 56 vertebrae, most of the pectoral and pelvic girdles and most of the limbs. It was referred to Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus by Storrs ( 1997 ). Comparison with other specimens of Plesiosaurus dolichodeirus indicates that MNHN A. C. 8592 is an adult of advanced age. It reveals some unique features that may be attributed to ontogenetical and/or intraspecific variations.

Methods: Between 01.04.2009 and 31.03.2010 serum and cerebrospinal fluid from children with various neurological symptoms were analyzed using Biomedica kits. Positive samples were confirmed with MIKROGEN Diagnostik Immunoblot assay and tested with DRG Diagnostics kits. The Biomedica IgG kit contains recombinant antigens: OspC, p18, p100 and VIsE ; the IgM Biomedica kit contains recombinant antigens: OspC (B.afzelii, B.garinii), p41/I, VIsE. The DRG IgG kit contains recombinant VIsE antigen and lysate antigens from B.burgdorferi s.s., B.afzelii and B.garinii; the DRG IgM kit contains recombinant 14 kD protein and native OspC. Interpretation of the ELISA and Immunoblot was done according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results: A total of 379 samples (353 sera and 26 CSF) were analyzed for Borrelia antibodies. Antibodies against B.burgdorferi were detected by Biomedica kit in 55 samples from which 29 (52%) were confirmed with Immunoblot. Based on the Immunoblot analysis 29 / 379 (7,3 %) samples were considered as “true positive”. Among two ELISA tests, 26 sera were false-positive with the Biomedica test and 13 sera were false-positive with the DRG Diagnostics test.

Both LD and RF Borrelia species are obligate parasites and are dependent on nutrients provided by their hosts. The first step of nutrient uptake across the outer membrane of these Gram-negative bacteria is accomplished by water-filled channels, so-called porins. The knowledge of the porin composition in the outer membranes of the different pathogenic Borrelia species is limited. Only one porin has been described in relapsing fever spirochetes to date, whereas four porins are known to be present in Lyme disease agents. From these, the Borrelia burgdorferi outer membrane channel P66 is known to act as an adhesin and was well studied as a porin. To investigate if P66 porins are expressed and similarly capable of pore formation in other Borrelia causing Lyme disease or relapsing fever three LD species ( B. burgdorferi , B. afzelii , B. garinii) and three RF species ( B. duttonii , B. recurrentis and B. hermsii) were investigated for outer membrane proteins homologous to P66. A search in current published RF genomes, comprising the ones of B. duttonii , B. recurrentis and B. hermsii , indicated that they all contained P66 homologues. The P66 homologues of the six Borrelia species were purified to homogeneity and their pore-forming abilities as well as the biophysical properties of the pores were analyzed using the black lipid bilayer assay.",1460,0,0,1,0,ca,en,

Lyme arthritis is a common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease and should be considered in the evaluation of patients with monoarticular or pauciarticular joint complaints in a geographic area in which Lyme disease is endemic. Management of Lyme arthritis involves eradication of the spirochete with antibiotics. Generally, the prognosis is excellent. Arthroscopic synovectomy is reserved for refractory cases that do not respond to antibiotics.",950,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The primary vector of disease transmission is the tick Ixodes ricinus (in Europe), and given its seasonal activity, the highest incidence of the disease early stages is in summer. People professionally exposed to a tick and other insect bite have a higher prevalence of positive serum antibody levels compared to the general population. The aim of this prospective study was to determine the levels of positive antibodies in professional soldiers after a tick bite, and also to determine the risk of occupational infection - Lyme disease.

Background Bilateral, predominantly motor, cervical radiculoplexus neuropathy, the “dangling arm syndrome,” has not been reported as a complication of acute Lyme infection. Methods Retrospective series of 5 patients from 2 tertiary neuromuscular centers. Results There were 4 men and 1 woman with an average age of 69 years. One recalled a tick bite, and preceding constitutional symptoms included headache (2) and fever, arthralgias, and fatigue in 1 patient each. Proximal arm weakness and acute pain developed within 3 weeks from onset; pain was bilateral in 3 patients and unilateral in 2 patients, and was described as severe throbbing. Arm weakness was bilateral at onset in 3 patients, and right sided in 2 patients followed by spread to the left arm within days. All the patients had weakness in the deltoid and biceps that was 3/5 or less (Medical Research Council scale), with variable weakness of the triceps and wrist extensors; 1 patient had a flail right arm and moderate (4/5) weakness of the proximal left arm muscles. Light touch was normal in the regions of weakness, and 1 patient had mildly reduced pin sensation over the forearm. Serum IgM Lyme titers were elevated in all the patients and were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid in 4 tested patients. The cerebrospinal fluid protein ranged between 135 and 176 mg/dL with lymphocytic pleocytosis (range, 42 to 270 cells). Electrodiagnostic studies showed normal median and ulnar motor potentials with asymmetrically reduced sensory amplitudes in the median (4), ulnar (3), and radial, and lateral antebrachial cutaneous potentials in 1 patient each. Two patients had acute denervation in the cervical or proximal arm muscles. There was full recovery after antibiotic therapy in 4 patients and considerable improvement in 1 patient after 2 months. Conclusion Acute brachial diplegia is a rare manifestation of acute Lyme infection and responds promptly to antibiotic therapy.",2038,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Sixty-six semi-structured interviews were conducted with 82 visitors in Richmond Park, New Forest, and Exmoor National Park in the UK. The data were analysed using thematic analysis and was informed by social representations theory. The analysis indicated that a lay understanding of the risk of Lyme disease was filtered by place-attachment and the social representations of the countryside. Lyme disease was not understood primarily as a risk to health, but was instead constructed as a risk to the social and restorative practices in the context of the countryside. The findings suggest that advice about zoonoses such as Lyme disease is unlikely to cause panic, and that it should focus on the least intrusive preventative measures.",955,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Serology is often negative in the early stage of Lyme borreliosis and cannot distinguish between active and past infection. Culture is cumbersome and not very sensitive, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis has been described over the last 20 years, with varying results. Areas covered: In this article, all of the major studies in which PCR has been used to diagnose Lyme borreliosis in humans are critically reviewed. However, this article does not include studies that consisted of fewer than 10 patients, nor does it include studies that have inadequate descriptions of the patient population. Expert opinion: There is a lack of standardized protocols, and preamplification procedures have not been standardized. Nested PCRs seem to perform best, but are prone to contamination. PCR on skin biopsies can be used to diagnose early Lyme borreliosis in patients with atypical forms of erythema migrans. PCR also has diagnostic potential in Lyme arthritis and early neuroborreliosis. Blood and urine should not used for PCR. For future development, preamplification procedures should be optimized using materials from experimentally infected animals. Multi-center studies should follow to evaluate these optimized tests.",1413,0,0,1,0,it,en,

There is no human vaccine against LD currently available. Our approach to a vaccine is based on its surface-exposed glycolipids. One group of these glycolipids termed BBGL-2 consists of 1,2-di- O -acyl-3- O -(α- d -galactopyranosyl)- sn -glycerol congeners having palmitic, oleic, stearic, linoleic, and myristic acids. In order to delineate the immunodominant region(s) of the BBGL-2 components, we embarked on a synthetic project to provide available structurally defined, homogeneous analogs of BBGL-2 that might help identify the best vaccine candidate. The antigenicity of the synthetic glycolipids was examined by dot-blot analysis using mice sera obtained by immunization with killed B. burgdorferi cells, with native BBGL-2 in complete Freund’s adjuvant, as well as sera obtained from patients with Lyme disease. We found that the presence of two acyl groups in the glycerol moiety was essential for antigenicity. At least one of these groups must be an oleoyl moiety. Neither the anomeric configuration of the galactose nor the configuration of the glycerol at C-2 was a decisive factor. Based on these findings we designed an ‘unnatural’ BBGL-2 analog having the structure 3- O -(β- d -galactopyranosyl)-1,2-di- O -oleoyl- d l -glycerol which is easier and less expensive to synthesize than the other BBGL-2 congeners prepared in this study.

Lyme disease is a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment of Lyme disease reduces complications including arthritis and cardiac involvement. While a urine test is highly desirable for Lyme disease screening, this has been difficult to accomplish because the antigen is present at extremely low concentrations, below the detection limit of clinical immunoassays. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) – acrylic acid (AAc) microparticles were covalently functionalized with amine containing dyes via amidation of carboxylic groups present in the microparticles. The dyes act as affinity baits towards protein analytes in solution. NIPAm/AAc microparticles functionalized with acid black 48 (AB48) mixed with human urine, achieved close to one hundred percent capture and 100 percent extraction yield of the target antigen. In urine, microparticles sequestered and concentrated Lyme disease antigens 100 fold, compared to the absence of microparticles, achieving an immunoassay detection sensitivity of 700 pg/mL in 10 mL urine. Antigen present in a single infected tick could be readily detected following microparticle sequestration. Hydrogel microparticles functionalized with high affinity baits can dramatically increase the sensitivity of urinary antigen tests for infectious diseases such as Lyme disease.

In this report we show that α-DG-N is released into different body fluids, such as lachrimal fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine and plasma. To investigate the significance of α-DG-N in CSF we examined the levels of α-DG-N and known neurodegenerative markers in CSF from patients diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) and healthy controls.

This juvenile plesiosaur specimen was originally referred to ‘ Plesiosaurus ’ macrocephalus . However, reexamination indicates that it does not belong to Plesiosaurus and comparison with the type specimen of ‘ Plesiosaurus ’ macrocephalus (NHMUK OR1336) suggests that it is taxonomically distinct. Therefore, NHMUK OR49202 is made the holotype of a new genus and species: Anningasaura lymense . The specimen possesses plesiomorphic characters, including premaxillae that do not separate the frontals on the midline, narrow cranioquadrate passages, lack of a constricting groove around the occipital condyle, and several autapomorphies not observed in other plesiosaurian taxa: posteromedial processes of the premaxillae (or possible anterior portion of the frontal) forming a dorsoventrally thick, mediolaterally expanded platform; supplementary foramen penetrating the parietal sagittal crest; absence of a pterygoid-vomerine contact; absence of a contact between the pterygoids in palatal aspect; cultriform process of the parasphenoid wider mediolaterally than the combined posterior interpterygoid vacuities; and two closely spaced foramina in the lateral surface of the exoccipital.

A subset of patients treated for Lyme disease report persistent or recurrent symptoms of unknown etiology named post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). This study aims to describe a cohort of participants with early, untreated Lyme disease, and characterize post-treatment symptomatology and functional impact of PTLDS over time. Methods. Sixty-three participants with erythema migrans and systemic symptoms were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Participants underwent physical exams and clinical assessments, and completed the SF-36 (daily life functioning) and the Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II) (depression), at each of five visits over a period of 6 months. Results. Signs of Lyme disease disappeared post-treatment; however, new-onset patient-reported symptoms increased or plateaued over time. At 6 months, 36% of patients reported new-onset fatigue, 20% widespread pain, and 45% neurocognitive difficulties. However, less than 10% reported greater than “minimal” depression across the entire period. Those with PTLDS (36%) did not differ significantly from those without with respect to demographics, pre-treatment SF-36, and BDI-II scores. Statistically significant differences were found over time on the Role Physical, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, and Mental Health subscales (with a trend toward significance for the remaining three subscales of Physical Functioning, Bodily Pain, and General Health) of the SF-36 between those with an eventual PTLDS diagnosis and those without when measured at 6 months. Conclusions. Unlike clinical signs of Lyme disease, new-onset symptoms are reported by a subset of participants without evidence of depressive symptomatology. Patients who developed PTLDS had significantly lower life functioning compared to those without PTLDS. We propose future avenues for researching infection-triggered symptoms resulting from multiple mechanisms.",1944,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Fatigue was determined by the validated Piper Fatigue Scale before, during and after the trial. Participants included 58 patients (30 females and 28 males) with chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis, chronic Lyme disease or other fatiguing illnesses, such as fibromyalgia syndrome or Gulf War illness. These patients had been symptomatic for an average of 17.1 ± 0.6 years, had been seen by many physicians (15.2 ± 0.7) and had used many other supplements and drugs (35.4 ± 2.7) without apparent reductions in their fatigue. Results: Participants in the study responded to the combination test supplement, showing a 30.7% reduction in overall fatigue within 60 days ( P < 0.001). Analysis of subcategories of fatigue indicated that there were significant improvements in the ability to complete tasks and activities as well as significant improvements in mood and cognitive abilities. Regression analysis of the data indicated that reductions in fatigue were gradual, consistent, and occurred with a high degree of confidence (R 2 = 0.960). The data also suggested that further reductions were likely if the participants had continued the supplement beyond the 8-week trial. Males responded slightly better to the combination supplement than females, and the patients with the most severe forms of fatigue responded slightly better than those with milder fatigue, independent of their diagnosis. Conclusions: The combination supplement was a safe and effective method to significantly reduce fatigue in long-term patients with intractable chronic fatigue.",1840,0,0,1,0,en,en,

SBIRT/MI-competent facilitators served as both trainers and actors at 8 carefully sequenced Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) stations, providing instruction, role-play practice, and feedback on 17 microskills in 2 successive clinical “visits”/rounds addressing alcohol misuse and diabetes management. Evaluation included OSCE checklists, overall competency assessments, and responses to open-ended questions. Three residents showed improvement between rounds. Resident evaluations were strongly positive, identifying practice of MI skills and receipt of coaching and feedback from MI experts as particularly valuable.

Preliminary studies have indicated the presence of the arthropod vector and the pathogen in North Africa. A few clinical cases have been reported. Our objective is to evaluate whether Lyme borreliosis constitutes a threat to public health. To access our objective, we plan to establish a map of the tick distribution, to evaluate the prevalence of Borrelia infection in ticks, to identify Borrelia strains and to determine their genetic diversity, to identify reservoirs used to maintain Bb.sl, and to evaluate the incidence of the disease in the human population. The knowledge of the natural enzootic cycle involving arthropods and wild vertebrates in the maintenance of Bb.sl should permit to develop prevention strategies to counter any public health threat.

The subject presented positive reactivity for Mycoplasma Pneumoniae . According to recent studies, misdiagnosis of initial symptoms of Lyme disease and delayed treatment can lead to persistent interactive coinfections in the organism which may result in chronic pathologies. Thus, a link could exist between a chronic infection with Mycoplasma Pneumoniae and an atypical symptomology similar to autism. So the hypothesis proposed is that there may be a correlation between Lyme disease and autism and that long-term antibiotic therapy may be an effective treatment. Following a clinical presentation of the history of this young patient, the evolution of the subject's symptomology and behavior during one year of antibiotic therapy will be described. His cognitive level was evaluated before and during treatment, and assessment showed a marked progress. In daily life, an increase in verbal communicative skills and social interaction, an improvement of sleep and a decrease in the repetitive behaviors were reported. The antibiotic therapy was administered simultaneously to contextual changes, so it was supposed that a medicamentous treatment could only have a favorable and long-term influence on behavior when associated with a regular and adapted educational program. Finally, this case study will allow us to question the definition of autism, its etiology and the validity of the initial diagnosis established for this patient. The present study also raises the following questions: how can the subject's “late entry” in autism be explained? Was the subject misdiagnosed with autism? Did the presented behaviors have an infection-induced cause or, more precisely, is the outbreak of autistic disorders compatible with a post-Lyme disease syndrome? Or else, if it was the case that autism was present from the subject's birth and its emergence was preceded during the first months of life by a set of subtle and discreet disorders (thus not detected by the parents), could it be said that the Lyme disease has simply playing the role of revealing of the autistic syndrome? Further research is required in order to provide evidence that long-term antibiotic therapy could be an appropriate treatment for children co-morbid with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Lyme disease.",2622,0,0,1,0,fr,fr,

Dirección para correspondencia RESUMEN La borreliosis de Lyme es una enfermedad multiorgánica con afectación principalmente dermatológica, reumática, neurológica y cardiaca. La detección y el tratamiento en los primeros estadios son básicos para evitar su progresión. El pediatra, por tanto, debe conocer las manifestaciones clínicas de la enfermedad, así como establecer un correcto diagnóstico y tratamiento. Se exponen dos casos que incluyen las formas más frecuentes de presentación. Palabras clave: Enfermedad de Lyme. Eritema crónico migrans . Tratamiento. Parálisis facial. ABSTRACT Lyme borreliosis is a multisystem disease mainly dermatological, rheumatical, neurological and cardiological. The detection and treatment in the early stages are essential to prevent its progression. The pediatrician, therefore, must be aware of the clinical presentations of the disease as well as to establish a correct diagnosis and treatment. Two cases are presented involving the most common forms of presentation. Key words: Lyme disease. Erythema chronicum migrans. Therapeutics. Facial paralysis. Introducción La borreliosis (o enfermedad) de Lyme es una enfermedad compleja con manifestaciones cutáneas, articulares, neurológicas, cardiacas y otras manifestaciones sistémicas, cuya lesión más específica desde el punto de vista diagnóstico es el eritema crónico migratorio (EM) 1 que resulta de la infección por espiroquetas del complejo Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato 2 . En Europa, este complejo incluye tres genoespecies patógenas: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, Borrelia afzelii y Borrelia garinii 1,2 . Su vector principal, la garrapata Ixodes ricinus , se encuentra ampliamente distribuido en la Península ibérica 1 . Se trata de la infección transmitida por un vector más frecuente en Norteamérica y Europa 2 . La distribución de esta garrapata a nivel mundial hace de la borreliosis de Lyme una enfermedad asociada a áreas forestales de hoja caduca del hemisferio norte 3 . La cornisa cantábrica y el nordeste de España están ampliamente pobladas por este artrópodo. Se han encontrado Ixodes en Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, País Vasco y Castilla y León, en la zona este (Cataluña), en la zona centro (Madrid) y en el sur (Andalucía). Zonas del norte de España como La Rioja, Navarra o la sierra del Sueve en Asturias son zonas endémicas de borreliosis de Lyme 1 . Debido al ciclo vital de la garrapata, la enfermedad suele iniciarse durante los meses de junio, julio y agosto. Las ninfas pueden estar activas durante todo el año en zonas húmedas y templadas como la cornisa cantábrica 1 . La transmisión suele producirse tras 48-72 horas del anclaje de la garrapata 2 . Las manifestaciones clínicas dependen del estadio de la enfermedad 3 : • Enfermedad temprana localizada: eritema migrans o migratorio (EM). • Enfermedad temprana diseminada: EM múltiple, parálisis de nervios craneales (especialmente del nervio facial), meningitis, carditis. • Enfermedad tardía: artritis, encefalopatía o polineuropatía subaguda. Los primeros signos de infección se hacen evidentes semanas o pocos meses después de la picadura, mientras que los tardíos lo hacen muchos meses, e incluso años, después. Las manifestaciones tempranas suelen ser autolimitadas, mientras que las tardías se pueden hacer crónicas e incluso generar daño orgánico irreversible 3 . Durante las primeras fases de la enfermedad temprana localizada (primeras cuatro semanas), los test serológicos no tienen suficiente sensibilidad para ayudar en el diagnóstico, por lo que el conocimiento de la clínica es fundamental 4-6 . En caso de solicitar estudios complementarios, lo más adecuado es el llamado enfoque de dos pasos mediante una cuantificación de anticuerpos mediante enzimoinmunoanálisis (EIA) en primer lugar y, en caso de positividad o resultado indeterminado, realizar un estudio, más sensible y específico, por inmunotransferencia de Western 4-7 . Cuando se investiga la enfermedad temprana diseminada, deben efectuarse EIA para IgG e IgM; cuando se sospecha una enfermedad tardía, solo para IgG 5-7 . No se recomienda la realización de serologías ante síntomas inespecíficos, dada la posibilidad de falsos positivos 4-7 . En la enfermedad temprana localizada, la doxiciclina es el tratamiento de elección en mayores de ocho años de edad ( Tabla 1 ). Los niños más pequeños se tratan con amoxicilina oral. La cefuroxima es un fármaco alternativo. La eritromicina y la azitromicina son menos eficaces 6,8 . Por último, son útiles medidas preventivas como llevar pantalones largos o la aplicación de repelentes. El examen cutáneo en busca de garrapatas es recomendable aunque de efectividad dudosa, dada facilidad de que pasen desapercibidas por su pequeño tamaño. Una vez localizada, la garrapata debe ser extraída mediante una pequeña pinza, lo más cerca posible de su cabeza y evitando la compresión de su cuerpo, la rotación del mismo o la aplicación de agentes químicos tópicos 4 . No está indicada la profilaxis antibiótica tras la picadura, aun en zonas endémicas 4,6 . Caso 1 Paciente varón de 13 años que acude a la consulta por cervicalgia de 20 días de evolución, no irradiada y sin alteraciones sensoriales o motoras en los miembros superiores, de predominio nocturno y con mala respuesta al tratamiento con ibuprofeno y diazepam. Diplopia intermitente, fiebre de dos días de duración al inicio del proceso, sin síntomas generales acompañantes. A los diez días del inicio de la clínica se realizan hemograma, velocidad de sedimentación globular y radiografía cervical, que son normales. En la exploración física destaca una desviación de la comisura bucal con la sonrisa; el resto de la exploración neurológica es normal. No presenta exantemas, aunque la madre refiere, al ser preguntada, una picadura en un hombro dos meses antes, con eritema circular progresivo de unas dos semanas de duración. Ante la sospecha de enfermedad de Lyme, se realizan estudios serológicos con EIA (IgG, IgM) e inmunotransferencia de Western (IgG, IgM), ambos positivos, tras lo cual se inicia tratamiento con doxiciclina oral durante 21 días. Visto en consulta un mes tras el tratamiento, el paciente se encuentra asintomático. Caso 2 Paciente varón de siete años de edad con exantema axilar no pruriginoso de 15 días de duración y crecimiento progresivo, sin otros síntomas asociados. Refiere picaduras de garrapata a nivel axilar y en una pierna un mes antes de la consulta. La exploración muestra una lesión anular eritematosa de bordes irregulares, sin descamación, de unos 15 cm de diámetro ( Fig. 1 ). Ante la sospecha de EM se inicia tratamiento con amoxicilina oral (21 días) y se realizan estudios serológicos con EIA (IgG, IgM) e inmunotransferencia de Western (IgG, IgM), que resultaron positivos. A los cinco días de iniciado el tratamiento desaparece el eritema. Discusión El diagnóstico de la enfermedad es fácil cuando el médico conoce la entidad, se acompaña del típico EM y se refieren antecedentes de picadura de garrapata. La característica más precoz de la enfermedad de Lyme, y la más frecuente en la infancia, es una erupción cutánea única denominada EM, que se presenta hasta en un 90% de los niños afectados 2,6,9 . Aparece en el lugar de la inoculación aproximadamente a los 7-14 días de la picadura (rango 3-30 días), aunque la lesión puede aparecer en un lugar diferente al sitio recordado, dada la posibilidad de picaduras no reconocidas 3 . Una historia de picadura de garrapata en un pasado más lejano debería considerarse una evidencia de riesgo potencial de exposición, mientras que no recordar una picadura no debe descartar el diagnóstico 3 . La manifestación inicial suele ser una mácula o pápula roja en el lugar de la picadura que después se ensancha lentamente adquiriendo forma de anillo irregular de borde rojo no sobreelevado 2,3 . Otras veces se presenta de forma más atípica como una placa edematosa, roja y caliente, incluso podrían aparecer vesículas o áreas de necrosis en la zona central de la lesión en relación con la intensa respuesta inflamatoria que se produce 2,6 . Suele ser indolora y durar de días a semanas adquiriendo un tamaño considerable 3 . La lesión es más frecuente en la cabeza y el cuello en niños pequeños, y en las extremidades en niños mayores 3 . A menudo asocia síntomas como cefalea, fatiga, mialgias, artralgias, dolor cervical, rigidez nucal, fiebre, náuseas, vómitos, dolor de garganta o linfadenopatía 2,3,6,9 . El diagnóstico diferencial incluye entidades como hipersensibilidad a la picadura de insectos, infección cutánea, urticaria, eritema multiforme, eritema anular centrífugo, granuloma anular o tinea corporis , basándose en la morfología, el tamaño, el prurito, la localización, el dolor o los cambios secundarios, como por ejemplo descamación 3,4 . Si la enfermedad de Lyme no es reconocida y tratada en esta fase inicial, las espiroquetas penetran en el torrente sanguíneo y se diseminan por diferentes órganos y tejidos produciendo las siguientes etapas de la enfermedad, lo cual hace tan importante su sospecha ante la aparición de un exantema compatible 3,6 . La manifestación más frecuente de la neuroborreliosis de Lyme en Europa es la parálisis del nervio facial, ante la cual se debe pensar siempre en un Lyme, sobre todo si es bilateral 5,9,10 . Usualmente acontece 1-12 (principalmente 4-6) semanas tras la picadura 5 . Hasta en un 80% de los casos asocia manifestaciones sistémicas como náuseas, dolor abdominal, artralgia y cefalea 10 . Son predictores independientes de enfermedad de Lyme como causa el inicio durante la estación epidémica, la ausencia de lesión herpética previa, la presencia de fiebre y la historia de cefalea. Los pacientes con estos tres predictores tienen un 50% de riesgo de presentar enfermedad de Lyme y sería aconsejable la realización de estudios serológicos y considerar el inicio del tratamiento ante la presencia de más de uno de ellos 5,10 . La mayoría de los pacientes con una parálisis facial aislada pueden ser tratados exitosamente con doxiciclina oral durante 14-21 días 5,6,8,9 . No hay evidencia de que los niños con cualquier manifestación de la enfermedad se beneficien de tratamientos antibióticos prolongados, por lo que la duración máxima de los mismos no debe sobrepasar las cuatro semanas 6 . En este caso, el tratamiento no busca la resolución de la parálisis facial, cuyo pronóstico es excelente, sino prevenir la enfermedad tardía, y no deben administrarse corticosteroides 8 . La realización de una punción lumbar es controvertida, aunque podría ser innecesaria cuando no existe clínica de afectación del sistema nervioso central, como rigidez nucal, edema de papila o cefalea intensa o prolongada, ya que el significado clínico de las alteraciones en el líquido cefalorraquídeo es incierta y la evolución con el tratamiento oral excelente 3,6 . La mayoría de los pacientes son seropositivos en este estadio 7 . Se debe ser precavido al interpretar el resultado de los test diagnósticos. En ambos casos clínicos la sospecha diagnóstica inicial es fundamental, teniendo en cuenta que un EIA y una inmunotransferencia de Western positivos no indican necesariamente enfermedad de Lyme, al igual que un resultado negativo no la descarta por completo 5 . En áreas endémicas, ante una clínica inespecífica, el valor predictivo positivo del test es pobre y, por otro lado, en pacientes con enfermedad previa puede persistir seropositividad incluso tras un tratamiento antibiótico adecuado y una recuperación completa 4,5 . Por último, llama la atención que, frente a una incidencia en España estimada de 0,25 casos por 100 000 habitantes 11 , desde el Servicio de Microbiología del Hospital Carmen y Severo Ochoa, hospital de referencia de nuestra área sanitaria en el suroccidente asturiano, se refiere una incidencia de 130 casos por 100 000 habitantes, pudiendo considerarse pues endémica en el área. Por otro lado, solo se han comunicado los dos casos pediátricos señalados en este artículo, por lo que es probable que esté infradiagnosticada en estas edades, bien porque no se consulta o bien por desconocimiento clínico.

Biosensors were fabricated on oxidized silicon wafers using chemical vapor deposition grown carbon nanotubes that were functionalized using diazonium salts. Attachment of Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme) flagellar antibodies to the nanotubes was verified by atomic force microscopy and electronic measurements. A reproducible shift in the turn-off voltage of the semiconducting SWNT FETs was seen upon incubation with B. burgdorferi flagellar antigen, indicative of the nanotube FET being locally gated by the residues of flagellar protein bound to the antibody. This sensor effectively detected antigen in buffer at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml, and the response varied strongly over a concentration range coinciding with levels of clinical interest. Generalizable binding chemistry gives this biosensing platform the potential to be expanded to monitor other relevant antigens, enabling a multiple vector sensor for Lyme disease. The speed and sensitivity of this biosensor make it an ideal candidate for development as a medical diagnostic test.",1234,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Background : The adhesion process of Borrelia burgdorferi to susceptible host cell has not yet been completely understood regarding the function of OspA, OspB and OspC proteins and a conflict exists in the infection process. Aims : The adhesion rates of pathogenic (low BSK medium passaged or susceptible rat joint tissue co-cultivated ) or non-pathogenic Borrelia burgdorferi (high BSK medium passaged) isolate (FNJ) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured on coverslips and the synthesis of OspA and OspC proteins were investigated to analyze the infection process of this bacterium. Study Design : In-vitro study. Methods : Spirochetes were cultured in BSK medium or in a LEW/N rat tibiotarsal joint tissue feeder layer supported co-culture system using ESG co-culture medium and labelled with 3H-adenine for 48 hours. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, Immunogold A labeling as well as radiolabeling experiments were used to compare pathogenic or non pathogenic spirochetes during the adhesion process. Results : Tissue co-cultured B. burgdorferi adhered about ten times faster than BSK-grown spirochetes. Trypsin inhibited attachment to HUVEC and co-culture of trypsinized spirochetes with tissues reversed the inhibition. Also, the synthesis of OspC protein by spirochetes was increased in abundance after tissue co-cultures, as determined by SDS-PAGE and by electron microscopy analysis of protein A-immunogold staining by anti-OspC antibodies. OspA protein was synthesized in similar quantities in all Borrelia cultures analyzed by the same techniques. Conclusion : Low BSK passaged or tissue co-cultured pathogenic Lyme disease spirochetes adhere to HUVEC faster than non-pathogenic high BSK passaged forms of this bacterium. Spirochetes synthesized OspC protein during host tissue-associated growth. However, we did not observe a reduction of OspA synthesis during host tissue co-cultivation in vitro.",1933,0,0,1,0,so,en,

In red pine plantations in the Great Lakes region of North America, feeding by rhizophagous insects triggers a cascade that ultimately results in higher densities of blacklegged ticks, Ixodes scapularis , which are the primary vector of the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi . We sampled 31 plantations in Wisconsin, USA, that were diseased or asymptomatic for a previously described tree mortality syndrome that originates with root infestation. Understory vegetation was greater in diseased stands, as were the proportion of samples containing ticks and the number of ticks per sample. Infection rates with B. burgdorferi were consistent. Tick densities were identical between declining and healthy portions of symptomatic stands, suggesting stand-level factors are responsible, consistent with mammal movement. These results suggest that forest management practices that affect the dynamics of belowground food webs may have implications for human health.",1093,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Background: Lyme borreliosis (LB) is the most common zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks in the USA and Europe. This review aims to estimate the regional burden of LB in Western Europe. Data from previous publications were used to calculate the mean incidence. The mean incidence rates were then combined to estimate the regional burden and a population-weighted regional burden of disease based on the standardized incidence from the included studies and the total population at risk. Methods: Reviews and surveillance reports identified by the initial database search were first assessed for eligibility by their title and abstract, and subsequently by a more detailed review of the source for the most recent data regarding LB. 11 sources of incidence data were included in the review, representing 17 countries in total. Incidence estimates were calculated from reported values and population data. Results: Countries in Western Europe have a large variance in the incidence rates. The highest reported incidences for LB were reported in southern Sweden with 464 per 100 000 and the lowest in Italy of 0.001 per 100 000. The unweighted mean for the included data provided an incidence of 56.3 per 100 000 persons per year, equating to approximately 232 125 cases in one year throughout the region. The calculated population-weighted average incidence for the regional burden of LB in Western Europe was 22.05 cases per 100 000 person-years. Conclusions: LB is an emerging disease and the most common zoonotic infection in Western Europe approaching endemic proportions in many European countries. The population-weighted incidence has been estimated by this study to be 22.04 per 100 000 person-years. Concordant and well-conducted surveillance and disease awareness should continue to be encouraged to monitor LB as tick numbers and activity increases.",1869,0,0,1,0,es,en,

Here, a model for Lyme disease dynamics with different host seeking rates is used to investigate how different patterns of tick–host interaction affect the model predictions in the context of tick-borne disease control. Three different host seeking behaviors (the frequency-dependent rate, the density-dependent rate and the Holling type 2 rate) are compared. The comparison of results illustrates not only variable relationships between rodents and tick abundance but also different implications for disease control: (i) for the model with the frequency-dependent rate, reducing rodents is always bad for containing the disease; (ii) for density-dependent or the Holling type 2 rate, reducing or increasing rodent population should be carefully considered, since large host population may facilitate the development of immature ticks, resulting in the immature tick population level so low to sustain the transmission cycle. Furthermore, we distinguish different mechanisms of dilution effects (pathogen reduction with the increasing of the host biodiversity) from different tick–host interaction patterns.",1236,0,0,1,0,it,en,

Most practitioners and scientists recognize that Lyme disease is associated with certain objective clinical manifestations supported by laboratory evidence of infection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (the etiologic agent). There are others, however, who believe that patients with Lyme disease may have a wide variety of entirely nonspecific symptoms without any objective clinical manifestation and that laboratory evidence of infection by B. burgdorferi is not required to support the diagnosis. In reality, this perspective is not evidence based and would inevitably lead to innumerable misdiagnoses, given the high frequency of medically unexplained symptoms, such as fatigue and musculoskeletal pains, in the general population. Although those espousing this viewpoint do not believe that a positive laboratory test is required, nevertheless, they often seek out and promote alternative, unapproved testing methods that frequently provide false-positive results to justify their diagnosis. Herein, we provide a brief overview of Lyme disease testing, emphasizing current usage and limitations.

There was no difference of vertigo between LD and ISD patients. Patients with ISD

The aim of this study was to investigate whether herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 or 2, varicella zoster virus (VZV), enterovirus or tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) could be identified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum from children being evaluated for LNB, in order to elucidate whether such infectious diseases may be missed by the clinician. Methods: Ninety-nine pediatric patients (n = 99) were retrospectively included from a previous study on LNB in southeast of Sweden. They had been diagnosed as “Possible LNB” or “Not determined” due to negative Borrelia antibody index in CSF. Routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods were used for detection of herpes viral RNA or enteroviral DNA in CSF. An ELISA assay was used for detection of anti-TBEV antibodies (IgM and IgG) in serum. Results: One patient showed elevated anti-TBEV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum, indicating a current TBE infection. No positive PCR reactions for HSV 1 or 2, VZV or enterovirus were detected in CSF from any of the patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that undiagnosed herpes- or enteroviral infections are unlikely to explain CNS symptoms in children being evaluated for LNB, whereas missed TBE infections may occur.

While Koch’s postulates have been fulfilled for Lyme disease; causing transient fever, anorexia and arthritis in young dogs; treatment of sero-positive dogs, especially asymptomatic animals, remains a topic of debate. To complicate this matter the currently recommended antibiotic treatments of Lyme Disease in dogs caused by Borrelia burgdorferi require daily oral administrations for 31 days or longer, which makes non-compliance a concern. Additionally, there is no approved veterinary antimicrobial for the treatment of Lyme Disease in dogs in the USA and few recommended treatments have been robustly tested. In vitro testing of cefovecin, a novel extended-spectrum cephalosporin, demonstrated inhibition of spirochete growth. A small pilot study in dogs indicated that two cefovecin injections two weeks apart would be as efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto as the recommended treatments using doxycycline or amoxicillin daily for 31 days. This hypothesis was tested in 17–18 week old Beagle dogs, experimentally infected with B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, using wild caught ticks, 75 days prior to antimicrobial administration. Results. Clinical observations for lameness were performed daily but were inconclusive as this characteristic sign of Lyme Disease rarely develops in the standard laboratory models of experimentally induced infection. However, each antibiotic tested was efficacious against B. burgdorferi as measured by a rapid elimination of spirochetes from the skin and reduced levels of circulating antibodies to B. burgdorferi . In addition, significantly less cefovecin treated animals had Lyme Disease associated histopathological changes compared to untreated dogs. Conclusions. Convenia was efficacious against B. burgdorferi sensu stricto infection in dogs as determined by serological testing, PCR and histopathology results. Convenia provides an additional and effective treatment option for Lyme Disease in dogs.",1969,0,0,1,0,en,en,

He initially presented in complete heart block. A transvenous pacemaker was placed in the emergency department, and he was started empirically on Ceftriaxone for Lyme disease. He was admitted and over the course of the next few days, his rhythm regressed to Mobitz type I first-degree atrioventricular block and then to normal sinus rhythm. This case report highlights some important features regarding Lyme carditis, a rare presentation of early disseminated Lyme disease (seen in a few weeks to months after the initial tick bite). In 25%–30% of patients, the characteristic targetoid rash may not be seen, a likely culprit of the disease not being detected early and progressing to disseminated disease. The most common cardiac complaint of Lyme disease is palpitations, occurring in 6.6% of patients, which may not accurately reflect progression into disseminated Lyme disease because it is a nonspecific finding. Conduction abnormality, occurring in 1.8% of patients, is a more specific finding of Borrelia invading cardiac tissue. Finally, this case report highlights a recommendation that patients with confirmed Lyme disease or those presenting with cardiac abnormalities or symptoms who have an atypical profile for a cardiac event should be screened with a 12-lead electrocardiogram, Lyme serology, and be considered for antibiotic therapy with the possibility of temporary pacing.",1527,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The model used county-level Lyme disease incidence in thirteen states in the Northeastern United States during 2002–2006 and linked it with several previously identified key landscape and climatic variables used in an earlier study. Results showed that there were significant differences between the outcomes from the initial model and those from bootstrap resampling.

In five field experiment days during the summer 2010 Jack Rabbit I (JR I) field trials, up to two tons of chlorine were released and concentrations were observed at distances, x, from 25 to 500 m. In the 1927 Lyme Bay (LB) experiments, there were four days of trials, where 3–10 tons of chlorine were released in about 15 min from the back of a ship. Concentrations were sampled at LB from four ships sailing across the cloud path at downwind distances in the range from about 350 to 3000 m. Thus, the distances from which JR I concentrations were available slightly overlapped the LB distances. One-minute arc-maximum chlorine concentrations, C (g/m 3 ), were analyzed from four JR I trials and two LB trials. Normalized concentrations (Cu/Q) were plotted versus x (m), where u (m/s) is measured wind speed at heights of 2–10 m and Q (g/s) is continuous mass release rate. It is found that the JR I and LB Cu/Q observations smoothly merge with each other and fall along a line with approximate slope of −2 at distances beyond about 200 m (i.e., Cu/Q is proportional to x −2 ). At x < 200 m, where dense gas effects are more important, the slope is less (about −1.5). Most of the data points are within a factor of two of the “best-fit” line.",1544,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Cilj ovog rada je da se prikažu osnovne epidemiološke karakteristike obolevanja od lajmske bolesti na području Beograda u 2014. godini. U radu je primenjen deskriptivni epidemiološki metod. Kao izvor podataka korišćeni su podaci Registra prijava zaraznih bolesti za grad Beograd, Savetovališta za lajmsku bolest Gradskog zavoda za javno zdravlje Beograd (Savetovališta) i rezultati seroloških analiza mikrobiološke laboratorije Gradskog zavoda za javno zdravlje Beograd.

A systematic review protocol,"['Jo Middleton', 'Ian Cooper', 'Anja S. Rott']",10.1186/s13750-016-0074-7,2016.0,3,journal-article,"Background. Lyme disease (LD) is the most commonly reported, broadly distributed vector-borne disease of the northern temperate zone. It is transmitted by ticks and, if untreated, can cause skin, cardiac, nervous system and musculoskeletal disease. The distribution and incidence of LD is increasing across much of North America and Western Europe. Interventions to decrease exposure to LD hazard by encouraging behavioural change have low acceptance in high risk groups, and a safe, effective human LD vaccine is not presently available. As a result, habitat level interventions to decrease LD hazard itself (i.e. levels of infected ticks) have been proposed. However, some interventions may potentially negatively affect ecosystem health, and consequentially be neither desirable, nor politically feasible. This systematic review will catalogue interventions that aim to reduce LD hazard at non-domestic sites, and examine the evidence supporting those which are unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health. Methods. The review will be carried out in two steps. First, a screening and cataloguing stage will be conducted to identify and characterise interventions to decrease LD hazard at non-domestic sites. Secondly, the subset of interventions identified during cataloguing as unlikely to negatively affect ecosystem health will be investigated. In the screening and cataloguing step literature will be collected through database searching using pre-chosen search strings, hand-searching key journals and reviewing the websites of public health bodies. Further references will be identified by contacting stakeholders and researchers. Article screening and assessment of the likely effects of interventions on ecosystem health will be carried out independently by two reviewers. A third reviewer will be consulted if disagreements arise. The cataloguing step results will be presented in tables. Study quality will then be assessed independently by two reviewers, using adapted versions of established tools developed in healthcare research. These results will be presented in a narrative synthesis alongside tables. Though a full meta-analysis is not expected to be possible, if sub-groups of studies are sufficiently similar to compare, a partial meta-analysis will be carried out.",2291,0,0,1,0,es,en,

It is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi , transmitted by ticks (genus Ixodes ), and the abundance of infected tick nymphs determines the risk of the disease in humans. In eastern USA, fluctuations in oak ( Quercus spp.) acorn production (including mast seeding) determine rodent abundance, which has been linked with Lyme borreliosis risk in humans. However, the predictive power of masting on Lyme disease risk in other systems has never been tested. We used a combination of field and Internet data to trace the ecological chain reaction that links acorn production by oaks and Lyme borreliosis risk in European forests. We found a positive relationship between oak acorn production ( Q. robur and Q. petraea ) in year T and the number of Lyme borreliosis incidences in year T + 2. Acorn production was also positively correlated with Google search volume for the terms “tick” and “Lyme disease” two years later. Our results suggest that acorn production influences tick population, leading to fluctuations in the intensity of interactions between humans and ticks that can be seen in Google search dynamics. Thus, mast seeding together with the volume of specific Internet web searches appears to be a promising tool that could be used to alert public.",1328,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Die Erkrankung zählt zu den Zoonosen und wird durch Borrelien des Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bbsl) – Komplexes verursacht. Die Übertragung der Spirochäten findet in Mitteleuropa durch den Stich von infizierten Schildzecken, Ixodes ricinus, statt. Seltener ist die Übertragung auch durch andere fliegende Insekten wie Pferdebremsen und Stechmücken möglich. Von den bisher beschriebenen Spezies des Bbsl-Komplexes sind fünf humanpathogen: Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. garinii, B. bavariensis, B. afzelii und B. spielmanii. Das Risiko, in Deutschland nach einem Zeckenstich eine Infektion zu erleiden, liegt nach Einschätzung des Robert-Koch-Instituts bei 1,5 – 6 %. Im Durchschnitt sind 20 % der adulten Zecken, 10 % der Nymphen und etwa 1 % der Larven mit Borrelien befallen.

Clinical examination revealed violaceous skin lesions of the right calf and the gluteal region that occurred 2 years ago. Serological tests were positive for Lyme borreliosis and skin biopsy revealed lesions of chronic atrophic acrodermatitis. Renal biopsy showed minimal change glomerular disease. The skin lesions and the nephrotic syndrome resolved with a sequential treatment with first ceftriaxone and then corticosteroids. Conclusion. We report here the first case of minimal change disease associated with Lyme borreliosis. The pathogenesis of minimal change disease in the setting of Lyme disease is discussed but the association of Lyme and minimal change disease may imply a synergistic effect of phenotypic and bacterial factors. Regression of proteinuria after a sequential treatment with ceftriaxone and corticosteroids seems to strengthen this conceivable association.",1269,0,0,1,0,cy,en,

Here we describe the Ruggiero-Klinghardt (RK) Protocol that is based on integration of Autonomic Response Testing (ART) with diagnostic ultrasonography and on application of therapeutic ultrasounds; the latter are used as a provocation tool and as an instrument to optimize drug uptake and utilization in specific areas of the body. This protocol consists of a precise sequence of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with the ultimate goal of improving sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis at the same time evaluating and optimizing efficacy of treatments in chronic conditions including, but not limited to, persistent Lyme disease. The RK Protocol represents a paradigm shift in diagnostics and therapeutics: Thus, compartmentalized microbes, transformed cells, toxins and metabolites could be detected using a safe and non-invasive method. In addition, the RK Protocol allows optimization of efficacy of drugs and other therapeutic interventions. Although the RK Protocol was initially developed for persistent Lyme disease, it shows significant potential in conditions ranging from cancer to neurodegenerative diseases and autism. In oncology, the RK Protocol may serve to facilitate early diagnosis and to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to the killing effects of a variety of remedies ranging from conventional radio- and chemotherapy to more recent forms of immunotherapy. Thus, the 1st goal of the RK Protocol is diagnostic: That is, to make pathogens, toxins, transformed cells and cells infected by viruses that are inaccessible to conventional diagnostic and therapeutic tools, ""visible"" to the therapist who can detect them with laboratory methods and deal with them with appropriate interventions; and also to make them ""visible"" to the immune system that can fight them in a physiological manner. The 2nd goal is to optimize drug uptake and utilization in the organs and tissues studied and targeted with these procedures.",1957,0,0,1,0,en,en,

By the 1980s, the frequency and scale of coastal erosion and land instability had reached a point whereby the local council realised that a change from the previous ad hoc repair and protection approach was needed to secure the long-term future of the town. An environmental improvements initiative was developed from then onwards to provide a strategic and integrated programme of coast protection and cliff stabilisation measures designed to mitigate the increasing threat of climate change, coastal erosion and landslides, while respecting the site’s unique heritage and environmental interests.

Fulminant Lyme myocarditis in young adult male patient led to a sudden onset of acute, severe biventricular heart failure with progressive cardiogenic shock, and multiorgan failure immediately after admission.The previously healthy 28-year-old man was admitted to hospital with dyspnea, atrial flutter with 160/min ventricles rate, normotension, cardiomegaly, and incipient cardiogenic pulmonary edema on chest x-ray. Within the next 24 hours, the acute heart failure (AHF) progressed to the refractory cardiogenic shock with severe systemic hypotension, respiratory distress, anuria, liver congestion, and laboratory evidence of extremely high level of the anaerobic metabolism in the arterial blood (pH 7.16; HCO312.3 mmol/L; BE -14.6; lactates level 17 mmol/L). The transesophageal echo imaging showed severe dilatation and global biventricular akinesis, with left ventricular ejection fraction of 5%. The diagnosis of acute fulminant myocarditis of unknown etiology was reached. Since the patient did not respond rapidly to vasoactive and supportive therapy, MCS was immediately inserted. Broad differential diagnosis of fulminant myocarditis was considered and disseminated Borrelia infection was serologically confirmed and appropriate antimicrobial therapy was started from the fifth day after admission. MCS used over the next 26 days was successfully integrated with pharmacologic support and artificial ventilation in therapy. The patient was discharged from hospital after 65 days with a complete restoration of bilateral heart ejection fraction.This case shows that the clinical course of the Lyme carditis can present uncommonly with profound cardiovascular collapse and the MSC implementation should be considered in the early stage of drug resistant hemodynamic instability. Rapid transfer to the cardiac center where the MCS is available for all patients with signs and symptoms of AHF due to confirmed or suspected Lyme carditis would be recommended, as this treatment could be the only life-saving method.",2222,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The current developments towards nearly-zero energy houses in building efficiency have increased the overheating occurrences indoors. For house users summer thermal discomfort is an unknown challenge that they have not faced in the past. The objectives of this study is to highlight the problem of overheating in energy renovated dwellings in temperate climates and to investigate the ability of automated roof window control systems to address the risk during the peak summer period. The assessment of the indoor environment was conducted in a typical two-storey house, close to Copenhagen. Both dynamic and static criteria were used to carry out risk evaluation. The assessment of the monitored data of the house verifies the fact that active and passive ventilation and shading systems, if manually controlled, cannot guarantee high quality indoor environment. The use of automated roof window control system may significantly decreases the overheating risk without any significant compromise of the indoor air quality. The developed system is analyzed in detail. Suggestions for future work are also proposed.",1224,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Thecausative spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted by 4 species of Ixodes tick species. Over 90% of US cases occur in northeasternstates from Maine to Virginia, and in Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. Infection also takes place in northern California and Oregon. Lyme borreliosis is also diagnosed in parts of Europe, China, and Japan. The white-footed mouse is the primary animal reservoir for B. burgdorferi in the U.S. and the preferred host for nymphal and larval forms of the deer tick. Deer are hosts for the adult ticks but do not carry the spirochete. Signs and symptomsof infection occur in 3 stages; early localized, typified by erythema migrans; early disseminated with a flu-like syndrome, neurologic, and cardiac manifestations; and late, characteristically with arthritis. Although, the term ‘Chronic Lyme Disease’ has been assigned to many patients with a variety of unexplained symptoms, experts in the field question the validity of this diagnosis and warn against prolonged unproven antimicrobial therapies. Diagnosis relies upon clinical evaluation and is supported by serologic testing using a 2-step process which requires careful interpretation. Treatmentvaries with stage of disease, but normally includes doxycycline, amoxicillin,and ceftriaxone. Currently, no preventative vaccine is available. In some geographic areas, patients may be confected with Babesia, Ehrlichia, and Anaplasma since the same Ixodes ticks transmit these pathogens.",1560,0,0,1,0,en,en,

José Martínez']",10.4067/s0716-10182018000500606,2018.0,0,journal-article,"Introducción La enfermedad de Lyme es la infección transmitida por garrapatas más común del mundo 1 . En E.U.A es un problema de salud pública ya que da cuenta de 300.000 casos por año 2 . Es una patología inflamatoria multisistémica causada por espiroquetas del complejo Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato ( Bbsl ) 3 . Estas bacterias en forma de espiral de 4 a 30 μm de largo por 0,2 a 0,3 μm de diámetro, de la familia Spirochaetaceae, género Borrelia viven en la naturaleza realizando un ciclo zoonótico que incluye a garrapatas del género Ixodes , al roedor Peromyscus leucopus como reservorio y al hospedero de la garrapata, el ciervo Odocoileus virginianus 4 , 5 . Fue identificada por primera vez en 1976 en una comunidad rural cerca de Lyme, Connecticut, al noreste de E.U.A. 6 En 1981, el entomólogo William Burgdorfer sospechó que una espiroqueta podría ser el agente causal de la enfermedad, lo que fue demostrado dos años más tarde 7 , 8 . Esta patología tiene una distribución geográfica específica en forma de cinturón en América del Norte, principalmente en el noreste y centro-norte, países del centro de Europa, escandinavos y Asia 9 . En Chile, fue descrita por primera vez en 1989, a partir de un grupo de 25 pacientes con patología neurológica de causa no aclarada, basado en el cuadro clínico y exámenes serológicos a través de la técnica de ELISA. Sin embargo, no pudo aislarse el microorganismo ni pudo confirmarse el diagnóstico de enfermedad de Lyme 10 . Más tarde, basados en síntomas y signos sugerentes de ésta enfermedad se realizó un estudio con 118 pacientes, en quienes tampoco se pudo confirmar la presencia de Bbsl 11 . A esto se agrega el caso de una neuroborreliosis en un niño que tuvo contacto con hamsters traídos desde Alemania 12 . Estos reportes llevaron a concluir que no se cuenta con evidencia suficiente para confirmar la presencia del agente causante de la enfermedad de Lyme en nuestro país. Dado lo inusual de esta patología, presentamos el caso clínico de una mujer norteamericana con enfermedad de Lyme que reúne todos los aspectos epidemiológicos, clínicos y de laboratorio necesarios para el diagnóstico. Caso clínico Mujer de 47 años, profesora, residente en nuestro país, que consultó por presentar lesiones cutáneas maculares, circulares, eritematosas, algunas edematosas y con aumento de la temperatura local, en las extremidades. Como antecedente refería haber viajado hacía tres semanas a Pensilvania, estado del noreste de E.U.A con amplias extensiones de bosques, donde realizó actividades al aire libre. Dos días después de su regreso a Santiago, presentó dolor mandibular, cefalea y cervicalgia intensa, que trató con ibuprofeno oral durante una semana y luego con ciclobenzaprina. Al sexto día presentó la primera mácula cutánea en el brazo derecho, a la que se fueron agregando otras, progresivamente. Una semana más tarde se agregó sensación febril no cuantificada, compromiso del estado general, insomnio y dolor en ambas muñecas y rodillas. Al examen físico dermatológico se evidenciaron múltiples máculas eritematosas tipo target o en diana, de gran tamaño (hasta 20 cm de diámetro mayor), en distintas etapas evolutivas. La lesión más grande se ubicaba en la cara posterior del muslo izquierdo, con aumento de la temperatura local, edema y sensación urente al tacto, compatible con un eritema migrans múltiple ( Figura 1a y 1b ). Figura 1a Eritema migrans múltiple en distintas etapas de evolución. Lesiones en la cara dorsal de muslos. Figura 1b Eritema migrans múltiple en distintas etapas de evolución. Lesiones en el tronco. Dado el cuadro clínico y el antecedente epidemiológico, se diagnosticó una enfermedad de Lyme en etapa diseminada temprana. Se inició tratamiento con doxiciclina 100 mg vía oral, fraccionado cada 12 h, por 21 días, cetirizina 10 mg oral al día e hidrocortisona 1% en loción tópica, dos veces al día. Se solicitó serología IgM e IgG para Borrelia burgdorferi , el cual fue realizado en el Laboratorio Clínico de Red de Salud UC Christus. Como tamizaje se detectaron anticuerpos por enzimoinmunoensayo fluorescente (Vidas R ) 13 y se confirmaron mediante western blot (MarDx R ), presentando tres bandas para proteínas de B. burgdorferi en IgM (positivo = dos bandas o más) y siete bandas en IgG (positivo = cinco o más) 5 . Al término del tratamiento se constató la mejoría de las lesiones cutáneas, manteniendo un leve eritema violáceo en ambos muslos ( Figura 2 ) y de los síntomas generales, aunque persistía con dolor leve en antebrazos y dedos y parestesias en los labios. La evaluación neurológica y cardiológica dirigida descartó un compromiso sistémico por la enfermedad de Lyme. Figura 2 Eritema residual post-tratamiento antimicrobiano en cara posterior de los muslos Discusión De acuerdo a la división clásica de la enfermedad de Lyme, nuestro caso corresponde a una etapa diseminada temprana, sin compromiso neurológico y cardíaco ( Tabla 1 ). Sin embargo, los hallazgos clínicos de cada etapa pueden sobreponerse y algunos pacientes pueden incluso presentar características de la etapa tardía, sin tener historia de síntomas o signos sugerentes de las etapas iniciales 5 , 14 . El diagnóstico de la enfermedad de Lyme es difícil para los médicos que no trabajamos en áreas endémicas de la enfermedad y ante un posible caso, es fundamental obtener una historia detallada de viajes, actividades recreativas y la presencia de alguna manifestación consistente con enfermedad de Lyme 15 . Tabla 1 Manifestación clínica, diagnóstico de laboratorio microbiológico y tratamiento antimicrobiano según la etapa clínica de la enfermedad de Lyme Etapa Localizada temprana Diseminada temprana Tardía Cuadro clínico Eritema migrans Eritema migrans múltiple Artritis de Lyme Linfocitoma por Borrelia * Neuroborreliosis de Lyme Acrodermatitis crónica atrófica Carditis de Lyme Manifestaciones oculares Examen de laboratorio No es necesario Serología para Bbsl Serología para Bbsl Ac específicos en LCR Tratamiento Doxiciclina 200 mg oral Doxiciclina 200 mg oral Ceftriaxona o cefotaxima intravenosa 2 semanas (*3 a 4 semanas) 3 semanas 4 semanas Adaptado de las referencias: 5 y 14 . El signo más importante para el diagnóstico de la enfermedad de Lyme en etapa localizada temprana adquirida en E.U.A es la presencia del eritema migrans 14 . Este se manifiesta como una mácula eritematosa que aparece en el sitio de mordedura de la garrapata usualmente desde 7-14 hasta 30 días después, en 80% de los pacientes. A diferencia de otras mordeduras de insectos, la aparición del eritema es tardío y se expande más de cinco cm 14 . La serología generalmente es negativa en esta etapa. Sólo 20 a 50% de los casos presenta anticuerpos detectables, pues no se alcanza a lograr una respuesta inmune adaptativa 5 , 16 , 17 . El diagnóstico en la etapa diseminada temprana, se realiza a partir de la constatación de signos como el eritema migrans múltiple, al igual que nuestro caso clínico, y puede sobreponerse a un compromiso neurológico o cardíaco 14 . El compromiso neurológico se considera consistente con enfermedad de Lyme si presenta meningitis linfocítica, neuritis de algún par craneano, parálisis del nervio facial o radiculoneuropatía 12 , 15 . El compromiso cardíaco se manifiesta con la instalación aguda de un bloqueo atrio-ventricular de 2° y 3° grado, que pueden asociarse a miocarditis 15 . La serología generalmente es positiva para anticuerpos IgM e IgG anti B. burgdorferi 5 , 18 . A nuestra paciente se le identificaron anticuerpos específicos, mediante los ensayos estándares internacionales, confirmando así la infección por B. burdorferi 5 , 13 . Cabe destacar, que las pruebas serológicas disponibles en nuestro país están optimizadas para la búsqueda de B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, la principal genoespecie en Norteamérica y Europa, siendo menor la sensibilidad de estas pruebas para otras genoespecies de Bbsl 13 . La etapa tardía de la enfermedad de Lyme ocurre meses o años después de la infección. El compromiso articular corresponde a episodios cortos y recurrentes de aumento de volumen monoarticular u oligoarticular. En E.U.A ésta es la característica más común de la etapa tardía 14 . Sólo en Europa se ha descrito una manifestación cutánea tardía infrecuente llamada acrodermatitis crónica atrófica 5 . En la etapa tardía de la enfermedad, las pruebas serológicas deberían ser positivas para anticuerpos IgG anti B. burgdorferi 5 , 14 . Las pruebas serológicas son menos específicas en poblaciones con baja probabilidad pre-test de enfermedad de Lyme 17 . Los falsos positivos pueden verse en otras borreliosis (fiebre remitente, enfermedad por Borrelia miyamotoi ), otras enfermedades por espiroquetas (sífilis, leptospirosis, pinta, frambesía, gingivitis), endocarditis infecciosa, virosis, lupus eritematoso sistémico y artritis reumatoide 19 . Y aunque se han propuesto nuevas estrategias para el diagnóstico serológico, ninguna ha ganado aceptación entre los expertos 5 , 17 . El tratamiento de la enfermedad de Lyme depende de la etapa clínica y las manifestaciones, existiendo variaciones en el tiempo de tratamiento sugerido según sean consensos norteamericanos o europeos 14 , 18 . Para la etapa temprana en adultos se recomienda el tratamiento con doxiciclina, amoxicilina o cefuroxima. Los pacientes que presentan eritema migrans múltiple podrían experimentar dentro de las 24 h del tratamiento una reacción de Jarisch-Herxheimer, que se debe advertir. Para manejar los síntomas asociados a la terapia se deben administrar anti-inflamatorios no esteroidales. No hay evidencia que la persistencia de fatiga, artralgias y cefalea después del tratamiento con antimicrobianos, a menudo denominado síndrome post-tratamiento o enfermedad de Lyme crónica, respondan a cursos de antibacterianos más prolongados de los recomendados 20 . El agente causal, Bbsl constituye un complejo de espiroquetas compuesto por 20 genoespecies distribuidas en el hemisferio norte 21 , 22 ; sin embargo, últimamente gracias a los métodos de secuenciación genética se han podido identificar otras, en lugares no tradicionales. El principal vector es la ninfa de la garrapata de patas negras, Ixodes scapularis 23 . Su tamaño es tan pequeño, que muchas veces los pacientes no notan la mordedura, por lo que se debe educar a los visitantes de zonas endémicas sobre la importancia de las acciones preventivas como el uso de repelentes y ropa adecuada para así minimizar la exposición a garrapatas 24 . La distribución geográfica de esta enfermedad se limita al hemisferio norte. En E.U.A. se han propuesto varias hipótesis que explicarían esta gradiente de distribución geográfica, como la gran diversidad de hospederos vertebrados en el sur que diluye la importancia del ratón como reservorio, o la abundancia relativa de lagartos en el sur, hospederos ineficientes para las ninfas de garrapata, y que además depredan los ratones 25 . Por último, las altas temperaturas del sur pueden cambiar los tiempos de desarrollo de la garrapata y su fenología, lo cual puede interferir en la transmisión estacional característica en los estados del norte 26 . Las garrapatas con complejo Bbsl septentrionales serían genéticamente diferentes a las del sur y esta diferencia se manifiesta en el comportamiento de búsqueda del hospedero de las ninfas. Las del norte suben a la parte superior de la hojarasca, mientras que las meridionales permanecen debajo de la superficie. Esto explica por qué las garrapatas del norte se adhieren con mayor facilidad a los seres humanos como hospederos, mientras que las del sur, aunque presentes, rara vez se encuentran con personas 27 , 28 . Esta evidencia pone de manifiesto que hay factores ambientales que están involucrados directamente con el ciclo zoonótico de la espiroqueta, y que son imprescindibles para que ésta pueda perpetuar el ciclo zoonótico. En 2013, se comunicó por primera vez la presencia de Bbsl en la pampa uruguaya en garrapatas del género Ixodes ricinus ( I. scapularis, I. pacificus ) e Ixodes pararicinus 29 . Más tarde, se publicó evidencia de Bbsl circulando en garrapatas en Argentina 30 , 31 . En Brasil, se han reportado casos similares a la enfermedad de Lyme, denominados síndrome tipo enfermedad de Lyme. En estos casos se han identificado espiroquetas y otras bacterias asociadas, distintas a Bbsl; el vector sería una garrapata muy voraz del género Amblyomma 32 . En Chile el año 2001, Osorio 33 encontró que, aunque todos los elementos requeridos para el ciclo zoonótico de Bbsl están presentes en el país, su detección directa en 62 garrapatas chilenas, usando RPC, fue negativa. Sin embargo, se requeriría realizar una recolección mayor de garrapatas y en un área geográfica más extensa para tener una conclusión significativa. Doce años más tarde, se describió la presencia de Borrelia chilensis 34 , genéticamente relacionada al complejo Bbsl, en garrapatas que son del género Ixodes y que infestan al ratón de cola larga ( Oligoryzomys longicaudatus ) y al pudú ( Pudu puda ) 35 , 36 . El estudio de Verdugo et al 36 sugiere que la garrapata I. stilesi puede jugar un rol importante en la persistencia de B. chilensis , aunque se requieren otros estudios biológicos de comportamiento de los vectores para comprender los mecanismos de transmisión natural de B. chilensis y el riesgo de infección en seres humanos. Hasta la fecha no hay casos reportados en nuestro país de infección en humanos por B. chilensis . Conclusión El caso clínico presentado cumple con los criterios de enfermedad de Lyme en etapa diseminada temprana por los hallazgos al examen físico, el antecedente de viaje a zona endémica y la confirmación serológica. Se trató adecuadamente y tuvo una notable mejoría clínica, sin complicaciones neurológicas y cardíacas y solo persistió con molestias músculo-articulares en antebrazos y dedos, que podrían corresponder a un síndrome post-tratamiento de enfermedad de Lyme. Es importante reconocer los síntomas y signos consistentes con enfermedad de Lyme, para iniciar de manera temprana la terapia antibacteriana que evita la progresión a la etapa crónica. Las pruebas serológicas de anticuerpos contra B. burgdorferi deben considerarse como un complemento del diagnóstico clínico y no pueden establecer ni excluir el diagnóstico de enfermedad de Lyme. A pesar de los casos comunicados en Chile como enfermedad de Lyme, el país no es considerado un área endémica, ya que Bbsl no se ha aislado en pacientes. Se necesitan más estudios para conocer la distribución, patogenia, reservorios y vectores de haplotipos de Bbsl emergentes en Sudamérica. Debido a la emergencia de nuevas especies y variantes, y a la generación de nuevas técnicas diagnósticas, es posible que el número de miembros del complejo Bbsl se incremente en los próximos años, extendiendo la enfermedad de Lyme fuera de sus fronteras tradicionales.",14900,0,0,1,0,es,es,

Although Lyme disease is the most common tickborne illness in the USA and Eurasia, the pathophysiology and clinical course of chronic Lyme disease (CLD) have not been formally defined. The purpose of this paper is to present a working case definition of CLD based on analysis of more than 700 peer-reviewed publications. According to this definition, CLD is a multisystem illness with diverse musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric and/or cardiovascular manifestations that result from ongoing infection with pathogenic members of the Borrelia spirochete complex often associated with other tickborne disease (TBD) pathogens. To qualify for the diagnosis of CLD, patients must have Lyme-compatible symptoms and signs that are either consistently or variably present for six or more months. Two subcategories of CLD include untreated chronic Lyme disease (CLD-U) and chronic Lyme disease following a limited course of antibiotic treatment (CLD-T). The symptom patterns and optimal therapy of CLD require further study.",1022,0,0,1,0,en,en,

However, recent studies have shown that migrating birds can transport ticks infected by bioagents between countries and continents. To evaluate serological evidence of human Borrelia-caused infections in Brazil, and to compare these data with the presence of migratory birds, and testing for spatio-temporal correlation between these two events. Spatiotemporal analysis of Lyme disease-reactive human serologies (2009-2016) and sites and times of migratory bird occurrence of in Brazil was conducted. Geographic groupings were analyzed by estimating Kernel density and Moran I Global Index. To evaluate record temporal structuring, data from months when migratory birds occur in Brazil (September to April), were compared with months of onset of symptoms clinically resembling Lyme borreliosis. Analysis of variance was performed to test whether the presence/absence of migratory birds is associated with the frequency of serologies. Results indicate a spatial association between the events (I=0.53). However, analysis of variance found no significant difference between the presence/absence of migratory birds in Brazil and the frequency of Lyme disease reactive serologies (F=0.564, df=1, p=0.456). The observed spatio-temporal pattern suggests that either translocation of infected vectors or the migration of birds with bacteremia from endemic areas may be responsible for human infections of Lyme borreliosis in Brazil. However, more research, monitoring and surveillance (human and animal) are required to support this hypothesis.Keywords:Lyme Borreliosis; Borrelia burgdorferi; Serology; Diagnosis; BrazilDownload PDF",1879,0,0,1,0,en,en,

However, they tend to overlook the politics and economics underpinning such factors and, in turn, what is necessary to change them. To remedy these problems, I take a political ecological approach to understand why and when anthropogenic changes, such as sub- and ex-urban development, facilitate the emergence and spread of ticks, their hosts, and the diseases they carry. Examining the case of Lyme disease in Northern Virginia, I argue that the emergence and spread of Lyme disease to new locations is not only the result of climate change and sub- and ex-urbanization, but also the result of the adoption of liberal economic policies, specifically financial deregulation and the privatization of government services. To support this argument, I demonstrate how changing forms of housing finance and the rise in federal government subcontracting from the 1970s onward propelled the growth of large-lot suburbs south of Washington D.C. and resulted in the creation of a landscape in which tick-hosts, ticks, and tick-borne disease thrive.",1208,0,0,1,0,es,en,

Due to the raised public awareness of Lyme Borreliosis (LB), its increased incidence and the increased availability of serological tests, the demand for diagnostic testing on LB has increased. This may affect the diagnostic behaviour of general practitioners (GPs). Aim of our study was to describe GPs’ diagnostic behaviour when suspecting LB. Methods. In this descriptive study from January 2010 to June 2015, we used the anonymized electronic medical records of 56,996 patients registered in 12 general practices in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The target population was identified by means of an extensive search strategy, based on International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-1) codes, free text and diagnostic test codes. All contacts related to LB were included in the analysis. Results. 2311 patients were included, accounting for 3861 LB contacts and 2619 LB episodes. The distribution of LB contacts showed annual peaks during spring and summer. Serological testing was performed in 36.4% of LB episodes and was mostly requested in patients presenting with general symptoms (71.4%). Unnecessary testing often occurred and only 5.9% of the tests turned out to be positive by immunoblot. From January 2010 to June 2015, no significant differences were found in the number of requested serological tests. The level of serological testing during LB episodes differed significantly between the general practices (19.2% to 75.8%). Conclusions. Contrary to clinical guidelines, GPs regularly requested serology even when there was a low suspicion of LB. The development of an easy-to-use diagnostic algorithm may decrease overuse of diagnostic tests and thereby reduce overtreatment of LB.",1709,0,0,1,0,en,en,

A major objective of this paper is to bring together background information on Borrelia (B.) burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) and basic clinical knowledge of LB, which is one of the most frequently reported vector-borne diseases in the Northern Hemisphere. The goal is to provide practical guidance for clinicians and for laboratory physicians, and scientists for a better understanding of current achievements and ongoing obstacles in the laboratory diagnosis of LB, an infectious disease that still remains one of the diagnostic chameleons of modern clinical medicine. Moreover, in bringing together current scientific information from guidelines, reviews, and original papers, this review provides recommendations for selecting the appropriate tests in relation to the patient’s stage of disease to achieve effective, stage-related application of current direct and indirect laboratory methods for the detection of B. burgdorferi s.l.

Furthermore, levels of MRP8/14 have been shown to be elevated in the joints of patients with Lyme arthritis. We hypothesized that MRP8/14 has a protective effect during B. burgdorferi infection. To determine the role of MRP8/14 in the immune response to B. burgdorferi , we studied the course of B. burgdorferi infection in wildtype ( wt) and mrp14 −/− mice. In addition, we studied the response of leukocytes from mice lacking MRP8/14 to B. burgdorferi ex vivo. We demonstrated similar levels of B. burgdorferi dissemination, cytokine and immunoglobulin production in infected wt and mrp14 −/− mice after 21 days. Neutrophils and monocytes lacking MRP8/14 were undiminished in their ability to become activated or phagocytose B. burgdorferi. In conclusion, we did not find a central role of MRP8/14 in the immune response against B. burgdorferi. As the levels of MRP8/14 in the serum of infected mice were low, we speculate that MRP8/14 is not released in levels great enough to influence the course of B. burgdorferi infection.",1309,0,0,1,0,it,en,

POWV lineage II, also known as deer tick virus, is the strain of the virus most frequently found in Ixodes scapularis ticks and is implicated in most cases of POWV encephalitis in the United States. Currently, no commercial tests are available to detect POWV exposure in tick-borne disease (TBD) patients. We describe here the development and analytical validation of a serologic test panel to detect POWV infections. The panel uses an indirect enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to screen. EIA-positive samples reflex to a laboratory-developed, POWV-specific immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The analytical sensitivity of the test panel was 89%, and the limit of detection was a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) titer of 1:20. The analytical specificity was 100% for the IgM assay and 65% for the IgG assay when heterologous-flavivirus-positive samples were tested. On samples collected from regions where Lyme disease is endemic, seroprevalence for POWV in TBD samples was 9.4% (10 of 106) versus 2% when tested with non-TBD samples (2 of 100, P = 0.034). No evidence of POWV infection was seen in samples collected from a region where Lyme disease was not endemic (0 of 22). This test panel provides a sensitive and specific platform for detecting a serologic response to POWV early in the course of infection when neutralizing antibodies may not be detectable. Combined with clinical history, the panel is an effective tool for identifying acute POWV infection.",1575,0,0,1,0,en,en,

For individuals who live in or have travelled to areas where ticks reside, LNB should be considered among differential diagnoses when clinical manifestations from the nervous system occur. Radiculitis, meningitis and facial palsy are commonly encountered, while peripheral neuropathy, myelitis, meningoencephalitis and cerebral vasculitis are rarer manifestations of LNB. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis and serology are key investigations in patient workup. The primary role of imaging is to rule out other reasons for the neurological symptoms. It is therefore important to know the diversity of possible imaging findings from the infection itself. There may be no imaging abnormality, or findings suggestive of neuritis, meningitis, myelitis, encephalitis or vasculitis. White matter lesions are not a prominent feature of LNB. Insight into LNB clinical presentation, laboratory test methods and spectrum of imaging pathology will aid in the multidisciplinary interaction that often is imperative to achieve an efficient patient workup and arrive at a correct diagnosis. This article can educate those engaged in imaging of the nervous system and serve as a comprehensive tool in clinical cases. Key Points. • Diagnostic criteria for LNB emphasise exclusion of an alternative cause to the clinical symptoms. • MRI makes a crucial contribution in the diagnosis and follow-up of LNB. • MRI may have normal findings, or show neuritis, meningitis, myelitis, encephalitis or vasculitis. • White matter lesions are not a prominent feature of LNB.",1666,0,0,1,0,en,it,

We previously identified a bacterial CarD N-terminal-like (CdnL) protein, LtpA (BB0355), in B. burgdorferi that is preferably expressed at lower temperatures, which is a surrogate condition mimicking the tick portion of the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi . CdnL-family proteins, an emerging class of bacterial RNAP-interacting transcription factors, are essential for the viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Myxococcus xanthus . Previous attempts to inactivate ltpA in B. burgdorferi have not been successful. In this study, we report the construction of a ltpA mutant in the infectious strain of B. burgdorferi , strain B31-5A4NP1. Unlike CdnL in M. tuberculosis and M. xanthus , LtpA is dispensable for the viability of B. burgdorferi . However, the ltpA mutant exhibits a reduced growth rate and a cold-sensitive phenotype. We demonstrate that LtpA positively regulates 16S rRNA expression, which contributes to the growth defects in the ltpA mutant. The ltpA mutant remains capable of infecting mice, albeit with delayed infection. Additionally, the ltpA mutant produces markedly reduced spirochetal loads in ticks and was not able to infect mice via tick infection. Overall, LtpA represents a novel regulator in the CdnL family that has an important role in the enzootic cycle of B. burgdorferi .",1436,0,0,1,0,en,en,

We report, as proof of concept, that a novel Cu hypersensitivity phenotype can be generated in mycobacteria, including Mtb, through a peptide, DAB-10, that is able to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) following Cu-binding. DAB-10 induces intramycobacterial oxidative stress in a Cu-dependent manner in vitro and during infection. DAB-10 penetrates murine macrophages and encounters intracellular mycobacteria. Significant intracellular Cu-dependent protection was observed when Mtb-infected macrophages were treated with DAB-10 alongside a cell-permeable Cu chelator. Treatment with the Cu chelator reversed the intramycobacterial oxidative shift induced by DAB-10. We conclude that DAB-10 utilizes the pool of phagosomal Cu ions in the host–Mtb interface to augment the mycobactericidal activity of macrophages while simultaneously exploiting the susceptibility of Mtb to ROS.

Metformin is an oral biguanide and a first choice anti-hyperglycaemic medication for T2DM. It reduces levels of blood glucose by inhibition of glucose production in the liver. Metformin helps the body to restore its ability to respond to insulin and is generally a safe and effective treatment. Other than glycaemic control, metformin also improves insulin resistance, dysfunction of the endothelium, oxidative stress, and haemostasis and lipid profiles. Metformin can help to avoid complications as a result of high blood glucose, such as diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy and retinopathy. Metformin can adversely affect renal functions of T2DM patients and chronic kidney disease can develop. The serious side effect of lactic acidosis is rare but can develop because metformin can accumulate. This review discusses the possible side effects of metformin, however patients taking metformin may or may not experience any or all of them. Metformin should be used carefully in the elderly and in patients who have trauma, fever, surgery, heart failure, impaired kidney or liver functions.

Recent findings Two-tier testing combining pairs of ELISAs, using C6 or VlsE assays to replace second tier Western blots, may eliminate confusion about test interpretation. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can be informative in diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) Lyme disease, not peripheral nervous system (PNS) disorders. CSF CXCL13 may provide useful adjunctive information in CNS infection; its specificity remains to be defined. Lyme encephalopathy is not indicative of CNS infection. Post treatment Lyme disease symptoms do not occur in patients who have had definite CNS Lyme infection. Whether post treatment Lyme disease symptom (PTLDS) is an actual entity, or reflects anchoring bias when commonly occurring symptoms arise in patients previously treated for Lyme disease, remains to be determined. Regardless, these symptoms do not reflect CNS infection and do not respond to additional antimicrobial therapy. Summary Serologic testing is robust in individuals with a priori likelihood of infection of greater than 2–6 weeks duration. Western blots provide useful confirmation of screening ELISAs, but may be replaced by second ELISAs. CSF testing, including CXCL13, may be informative in CNS Lyme, not PNS, and is generally normal in Lyme encephalopathy. PTLDS does not occur following CNS infection, and may not be a distinct entity.",1467,0,0,1,0,en,fr,

Students should be able to connect what they learn in their biology courses to explain these events happening around them. Unfortunately, students do not necessarily make those connections. Therefore, it is important, as instructors, to provide opportunities where students engage with societal issues and problems related to course content and case studies, using headlines from the news are one way to do this. Here I describe a case study about Lyme disease that engages students in learning about the ecology of infectious disease. Lyme disease incidence has tripled in the last 15 years and is estimated to affect 300,000 Americans annually. This lesson uses an NPR news audio clip containing interviews with two disease ecologists, Rick Ostfeld and Felicia Keesing, who describe predicting Lyme disease incidence by measuring mice populations. The activities in this lesson explore factors that led to the recent surge in Lyme disease. In small collaborative groups, students analyze data figures from publications by the Ostfeld and Keesing labs (along with others) to construct an understanding of the ecology of Lyme disease and predict how changes to the ecosystem could affect Lyme disease incidence. This case study lesson could be relevant to those teaching microbiology, ecology, public health or biology for majors. Citation Klockow, L. 2019.

The use of structured small group work allows input and collaboration among all students. Students work with the same team of peers throughout the semester to enable less confident students to become comfortable sharing their ideas in a nonthreatening environment so that they can gain confidence in their knowledge. I provided guidance on effective teamwork at the beginning of the semester to ensure that team expectations were clear, and that group work would be inclusive and productive. Framing the content around a current and real-world event provides relevance to a variety of students. The use of Lyme disease as our case study allowed opportunities to think about environmental issues and public health issues in addition to microbiology and therefore appeals to students' broader interests. Active Learning Students read a CDC-produced brochure as well as a scientific article outside of class to gain an understanding of Lyme disease and its transmission cycle as well as a basic introduction to the ecology of infectious disease. Students then spend class time working in teams of four to five students to interpret data from a number of research articles on Lyme Disease and to evaluate potential answers to each question on the case study worksheet. Teams of students are given a single case study worksheet to encourage discussion and debate. During the whole class debrief, students are asked to provide and explain their responses to the case study questions. This whole class debrief allows teams to assess their own responses for correctness. Individually, students will summarize what they have learned by creating a concept map demonstrating connections between the concepts discussed. Assessment I assess students' understanding of the background reading by an individual and group quiz (Supporting File S2: Lyme Disease-Reading Quiz). This multiple-choice quiz is initially taken individually. Then the student takes the same quiz with their team using an IF-AT scratch off card (http://www.epsteineducation.com/home/) for immediate feedback. I also informally assess background knowledge by visually inspecting the teams' drawings of the transmission cycle of Lyme disease.


Students can self-assess during the student-led discussions of the case study worksheet questions (Supporting File S3: Lyme Disease In-class Worksheet) as peers can correct each other and/or clarify concepts to one another. I provide formative assessment by interacting with groups during the team discussions and during the entire class debrief. I also collect and assess the team written responses for accuracy. I provide written comments on the worksheets that are returned to students the following class.


Finally, summative assessment occurs when I gauge each team's concept map during class session 2 for accuracy and integration of concepts. Each individual student created a concept map as homework prior to class session 2 and these may be turned in collected and assessed for an individual grade although I did not choose to do that. INTRODUCTION Outbreaks and infectious diseases make headlines all the time. Students hear about these events and need to understand and grapple with their implications. However, students do not always connect what's happening in the world with the science I am teaching in my microbiology course. I want to help students see those connections so that hopefully they can make them for themselves beyond the classroom. Indeed, research shows that experts tend to organize knowledge with a high density of connections versus novices who often learn concepts in isolation, making few connections among concepts and facts ( 1 ). To help students see the relevance of microbiology in the world around them and to appreciate the impact of societal behavior on the emergence of infectious diseases and their spread, I developed this lesson to engage students in learning about the ecology of infectious disease and the interconnectedness of humans, microorganisms, animals and the environment and its impact on human health. To achieve this, I developed a case study that focuses on a current infectious disease epidemic. Case Study Approach I chose the case study approach because it is student-centered, collaborative, and shifts the focus away from memorizing facts to applying concepts and skills to solve real world problems ( 2 ). Furthermore, providing content in the form of a narrative of a real-world event makes the content more relevant to students ( 3 ) and since relevance can be a strong motivating factor ( 4 ), case studies can engage students in deep and lasting learning ( 1 ). The case study approach was particularly appropriate in the context of teaching the ecology of infectious disease because it has been shown to be highly effective in promoting interdisciplinary learning ( 5 , 6 ). This case study lesson is anchored by an NPR audio news clip ( 7 ) containing interviews with two disease ecologists, Rick Ostfeld and Felicia Kessing, who describe their novel way of predicting Lyme disease incidence by measuring mice populations. The activities in this lesson follow the experiments performed by the ecologists featured in the news report to explore the factors that have led to the surge in Lyme disease. In small collaborative groups, students analyze data figures from publications by the Ostfeld and Kessing labs (along with others) to construct an understanding of the ecology of Lyme disease and predict how changes to the ecosystem would affect Lyme disease incidence. This news story provided an interesting case study to engage students in examining factors that have led to the surge in Lyme disease and to learn about the ecology of infectious disease. INTENDED AUDIENCE This lesson was designed for a class of 20-25 junior and senior-level biomedical science majors in an elective course about Outbreaks, Epidemics and Pandemics. In this course, students learn about both the biological as well as the social/cultural/environmental factors that impact disease spread and how to prevent and control outbreaks. The vast majority of students intend to pursue health professional careers (physicians, dentists and physician assistants) or public health careers. REQUIRED LEARNING TIME The lesson was completed in 90 minutes using 1 x 75-minute class period and the first 15 minutes of a second class period. PRE-REQUISITE STUDENT KNOWLEDGE The students should have basic skills in interpreting line and bar graphs and in the process of science, i.e. making predictions based on evidence, testing those predictions against experimental or observational data and modifying one's own understanding in light of evidence. The students should also have basic knowledge of infectious disease and the chain of transmission including the role of reservoirs. If students lack this knowledge, this content could be provided by a brief mini lecture in a preceding class or as an assigned reading prior to class. PRE-REQUISITE TEACHER KNOWLEDGE Instructors should have a basic understanding of the transmission cycle of Lyme disease and the ecology of Lyme disease including the roles of mice, tick, and deer. Instructors should also familiarize themselves with the experiments performed to generate the graphs in the case study worksheet by reading the scientific papers referenced by each graph (Table 1). I suggest instructors read the full scientific papers to familiarize themselves with Ostfeld and Keesing's research in order to field potential student questions that may arise. The instructor does not need to have a comprehensive background in microbiology or ecology to understand these papers or to teach this lesson. Table 1. Scientific Articles used in the case study SCIENTIFIC TEACHING THEMES ACTIVE LEARNING Students read a CDC-produced brochure as well as a scientific article outside of class to gain an understanding of Lyme disease and its transmission cycle as well as a basic introduction to the ecology of infectious disease.

INCLUSIVE TEACHING The lesson uses multiple approaches to facilitate learning: reading, listening, analyzing data, discussing and creating a concept map. The use of structured small group work allows input and collaboration among all students. Students work with the same team of peers throughout the semester to enable less confident students to become comfortable sharing their ideas in a nonthreatening environment so that they can gain confidence in their knowledge. I provided guidance on effective teamwork at the beginning of the semester to ensure that team expectations were clear, and that group work would be inclusive and productive.

LESSON PLAN COURSE CONTEXT AND COURSE SITUATIONAL FACTORS This activity is designed as part of a unit on the physical and social environmental factors that facilitate infectious disease spread. This unit is one of 4 units of a 3-credit upper level course on Outbreaks, Epidemics and Pandemics taught by a single instructor. The lesson occurs after basic infectious disease concepts of chain of transmission, role of reservoirs and zoonotic disease have been covered. Fourteen and 22 students enrolled, respectively, during the two semesters I implemented the case study. A course in microbiology was a prerequisite for this course; however, the activity could be adapted for lower division students who haven't taken microbiology yet. The course was designed using a team-based learning model in which students work in groups of 4-5 on class activities throughout the semester. I randomly assigned students to groups and they worked with the same group throughout the semester. Thus, the students had established effective group dynamics and had experienced working on case studies and completing a case study worksheet before this particular activity. The course was taught in both a standard classroom and a collaborative and active learning (CAL) classroom ( http://www.marquette.edu/ctl/faculty-professional-development/CallforProposalstoTeachinCALClassroom.shtml ). The standard classroom had small moveable desks whereas the CAL classroom had tables large enough for students to work in groups of 4 or 5, moveable chairs and portable white boards. In the discussion, I describe some modifications I made to the standard classroom to implement the collaborative and active learning approach of this lesson. TIMELINE OF LESSON PRE-CLASS STUDENT PREPARATION This lesson specifically addresses humans' impact on the ecosystem and how this changes the dynamics between bacteria, animal reservoirs, and human hosts. The students should already be familiar with basic infectious disease concepts such as the chain of transmission, transmission cycles, role and types of reservoirs and zoonotic disease. I covered these concepts in prior lectures and/or prior reading assignments in this course. For example, students have read several scientific review papers about zoonotic spillover events and different types of transmission cycles of vector-borne diseases prior to this lesson ( 8-10 ). These additional references may be assigned in preparation for this lesson as well. Students will also need to understand concepts specifically related to transmission of Lyme disease. I assign a CDC brochure, ""Lyme disease: What you need to know,"" as outside-of-class reading to provide students with this background. In addition, students read a scientific review article about biodiversity loss and the ecology of infectious diseases as homework ( 11 ). Reading objectives are provided to the students to guide their reading (Supporting File S1: Lyme Disease Reading Assignment). If students have not yet been introduced to the topics of reservoirs, transmission cycles or zoonotic disease, then additional readings that cover these topics should be assigned. Example resources are provided in the modifications for lower division students in the Discussion. PRE-CLASS INSTRUCTOR PREPARATION Instructors should assign the pre-class reading to students before the class period in which you use the case study. Instructors should prepare copies of the reading quiz (Supporting File S2: Lyme Disease-Reading Quiz) for each student, a case study worksheet per student group (Supporting File S3 Lyme Disease In-Class Worksheet) and an IF-AT scratch off card per student group. Instructors should check that the embedded links to the audio files function properly with their classroom equipment. Instructors may choose to download the audio file of the NPR story from: http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=518219485 . INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP READINESS ASSURANCE TEST Class begins with an activity to ensure students' understanding of the preassigned reading about Lyme disease transmission. Each student takes an individual readiness assurance test (i.e. a quiz) and submits their answers for a grade (Supporting File S2: Lyme Disease-Reading Quiz). I use the Zipgrade app ( https://www.zipgrade.com/ ) to grade these individual quizzes and examine the item analysis to gauge which quiz questions were challenging to the students. It takes me less than 2 minutes to grade 22 quizzes using Zipgrade. While I grade the individual quizzes, the students work within their small group on the same quiz and submit group responses by completing an Immediate Feedback Assessment Technique (IF-AT) card ( http://www.epsteineducation.com/home/about/ ). The purpose of using the IF-AT card is that the group must discuss the answers and reach consensus before committing to an answer. The IF-AT cards also provide immediate feedback and students are able to make a second attempt at a question is their initial answer is incorrect. The quiz is worth a total of 15 points with the individual quiz making up 5 of the points and the group quiz grade making up 10 of the points. The grading was designed intentionally to emphasize group work. INTRODUCTION TO THE CASE I begin the case study activity by playing the first 2 minutes of the audio file titled, ""Forbidding Forecast for Lyme Disease in the Northeast"" by Michaeleen Doucleff and Jane Greenhalgh aired on National Public Radio on March 6, 2017 ( 7 ), (Embedded audio file in slide 2 of Supporting File S5-Lyme Disease Case Slides). The clip introduces the students to the case: an emerging Lyme disease epidemic is happening in the Northeast and 2017 is predicted to be the worst year for Lyme disease. Why is this happening? The ecologists in the story imply that an increase in the mice population predicts a high number of Lyme disease cases. After the clip, I explain to the students that they will be working through this case study to figure out the relationship between large mouse populations and Lyme disease to understand more broadly how humans' impact on the environment is a driver of emerging infectious diseases. The individual and group quizzes encouraged retrieval of the students' knowledge of the life cycle of ticks and Lyme disease transmission from the assigned reading. After the case is introduced, the students use their prior knowledge to create a visual flow diagram of the chain of transmission of Lyme disease on a white board, which is essential to thinking through the case. I quickly assess the drawings by looking at each group's white board and address any incorrect concept or any missing factors. Next, we discuss the concept of the epidemiological triangle, and I emphasize that this case study will focus on the environment that increases exposure of the human host to the infectious agent, Borrelia burgdorferi . Then, I play the next minute of the audio file, which reinforces the chain of transmission of Lyme disease and describes the spread of Lyme disease in the U.S. and ends with the reporter asking, ""So why is Lyme spreading like this? That question is simple, but the answer is complicated."" Student teams then brainstorm ideas for why Lyme cases have tripled in the last 30 years and these ideas are shared with the entire class. I then guide the discussion back to the case study and repeat the prediction voiced in the case study by the featured ecologists, Felicia Keesing and Rick Ostfeld, that large mouse populations lead to increased Lyme cases. I then explain to the students that they will be interpreting data published by Keesing's and Ostfeld's labs. DISCUSSION OF FIGURES The bulk of the lesson is spent with students working through the case study worksheet (Supporting File S3 Lyme Disease In-Class Worksheet) either interpreting graphs from Keesing and Ostfeld publications or predicting the results of Keesing and Ostfeld's experiments and then verifying their predictions by comparing to published results. Case Study Figure 1 (slide 12 from Supporting File S5: Lyme Disease- Case Slides) is a graph created from the data in Table 1 from LoGiudice et al ( 12 ). I explain that the authors sampled various host species by collecting the engorged larvae from animals during a 72-hour captive period and calculating the proportion of engorged larvae that molted into nymphs and the infection prevalence of the resulting nymphs. After students examine Case Study Figure 1, the instructor can prompt them to analyze the figure and use the data to explain why Drs. Keesing and Ostfeld focused on mice. The next discussion prompt is to get students to think about why mice might be a competent reservoir. In a previous lecture, we covered features of reservoir competence and so this discussion serves to reinforce this concepts. However, if reservoir competence is not a critical concept for your students, this discussion prompt can be skipped without affecting the goals of the case study. Next, the students brainstorm why mice populations increase. Even though none of the students in the course had taken an ecology course, they were able to come up with ecological explanations such as loss of predators, higher birth rate, influx of mice from other areas in search of food, abundance of food, availability of alternative food source, milder weather, etc. I then explain the experiment conducted by Schauber et al., where researchers measured acorn production annually from 1992-2002 by placing baskets underneath mature oak trees in two 2.25 hectare forest plots at the Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Duchess County, New York and counting intact mature acorns collected every month during autumn. They calculated acorn production by dividing the total acorn count by square meter of ground under oak trees ( 13 ). The authors also calculated mouse density in the same two 2.25 ha areas by a capture-mark-recapture method to count mice and then divided the number of mice per square meter. Students are asked in question 4 to consider Case Study Figure 2 (slide 17 from Supporting File S5: Lyme Disease- Case Slides) and as a group, write down their conclusion. After a brief discussion of Case Study figure 2, I give a mini lecture about masting events and then ask the students, ""Why would an increase of acorns lead to increased mice density the following year?"" Possible response may include higher mouse survival, immigration of mice to the area of high food, and higher fitness and consequently better breeding. I then explain that Dr. Ostfeld's group did an experiment that was published in Science , one of the premier science journals ( 14 ), to examine this question. Their experiment aimed to characterize the relationship between acorn production and mouse survival and reproduction. The researchers took advantage of the fact that in 1995, acorn production at their research site was exceptionally low (lower by a factor of 18 than in 1994). They added acorns to 3 experimental grids of land but not to three control grids in October- November 1995 and monitored mouse density and reproductive status each month before, during and after the acorn addition. Students analyze Case Study Figure 3 (slide 20 from Supporting File S5: Lyme Disease- Case Slides) and write down their conclusions. Students should be able to articulate that after acorn addition in Nov/Dec, mice densities were greater in the experimental grids than on control grids from March- August. The instructor can then also discuss the mouse breeding data which is consistent with the mouse density data. After the Case Study Figure 3 discussion, the students predict the levels of tick density in the control and experimental grids after acorn addition in the same experiment. The case study worksheet includes a blank template of a graph (Question 6) that the students should fill in. By providing a template, the students must visualize how the data should appear and commit to a prediction. I find that having the students draw their prediction on the graph allows for a richer discussion of their ideas. This also allows instructors the opportunity to very quickly assess each groups' prediction by quickly glancing at their drawn graphs on their worksheet. After I ask one group to explain their prediction, I then discuss the results published by Jones et al. ( 14 ) and students can compare and assess their own predictions. After a brief mini lecture about urban sprawl and forest fragmentation, students then predict the effects of forest fragmentation on mouse density. I then reveal a figure from Nupp and Swihart, ""Case Study Figure 4 (slide 27 from Supporting File S5: Lyme Disease- Case Slides) that shows that as woodland size decreases, mice density increases ( 15 ). Next, students use knowledge gained from their assigned reading to discuss why mice may be resilient to forest fragmentation. Students then predict the effect of forest fragmentation on tick density, again using a provided graph template. Next, I display the data figure from Allan et al. ( 16 ), ""Case study Figure 5"" (slide 33 from Supporting File S5: Lyme Disease- Case Slides), that shows that as forest size decreases, tick density also decreases. Students compare and assess their predictions to the published data. Subsequently, students predict the effect of a decrease in species biodiversity on Lyme prevalence using a provided graph template. Again, students compare their prediction to published data from Ostfeld et al. ( 17 ). SUMMARIZE IN A CONCEPT MAP After going through the data that helps explain the ecology of Lyme disease, I ask the students to construct a concept map as homework, using a provided list of terms (Question 14 from Supporting File S3 Lyme Disease In-class Worksheet), to synthesize what they learned. CONCLUDING THE CASE The lesson continues the next class period. The students begin by sharing their concept maps with their team members. Then together as a team, they construct a group concept map and draw it on the white board. I quickly assess the group concept maps and address any errors. Student groups are invited to look at other groups' concept maps and compare to their own. We then listen to the remaining few minutes of the audio file, which explains how urban development of forest areas impacts mice populations, leading to increased tick populations and consequently increased incidence of Lyme disease. As a whole class, we debrief on why one would expect to see a high incidence of Lyme disease cases in a suburban habitat based on the interactions in the concept map. This leads into a broader discussion of strategies to control the Lyme disease epidemic and prevent its further spread. The lesson is completed in about 15 minutes of this second class period, leaving time to cover a new topic. Table 2. Lyme Disease Case - Teaching Timeline Table 2. Lyme Disease Case - Teaching Timeline (continued) TEACHING DISCUSSION This case study activity is an engaging, adaptable lesson that effectively gets students thinking broadly about infectious disease and the interplay between animals, humans, microbes and the environment in disease emergence. Examining disease ecology data helps students see the connections among the multiple determinants of disease outbreaks. The case study format and the use of a current news story make the topics of disease ecology, epidemics, and emerging infectious diseases approachable and interesting. LESSON'S EFFECTIVENESS The Lyme disease epidemic case study provides a framework for students to integrate concepts of ecology, microbiology and epidemiology to construct a rich understanding of how this epidemic emerged. The first question in the handout will typically elicit somewhat superficial responses from students to explain the recent explosion of Lyme disease cases in the US. By following the experiments from Keesing's and Ostfeld's labs, students dive deep into the research to understand the connections between humans, environment, wildlife, and pathogen. At the end of the lesson, students synthesize their knowledge by creating a concept map. My assessment of the groups' concepts maps indicate that the lesson was effective for student learning of how changes in the interactions between bacteria, animals, plants, and humans increased Lyme disease incidence. While students explored the microbiology and ecology behind the case, they also explored the social human factors that impact disease emergence. Exploring these interactions in the context of a case study led to richer discussions of the multiple determinants of disease emergence and establishment of epidemics in subsequent class discussions. In addition to content, the case study was also designed to encourage students to develop hypotheses and predict the graphical representation of experimental data. I observed that students became more comfortable over the course of the lesson with drawing their predicted graphs. The first time they are asked to draw their prediction in the graph template (Question 6 from Supporting File S3 Lyme Disease In-class Worksheet), the students seem hesitant but as we move through the activity, they seem more willing to take intellectual risks and draw multiple possible outcomes that the group can then discuss to determine the most likely outcome. Asking students to draw their prediction on a graph not only forces them to commit to a clear unambiguous answer as a group, but also requires the students to externally visualize their understanding of the concept. Thus, asking students to draw the predicated data allows the instructor to quickly gauge whether the students understood the experiment and concept. STUDENTS' REACTION The students' response to the case study and small group work format was very positive. In 2017, students completed an anonymous course survey where they were asked to rate on a Likert scale of one through five the usefulness/effectiveness of various course components. 10 of the 12 (83%) students who completed the survey rated the case-based format as ""most useful/effective"" (score=5) and the remaining students (17%) rated it as ""useful/effective"" (score=4). In 2018, the class completed a different anonymous survey and in response to the open-ended question, ""What worked well for you in this course?"" a majority of students (11/20) mentioned specifically the opportunity to work with a group of peers on the worksheets. A representative student comment was: ""The ability to collaborate in small groups each class was a great simulation for the teamwork that is required of all professionals."" In addition, some (7/20) responded to the same open ended question that the case studies specifically were what worked well for them : ""It [case study format] really helped put things into a ""real life"" and applicable perspective"" and ""The case studies during class allowed me to conceptually apply the material we would learn in class."" ADAPTATIONS AND MODIFICATIONS DIFFERENT TOPIC EMPHASIS While this activity was implemented in a small upper-division infectious disease course, its content touches upon multiple disciplines and therefore could be appropriate for ecology, microbiology, epidemiology, environmental studies, general biology, or (with modifications) biology for non-majors courses. Depending on the course learning goals, different concepts of the case may be emphasized or eliminated. For example, an ecology course may eliminate the discussion of reservoir competence but spend more time discussing oak tree masting events or the impact of biodiversity loss. ADAPTING FOR LOWER DIVISION BIOLOGY STUDENTS The activity could be used with lower division biology students who have not taken a course in microbiology. These students would need to receive instruction in or read as an assigned reading about concepts of transmission, reservoir and infections. A good resource that covers these topics is Lesson 1 Introduction to Epidemiology Section 10: Chain of Infection from Principles of Epidemiology in Public Health Practice, a free online resource published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( https://www.cdc.gov/ophss/csels/dsepd/ss1978/lesson1/section10.html ). Excellent, short video clips are available to introduce students to the concept of zoonoses ( https://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/04/07/unseen-enemy-extra-1.cnn ). Reading objectives should be modified based on the students' prior knowledge. For example, my students had already been introduced to the topics of sylvatic and urban transmission cycles and therefore were able to answer Reading Objective #5 using their prior knowledge. For lower division students, this reading objective and others may need to be modified. Adapting the activity in the classroom would require more instructor guidance of student-led discussions of the worksheet questions. If enrollment is large, then senior undergraduate or graduate teaching assistants may be needed to facilitate the small group discussions. In addition, more time for whole class debriefs would be needed to articular the process of interpretation of the data and how it supports a particular response. WHITEBOARDS FOR GROUP DRAWING (PATHWAYS, CONCEPT MAPS, PREDICTED GRAPHS, ETC.) Because my course emphasizes group work, this exercise (along with others that I use in the course) requires students to generate drawings of predicted graphical data, pathways and concept maps to visually represent students' thinking to help facilitate the discussion of ideas in a group. Because I teach in both a CAL classroom and a classroom that does not have white boards, I have modified the traditional classroom by taping large poster-size pieces of paper to the wall at the start of class on days that involve drawing. In addition, 3M makes easel pad size Post-It adhesive paper, although these can be expensive. Other ways to facilitate drawing for small group discussion are laminated poster boards or cut marker board sheets from a home improvement store that students can write on with dry-erase markers. DIFFERENT TIME FRAMES While the activity is designed to take ~90 minutes, it could be extended by including further discussion questions. For example, students could be shown a brief news clip about a different epidemic of a zoonotic disease and asked how forest fragmentation may impact it. Some examples include the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic or Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the U.S. In a higher-level course where students have been trained in reading primary literature, students could be assigned to read the original scientific papers and complete the worksheet as a homework assignment and class time could then be used to discuss their answers. Depending on the course objectives, certain worksheet questions or topics may be eliminated to shorten the case study activity to fit a 60-minute class format. ADAPTING FOR A LARGE ENROLLMENT CLASS While the activity was used in relatively small (<25 students) classes, it could be adapted for use in a large enrollment class by allowing more time for the all-class debrief. A subset of groups could be asked to present their responses to the worksheet questions. Teaching assistants could rotate among groups as they work through the worksheet questions guiding students in their small group discussions. Sample concept maps or sample graph predictions could be shared with the entire class by capturing with a cell phone or document camera and projecting to the class. ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS TO GRADE GROUP QUIZZES This instructor used IF-AT cards for the group quizzes however, if an instructor does not have access to IF-AT cards, students could also simply submit a single group answer sheet that the instructor grades immediately. Alternatively, some student response systems have a group quiz function (i.e., Learning Catalytics) or a team mode (i.e., Kahoot!) which would allow immediate feedback to the group.

A 32-year old male experiencing extreme fatigue and low-grade fever payed a visit to his general practitioner weeks after his initial symptoms.  He assumed it was stress related due to working the night shift.  His physician ordered routine blood work.  The results were negative including a Lyme ELISA screen.  It was recommended that he take it easy and try and get more sleep.  Despite getting more rest, his symptoms continued and several months later began to experience neurological symptoms including migraines, blurred vision and Bell's palsy.  Physicians ruled out stroke, Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus.  Despite multiple visits to various physicians, no definitive diagnosis was made.   Finally, after 9 months, he was diagnosed with Stage 3 Lyme disease and was treated with IV Rocephin for three weeks.  Although IV antibiotics were administered, he continued to experience neurological symptoms for years as well as cardiac involvement including a mild heart attack.  Unfortunately, six years later he discovered a tick embedded in his chest which was sent to the CDC and tested positive for Lyme disease.  Once again, he was placed on IV Rocephin for 6 weeks.  The initial misdiagnosis and the progression to Stage 3 Lyme disease plus becoming infected a second time with Borrelia burgdorferi (causative agent of Lyme disease) resulted in irreversible clinical manifestations.  As a result, he continues to suffer from neurological, cardiac, gastrointestinal, bladder, prostate and pulmonary issues in addition to arthritis and osteoarthritis.  This case report will follow the patient's disease progression over the course of 28 years and will emphasize the need for a quick, accurate

We describe a case report of an elderly patient who had presented with acute onset of atypical lower extremity pain and gait dysfunction, and was ultimately diagnosed with Lyme arthritis. Case report. A 70-year-old male presented with a chief complaint of 10 days of lower back and bilateral lower extremity pain. He described sudden onset of intense, sharp bilateral anterior thigh pain radiating to the medial calves intermittently and without paresthesia, bowel or bladder incontinence, fevers, rashes or weight change. His gait was found to be antalgic and slow. Strength, sensation, and reflexes were intact in both legs. X-ray imaging of bilateral hips revealed mild osteoarthritis bilaterally. An MRI of the bilateral hips showed bilateral hip effusions with synovial proliferation and degenerative labral tearing. He underwent a fluoroscopically guided bilateral injection with each hip, and clear, straw-colored synovial fluid was aspirated from the left hip. He gave additional history following the injection of being treated for Lyme disease 4 months prior to the onset of his leg pain, for which he previously completed 2 weeks of doxycycline. Fluid analysis revealed elevated nucleated cell count and positive serology for multiple Borrelia-specific bands, consistent with Lyme arthritis. He was subsequently treated with a 4 week course of doxycycline. As of 18 months later, his pain has improved significantly. Conclusion. Patients with antibiotic refractory Lyme disease that continue to have chronic symptoms, including arthritis and synovitis, after appropriate antibiotic therapy may benefit from treatment with anti-inflammatory medications, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARD) or synovectomy.",1740,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In particular, we determined the basic reproduction number R 0 of any combination of each genospecies and various species of rodents, birds, and lizards. Based on a thorough literature analysis, we parameterized the model with field-derived and laboratory-derived values. Although R 0 of Borrelia afzelii varied widely with the rodent species analysed, the association of this genospecies with rodents overall reached higher R 0 values than the association of B. garinii or B. valaisiana with birds or of B. lusitaniae with lizards. For such well-adapted combinations of genospecies and host species, the survival probability from larva to nymphs and the parameters relevant for horizontal transmission most strongly influenced R 0 . The model differentiated the transmission efficiency of the two ubiquitous genospecies infecting rodents, B. afzelii and B. burgdorferi s.s. and emphasized differences between experimental and field-derived observations. It appears that the fraction of blood meals that larvae take on particular omnipresent host species influences the local proportion of each of the ubiquitous genospecies - B. afzelii , B. garinii and B. valaisiana - in questing nymphs. The efficiency of the transmission cycles of locally restricted genospecies - B. spielmanii and B. lusitaniae - on the other hand, appears to result in their predominance in sites, where their respective competent hosts occur. We observed that R 0 varies around its threshold value of 1 depending on the genospecies-host association and differs for species even within host groups. This justifies and calls for distinguishing both, genospecies and host species, in further modelling studies in Central Europe.",1948,0,0,1,0,it,en,

While previous studies have provided useful insights into various aspects of Lyme disease, the tick's host preference in the presence of multiple hosts has not been considered in the existing models. In this study, we develop a transmission dynamics model that includes the interactions between the primary vectors involved: blacklegged ticks ( I. scapularis ), white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ), and white-tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ). Our model shows that the presence of multiple vectors may have a significant impact on the dynamics and spread of Lyme disease. Based on our model, we also calculate the basic reproduction number, R 0 , a threshold value that predicts whether a disease exists or dies out. Subsequent extensions of the model consider seasonality of the tick's feeding period and mobility of deer between counties. Our results suggest that a longer tick peak feeding period results in a higher infection prevalence. Moreover, while the deer mobility may not be a primary factor for short-term emergence of Lyme disease epidemics, in the long-run it can significantly contribute to local infectiousness in neighboring counties, which eventually reach the endemic steady state.",1383,0,0,1,0,en,en,

3872,case reports in veterinary medicine,A Suspected Case of Lyme Borreliosis in a Dog from Belgium,"['Marina Gatellet', 'Sébastien Vanderheyden', 'Michel Abee', 'Łukasz Adaszek', 'Marie Varloud']",10.1155/2019/3973901,2019.0,1,journal-article,"Abstract. A 5-year-old Jack Russell Spaniel was presented in December 2017 to his veterinarian in Belgium for sudden weakness, reluctance to move, and pain. Blood analysis showed no deviations and serum increased levels of B. burgdorferi s.l. antibodies were detected. The dog recovered a few days after the onset of doxycycline treatment. This case illustrates the possible relationship between tick-borne diseases and orthopedic problems. 1. Introduction. Borreliosis is a tick-borne disease caused by a gram-negative spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (B. burgdorferi s.l. ) which includes at least 11 subspecies, of which 3 are considered pathogenic for dogs: Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto ( B. burgdorferi s.s.), Borrelia afzelii , and Borrelia garinii . Pathogenicity of other species has not been demonstrated so far. The vectors of Borrelia in Europe are Ixodes ticks which primarily live in deciduous woodland and mixed forest. These ticks can feed on various species of mammals and birds. In some European areas, up to 75% of Ixodes ticks can be infected by Borrelia spp. [ 1 , 2 ]. This result might explain why, in Belgium, 21.6% of forest workers were detected seropositive for Borrelia burgdorferi [ 3 ]. Based on this observation, it is likely that dogs that often walk in the forest are also heavily exposed to spirochetes. In experimental studies, around 57% of Borrelia infected dogs exhibited clinical signs of Lyme disease [ 4 – 9 ]. Numbers appear to be much lower under field conditions, possibly because transitory clinical signs might be overlooked by pet owners. Clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis in dogs living in Europe were already described in the United Kingdom [ 10 ], Czech Republic [ 11 , 12 ], Spain [ 13 ], Italy [ 14 ], Belgium [ 15 ], and Poland [ 16 ]. We report here a suspected case of Lyme borreliosis in a Belgian dog used to do long hikes in the forest. The dog was identified using social media where its owner reported the disease on the dog’s personal webpage. A consent form was signed by the owner before investigating the case. 2. Case Description. The presented patient is a 5-year-old male Jack Russell Terrier and it is considered as a member of the family, lives mainly indoors, and is correctly vaccinated against distemper, parvovirosis, leptospirosis, Rubarth disease, parainfluenza, and rabies. The dog is treated monthly against external parasites with afoxolaner. The dog and owner live in Belgium (province of Liège). They are used to do long recreational hikes in the forest all year long and ticks were occasionally found and removed from its skin. The dog has no history of travelling abroad. In December 2017, the owner observed sudden weakness and a reluctance of his dog to move from his basket. The following day, because of the persistency of the signs, the dog was presented to the local veterinarian who noticed a reluctance to move, generalized muscular pain, hindquarters articular pain, and a mild fever. Results of hematology examination and biochemistry were unremarkable. Serum was sent to an external laboratory only for serological examinations for Toxoplasma gondii and Borrelia spp.: the results of serology for toxoplasmosis were negative and Lyme serology (immunofluorescent antibody testing) was positive (1: 1024). As soon as the results were available, the dog was prescribed doxycycline 5 mg/kg per os twice a day for 30 days. Three days after initiation of the treatment, the dog’s condition improved, the clinical signs disappeared and, from that moment, it never presented similar symptoms again. 3. Discussion. The presented clinical case illustrates systemic and orthopedic disorders as the main clinical manifestation of Lyme disease. Indeed, 53% of European cases mentioned musculoskeletal disorders. In this particular case, the owner did not observe lameness. This is, however, most likely due to the difficulty to observe lameness when both front and hind limbs are equally affected. In addition to orthopedic problems, pyrexia is detected in about 50% of the cases. Recovery is usually achieved within one month of antibiotic treatment, illustrating good prognosis of this clinical form. Cases of canine borreliosis were already reported in two dogs in Belgium [ 15 ]. Similarly to our present case, both dogs exhibited orthopedic signs with lameness and loss of appetite. Suspicion was strengthened with ELISA and immunofluorescent antibody testing results. One dog developed paralysis of nerves V, VII, IV, and X which is a very rare condition. The prevalence of Borrelia infection in ticks is a major component of risk-based assessment in human and veterinary medicine. A Belgian study shows that 12.0% of ticks are infected by B. burgdorferi s.l. with the majority being B. afzelii (55%) and B. garinii (21%) [ 17 ], and 8% were coinfected by at least two Borrelia species. Ruyts et al. [ 18 ] showed that 17.6% of nymphs were infected, most commonly by B. afzelii . Borreliosis should therefore be suspected in all cases of orthopedic problems and systemic disorders, particularly if forest hikes and tick infestation are reported by the owner. Moreover, limb dysfunction and systemic signs are the only symptoms validated by Koch’s postulates, establishing a causal link between a pathogen and the disease. Other clinical manifestations, especially renal and cardiac, were previously described, but not yet reproduced experimentally, therefore remaining unvalidated as a clinical symptom of Lyme disease. In case of orthopedic signs, such as lameness (including intermittent or shifting), pain, and joint swelling, other major causes should be excluded and the following tests should be considered: tibial-femoral movement to evaluate the anterior cruciate ligament (drawer sign) and imaging of swollen joints. If there are no abnormalities, blood analysis should be performed to evaluate systemic diseases, if possible combined with measuring creatine kinase to detect polymyositis. To evaluate arthritis, arthrocentesis is indicated with cytology of the synovial fluid and PCR to detect Borrelia DNA. Other infections are to be considered, such as anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis, or immune-mediated polyarthritis. In the case presented, no radiographs were performed because of the absence of a trauma history; in combination with the detected fever, a systemic process was suspected. As lameness is not a pathognomonic sign, serology and, if possible, evidence of pathogen presence with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is indicated. In this case, serology demonstrated exposure to the pathogen, but this is not predictive of developing clinical signs and the antibody level is not correlated to the severity of the symptoms [ 4 ]. There are a lot of serology methods available today. ELISA, immunofluorescent antibody (IFA), or Western Blot is not recommended as a single test because of the possibility of cross-reactions with other spirochetal exposure [ 19 ]. Some tests, e.g., quantitative C6 ELISA (Idexx), are based on the detection of antibodies to the C6 peptide, highly specific for B. burgdorferi s.l. and expressed only during a natural infection. In addition to being more specific, this test also allows differentiation between vaccinated and nonvaccinated dogs [ 20 ]. Moreover, this test was demonstrated to be highly sensitive and specific (100%) for possible early detection of the pathogen (30% of dogs three weeks after initial infection) [ 20 ]. Levy et al. [ 21 ] demonstrated the median drop off of this quantitative value 6 months after treatment was 68%, depending on the initial level. This test is thus useful for the follow-up. PCR in blood often provides false negative results as bacteremia in case that borreliosis seems not permanent [ 22 ]. PCR sensitivity of synovial fluid seems to be quite high according to some veterinarians, but it is not supported experimentally. Doxycycline is the drug of choice in the therapy of canine Lyme disease, but at its normal dose (10 mg/kg once a day for a least one month) it may trigger gastrointestinal side effects [ 23 ]. Dividing the dose in two administrations of 5 mg/kg per day can limit these adverse effects. As doxycycline is not always well tolerated or in case of young animals, other possibly effective antibiotics are indicated: minocycline 12 mg/kg twice a day or 25 mg/kg once a day during at least 1 month, amoxicillin 20 mg/kg three times a day for at least one month, azithromycin 25 mg/kg once a day for 1 month minimum, or chloramphenicol in case of neurologic disorders 15-25 mg/kg three times a day for 14-30 days. In most dogs with orthopedic borreliosis, the prognosis is good. But some treated animals remain nonclinical carriers [ 19 ]. Some of these dogs can exhibit similar clinical signs months to years later because of a new infection (dogs are not protected after an infection) or reactivation of the pathogen. As a conclusion, in case of orthopedic problems when no traumatic cause can be identified, Lyme disease should be considered, especially in endemic area or when travel to an endemic area was reported. To support any suspicion and to facilitate follow-up, serology (especially quantitative C6-ELISA testing) is strongly recommended. If possible (and indicated), a synovial fluid PCR should be considered. After antibiotic administration and, if needed, analgesic treatment, most dogs will recover. However, pet owners should be aware that their dog is not protected and reoccurrence can happen. Conflicts of Interest.

RNA sequencing following infection of P. leucopus with Borreliella burgdorferi , a Lyme disease agent, shows that, unlike blood, the skin is actively responding to the infection after several weeks. P. leucopus has a high level of segregating nucleotide variation, suggesting that natural resistance alleles to Crispr gene targeting constructs are likely segregating in wild populations.

We here compare the load of Ixodes ricinus (the vector) on small mammals and investigate the infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. (the pathogen) involved in the enzootic transmission cycle of Lyme disease in two contrasting ecosystems in Norway from 2014 to 2016. The most common larval tick host in the eastern region was the bank vole, while the common shrew dominated in the western region of Norway. However, the wood mouse and the bank vole had consistently higher larval tick loads than the common shrew in both ecosystems. Hence, the evidence indicated that species are differently suitable as hosts, regardless of their abundances. The pathogen infection prevalence was similar among small mammal species, but markedly higher in the region with larger small mammal populations and higher tick loads, while the seasonal and annual variation was less marked. Our study indicated that the generalist I. ricinus shows consistent patterns of load on species of small vertebrate hosts, while B. burgdorferi s.l. ( B. afzelii ) was a true generalist. The similar roles of host species across regions suggest that disease dynamics can be predicted from host community composition, but predicting the role of host community composition for disease dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the different species population limitations under global change.",1561,0,0,1,0,it,en,

The aim was to determine the frequency of Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD)-based pain diagnoses and dynamic/static tests-based pain diagnoses, and to assess the agreement of palpation tests with static/dynamic tests. Materials and methods. Eighty-six ( N = 86) adult patients with Lyme disease (mean age 57.0 ± 14.3 years; male/female ratio was 42/44) were examined according to techniques described in the RDC/TMD. Additionally, dynamic/static tests were performed. For RDC/TMD-based pain diagnoses and dynamic/static tests-based pain diagnoses, descriptive frequencies were calculated. Differences between the frequency of palpation-based diagnoses and of dynamic/static-based diagnoses as well as the agreement between pain diagnoses established with the two diagnostic approaches were assessed. Results. RDC/TMD-based pain diagnoses were made in 61 patients for myofascial pain and in 11 patients for arthralgia and/or osteoarthritis. Based on dynamic/static tests, mainly myogenous pain was diagnosed in 6 patients, and a mainly arthrogenous pain in 5. The agreement of palpation tests with static/dynamic tests in Lyme disease population was poor. Conclusion. A high prevalence of TMD symptoms was found in patients with Lyme disease. The results suggest that using palpation tests alone could overestimate primary TMDs when comorbid conditions are present. Clinical relevance: Dynamic/static tests should be used as part of the routine TMD assessment. In case of Lyme disease as the actual cause of the facial pain, while the dentist might be suspecting TMD when dynamic/static TMD tests are negative, referral to an appropriate specialist for the diagnosis and treatment of Lyme disease needs to be made.",1762,0,0,1,0,it,en,

In the United States, Lyme disease is one of the most common infectious diseases. The major endemic areas of the disease are New England, Mid-Atlantic, East-North Central, South Atlantic, and West North-Central. Virginia is on the front-line of the disease’s diffusion from the northeast to the south. One of the research objectives for the infectious disease community is to identify environmental and economic variables that are associated with the emergence of Lyme disease. In this article, we use a spatial Poisson regression model to link the spatial disease counts and environmental and economic variables, and develop a spatial variable selection procedure to effectively identify important factors by using an adaptive elastic net penalty. The proposed methods can automatically select important covariates, while adjusting for possible spatial correlations of disease counts. The performance of the proposed method is studied and compared with existing methods via a comprehensive simulation study. We apply the developed variable selection methods to the Virginia Lyme disease data and identify important variables that are new to the literature.

The dam presented with lameness 12 days prior to parturition and was C6 Ab positive with a Quant C6 Ab concentration of 237U/mL. Treatment with amoxicillin was initiated and 11 days later nine pups were delivered. Screening of the sera from the dam and pups against Bb cell lysates and a panel of antigens revealed similar immunoreactivity profiles. While antigen-specific IgG and IgM reactivity persisted in the dam for at least 7 months, a rapid decline in IgG specific for BBA36, BBK53, BB0238, BBA73 and outer surface protein (Osp) E in the pups occurred between days 29 and 52 post-parturition. In contrast, Ab specific for DbpA and the diagnostic antigens VlsE (C6) and OspF, remained elevated in the pups. Sera from the dam displayed potent complement-dependent bactericidal activity against Bb. Sera from the pups was also bactericidal but primarily through a complement-independent mechanism. Lastly, single dose vaccination of the dam at day 51 post-parturition with a LD subunit vaccine consisting of OspA and an OspC chimeritope triggered a broad anti-OspC Ab response indicative of an anamnestic response.

These ticks are responsible for the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi , causative agent of Lyme Disease. Historically, ticks and B. burgdoferi have been well studied due to this human threat. However, wildlife hosts other than mice or deer that may serve as reservoirs for tick species are often overlooked as a part of this web. In this study, we surveyed 40,000+ manuscripts and identified those that considered wildlife hosts when studying Ixodes scapularis (Blacklegged Tick). We found that there appears to be a taxonomic bias in research on wildlife hosts and that this may be contributing to a continued lack of knowledge about potential transmission and management of Blacklegged Ticks or Lyme Disease. Collectively, these findings suggest that more information is needed on wildlife hosts and tick-host ecology, particularly that of birds, meso-mammals and reptiles. Finally, we propose a list of potential research questions that could help further elucidate the importance of wildlife and tick-host ecology.",1233,0,0,1,0,en,en,

The etiological agent of borreliosis is the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi . The symptoms of borreliosis can vary depending on the attacked system and length of infection. Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical symptoms and immunoserological tests. The clinical symptoms of borreliosis also include dysfunction in the tissues and organs of the stomatognathic system. This paper describes a case of a female patient who had experienced a long-term dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). After careful analysis, the symptoms were found to be caused by a chronic form of neuroborreliosis with exacerbations. The findings in this case study show that borreliosis should be considered by doctors and dentists in the differential diagnosis of pain in the area of the TMJ.

Abstract. Babesia is a single celled protozoan parasite which may be transmitted through the bite of an infected tick, blood transfusion and/
or maternal-fetal transmission. We describe the case of a woman previously treated for Lyme disease and babesiosis who relapsed
with severe malaria-like symptoms during the 3rd trimester of two consecutive pregnancies. Testing for active babesiosis was
positive in both pregnancies despite prior conventional therapies, and she was subsequently treated with high dose atovaquone
(1500 mg PO BID) and Zithromax during each of her 3rd trimesters, along with clindamycin during her 3 rd pregnancy. At term, neonates were healthy with no clinical evidence of active babesiosis (no fever, acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS], hepatosplenomegaly or jaundice) and no laboratory evidence of babesiosis (no positive blood smears, hemolytic anemia, neutropenia or thrombocytopenia). Intramuscular benzathine penicillin was simultaneously used throughout her four pregnancies to prevent transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi , the agent of Lyme disease, with no evidence of transmission of the spirochete to the fetuses. Although this novel Lyme and Babesia therapy was effective in preventing congenital transmission of Borrelia
burgdorferi and Babesia microti in consecutive pregnancies, future studies are needed to define the optimal management strategy
for pregnant patients with Lyme disease and babesiosis due to the possible relapsing, remitting nature of the disease and the
potential for associated morbidity and mortality. Introduction. The genus Babesia comprises over 100 species of tick-transmitted protozoal intraerythrocytic pathogens (piroplasms) [ 1 ], causing malarial-type illness. The most common human pathogens in the United States are B. microti [ 2 ] and Babesia duncani (WA- 1) [ 3 ]; Less common species include Babesia MO-1 [4] and KO-1 [ 5 ], as well as Babesia divergens and Babesia venatorum (EU-1) in Europe [ 6 ]. Although transmission of Babesia spp. is primarily through the bite of an infected tick [ 7 ], transmission through blood transfusion [ 8 - 10 ], solid organ transplantation [ 11 ], and maternal-fetal transmission [ 12 , 13 ] have all been well documented. Congenital transmission of babesiosis has been reported in 8 prior case studies [ 13 - 20 ], where most infants presented with fever, anemia
and thrombocytopenia and required blood transfusions
[ 13 ]. We present the case of a woman with a well-documented history of infection with B. burgdorferi , the agent of Lyme disease, who was co-infected with B. microti before and during her pregnancy. Despite traditional antibiotic and antimalarial therapy for Lyme disease and babesiosis she remained ill. At the beginning of her third trimester, and during two consecutive pregnancies, she complained both times of the sudden onset of drenching sweats, flushing, and chills along with worsening fatigue and headaches. Retesting for babesia showed evidence of an active infection in both pregnancies despite prior treatments with clindamycin [ 21 ], and atovaquone and azithromycin [ 22 ], both
established regimens for the treatment of babesiosis
[ 23 ]. She was subsequently rotated to a combination
regimen of higher dose atovaquone (1500 mg PO
BID) and azithromycin, along with a 10-day course of
clindamycin during her third pregnancy. At birth, all
neonates were asymptomatic with healthy Apgar scores
and no clinical or laboratory signs of active babesiosis.
Published medical literature on treatment for babesiosis
during pregnancy recommends either clindamycin and
quinine [ 24 ], or atovaquone and azithromycin [ 25 ], with
variable outcomes in neonates, oftentimes resulting
in thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia requiring
a blood transfusion [ 17 ]. It is therefore imperative to find novel therapies that are safe and effective. Our case report is to our knowledge the first to describe the use of a novel combination of Lyme disease and babesiosis therapies during pregnancy which were well tolerated and beneficial in the mother, without clinical or laboratory signs of active infections of B. burgdorferi or B. microti in the newborns. Case History. A 27-year-old white female with a past medical history significant for Lyme disease, babesiosis, Helicobacter pylori , hypothyroidism, neurocardiogenic syncope, celiac disease, food allergies, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome and multiple chemical sensitivity came to see us with the chief complaints of symptomatic fatigue, headaches, and multiple joint pains. She had a history of chronic joint pain for several years of unknown etiology, followed by getting a tick bite and erythema migrans rash while living in Europe. Her ELISA and IgM Western blot became CDC positive after her tick bite (positive 23 KDA [OspC], 39 KDA, 41 KDA), along with a positive B.microti IgM titer (1:160+), and despite prompt treatment she remained ill and symptomatic for years. She then moved to the West Coast of the United States and underwent treatment with rotations of antibiotics for a chronic relapsing H. pylori infection, which included several courses of amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin. Her G.I. symptoms eventually improved. She subsequently received treatment for her Lyme disease and babesiosis, which included rotations of antibiotics including doxycycline + mefloquine; atovaquone + telithromycin; as well as metronidazole + clarithromycin. Despite these antibiotic rotations, there was no clinical improvement in her resistant fatigue, headaches or joint pain. The patient and her family then moved to the East Coast of the United States and came to our medical center for a diagnostic evaluation. At the time of her initial visit, her chief complaints included: daily day and night sweats which were drenching; constant hot flashes and chills; chronic fatigue; sore throat; hair loss; the sensation of “air hunger” and shortness of breath, both at rest and exertion; chest pain with tenderness to palpation of the chest wall; palpitations, which improved with the use of metoprolol; migratory joint pain which was worse in her shoulders, neck, ankles, knees, and bilateral great toes; soreness of the soles of her feet; myalgias in her upper and lower extremities; constant tingling and numbness of her fingers and toes, which increased with the use of atovaquone and clarithromycin, but not metronidazole; occasional paresthesias of the face; blurry vision and photosensitivity; sound sensitivity and increased sensitivity to smells; dizziness with episodes of vertigo; tinnitus; hearing loss (prior to antibiotic use); memory and concentration problems with word finding problems and emotional instability. She felt that she was functioning at 30 to 40 percent of her normal level due to the severity of these symptoms. Social history and family history were unremarkable. One brother was alive and well with a history of syncopal episodes. She grew up around cats as pets. Allergies included dermatological reactions to nickel (rash) and intolerance to azithromycin and metronidazole (nausea), mefloquine (nausea, weakness, visual hallucinations), and cortisone injections (anaphylactic shock). Medications at the time of her initial visit included clarithromycin 500 milligrams PO BID and metronidazole 500 milligrams BID along with metoprolol 25 milligrams QD; Armour Thyroid 15 milligrams QD; a baby aspirin, meloxicam 15 milligrams QD for pain and a birth control pill (microgestin 1/20 QD). Review of systems was negative except for previously described symptoms as well as occasional edema of the lower extremities; intermittent dysphagia, gas and stomach pain; rare yeast infections with urinary frequency; muscle weakness; eczema; anxiety and multiple syncopal episodes. Physical examination revealed a well-developed, wellnourished white female in no apparent distress. She was afebrile. Her blood pressure was 118/74 with a pulse of 74 beats per minute (regular), and respiratory rate of 16 per minute. Physical exam was unremarkable except for cool, mottled extremities consistent with probable dysautonomia; dry skin of her hands with a bilateral erythematous, violaceous rash, consistent with acrodermatitis chronicum atrophicans. ( Figure 1 ) and reddish streaks and striae on various parts of her body which were perpendicular to skin planes ( Figure 2 ), suggestive of possible bartonellosis. Laboratory evaluation was significant for a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) positive IgM Western blot and B.microti IgM titer which was positive at 1:160, positive Babesia fluorescent in situ hybridization test (FISH+, RNA testing) despite 6 months of taking atovaquone and telithromycin before our initial visit, prior exposure to Mycoplasma pneumonia (1.45 ISR, normal less than 0.90), low C3 serum complement levels (81 micrograms/deciliter; normal range 90 to 180 mg/dl), low C4 serum complement levels (11 micrograms/deciliter; normal range 16 to 47 mg/dl), elevated C4a complement levels (25,425 nanograms/milliliter; normal range from 0 to 2830 ng/ml), low serum glucose (60 milligrams/ deciliter, normal range 65 to 99 mg/dl, consistent with reactive hypoglycemia), low cortisol levels at noon, and a positive tissue transglutaminase (TTG), confirming the history of celiac disease. Measurement of omega-3 fatty acids showed elevated levels of omega-3 fatty acids with low polyunsaturated Omega 6 fatty acid levels, including low levels of arachidonic acid (317, normal range 330-633). A dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) urine toxic metal test was performed for her resistant symptoms and was positive for exposure to mercury and nickel. A comprehensive digestive stool analysis (CDSA) was done for her irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms which revealed low levels of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, moderate levels of candida
krusei and trichosporin species, as well as high levels of gram-negative bacteria, including alpha hemolytic
streptococcus, gamma hemolytic streptococcus and Klebsiella pneumonia . She was negative for antibodies to Babesia duncani , Anaplasma phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis, HGA), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (human monocytic ehrlichiosis, HME), Bartonella henselae, Bartonella quintana , Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky mountain spotted fever), Coxiella burnetti (Q fever), chlamydia pneumonia, H. pylori, M. fermentans (PCR negative), active viral infections (negative PCRs for HSV-1, HSV-2, HHV6, CMV, EBV), toxoplasmosis, gastrointestinal parasites (negative ova and parasites on stool examination), or active fungal infections (negative PCR’s for Aspergillus fumigatus, cryptococcus
neoformans or trichosporin). Blood tests revealed a normal complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic profile (CMP), thyroid functions, Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate level, growth hormone (GH) level (normal insulin like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], which varied over time), B12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), homocysteine and folic acid levels, immunoglobulin levels and subclasses, mineral levels (copper, zinc, magnesium, iron), C-reactive protein (CRP), sedimentation rates, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) and rheumatoid factors, anti-myelin associated glycoproteins (anti- MAG antibodies), along with a normal IgE level and IgE food allergy panel. IgG 4 food antibody levels however were positive for mild allergies to rye, peanuts, almonds, sesame, sunflower, avocado, garlic, mustard and green peppers with moderate reactions to wheat, soy, and eggs. These results were consistent with the diagnosis of leaky gut. Over time, Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus 6 titers became low positive, but without a fourfold increase in titers. Review of prior outpatient testing revealed a possible episode of ventricular tachycardia while having an IV placed for a tilt table test, to rule out Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) so she was sent for a cardiology evaluation and cardiac stress test, which showed normal myocardial perfusion and no significant cardiac abnormalities. A 24-hour Holter monitor revealed extra beats without significant arrhythmias. She did intermittently have evidence of hypotension, dropping her blood pressure from 100/64 to 85/55 with a 14 point increase in heart rate and lightheadedness, consistent with the diagnosis of moderate POTS. A brain SPECT scan showed severe hypoperfusion. A fivehour glucose tolerance test was also performed for the history of fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations and syncope with the history of a low glucose level one time, which revealed a hypoglycemic response during the 4th hour when the blood sugar dropped to 53 milligrams/ deciliter (normal range 65-99 mg/dl) and the patient became symptomatic. She was subsequently placed on a low carbohydrate diet with small frequent meals and adequate levels of protein, which helped stabilize postprandial fatigue. Her endocrinologist also placed her on a small dose of hydrocortisone (Cortef, 5 mg/day) for her low adrenal function, with mild improvement in fatigue and stamina. Since the patient had never used a cell wall antibiotic (penicillins, cephalosporins) for Lyme disease and complained of significant neurocognitive symptoms, she was placed on IV ceftriaxone (Rocephin) 2 grams per day, ursodiol (Actigall) 300 milligrams PO BID, atovaquone (Mepron) 750 milligrams, 2 teaspoons PO BID with a high-fat meal, clarithromycin XL 500 milligrams BID, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) 200 milligrams PO BID and nystatin 500,000 units tablets, 2 PO BID. Despite this protocol, she complained of daily drenching sweats, severe fatigue, increased joint and muscle pain, headaches, and worsening cognitive impairment. Bactrim double strength (sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim) one PO BID was therefore added to the regimen, along with extra detoxification support, including IV glutathione 3 days per week. She reported improvements days that she was on IV glutathione and her sweats and chills became less frequent with the addition of Bactrim to the regimen. Herxheimer reactions however continued the days on IV ceftriaxone, despite trying to pulse the IV medication 4 days in a row per week, so she was subsequently taken off this protocol, and switched to IV doxycycline 200 milligrams per day, infused over a 2 hour time period along with Plaquenil, nystatin, and rifampin 300 milligrams PO BID. Day and night sweats, chills, and peripheral neuropathy symptoms increased off her atovaquone and Rocephin, so she was rotated to clindamycin 300 milligrams, 2 capsules 3 × per day, atovaquone 2 teaspoons PO BID along with clarithromycin 500 milligrams BID for her babesiosis. High dose B12 injections were also started for the resistant neuropathy along with alpha lipoic acid 600 milligrams QD with B6 50 milligrams TID. After one month, the only improvement she experienced was a decrease in sweats for one to two days, which subsequently increased in intensity with severe fatigue, severe cognitive dysfunction, headaches, leg pain, myalgias and peripheral neuropathy. She was therefore rotated to doxycycline, ciprofloxacin 500 milligrams PO BID and atovaquone/proguanil to 50/100 milligrams, 4 tablets per day, with low dose mefloquine (250 milligrams Q5 days) for the possibility of resistant bartonellosis along with Lyme disease and babesiosis, but unfortunately this regimen was ineffective in significantly relieving symptomatology, so all antibiotics were stopped, and the patient was placed on a yeast-free, sugar-free diet with an herbal protocol for her tickborne diseases. Herbals included Samento (cat’s claw), Cumunda, Enula, Burbur, and parsley. Within days of being off her antibiotics, all symptoms worsened including severe depression where she was crying for hours at a time, so she was placed back on a Babesia protocol, including atovaquone, clarithromycin and Bactrim DS twice a day. This immediately helped resolve the mood swings and decreased associated fevers, sweats, chills, and palpitations. At the end of 2008, after several months on this protocol, the patient decided to try getting pregnant. Options were discussed for her pregnancy including oral penicillin’s, cephalosporins or intramuscular benzathine penicillin (IM Bicillin) with azithromycin which have all been shown to be safe for the fetus [ 26 ]. She chose intramuscular Bicillin 1.2 million units IM twice a week with EMLA cream one hour prior to the injection. She was to stay on atovaquone, clarithromycin and Bactrim, which were controlling her Babesia symptoms until she got pregnant. Over the next few months, the Bicillin injections helped her to feel better with improvement in energy and cognitive functioning, and eventually the Bactrim was stopped. One month later, the patient became pregnant and tapered off clarithromycin and nystatin but stayed on low-dose hydrocortisone (2.5 milligram BID) and Armour thyroid (dosage of 90 mg/day) as per her endocrinologist, along with Bicillin and azithromycin (Zithromax). She followed the pregnancy with a highrisk OB/GYN at Yale who placed her on a prenatal multivitamin with folic acid and extra vitamin D (7000 IU/d) for subtherapeutic vitamin D levels, and her Armour thyroid was increased to 120 mg/day in the third trimester for borderline elevated levels of TSH (3.04 microIU/ml, optimum range below 2.5 microIU/ml). IgF1 levels were intermittently low (121 ng/ml, normal range 138-410 ng/ml), suggestive of growth hormone (GH) deficiency, but due to normal fetal growth, levels were followed. A beta blocker, labetalol, proven to be safe in pregnancy [ 27 ], was also prescribed at 100 mg PO BID and was effective in controlling palpitations. She carried the fetus to term and gave birth to a healthy baby girl by vaginal delivery, with no signs or symptoms of active Lyme or babesiosis. Real time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the placenta and cord blood was negative for B. burgdorferi or B. microti . The patient began breast feeding, and breast milk was also checked for any evidence of B. burgdorferi , which was
negative. A subsequent IgF1 level became normal (147,
normal range 114-492) and a glucagon stimulation test
indicated normal GH production (13.2 ng/ml, peak GH
of 3 ng/ml or higher being normal). 25-OH Vitamin D
levels also became normal (60 ng/ml, range 20-100 ng/
ml) over time but 1,25 OH Vit D levels were elevated
at 153 pg/ml (normal range 19-67 pg/ml). Vitamin D
dosing was decreased accordingly. Shortly after giving birth and during the period of breast feeding for approximately one year, the patient noticed increased symptoms of resistant fatigue and sweats. She had remained on Bicillin injections during this time, which were increased post-partum to 2.4 million units twice a week (total of 4.8 million units) for resistant fatigue, which improved with the higher dose of intramuscular penicillin. Bactrim DS was added to Zithromax along with higher dose atovaquone (3 tsp PO BID) for resistant Babesia symptoms, which also improved symptomatology. Her perceived level of functioning increased from 30% to 65% of normal during that time, a significant improvement from prior baseline levels of functioning. Approximately one year into breast feeding (10/2010) the patient became pregnant for the second time and all medications were stopped except for Bicillin injections and Armour thyroid. She was able to taper off low dose hydrocortisone without difficulty, since subsequent cortisol measurements were within normal limits. Labetalol, an alpha and beta blocker, was also stopped because of urinary urge incontinence which developed post-partum, which improved off the medication. The patient remained at 70% normal functioning during the second pregnancy without any yeast or diarrhea (she was continuously on three probiotics twice a day with Saccharomyces boulardii during the course of treatment) [ 28 ]. Resistant joint pain bilaterally in the wrists, knees and shoulders persisted, as did fatigue, dizziness, headaches, light and sound sensitivity and memory/concentration problems, which varied between mild to severe in intensity. Although palpitations were initially controlled off Labetalol, the medication needed to be re-added at half dose (50 mg BID) once extrasystoles returned later in the pregnancy. The labetalol was better tolerated at lower dosing without any associated incontinence, and no orthostatic intolerance was seen with the addition of the low dose beta blocker. At term on 7/2011, the patient gave birth vaginally to a healthy baby boy. Again, B. burgdorferi Real-Time PCR of the placenta and B. burgdorferi Real-Time PCR and B. microti Real-Time PCR of the cord blood were negative without signs or symptoms of active babesiosis in the neonate. The patient also denied significant day or night sweats or air hunger during her second pregnancy or several months into the post-partum period (symptoms of active babesiosis), although these symptoms relapsed by 1/2012 when day sweats and night sweats returned several times a week. She felt that Bicillin injections remained her best Lyme disease treatment to date, despite resistant symptoms of fatigue, joint pain, and headaches as these symptoms often improved immediately post injection. Zithromax and rifampin were added post-partum (rifampin may be used while pregnant and breastfeeding, as there is no known risk of infant harm) [ 29 ], and the patient felt an improvement in her moods, fatigue and headaches with the addition of the 2nd intracellular medication. Dosing of rifampin higher than 150 milligrams PO BID caused significant Herxheimer reactions however, suggestive of an active intracellular infection, and any attempt to lower the Bicillin injections to 1.2 million units twice a week resulted in an increase in headaches and mood swings. The patient remained stable on this regimen until 10/2012 when she had a syncopal episode post venipuncture. It was subsequently determined that she was pregnant for the third time. An ultrasound at 16 weeks was normal and she was again followed by her high-risk OB-GYN. At the end of her second trimester her night sweats began to return with increased fatigue and headaches. Repeat testing for tick-borne diseases was performed and revealed an ongoing positive B.microti IgM antibody at 1:160 + (IgeneX laboratories), new positive Babesia duncani (WA-1) IgG immunofluorescent antibody at 1:256 + (Bioreference laboratory, normal reference range below 1:256). Testing for Coxiella burnetti (Q-fever), Brucella, Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky mountain spotted fever), Bartonella henselae , and toxoplasma gondii were all negative. ANA, rheumatoid factor and sedimentation rates along with thyroid functions were also within normal limits. No other explanation for the sweats could be found, so a confirmatory blood test was sent to Mayo Clinic which showed a low positive IgM B. microti at 1:40+ with a negative PCR. A blood smear was sent to visualize parasites, but the specimen was deemed too old to be useful. A repeat Babesia FISH test was therefore sent to IgeneX laboratories as it provides a significant increase in sensitivity and specificity over standard Giemsa stained smears for the presence of intraerythrocytic parasites (piroplasms) in RBC’s [ 23 , 30 ]. The Babesia FISH test returned positive during the beginning of her third trimester indicating active babesiosis despite prior anti- Babesia therapies. Laboratory blood tests during that time intermittently showed toxic vacuolation and granulations present in the white cells with myelocytes present, a mild anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.5 g/dl (normal range 12-16 g/dL), hemoglobin of 34.9 (normal range 36-46%), slightly low platelet counts ranging between 116,000/ UL and 130,000/UL (normal range 140-400,000/ UL) with normal liver and kidney functions. She was placed back on clindamycin 300 mg 2 PO BID for 10 days along with atovaquone 750 mg, two tsp PO BID with a high fat meal and azithromycin 250 mg PO BID throughout the third trimester. After one week on atovaquone the sweats significantly decreased and she felt an improvement in her overall symptomatology, although muscle and joint pains and neuropathy continued to be moderate to severe in intensity. She remained on Bicillin injections during this time and a long acting oral amoxicillin (Moxatag 775 mg) was added during the 3rd trimester as higher dose Bicillin injections helped decrease symptomatology in the past. This resulted in improvement in headaches and fatigue. Her high-risk OB/GYN and neonatal infectious disease specialist were consulted, who agreed with the plan, and the patient gave birth to her 3rd child, a healthy girl, in the summer of 2013. Apgar scores were normal. Testing of the cord blood for B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease), B. microti, B. henselae, Bartonella quintana , and Mycoplasma species were all negative by qualitative and Real-Time PCR through Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (MDL). Placental biopsies were also negative by Real-Time PCR for Lyme disease, B. henselae and B. quintana . There was no clinical or laboratory evidence of infection in the neonate (lack of leucopenia, thrombocytopenia, hemolytic anemia, transaminitis) and the patient breastfed during the following year without any complications in the newborn. During 2014, the patient continued to breastfeed and clinically improved as long as she stayed on Bicillin injections, atovaquone, azithromycin, and Bactrim DS with a low carbohydrate, Paleo diet which also helped stabilize her energy and headaches. By August 2014, she was functioning at 85% of normal functioning, a significant improvement from her baseline. However, each time she tried to lower the dose of Bicillin injections or Moxatag/probenecid for her Lyme disease, or discontinue atovaquone and Bactrim for Babesia , her fatigue, headaches, migratory joint pain and sweats significantly increased. A high salt diet and fluids helped decrease orthostatic changes. The patient decided to try for her 4th child in the fall of 2014 after breastfeeding for 17 months and became pregnant by the end of December 2014. Cefixime (Suprax) 400 mg QD was added during the first trimester due to significant joint pain, which helped decrease the intensity. During her visit of 6/2015, at the end of her second trimester, all prenatal checkups were fine and higher dose Bicillin and cefixime were helping to decrease her joint pain. Although she complained of resistant fatigue and dizziness, there were no orthostatic changes or increases in heart rate during her physical examination, ruling out significant dysautonomia as a potential etiology. The patient initially denied significant fever, sweats or chills, but did complain of ongoing “air hunger” and a cough, atypical symptoms of babesiosis. Based on these symptoms and her prior history of relapses with proof of active infection, repeat Babesia titers and a FISH test were performed, as well as repeat titers for other tickborne infections. Almost immediately upon returning to her home in the southeastern United States, and beginning her 3rd trimester, her sweats began to return, occasionally drenching in nature. Although she denied any new tick bites, her B. microti IgM titer had now increased to 1:320+, her IgG B.microti titer turned positive at 1:40+ while her Babesia FISH test remained positive. Repeat Western blots for Lyme disease revealed an increase in the 31 KDA band (outer surface protein A) and decrease of her 23 KDA band (outer surface protein C) on her IgM blot from baseline measurements. All other tickborne titers were negative, including antibodies for Borrelia burgdorferi (negative C6 ELISA), relapsing fever borreliosis ( Borrelia hermsii ), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (HGA), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (HME), Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky mountain spotted fever), Coxiella burnetti (Q-fever), Bartonella henselae , Bartonella quintana , and B. Abortus (Brucellosis). Thyroid functions also remained within normal limits and a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was negative (an indirect marker of Bartonella) [ 31 ]. CBC as well as kidney and liver functions also remained within normal limits, with no evidence of anemia, thrombocytopenia, or transaminitis. The patient therefore was placed back on high dose Mepron (atovaquone) 2 teaspoons PO BID with azithromycin during her 3rd trimester for active relapsing babesiosis. Clindamycin, which had been added during her 3rd pregnancy, was held due to ongoing nausea. Symptoms significantly improved once high dose atovaquone was re-added to the protocol, with a significant decrease in both the frequency and intensity of headaches and decrease in sweats (which were primarily at night, 2 to 3 times per week). She gave birth at term by vaginal delivery to a healthy boy in the fall of 2015, with normal Apgar scores and no signs or symptoms of babesiosis (lack of anemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis, hepatosplenomegaly or jaundice). Repeat real-time PCR’s of the cord blood for B. burgdorferi, B. microti, B. henselae, B. quintana , and qualitative PCRs for Mycoplasma species from MDL laboratories were all negative. Clindamycin and Bactrim needed to be added several months into breastfeeding however (the pediatrician concurred) when drenching night sweats returned. Despite a temporary increase in emotional lability with Bactrim, symptoms subsequently resolved. Follow-up titers for babesiosis months later showed a further increase in B. microti IgM titers to 1:640+ (a fourfold increase from her initial titers) with the IgG B. microti titer turning negative, yet the patient remained stable on her regimen and baby continued to do well. To date, years later, all four children have remained healthy. This case report is to our knowledge the first one to describe the safe and effective use of high dose benzathine penicillin injections along with high dose atovaquone, azithromycin and clindamycin to prevent the perinatal transmission of Lyme disease and babesiosis in multiple consecutive pregnancies. Discussion. Tick-borne diseases can pose significant risks to both the mother and fetus during pregnancy. Maternalfetal transmission has been reported for babesiosis [ 12 - 16 ], as well as multiple tick-borne bacterial infections, including B. burgdorferi (Lyme disease) [ 32 - 39 ], relapsing fever borrelia (B. hermsii) [ 40 - 41 ], A.phagocytophilum (human granulocytic anaplasmosis) [ 42 ], Ehrlichia chaffeensis (human monocytic ehrlichiosis) [ 43 , 44 ], and Rickettsia rickettsii (Rocky mountain spotted fever) [ 45 , 46 ]. Bartonella species have also been implicated in adverse fetal outcomes [ 47 , 48 ], whether vectored by a tick [ 49 ],
or other modes of transmission [ 50 ]. Tick bites within 3 years preceding conception have been shown to be significantly associated with congenital malformations [ 51 ] and our patient had a history of chronic joint pain for several years after getting a tick bite and erythema migrans rash while living in Europe. She also had a bilateral erythematous, violaceous rash on her hands, consistent with acrodermatitis chronicum atrophicans ( Figure 1 ). This is a chronic dermatological manifestation seen more often in women and associated with Borrelia afzelii in Europe [ 52 ]. In North America, although Lyme disease is primarily caused by B.burgdorferi sensu stricto and/or eight other sensu lato
species ( B. mayonii, B. americana, B. andersonii, B.
bissettii, B. californiensis, B. carolinensis, B. garinii,
and B. kurtenbachii ) [ 53 - 58 ], in Europe the majority of cases of Lyme borreliosis are caused by Borrelia afzelii and Borrelia garinii leading to a broad range of clinical
manifestations [ 59 ]. As our patient had a history of
both classic dermatological skin lesions seen in Lyme
disease, an EM rash and ACA, several borrelia species
may have been involved in the chronicity of her illness. Successes and failures of treating ACA and EM rashes with traditional antibiotics have been reported. In one study of ACA, B. burgdorferi DNA excretion was still positive after 12 months [ 60 ], and atypical forms of B. burgdorferi were visualized under the microscope with positive staining for borrelia genusspecific monoclonal flagellar antibody [ 61 ]. These may have represented in vivo morphologic variants of this bacterium [ 61 ], which have been shown to form round body forms [ 62 , 63 ], stationary phase cells and persister cells [ 64 - 66 ], as well as aggregates in biofilms [ 67 - 69 ], depending on environmental conditions and stressors [ 65 , 70 ]. Successful cultivation of spirochetes from skin lesions of patients with erythema migrans (EM) and Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans with a disease duration of greater than 10 years also suggests that the spirochetes may survive in the human body for a considerable time [ 71 ]. This was confirmed in a study of recurrent erythema migrans despite extended antibiotic treatment [ 72 ]. In that study, persistent B. burgdorferi infection was found in the blood by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while skin biopsy specimen contained Borrelia-compatible structures [ 72 ]. These findings are consistent with other published scientific literature showing persistence of B. burgdorferi despite seemingly adequate courses of antibiotics [ 73 , 74 ], where the bacteria can persist in various parts of the body where antibiotics may not easily penetrate. These include the ligamentous tissue [ 75 ], intracellular compartment and synovium [ 76 , 77 ], joints [ 78 ], joint fluid [ 79 ], spleen [ 80 ], eyes [ 81 , 82 ], neuronal and glial cells [ 83 ], endothelial cells and macrophages [ 84 ], and central nervous system [ 85 ]. Persistence in skin lesions in EM and ACA may be due to immune evasion [ 86 ], biofilms protecting the organism [ 68 , 87 ], as well as invasion of human skin fibroblasts by B. burgdorferi [ 88 ], where fibroblasts can protect the Lyme disease spirochete from the effect of antibiotics, including ceftriaxone [ 89 ], which the patient received early on in the course
of her treatment. A 2018 systematic review on the impact of gestational Lyme disease in humans on the fetus and newborn reported significantly fewer adverse birth outcomes in women reported to have been treated for gestational Lyme disease (LD) (11%, 95% confidence interval [CI]) compared to those who were not treated during pregnancy (50%, 95% CI) providing indirect evidence of an association between gestational LD and adverse birth outcomes [ 90 ]. Among those fetal abnormalities
noted, adverse outcomes with a possible association
included syndactyly, cortical blindness, hydrocephalus,
intrauterine fetal death [ 38 ], prematurity, rash in
the newborn [ 91 ], as well as stillbirth [ 92 ] neonatal
distress syndrome, intrauterine growth retardation,
maternal toxemia of pregnancy and sudden infant
death syndrome [ 38 ]. Despite these findings, prior reviews of the literature concerning the effects of gestational LD from case reports and series, epidemiologic studies, and experimental animal models have yielded conflicting results [ 93 , 94 ] and inconsistent evidence for adverse birth outcomes of gestational LD in the epidemiological research [ 90 ]. Also, no comparative studies on the effectiveness of different therapeutic approaches for LD are available regarding preventing vertical transmission in pregnancy [ 95 ], apart from a large series of pregnant women who had a favorable course and outcome using intravenous ceftriaxone [ 96 ]. What is clear however, is that gestational LD appears to be associated with a low risk of adverse pregnancy outcome, particularly with appropriate antibiotic therapy [ 93 ]. In one case study reported by Horowitz [ 97 ], a healthy woman with a history of Lyme disease who was previously treated with several months of antibiotics miscarried at week eighteen when she was no longer on antibiotics, and both the placenta and fetus were positive for PCR evidence of B. burgdorferi . As per the CDC, “Lyme disease acquired during pregnancy may lead to infection of the placenta and possible stillbirth; however, no negative effects on the fetus have been found when the mother receives appropriate antibiotic treatment” [ 98 ]. According to US Preventative Services Task Force, all women should be screened serologically early on in pregnancy for syphilis, another spirochetal infection [ 99 ], due to the possibility of stillbirth, neonatal death and neurologic impairment [ 99 ]. These are some of the same symptoms reported in congenital Lyme disease, another spirochetal infection [ 38 , 92 ]. Treatment of syphilis involves intramuscular injection of long acting Benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units administered intramuscularly) for primary, secondary or early latent syphilis and has been found to be effective [ 100 ]. Since B. burgdorferi has been found in a newborn despite the use of oral penicillin for Lyme borreliosis during pregnancy [ 34 ], and as Bicillin injections have been found effective in the treatment of both Lyme arthritis [ 101 , 102 ] and other resistant symptoms of LD (chronic
fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, headaches, paresthesias and cognitive difficulties) unresponsive to oral therapy
[ 103 ], we decided to institute IM benzathine penicillin
after an informed discussion of the risks and benefits. Our patient was on intramuscular benzathine penicillin (Bicillin) throughout her four pregnancies, ranging from 2.4 to 4.8 million U IM/week with no adverse outcomes in the fetus, and the route of administration of antibiotic therapy has been shown to play a role in pregnancy outcomes. In a study of 95 women with Lyme borreliosis during pregnancy, adverse outcomes were seen in 12.1% of parentally treated women, 31.6% of orally treated women, and 60% untreated women [ 104 ]. In comparison to patients treated with antibiotics, untreated women had a significantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcome (odds ratio [OR] 7.61, p=0.004). The advantage of benzathine penicillin intramuscularly is that parenteral penicillin therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Lyme disease and Lyme arthritis [ 101 , 102 ], and as opposed to oral regimens with varying peak and trough levels, sustained therapeutic levels of benzathine penicillin may be effective by inhibition of germ replication or by lysis of the spirochetes leaving their sanctuaries [ 102 ]. This may have contributed to healthy outcomes in all four newborns. Despite ongoing treatment, our patient had frequent complaints of symptoms of fatigue, migratory joint pain, neuralgia, severe headaches, and cognitive difficulties. These are all part of the classic constellation of symptoms seen with Lyme disease [ 105 , 106 ], although it is possible that she also suffered from occult bartonellosis with her history of unexplained striae ( Figure 2 ), Herxheimer flares with rifampin, high 1-25 OH/25 OH Vitamin D ratios (consistent with an active intracellular infection) [ 107 , 108 ], and resistant symptoms. The type of striae seen on her physical examination have been found to be associated with bartonella [ 109 , 110 ], and laboratory testing in New York only allowed evaluation of two species, B. henselae and B. quintana , although 36 different Bartonella species have now been discovered [ 50 ], and at least seventeen of them have been associated with an expanding spectrum of human diseases [ 111 ]. Bartonella may complicate and worsen clinical presentations. Bartonella species were recently found in 46.6% of Lyme patients with rheumatological symptoms in one case series [ 112 ], and 46.5% of neurologically impaired Lyme patients in a recent 2019 retrospective chart review [ 113 ]. Our patient also frequently complained of drenching day and night sweats, chills, flushing, an unexplained cough and shortness of breath described as ‘air hunger’. These are commonly experienced symptoms in patients infected with babesiosis [ 105 ]. Laboratory diagnosis of babesiosis is typically made by examination of
peripheral thick and thin blood smears using Giemsa
staining, visualizing ring forms and Maltese cross forms
(smears can be negative with low levels of parasitemia),
as well as serology (IFA, ELISA), culture and nucleic
acid amplification (PCR, RNA) and sequencing
[ 114 ]. FISH staining of blood smears has also proven
effective [ 115 ]. Our patient had evidence of exposure to B. microti with a fourfold rise in titer over time and
multiple positive FISH tests, proving persistence [ 116 ]. She also had a positive antibody titer to B. duncani , a species primarily found on the west coast. The patient did live in California for several years before moving to the eastern seaboard but did not report a known tick bite during that time. It is possible that she was exposed to several different Babesia species, as two recent reports have indicated the probable spread of B.
duncani across the US as well as Canada [ 113 , 117 , 118 ]. It is also possible that her B. duncani test represented cross reactivity with B. microti , as only 13 confirmed
cases have been reported to date by the CDC [ 113 , 119 ], although antibody responses among the three dominant human pathogens of humans, B. microti, B. duncani , and B. divergens appear to be species specific [ 120 ]. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that babesiosis is spreading in the United States [ 121 , 122 ] and Europe [ 123 - 125 ], and that simultaneous infection with B. microti and B. burgdorferi are now the most common tick-transmitted coinfections in the U.S. [ 122 , 126 , 127 ]. B. microti-B. burgdorferi coinfected patients suffer from significantly more diverse and intense symptoms, which persist longer than those in patients infected with each pathogen individually [ 128 ]. Several reasons may exist for the increased severity of illness. It has been suggested that coinfection not only increases the severity of disease, but also may impair host defense mechanisms [ 129 ]. In support of this hypothesis, patients with coinfections report a longer duration of illness and exacerbated symptoms including fatigue, myalgia, sweats and erythema migrans [ 128 , 130 ]. Our patient complained of resistant fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, sweats and an ACA rash. Co-infection has also been reported to result in a death from pancarditis [ 131 ]. Impaired host defense mechanisms have been described in detail for babesiosis [ 126 ]. The adaptive immune system and a strong TH1 response increasing production of IFN-γ is needed to combat intracellular pathogens and Babesia , while a strong Th2 response with an increase in IL-4 production and B cell production of antibodies is essential for host defense against extracellular pathogens and Lyme disease [ 132 ]. A robust B cell response has also been shown to be necessary for rapid resolution of Lyme disease [ 133 ], and in the acute phase of co-infection in the mouse model, marginal zone disruption of the spleen and B cell atrophy were seen where B. microti infection ultimately
resulted in reduction in splenic B cells and pathogen
specific antibody production [ 126 , 134 ]. B. burgdorferi infection has also been shown to attenuate parasitemia in mice while B. microti subverts the splenic immune
response, leading to a marked decrease in splenic B and
T cells, reduction in antibody levels and diminished
functional humoral immunity [ 135 ]. Clearance of both
pathogens could therefore be impaired by imbalances
in the immune system. Infection with B. burgdorferi has previously been shown in the mouse model to cause a T cell independent response in the lymph nodes where there is a lack of strongly induced, protective borrelia-specific IgG antibodies [ 136 ]. Suppression of a long-lived humoral immunity following an infection with B. burgdorferi ultimately results in a temporary immunosuppression of the host where early germinal centers systemically fail to produce antigen-specific memory B cells [ 137 ]. This can result in elevations of IgM antibodies and a decrease in IgG protective antibodies. The same type of immune deficiencies has been reported in humans infected with B. burgdorferi and/or co-infected with babesiosis [ 113 ]. This could potentially explain our patient’s four-fold rise in IgM titers to B. microti over time, with evidence of persistent Babesia by RNA analysis (FISH), without significant production of protective IgG antibodies. Numerous studies highlight immune suppression in pregnancy, where progesterone can act as a natural immune suppressor [ 138 ]. Advanced age, splenectomy and immune suppression all increase the risk of critical outcomes with Babesia [ 119 ]. Pregnant women have also been shown to be more severely affected by infections with certain organisms vs. non-pregnant women, including the influenza virus, hepatitis E virus (HEV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the malaria parasite [ 139 ]. Babesiosis and malaria are both intraerythrocytic parasitic infections and share certain similar clinical characteristics, including febrile hemolytic anemia [ 140 ]. Considering the risk of immunosuppression in pregnancy with the possibility of transplacental infection and congenital babesiosis, certain authors have therefore advocated for the treatment of all pregnant women diagnosed with babesiosis, even if asymptomatic [ 25 ]. Babesiosis in pregnancy can also imitate HELLP syndrome [ 25 ] which is an important differential diagnosis, since both diseases can result in hemolysis, elevated liver functions and low platelet counts. Our patient only had evidence of very mild anemia later in her pregnancies (normally seen in pregnancy with hemodilution) with very mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ranging between 116,000/UL and 130,000/UL [normal range 140-400,000/UL)] and normal liver and kidney functions. There was no evidence of hemolytic anemia, even though her initial exposure to Babesia was in Europe, where the European species B. divergens has been shown to be more highly associated with hemolytic anemia [ 141 ]. Babesiosis can also result
in symptoms ranging from mild anemia, to severe
pancytopenia, with complications including splenic
rupture, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
(DIC), hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
[ 142 ], and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
[ 143 ], as well as warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia
(WAHA) [ 144 ]. Congenital babesiosis in the fetus can
result in anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia
[ 13 ], with fevers, jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly
[ 16 ]. Apart from following the pregnancy with a highrisk
OB/GYN, the pediatric team should be alerted
to a history of maternal babesiosis, so appropriate
blood work and close surveillance are performed postdelivery. In our patient, all four children were healthy at delivery with no signs or symptoms of borreliosis or babesiosis. Clindamycin with quinine is one of the most common treatments for babesiosis in pregnancy, due to good placental penetration and evidence of decreased vertical transmission to the fetus [ 12 ]. Transplacental passage of azithromycin was initially postulated to occur at low rates [ 145 ], but further pharmacokinetic studies have proven adequate penetration into the amniotic fluid with adequate doses, dosing intervals and duration of therapy [ 146 ]. Azithromycin in higher doses as monotherapy have also been shown to be efficacious in treating B. microti in the animal model [ 147 ]. We chose atovaquone and azithromycin as it has been shown to be as effective as clindamycin and quinine for both mild and severe infections [ 22 , 148 ], with less potential side effects. For example, quinine may induce nausea, vomiting, rashes, and QT prolongation with torsade de point [ 149 ]. Both regimens however may be inadequate to completely clear the parasitic infection [ 150 ]. A 2019 study by Abittan et al., found clindamycin and quinine as well as atovaquone and azithromycin to be ineffective in treating babesiosis during pregnancy [ 24 ]. That was our experience as well. Our patient continuously relapsed with signs and symptoms of active babesiosis with multiple positive FISH (RNA) tests before and during her pregnancy despite long term use of atovaquone and azithromycin. Clindamycin was also used for 10 days during the third trimester of her third pregnancy along with atovaquone and azithromycin for resistant symptoms. This was helpful in relieving her symptomatology and preventing vertical transmission but was not curative. Treatment regimens for babesiosis are limited by the emergence of drug-resistant parasites, potential toxicity and failure of drugs [ 151 , 152 ]. Lemieux et al. found mutations in the cytb and rpl4 genes of B. microti from patients with resistant infections [ 153 ], and there are now difficulties and failures treating B. microti and B. duncani in both those with normal functioning immune systems as well as in those who are immunosuppressed [ 154 , 155 ]. Those at highest risk are patients with immunodeficiencies resulting from B-cell lymphomas, organ transplants, HIV/AIDS, or treatment with immunosuppressive drugs such as Rituximab [ 156 - 159 ] and severe disease can also be seen in hospitalized patients with concurrent chronic illnesses, including diabetes, congestive heart failure (CHF) and renal failure [ 160 ]. Yet babesiosis may be fatal even in those with no clear underlying medical problems, especially when transmitted by blood transfusion. [ 4 , 156 , 161 ]. Lyme disease patients co-infected with Babesia spp. oftentimes are sicker and more resistant to therapy [ 157 , 162 ], and this is especially the case in pregnancy when underlying immunosuppression is present [ 128 , 151 , 154 , 163 ]. Recently a pregnant patient with babesiosis who failed clindamycin and quinine as well as atovaquone and azithromycin required an exchange transfusion [ 24 ]. Other treatments that have been shown to be helpful in certain cases of resistant babesiosis, including the use of higher dose Bactrim [ 164 ], mefloquine [ 165 ], atovaquone/proguanil, artemisinin derivatives and dapsone [ 119 , 166 - 168 ] are contraindicated during pregnancy. Similarly, disulfiram [ 169 ] and tafenoquine [ 170 ] which have the potential to treat resistant babesiosis are unable to be used due to potential toxicity in the fetus. Novel and more effective treatments for resistant babesiosis are urgently needed. In our patient, we used higher doses of atovaquone (two teaspoons BID, i.e., 1500 mg BID) combined with azithromycin during all four pregnancies to try and overcome resistance to standard drug regimens. Clindamycin was also used in combination with atovaquone and azithromycin during the third pregnancy. Combination therapies have previously been shown to be superior to monotherapy [ 147 ], and our use of higher doses of atovaquone with azithromycin and clindamycin proved to be effective in preventing congenital transmission, even if ineffective in clearing Babesia in the mother. Atovaquone used alone can cause drug resistance but evidence that clindamycin and atovaquone with azithromycin can effectively treat Babesia has previously been reported in both animals [ 171 ], and humans [ 172 ], although there is now greater recognition of resistance to standard Babesia regimens [ 153 , 163 ], especially in immunocompromised patients with babesiosis when 6 weeks of therapy or longer may be necessary [ 172 ]. At birth, none of the neonates of our patient demonstrated signs of active infection with Lyme or babesiosis during pediatric follow-up. Follow-up ranged from 1-10 years. In prior case series of congenitally transmitted babesiosis among 9 children [ 13 ] most mothers were unaware of being infected and therefore were not treated, leading to increased morbidity in the neonates who presented with fever, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia [ 13 ]. Conclusion. Considering the significant increase in exposure to Lyme disease in the United States in the past decade [ 173 - 175 ] as well as the increase in cases of babesiosis [ 127 , 176 , 177 ] it is important for all women of childbearing age to be aware of the risks of congenital transmission of tick-borne diseases and to take appropriate preventative measures. A screening questionnaire to establish the pre-test possibility of tick-borne infection before and during pregnancy could be useful [ 105 ], as well as determining optimal testing and management approaches [ 24 , 178 ]. Penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, clindamycin, quinine and atovaquone may all be used in pregnancy [ 91 , 179 - 183 ], although high dose quinine should be avoided in the first trimester secondary to the possibility of spontaneous abortion [ 12 ]. Our case report is the first one to our knowledge to describe both the safe and effective use of IM benzathine penicillin and azithromycin in four consecutive pregnancies to prevent vertical transmission of LD, along with high dose atovaquone and azithromycin (with or without clindamycin) to prevent vertical transmission of babesiosis. Future research into effective treatments of Lyme disease and babesiosis in both the pregnant and non-pregnant patient is urgently needed due to the possible relapsing, remitting nature of both diseases and potential for associated morbidity and mortality.

A complex debate has emerged, with patient groups challenging clinical and testing practices. This paper focuses on four dimensions of diagnostic testing: accuracy, types of test, clinical application and test interpretation, to illustrate the divergence amongst and between official and patient group views. We explore these issues via analysis of information from sources including patient organisations’ documents and statutory policy and professional publications, supplemented by data from an online questionnaire survey. Our analysis shows a lack of consistency in policy, consumerist strategies among patients, and official policy that inhibits illness identity and maintains hard boundaries between patients’ experience and public health practice. We suggest that medical policy and practice have become entrenched in defensive testing and clinical protocol. We note recently emerging trends in consultation and patient group involvement, illustrating more participative public health governance. As a joint patient organisation-academic project, we contribute to understanding of patient organisation activism in public health by demonstrating our own collaborative, reflective ‘evidence-based’ activist research. Notably, in doing so we deploy a variety of forms of knowledge and ‘evidence’ beyond the often-acknowledged ‘experiential’ and ‘embodied’ forms. On this basis, we recommend that shared-decision-making and ‘facilitational’ advocacy would improve patients’ empowerment and their experiences of testing and diagnosis. We argue that such reforms will enhance the perceived legitimacy of ‘chronic’ Lyme disease claims even under the prevailing conditions of scientific and medical uncertainty.",1842,0,0,1,0,en,en,

In most cases the course of the disease is benign and when the patient is diagnosed and treated appropriately, even the most advanced forms of A-V block typically resolve within one week. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is only exceptionally necessary. We present a case of a patient with multiple cardiac arrests due to advanced A-V block. Despite the proper diagnosis of LC and targeted antibiotic therapy, the patient was completely dependent on temporary endocavitary pacing for more than one week. Finally, implantation of a permanent pacemaker was decided, however, during the next three months, A-V conduction abnormalities gradually subsided. This made us doubt whether the decision about implantation wasn’t made prematurely. The solution came at a one-year follow-up visit when it turned out that ventricular stimulation reappeared. We believe, that if A-V conduction disturbances in the course of Lyme disease persist for more than a week despite targeted antibiotic therapy, it is most likely a sign of serious and irreversible damage to the structures of the A-V node.",1221,0,0,1,0,en,ca,

How well does the news media provide this information? Here, reports from the British Public Service Broadcaster, the BBC, were examined. Methods BBC coverage of Lyme Disease was classed depending on media type as ‘television’, ‘radio’ or ‘web page’. Keywords related to symptoms and prevention techniques were recorded. Images of ticks or the characteristic EM rashes were also noted. Results More reports occurred in the spring and summer months than autumn and winter (Q2, 31.7%: Q3, 29.1%). Early diagnostic features such as a ‘rash’ (53.3%) and reference to tick bites (68.9%) were frequently mentioned. Other symptoms were well covered; including fever or ‘flu-like’ symptoms (43.6%), malaise (35.9%) and joint pain (43.6%). Less often mentioned were focal symptoms; including arthritis (8.7%) or facial palsy (6.7%). Prevention techniques were mentioned in 32% of all media reports, with tick removal (26.2%) and body checking (20.3%) being most often mentioned. Tick images were frequently provided (40.7%), but those of EM rashes less often (16.5%). Conclusion Overall, coverage of early symptoms was high. However, symptoms indicative of later infection were less well covered. Increased use of EM images, and more appropriate tick images, could aid Lyme Disease identification amongst the general public.",1543,0,0,1,0,en,en,

Current mitigation strategies rely on personal protective behaviours, early diagnosis, and antibiotic treatment. This review updates on previous reviews on educational interventions for the prevention of LD and examines the impact of different interventions on the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of healthcare professionals and the general public. We searched six databases for studies reporting participant assessment on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours related to LD. We included studies targeting the public as well as healthcare professionals. We used keywords related to Lyme disease, health knowledge, attitudes, practices, community, health education, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Fourteen studies were included in this review; 13 reported educational interventions focused on the prevention of LD in the public, and one on physicians’ diagnosis of LD. Regardless of the type of intervention, the public’s knowledge (11/13 studies) were generally observed to improve post-intervention, though changes to preventive behaviours and attitudes were inconsistent. A key finding in this study was that no studies reported outcomes from interventions targeted at educating healthcare professionals on their knowledge of LD, or how to treat LD. Our review demonstrated that public health interventions enhance assessed and/or perceived LD knowledge. However, more research is needed to investigate interventions directed at healthcare professionals across the spectrum of LD: prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of early, late and post-treatment illness.

B. burgdorferi genes shown to be regulated by temperature, pH and/or cell density during the organism’s growth in culture medium were assayed for expression during various stages of the tick feeding cycle by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ospA , ospC , flaB , erpA/I/N , erpB/J/O , rev and mlpA , were transcriptionally active following the larval and nymphal stages of feeding as determined by qualitative RT-PCR. During tick resting periods between feedings, ospC , mlpA and rev transcription were undetectable, in contrast to ospA , flaB , erpA/I/N and erpB/J/O . bba64 , a gene induced by environmental changes in culture and expressed during mammalian infection, was not detectable during any of the tick life cycle phases. Quantitative PCR to determine B. burgdorferi genome equivalents in these tick samples using DNA co-purified with the RNA allowed an estimation of gene expression relative to the numbers of B. burgdorferi present in the ticks. Although the spirochete totals varied widely between individual tick pools of fed, replete nymphs, the relative expression ratios between individual target genes following a nymphal feed were comparable. Similarly, borrelial gene transcription from the larval feeding and the nymphal feeding were observed and compared. These findings analogize B. burgdorferi gene expression observed by environmental stimuli in vitro with the transcriptional activity occurring during the organism’s infectious cycle within the tick.",1717,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Here, we report on the case of a schizophrenic patient who developed several episodes of severe catatonia after suffering from adequately treated Lyme disease with encephalitis. The catatonic stupor was not responsive to typical neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. After the medication was changed to risperidone, there was a dramatic and persistent improvement of the patient's condition. Two relapses during the follow-up period over five years were caused by dose reductions. Risperidone might be a promising drug in the treatment of acute catatonia and in preventing further episodes.

In this report we describe pertussis toxin-induced reversible encephalopathy dependent on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) overexpression (PREMO), a novel animal model that exhibits features of human encephalopathic complications of inflammatory disorders such as viral meningoencephalitis and Lyme neuroborreliosis as well as the mild toxic encephalopathy that commonly precedes relapses of multiple sclerosis (MS). Overexpression of the mouse MCP-1 gene product (classically termed JE) in astrocytes, the major physiological CNS cellular source of MCP-1, failed to induce neurological impairment. Unexpectedly, transgenic (tg) mice overexpressing MCP-1 at a high level (MCP-1 hi ) manifested transient, severe encephalopathy with high mortality after injections of pertussis toxin (PTx) plus complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Surviving mice showed markedly improved function and did not relapse during a prolonged period of observation. Tg mice that expressed lower levels of MCP-1 were affected minimally after CFA/PTx injections, and tg expression of other chemokines failed to elicit this disorder. The disorder was significantly milder in mice lacking T-cells, which therefore play a deleterious role in this encephalopathic process. Disruption of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) abolished both CNS inflammation and encephalopathy, identifying CCR2 as a relevant receptor for this disorder. Proinflammatory and type 1 cytokines including TNF-α, IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-2, RANTES, and IP-10 were elevated in CNS tissues from mice with PREMO. These studies characterize a novel model of reversible inflammatory encephalopathy that is dependent on both genetic and environmental factors.",1702,0,0,0,1,fr,en,

This article explores how human activities are bringing about global changes through their impact on biogeochemical cycles, land use and mobility of organisms, altering biodiversity and climate, and ultimately compromising the ecosystems services that sustain our planet. The consequences of global change for population health are examined, including the emergence of drug-resistant diseases, and the implications of climate warming and pollution for health. Addressing these issues presents a considerable challenge for nursing at all levels, in promoting sustainable policies, integrating environmental considerations into clinical practice, and in the nursing role as health educators. The greatest challenge is to education, to raise awareness of the relevance and importance of the global environment to health, and to empower nurses with sufficient understanding of the issues to apply them to practice, participate in debate and contribute to policy-making that aims to reduce the burden of global changes. The extent to which the profession is prepared to diversify in response to these challenges is discussed.",1347,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Wir dokumentierten die klinische  Präsentation und die Diagnostik bei Patienten, die sich nach einem  Zeckenstich mit Fieber präsentierten. Zudem untersuchten wir, ob neu  beschriebene Erreger (Ehrlichien, Babesien, Rickettsia helvetica) auch in der  Nordostschweiz vorkommen. Patienten und Methodik: 75 Patienten (41  Männer, 34 Frauen, medianes Alter 38 Jahre; darunter 10 Kinder) wurden  erfasst, die innerhalb von 3 Wochen nach einem Zeckenstich an Fieber  erkrankten. Gepaarte Seren wurden auf Antikörper gegen Borrelia  burgdorferi, Frühsommermeningoenzephalitis-Virus, Anaplasma (Ehrlichia)  phagocytophila, Babesia microti, B. divergens und Rickettsia helvetica  untersucht. Ehrlichien wurden zudem mikroskopisch und mittels  Polymerasen-Kettenreaktion gesucht. Klinische Daten wurden in der Akutphase,  nach 1 und 2 Jahren erhoben. Ergebnisse: Bei 36 (48 %)  Patienten wurde eine sichere oder mögliche Infektionskrankheit  diagnostiziert: 7 (9 %) Erythema migrans, 6 (8 %)  andere spezifische Manifestationen einer Lyme Borreliose, 6 (8 %)  Lyme Borreliosen mit unspezifischem febrilem Krankheitsbild, 8  (11 %) Frühsommermeningoenzephalitiden, 7  (10 %) granulozytäre Ehrlichiose, 1 B. microti Infektion bei  einem eingereisten Amerikaner, 6 (8 %) Doppelinfektionen. Bei 8  (11 %) Patienten fanden sich serologische Hinweise für eine  mögliche akute oder durchgemachte R. helvetica Infektion. Folgerung: Die Lyme Borreliose war im  untersuchten Kollektiv die häufigste Erkrankung, die sich zum Teil als  unspezifisches febriles Krankheitsbild manifestierte. Bei der einheimischen  Bevölkerung fand sich keine Babesiose. Es ergaben sich serologische  Hinweise für das Vorkommen der humanen granulozytären Ehrlichiose und  R. helvetica Infektion. Bei 50 % der Patienten mit Fieber nach  Zeckenstich konnte keine Infektion diagnostiziert werden. Background: Different tick-borne infections  can cause an acute febrile illness. The study objectives were to investigate  the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of infections among patients who  presented with fever after a tick-bite, and to detect newly described  pathogens, including Ehrlichia, Babesia and Rickettsia helvetica, in  North-Eastern Switzerland. Patients and methods : We studied 75 patients  (41male, 34 female, median age 38 years, among them 10 children) who had fever  within 3 weeks after a tick-bite. Paired sera were tested for antibodies to  Borrelia burgdorferi, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Anaplasma (Ehrlichia)  phagocytophila, Babesia microti, B. divergens, and Rickettsia helvetica. In  addition, microscopy and polymerase chain reaction was used to detect  Ehrlichia. Clinical data were obtained at baseline and at 1 and 2 year  follow-up. Results: Tick-borne infections were confirmed  or possible in 36 (48 %) patients: 7 (9 %) Erythema  migrans, 6 (8 %) other specific manifestations of Lyme  borreliosis, 6 (8 %) Lyme borreliosis presenting as non-specific  febrile illness, 8 (11 %) tick-borne encephalitis, 7  (10 %) granulocytic ehrlichiosis, 1 B. microti infection in a  traveler from the US and 6 (8 %) dual infections. In 8  (11 %) patients serological findings were suggesting possible  acute or past R. helvetica infection. Conclusion: Among patients with fever after a  tick-bite, Lyme borreliosis was most frequently found. There was no evidence  for babesiosis among the resident population. Serologic data suggest that human  granulocytic ehrlichiosis and R. helvetica infections may be endemic in  Switzerland. Among 50 % of the patients no tick-borne infections  could be diagnosed.

Concomitantly, several newly recognized tick-borne pathogens have emerged joining those already known to be transmitted by ticks. Together these factors have led to an enhanced public health awareness of ticks, tick-borne agents, and their associated diseases. Reports that several of these agents are transmitted by blood transfusion have raised concerns about blood safety. The primary agents of interest are members of the genus Babesia , but Anaplasma phagocytophilum , Rickettsia rickettsii , Colorado tick fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus also have been transmitted by transfusion. In many cases, these agents and their diseases share common features including vectors, symptoms, and diagnosis. Unfortunately, they also share the common problem of insufficient epidemiologic and transmissibility data necessary for making informed decisions regarding potential blood safety interventions. Although further surveillance and epidemiologic studies of tick-borne agents are clearly needed, at present only the Babesia warrant consideration for active intervention; because donor management strategies based on risk-factor questions are inadequate, leukoreduction not effective for agents found in red cells and pathogen inactivation remains problematic for red cell products. Despite the present unavailability of screening assays, some form of serologic and nucleic acid testing may be justified for the Babesia . Given that interactions between humans and ticks are likely to increase in the future, vigilance is required as new and extant tick-borne agents pose potential threats to transfusion safety.",1730,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Methods: Owing to the recent confirmation of human tick-borne encephalitis cases, vaccination against tick-borne encephalitis was offered to the population living in the endemic area through the use of leaflets and media campaigns. At the time of the initial dose, information and enrollment to this cohort study was carried out. Participants' characteristics, frequency of tick-bites and preventive measures were included in questionnaires. Logistic analysis was used to determine behavioural differences in activities taken in order to prevent tick bites. Conclusion: In total, 70% of the permanent residents had themselves vaccinated before the next tick season. Of the studied participants 356/517 (69%) regularly took preventive measures in their environment and/or personally. Women in particular, and those previously treated for a tick-borne disease, took significantly more preventive measures. When analysing all variables together, spending less time in a tick-endemic area and being tick-bitten during the latest tick season significantly increased the probability of taking preventive measures. After being tick-bitten, men were more inclined to start taking preventive measures than women. Awareness of the risks caused by living in a high tick-endemic area influenced the participant's daily life through preventive activities.

Recent advances have been made in our understanding of these differences in skin histology, physiology, and immunology, and they have implications for diseases such as acne, eczema, alopecia, skin cancer, wound healing, and rheumatologic diseases with skin manifestations. Objective: This article reviews advances in our understanding of gender differences in skin. Methods: Using the PubMed database, broad searches for topics, with search terms such as gender differences in skin and sex differences in skin , as well as targeted searches for gender differences in specific dermatologic diseases, such as gender differences in melanoma , were performed. Additional articles were identified from cited references. Articles reporting gender differences in the following areas were reviewed: acne, skin cancer, wound healing, immunology, hair/alopecia, histology and skin physiology, disease-specific gender differences, and psychological responses to disease burden. Results: A recurring theme encountered in many of the articles reviewed referred to a delicate balance between normal and pathogenic conditions. This theme is highlighted by the complex interplay between estrogens and androgens in men and women, and how changes and adaptations with aging affect the disease process. Sex steroids modulate epidermal and dermal thickness as well as immune system function, and changes in these hormonal levels with aging and/or disease processes alter skin surface pH, quality of wound healing, and propensity to develop autoimmune disease, thereby significantly influencing potential for infection and other disease states. Gender differences in alopecia, acne, and skin cancers also distinguish hormonal interactions as a major target for which more research is needed to translate current findings to clinically significant diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Conclusions: The published findings on gender differences in skin yielded many advances in our understanding of cancer, immunology, psychology, skin histology, and specific dermatologic diseases. These advances will enable us to learn more about disease pathogenesis, with the goal of offering better treatments. Although gender differences can help us to individually tailor clinical management of disease processes, it is important to remember that a patient's sex should not radically alter diagnostic or therapeutic efforts until clinically significant differences between males and females arise from these findings. Because many of the results reviewed did not originate from randomized controlled clinical trials, it is difficult to generalize the data to the general population. However, the pressing need for additional research in these areas becomes exceedingly clear, and there is already a strong foundation on which to base future investigations.",2997,0,0,0,1,nl,en,

Edwards', 'affiliation': 'Uppsala Monitoring Centre, Uppsala, Sweden'}]",10.2165/00002018-200730060-00005,2007.0,61,Article,"Background: The WHO Foundation Collaborating Centre for International Drug Monitoring (Uppsala Monitoring Centre [UMC]) has received many individual case safety reports (ICSRs) associating HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor drug (statin) use with the occurrence of muscle damage, including rhabdomyolysis, and also peripheral neuropathy. A new signal has now appeared of disproportionally high reporting of upper motor neurone lesions. Aim and Scope: The aim of this paper is to present the upper motor neurone lesion cases, with other evidence, as a signal of a relationship between statins and an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-like syndrome. The paper also presents some arguments for considering that a spectrum of severe neuromuscular damage may be associated with statin use, albeit rarely. The paper does not do more than raise the signal for further work and analysis of what must be regarded as a potentially very serious and perhaps avoidable or reversible adverse reaction, though it also suggests action to be taken if an ALS-like syndrome should occur in a patient using statins. Methods: The 43 reports accounting for the disproportional reports in Vigibase (the database of the WHO Programme for International Drug Monitoring) are summarised and analysed for the diagnosis of an ALS-like syndrome. The issues of data quality and potential reporting bias are considered. Results: ‘Upper motor neurone lesion’ is a rare adverse event reported in relationship to drugs in Vigibase (a database containing nearly 4 million ICSRs). Of the total of 172 ICSRs on this reported term, 43 were related to statins, of which 40 were considered further: all but one case was reported as ALS. In 34/40 reports a statin was the sole reported suspected drug. The diagnostic criteria were variable, and seven of the statin cases also had features of peripheral neuropathy. Of a total of 5534 ICSRs of peripheral neuropathy related to any drug in Vigibase, 547 were on statins. The disproportional reporting of statins and upper motor neurone lesion persisted after age stratification, and such disproportionality was not seen for statins and Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, extrapyramidal disorders, or multiple sclerosis-like syndromes. Discussion: Because the cases were sometimes atypical we propose the use of the term ‘ALS-like syndrome’ and speculate whether this is part of a spectrum of rare neuromuscular damage. The diagnosis of ALS is often problematic, and the insidiousness and chronicity of the disease make causality with a drug difficult to assess. The disproportionally high reporting makes this an important signal nevertheless, since ALS is serious clinically and statins are so widely used. Wide use of the statins also makes a chance finding more probable, but is unlikely to cause disproportional reporting when there are no obvious biases identified. Conclusion: We emphasise the rarity of this possible association, and also the need for further study to establish whether a causal relationship exists. We do advocate that trial discontinuation of a statin should be considered in patients with serious neuromuscular disease such as the ALS-like syndrome, given the poor prognosis and a possibility that progression of the disease may be halted or even reversed.",3291,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

The genome content is characterized by several repeat families, including antigenic lipoproteins. B. recurrentis exhibited a 20.4% genome size reduction and appeared to be a strain of B. duttonii , with a decaying genome, possibly due to the accumulation of genomic errors induced by the loss of rec A and mut S. Accompanying this were increases in the number of impaired genes and a reduction in coding capacity, including surface-exposed lipoproteins and putative virulence factors. Analysis of the reconstructed ancestral sequence compared to B. duttonii and B. recurrentis was consistent with the accelerated evolution observed in B. recurrentis .

A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) from the TNF family, owing to its role in the generation and survival of plasma cells (PCs), is currently targeted for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. However, little is known about APRIL expression in RA lesions, hampering our understanding of the way APRIL may modulate this autoimmune disease. Methods. We performed immunological staining of human normal, non-RA and RA synovial tissues with a pair of antibodies specifically recognizing APRIL-producing cells and secreted APRIL. Results. We detected significant amounts of secreted APRIL in normal synovium mostly concentrated around blood vessels and at the lining layer, but no cells producing APRIL. Meanwhile, we observed that blood neutrophils constitutively secrete APRIL, indicating that blood APRIL may diffuse into the synovium via its fenestrated vessels. Synovium from non-RA and RA patients retained similarly secreted APRIL, but in this case APRIL-producing cells, including neutrophils and macrophages, were present in the tissue. Notably, PCs - when present in RA synovium - accumulated in areas of APRIL retention, spreading from blood vessels towards the lining layer. Conclusions. PCs accumulate in synovial zones rich in secreted APRIL, consistent with a pro-survival role of APRIL for PCs in RA. The concentration of APRIL by normal synovium indicates that this tissue may constitute a proper environment for PCs even before RA onset.",1467,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Infections are a well-known cause of cerebral vasculopathy and vasculitis. We aimed to analyze the frequency of intracranial vasculopathy attributable to infection, the spectrum of causative microorganisms, imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) characteristics as well as clinical course and outcome. Methods. We used our institution’s medical record system to identify all patients diagnosed with nonatherosclerotic central nervous system vasculopathy from January 1, 1999 through February 28, 2009. We reviewed their clinical charts, imaging data, and results of CSF studies. Results. Twenty-five adult patients with nonatherosclerotic cerebral vasculopathy of large- and medium-sized intracranial vessels were identified. Eight patients had vasculopathy attributable to infection (32%). The underlying pathologies were acute bacterial meningitis ( n = 4), varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection ( n = 2), borreliosis ( n = 1), and syphilis ( n = 1). In six patients, magnetic resonance angiography was performed and showed vasculopathic changes in all patients examined (100%). In both patients with VZV-associated vasculopathy, the arterial wall enhanced on magnetic resonance imaging. The CSF examination of the patients with infectious vasculopathy showed a significantly higher white blood cell count. The outcome of the infectious cohort was unfavorable with one death, two patients with locked-in syndrome, and five patients discharged from intensive care with severe neurological deficits. Conclusion. In this cohort, one-third of all cases of nonatherosclerotic vasculopathy were due to infectious vasculopathy of large and medium intracranial vessels.",1676,0,0,0,1,ro,en,

Moreover, by a multivariate approach we analyzed in the same case–control study also the contribution of two previously examined pathogens: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb). Significant differences in the frequency of infectious agents in cases and controls were detected for Bb, HTLV-I and EBV. In MF patients we found the concurrent presence of two or three of these pathogen sequences in 21 out of 83 cases, but only in 1 out of 83 healthy controls.

It is caused by infection with spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group which are transmitted to the mammalian host by infected ticks ( Ixodes ). Exposure to B. burgdorferi is commonly diagnosed by serological testing. The gold standard for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi is a two-step procedure of an ELISA followed by confirmatory Western blotting (WB). Here, we developed and validated a new bead-based multiplex assay for the detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in canine serum which combined the testing by ELISA and WB in a single quantitative test. B. burgdorferi outer surface protein A (OspA), OspC and OspF were expressed in E. coli . The recombinant proteins were coupled to fluorescent beads providing the matrix of the assay. Two sets of canine sera were used for validation of the multiplex assay. First, sera from 79 dogs with known ELISA and WB results were used to establish the conditions of the assay. These samples were selected to provide similar numbers of pre-tested sera ranging from negative to high positive results and included sera from vaccinated and/or naturally infected dogs. A high correlation was observed for detection of antibodies to B. burgdorferi in the single and multiplex assays ( n = 79). Spearman's rank correlations were 0.93, 0.88 and 0.96 for OspA, OspC and OspF, respectively. Second, a total of 188 canine serum samples that were not tested previously were used for further multiplex assay validation. All samples were also blindly analyzed for antibodies to B. burgdorferi antigens by WB. The WB results provided a ‘relative gold standard’ for each antigen and were used to perform a receiver operating curve analysis. The areas under the curves were 0.93 for OspA, 0.82 for OspC, and 0.89 for OspF. Multiplex assay interpretation ranges for antibodies to all three B. burgdorferi antigens in canine serum were established by likelihood analysis. The diagnostic sensitivities of the individual OspA, OspC and OspF bead-based assays were 83%, 62% and 82%, respectively, and the diagnostic specificities were 90%, 89% and 86%, respectively. The new multiplex assay provides a sensitive and fully quantitative platform for the simultaneous evaluation of antibodies to B. burgdorferi OspA, OspC and OspF antigens and distinguishes between antibodies that originated from vaccination or natural exposure to B. burgdorferi .",2504,0,0,0,1,en,en,

This study sought to examine the abuse liability of oxycodone among patients with chronic, non-malignant pain who met the DSM-IV criteria for opioid abuse. Eighteen opioid-dependent patients with chronic pain lived on an in-patient unit of the New York State Psychiatric Institute during the 7-week study. Participants were given oral oxycodone (0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 mg/70 kg) while maintained on various doses of sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone (Bup/Nx; 2/0.5, 8/2, and 16/4 mg/day). Doses of both medications were administered under double-blind conditions. Oxycodone produced an overall positive, but less robust, subjective profile than previously reported in recreational opioid users without pain. Furthermore, unlike our findings in recreational opioid users and more similar to effects in non-drug-abusing individuals, oxycodone failed to serve as a reinforcer. As for the maintenance drug, Bup/Nx produced a dose-related reduction in some of the effects of acutely administered oxycodone. These data suggest that sublingual Bup/Nx has the potential as an analgesic medication and further research should investigate its use in treating patients with chronic pain who abuse opioids.",1402,0,0,0,1,cy,en,

We apply loop analysis to the transmission graph of five pathogens known to infect the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis . In this context loops represent repeating chains of transmission that could maintain the pathogen. They hence represent completions of the life cycle, in much the same way as loops in a life cycle graph do for plants and animals. The loop analysis suggests the five pathogens fall into two distinct groups. Borellia burgdorferi , Babesia microti and Anaplasma phagocytophilum rely almost exclusively on a single loop representing transmission to susceptible larvae feeding on vertebrate hosts that were infected by nymphs. Borellia miyamotoi , in contrast, circulates among a separate set of host types and utilizes loops that are a mix of vertical transmission and horizontal transmission. For B. miyamotoi the main loop is from vertebrate hosts to susceptible nymphs, where the vertebrate hosts were infected by larvae that were infected from birth. The results for Powassan virus are similar to B. miyamotoi . The predicted impacts of the known variation in tick phenology between populations of I. scapularis in the Midwest and Northeast of the United States are hence markedly different for the two groups.

Bell’s palsy is a rapid unilateral facial nerve paresis (weakness) or paralysis (complete loss of movement) of unknown cause. The condition leads to the partial or complete inability to voluntarily move facial muscles on the affected side of the face. Although typically self-limited, the facial paresis/paralysis that occurs in Bell’s palsy may cause significant temporary oral incompetence and an inability to close the eyelid, leading to potential eye injury. Additional long-term poor outcomes do occur and can be devastating to the patient. Treatments are generally designed to improve facial function and facilitate recovery. There are myriad treatment options for Bell’s palsy, and some controversy exists regarding the effectiveness of several of these options, and there are consequent variations in care. In addition, numerous diagnostic tests available are used in the evaluation of patients with Bell’s palsy. Many of these tests are of questionable benefit in Bell’s palsy. Furthermore, while patients with Bell’s palsy enter the health care system with facial paresis/paralysis as a primary complaint, not all patients with facial paresis/paralysis have Bell’s palsy. It is a concern that patients with alternative underlying etiologies may be misdiagnosed or have unnecessary delay in diagnosis. All of these quality concerns provide an important opportunity for improvement in the diagnosis and management of patients with Bell’s palsy. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to improve the accuracy of diagnosis for Bell’s palsy, to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with Bell’s palsy, and to decrease harmful variations in the evaluation and management of Bell’s palsy. This guideline addresses these needs by encouraging accurate and efficient diagnosis and treatment and, when applicable, facilitating patient follow-up to address the management of long-term sequelae or evaluation of new or worsening symptoms not indicative of Bell’s palsy. The guideline is intended for all clinicians in any setting who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with Bell’s palsy. The target population is inclusive of both adults and children presenting with Bell’s palsy. Action Statements The development group made a strong recommendation that (a) clinicians should assess the patient using history and physical examination to exclude identifiable causes of facial paresis or paralysis in patients presenting with acute-onset unilateral facial paresis or paralysis, (b) clinicians should prescribe oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for Bell’s palsy patients 16 years and older, (c) clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell’s palsy, and (d) clinicians should implement eye protection for Bell’s palsy patients with impaired eye closure. The panel made recommendations that (a) clinicians should not obtain routine laboratory testing in patients with new-onset Bell’s palsy, (b) clinicians should not routinely perform diagnostic imaging for patients with new-onset Bell’s palsy, (c) clinicians should not perform electrodiagnostic testing in Bell’s palsy patients with incomplete facial paralysis, and (d) clinicians should reassess or refer to a facial nerve specialist those Bell’s palsy patients with (1) new or worsening neurologic findings at any point, (2) ocular symptoms developing at any point, or (3) incomplete facial recovery 3 months after initial symptom onset. The development group provided the following options : (a) clinicians may offer oral antiviral therapy in addition to oral steroids within 72 hours of symptom onset for patients with Bell’s palsy, and (b) clinicians may offer electrodiagnostic testing to Bell’s palsy patients with complete facial paralysis. The development group offered the following no recommendations : (a) no recommendation can be made regarding surgical decompression for patients with Bell’s palsy, (b) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of acupuncture in patients with Bell’s palsy, and (c) no recommendation can be made regarding the effect of physical therapy in patients with Bell’s palsy.",4406,0,0,0,1,en,ca,

We measured overall infection intensity with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and resolved the composition of multiple infections using strain-specific PCR assays targeting the ospC gene (which encodes an immunodominant surface protein). We found seven different strains, as defined by ospC genotype. There was little evidence for interactions affecting infection intensities, but strains were highly aggregated (i.e., there were more multiple infections than expected from random co-occurrence). Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the difference at the amino acid level between two OspC types and their degree of association. Overall, the observed patterns suggest that facilitation is more important than competition in this system and that more diverse infections have an advantage in establishing and/or maintaining infection. We propose that this advantage is one of the factors that favors antigenic diversity.",1294,0,0,0,1,it,en,

To analyze the incidence and clinical course of patients developing progressive ocular inflammation following anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for presumed ocular tuberculosis (TB). Methods. Retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who received ATT for presumed ocular TB and completed at least 12 months follow-up after initiation of ATT. The diagnosis of presumed ocular TB was based on presence of ocular signs suggestive of TB, evidence of past tubercular infection, and exclusion of mimicking clinical entities. All patients received a combination of ATT and corticosteroid therapy. Primary outcome measure was progression (worsening) of ocular inflammation, defined as a two-step increase in level of inflammation (anterior chamber/ vitreous) or the appearance of new lesions following initiation of ATT. Results. A total of 106 patients (64 male, 42 female) received ATT for presumed ocular TB. Twenty-six (24.5%) patients developed progressive intraocular inflammation following ATT. Primary diagnoses in these patients were: anterior uveitis ( n =1), intermediate uveitis ( n =9), retinal vasculitis ( n =3), serpiginous-like choroiditis ( n =7), multifocal choroiditis ( n =2), and pan-uveitis ( n =4). Following progressive inflammation, diagnosis was revised in two patients (7.7%)—both responded to alternative therapy. Of the rest, majority ( n =16; 61.5%) resolved with escalation of corticosteroid therapy. Five patients (19.2%)—all having intermediate uveitis—required therapeutic vitrectomy for resolution. Three patients (11.5%) had persistent inflammation at end of follow-up period. Conclusion. Progressive inflammation following ATT for presumed ocular TB is common.

GPCRs are widely exploited targets of the pharmaceutical industry; approximately 50% of human drugs interact with these receptors. GPCRs are also candidate targets for next-generation insecticides and provide opportunities to discover new mode-of-action chemistries for insect control. We present an overview of the Purdue Insecticide Discovery Pipeline which employs a target-based “genome-to-lead” approach to identify novel insecticidal molecules. The pipeline is focused on invertebrate GPCRs, with an emphasis on mosquito and tick dopamine receptors (DARs). We summarize published studies describing the characteristics of D 1 -like (Gα s coupled) DARs from the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti ( Aa DOP1, Aa DOP2) and Lyme disease tick, Ixodes scapularis ( Is DOP1, Is DOP2), and review our ongoing cell-based chemical library screening efforts to discover small molecule ligands and modulators of Aa DOP2 and Is DOP2. We discuss “hit-to-lead” optimization of Aa DOP2 antagonists and present in vivo assay data demonstrating that lead antagonists cause rapid and high mortality of Ae. aegypti larvae. To expand capabilities of the pipeline, we developed an in vitro screen to identify small molecule agonists of Aa DOP2. Twenty-five agonists were discovered in the screen that exhibited significant potency at Aa DOP2, although a subset of the hits that were tested (SKF82958, SKF81297) showed no evidence of in vivo toxicity to Ae. aegypti larvae.

In this review, we update the involvement of the SP/NK-1 receptor system in the physiopathology of the above-mentioned pathologies and we suggest valuable future therapeutic interventions involving the use of NK-1 receptor antagonists, particularly in the treatment of emesis, depression, cancer, neural degeneration, inflammatory bowel disease, viral infection and pruritus, in which that system is upregulated.",1641,0,0,0,1,pt,en,

The bacterial genus Borrelia (phylum Spirochaetes) consists of two groups of pathogens represented respectively by B. burgdorferi , the agent of Lyme borreliosis, and B. hermsii, the agent of tick-borne relapsing fever. The number of publicly available Borrelia genomic sequences is growing rapidly with the discovery and sequencing of Borrelia strains worldwide. There is however a lack of dedicated online databases to facilitate comparative analyses of Borrelia genomes. Description. We have developed BorreliaBase , an online database for comparative browsing of Borrelia genomes. The database is currently populated with sequences from 35 genomes of eight Lyme-borreliosis (LB) group Borrelia species and 7 Relapsing-fever (RF) group Borrelia species. Distinct from genome repositories and aggregator databases, BorreliaBase serves manually curated comparative-genomic data including genome-based phylogeny, genome synteny, and sequence alignments of orthologous genes and intergenic spacers. Conclusions. With a genome phylogeny at its center, BorreliaBase allows online identification of hypervariable lipoprotein genes, potential regulatory elements, and recombination footprints by providing evolution-based expectations of sequence variability at each genomic locus. The phylo-centric design of BorreliaBase ( http://borreliabase.org ) is a novel model for interactive browsing and comparative analysis of bacterial genomes online.",1453,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Materials and methods : We included 78 study eyes in this prospective study. Best-corrected visual acuity, a full clinical examination, wide-field green-light FAF and composite color, green and red laser separation fundus imaging with Optomap SLO were performed. In a systematic analysis, the number, extension and margins of central and peripheral retinal or chorioretinal alterations, scars and infiltrates in infectious and non-infectious uveitic study eyes were evaluated. Wide-field FAF and color fundus imaging results were compared regarding their diagnostic properties. Results : Nine out of 78 study eyes were diagnosed with infectious, 69 cases with non-infectious uveitis. Six infectious uveitic study eyes had changes of the peripheral fundus compared with 48 of 69 non-infectious uveitic eyes. In 33 (infectious versus non-infectious: 4 versus 29) cases, wide-field FAF images revealed more retinal or chorioretinal alterations or pathologies with a farther extended demarcation than wide-field composite color fundus imaging. Eleven out of 69 non-infectious study eyes were diagnosed with vasculitis which could be more precisely evaluated with wide-field FAF than wide-field composite color, green or red light filtered fundus imaging. Conclusions : Non-invasive wide-field FAF detects more retinal or chorioretinal involvement in patients with posterior uveitis than seen in color imaging and thus is useful in diagnosis and follow-up of uveitic patients.",1611,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Methods: We reviewed the records of pediatric patients who underwent hip aspiration between 2005 and 2012 at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital. Demographic data, laboratory values, final diagnosis, and treatment details were recorded for the subpopulation of patients with an aspirate WBC count of 25,000 to 75,000 cells/mm 3 (25 to 75 × 10 9 cells/L). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess risk factors for septic arthritis of the hip across final diagnostic groups and subgroups with WBC values of <50,000 and ≥50,000 cells/mm 3 (<50 and ≥50 × 10 9 cells/L). Results: Forty-six children (twenty-seven males and nineteen females) with a mean age of 7.6 years met the inclusion criteria. The final diagnoses were septic arthritis of the hip (n = 15; 33%), Lyme arthritis (n = 13; 28%), transient synovitis (n = 8; 17%), and other findings (n = 10; 22%). Subjects with a synovial fluid WBC count of ≥50,000 cells/mm 3 (≥50 × 10 9 cells/L) were more likely to be diagnosed with septic arthritis of the hip (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 16.9; p = 0.03). While septic arthritis of the hip was the most common diagnosis (48%) in patients with WBC values of ≥50,000 cells/mm 3 (≥50 × 10 9 cells/L), it also represented 17% of cases with WBC values of <50,000 cells/mm 3 (<50 × 10 9 cells/L). Conclusions: Septic arthritis of the hip is the most common ultimate diagnosis in children with synovial fluid WBC values of 25,000 to 75,000 cells/mm 3 (25 to 75 × 10 9 cells/L) following hip aspiration, and it should be high on the differential diagnosis, even in cases with synovial fluid WBC values of <50,000 cells/mm 3 (<50 × 10 9 cells/L).

Methods: We enrolled 94 patients with LETM into our study. Bright spotty lesions (BSL), the lesion distribution and location were evaluated on axial T2-weighted images. Brainstem extension, cord expansion, T1 darkness and lesion enhancement were noted. We also reviewed the brain MRI of the patients during LETM. Results: Patients with NMO had a greater amount of BSL and T1 dark lesions ( p < 0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The lesions in NMO patients were more likely to involve greater than one-half of the spinal cord’s cross-sectional area; to enhance and be centrally-located, or both centrally- and peripherally-located in the cord.

Loss of olfaction has been considered inevitable in endoscopic endonasal resection of olfactory groove meningiomas. Olfaction preservation may be feasible through an endonasal unilateral transcribriform approach, with the option for expansion using septal transposition and contralateral preservation of the olfactory apparatus. Methods. An expanded unilateral endonasal transcribriform approach with septal transposition was performed in five cadaver heads. The approach was applied in a surgical case of a 24 × 26-mm olfactory groove meningioma originating from the right cribriform plate with partially intact olfaction. Results. The surgical approach offered adequate exposure to the anterior skull base bilaterally. The nasal/septal mucosa was preserved on the contralateral side. Gross total resection of the meningioma was achieved with the successful preservation of the contralateral olfactory apparatus and preoperative olfaction. Six months later, the left nasal cavity showed no disruption of the mucosal lining and the right side was at the appropriate stage of healing for a harvested nasoseptal flap. One year later, the preoperative olfactory function was intact and favorably viewed by the patient. Objective testing of olfaction showed microsomia. Conclusions.

These spirochaetes employ an unusual form of flagella-based motility necessary for pathogenicity; indeed, spirochaete flagella (periplasmic flagella) reside and rotate within the periplasmic space 2 – 11 . The universal joint or hook that links the rotary motor to the filament is composed of ∼ 120–130 FlgE proteins, which in spirochaetes form an unusually stable, high-molecular-weight complex 9 , 12 – 17 . In other bacteria, the hook can be readily dissociated by treatments such as heat 18 . In contrast, spirochaete hooks are resistant to these treatments, and several lines of evidence indicate that the high-molecular-weight complex is the consequence of covalent crosslinking 12 , 13 , 17 . Here, we show that T. denticola FlgE self-catalyses an interpeptide crosslinking reaction between conserved lysine and cysteine, resulting in the formation of an unusual lysinoalanine adduct that polymerizes the hook subunits. Lysinoalanine crosslinks are not needed for flagellar assembly, but they are required for cell motility and hence infection. The self-catalytic nature of FlgE crosslinking has important implications for protein engineering, and its sensitivity to chemical inhibitors provides a new avenue for the development of antimicrobials targeting spirochaetes.",1539,0,0,0,1,ro,en,

This creates widespread conflict with agriculture and other human interests, but also debate about the role of swans and geese as potential vectors of disease of relevance for human and animal health. Using a One Health perspective, we provide the first comprehensive review of the scientific literature about the most relevant viral, bacterial, and unicellular pathogens occurring in wild geese and swans. Research thus far suggests that these birds may play a role in transmission of avian influenza virus, Salmonella, Campylobacter , and antibiotic resistance. On the other hand, at present there is no evidence that geese and swans play a role in transmission of Newcastle disease, duck plague, West Nile virus, Vibrio, Yersinia, Clostridium, Chlamydophila , and Borrelia . Finally, based on present knowledge it is not possible to say if geese and swans play a role in transmission of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella, Helicobacter, Brachyspira, Cryptosporidium, Giardia , and Microsporidia. This is largely due to changes in classification and taxonomy, rapid development of identification methods and lack of knowledge about host specificity. Previous research tends to overrate the role of geese and swans as disease vectors; we do not find any evidence that they are significant transmitters to humans or livestock of any of the pathogens considered in this review. Nevertheless, it is wise to keep poultry and livestock separated from small volume waters used by many wild waterfowl, but there is no need to discourage livestock grazing in nature reserves or pastures where geese and swans are present. Under some circumstances it is warranted to discourage swans and geese from using wastewater ponds, drinking water reservoirs, and public beaches. Intensified screening of swans and geese for AIV, West Nile virus and anatid herpesvirus is warranted.",1980,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The objective of this review was to update a systematic review of associations between living near an animal feeding operation (AFO) and human health. Methods. The MEDLINE® and MEDLINE® In-Process, Centre for Agricultural Biosciences Abstracts, and Science Citation Index databases were searched. Reference lists of included articles were hand-searched. Eligible studies reported exposure to an AFO and an individual-level human health outcome. Two reviewers performed study selection and data extraction. Results. The search returned 3702 citations. Sixteen articles consisting of 10 study populations were included in the analysis. The health outcomes were lower and upper respiratory tracts, MRSA, other infectious disease, neurological, psychological, dermatological, otologic, ocular, gastrointestinal, stress and mood, and other non-infectious health outcomes. Most studies were observational and used prevalence measures of outcome. An association between Q fever risk and proximity to goat production was reported. Other associations were unclear. Risk of bias was serious or critical for most exposure-outcome associations. Multiplicity (i.e., a large number of potentially correlated outcomes and exposures assessed on the same study subjects) was common in the evidence base. Conclusions. Few studies reported an association between surrogate clinical outcomes and AFO proximity for respiratory tract-related outcomes. There were no consistent dose-response relationships between surrogate clinical outcome and AFO proximity. A new finding was that Q fever in goats is likely associated with an increased Q fever risk in community members. The review results for the non-respiratory health outcomes were inconclusive because only a small number of studies were available or the between-study results were inconsistent.

We derive threshold conditions for disease persistence and for nonlinear oscillations in the vector population and in the diseased vector and host populations. Our objective here is to use a simple mechanistic dynamic model to show that diapause and co-feeding transmission may generate periodic and irregular oscillations even when seasonal variations of the environmental conditions are ignored.

Introduction: Vectorborne diseases are major causes of death and illness worldwide. In the United States, the most common vectorborne pathogens are transmitted by ticks or mosquitoes, including those causing Lyme disease; Rocky Mountain spotted fever; and West Nile, dengue, and Zika virus diseases. This report examines trends in occurrence of nationally reportable vectorborne diseases during 2004–2016. Methods: Data reported to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System for 16 notifiable vectorborne diseases during 2004–2016 were analyzed; findings were tabulated by disease, vector type, location, and year. Results: A total 642,602 cases were reported. The number of annual reports of tickborne bacterial and protozoan diseases more than doubled during this period, from >22,000 in 2004 to >48,000 in 2016. Lyme disease accounted for 82% of all tickborne disease reports during 2004–2016. The occurrence of mosquitoborne diseases was marked by virus epidemics. Transmission in Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and American Samoa accounted for most reports of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika virus diseases; West Nile virus was endemic, and periodically epidemic, in the continental United States. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Vectorborne diseases are a large and growing public health problem in the United States, characterized by geographic specificity and frequent pathogen emergence and introduction. Differences in distribution and transmission dynamics of tickborne and mosquitoborne diseases are often rooted in biologic differences of the vectors. To effectively reduce transmission and respond to outbreaks will require major national improvement of surveillance, diagnostics, reporting, and vector control, as well as new tools, including vaccines.",1817,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Tick-associated microbes can influence pathogen colonization, offering the potential to inhibit disease transmission through engineering of the tick microbiota. Here, we investigate whether B. burgdorferi encounters abundant bacteria within the midgut of wild adult Ixodes scapularis , its primary vector. Through the use of controlled sequencing methods and confocal microscopy, we find that the majority of field-collected adult I. scapularis harbor limited internal microbial communities that are dominated by endosymbionts. A minority of I. scapularis ticks harbor abundant midgut bacteria and lack B. burgdorferi . We find that the lack of a stable resident midgut microbiota is not restricted to I. scapularis since extension of our studies to I. pacificus, Amblyomma maculatum , and Dermacentor spp showed similar patterns. Finally, bioinformatic examination of the B. burgdorferi genome revealed the absence of genes encoding known interbacterial interaction pathways, a feature unique to the Borrelia genus within the phylum Spirochaetes.

In the present study, we evaluated the comparative performance of SNAP 4Dx Plus (SNAP) and FLEX4 Rapid Test (FLEX4) using samples selected based on geographic distributions for canine vector borne diseases, including Borrelia burgdorferi ( n = 105), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (160), Anaplasma platys (115), Ehrlichia canis (154), Ehrlichia ewingii (163), Ehrlichia chaffeensis (151) and Dirofilaria immitis (105). Canine vector borne diseases infection status was established for each sample by a combination of reference methods that included necropsy ( D. immitis, heartworm disease), Western immunoblotting ( B. burgdorferi ), immunofluorescence assays ( A. phagocytophilum and E. canis ) and species-specific ELISAs ( A. platys, E. canis, E. ewingii and E. chaffeensis ). For comparisons among the 2 assays, samples were evaluated per the manufacturers’ instructions for each test kit. By testing each same sample set compared to the defined reference results, sensitivities differed substantially between SNAP and FLEX4, at 95.5 vs. 40.9%, respectively for B. burgdorferi , 97.1% vs. 61.4% for E. canis , 98.2% vs. 59.3% for E. ewingii , 64.3% vs. 35.7% for E. chaffeensis , 84.5% vs. 12.7% for A. phagocytophilum , 83.3% vs. 33.3% for A. platys , and 94.1% vs. 88.2% for D. immitis . Specificities for both rapid assay tests ranged from 98% to 100%. Based upon the comparative results derived from this study, the SNAP test was more sensitive than the FLEX4 test for detection of antibodies to all tick-borne pathogens and heartworm disease ( Dirofilaria immitis ) antigen in dogs.",2261,0,0,0,1,en,en,

The diversity of bacteria infecting Australian ticks has been studied using both culture- and metagenomics-based techniques. However, little is known about the virome of Australian ticks, including whether this includes viruses with the potential to infect mammals. We used a meta-transcriptomics approach to reveal the diversity and evolution of viruses from Australian ticks collected from two locations on the central east coast of Australia, including metropolitan Sydney. From this we identified 19 novel RNA viruses belonging to 12 families, as well as 1 previously described RNA virus. The majority of these viruses were related to arthropod-associated viruses, suggesting that they do not utilize mammalian hosts. However, two novel viruses discovered in ticks feeding on bandicoot marsupials clustered closely within the mammal-associated hepacivirus and pestivirus groups (family Flaviviridae ). Another bandicoot tick yielded a novel coltivirus (family Reoviridae ), a group of largely tick-associated viruses containing the known human pathogen Colorado tick fever virus and its relative, Eyach virus. Importantly, our transcriptomic data provided no evidence for the presence of B. burgdorferi sensu lato in any tick sample, providing further evidence against the presence of Lyme disease in Australia. In sum, this study reveals that Australian ticks harbor a diverse virome, including some viruses that merit additional screening in the context of emerging infectious disease.",1720,0,0,0,1,en,en,

Introducing antibody-encoding resistance alleles into the local mouse population is anticipated to disrupt the disease transmission cycle for decades. Technology development is shaped by engagement with community members and visitors to the islands of Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, including decisions at project inception about which types of disease resistance to pursue. This engagement process has prompted the researchers to use only white-footed mouse DNA if possible, meaning the current project will not involve gene drive. Instead, engineered mice would be released in the spring when the natural population is low, a plan unlikely to increase total numbers above the normal maximum in autumn. Community members are continually asked to share their suggestions and concerns, a process that has already identified potential ecological consequences unanticipated by the research team that will likely affect implementation. As an early example of CRISPR-based ecological engineering, Mice Against Ticks aims to start small and simple by working with island communities whose mouse populations can be lastingly immunized without gene drive.

By analyzing the motor structures of wild-type and stator-deletion mutants, we not only localized the stator complex in situ, but also revealed the stator–rotor interaction at an unprecedented detail. Importantly, the stator–rotor interaction induces a conformational change in the flagella C-ring. Given our observation that a non-motile mutant, in which proton flux is blocked, cannot generate the similar conformational change, we propose that the proton-driven torque is responsible for the conformational change required for flagellar rotation. https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48979.001",955,0,0,0,1,ca,en,

In summer 2017, we collected >700 ticks, primarily from city parks, suburban forest patches, and recreational areas. Comprehensive subsets of ticks were screened for presence of all common tick-borne pathogens. Half of the ticks carried at least one pathogen. The most common pathogens detected were the causative agents of Lyme borreliosis, i.e., bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group. Their prevalence was 37% in nymphal and 47% in adult ticks, which are high in comparison with surveys conducted elsewhere in northern Europe. Similarly, Rickettsia spp. (primarily R. helvetica ) were also detected in a relatively high proportion of the samples (11% of both nymphs and adults). The TBE virus was not found in a relatively small subsample, but we detected (albeit at a low prevalence of 0–6% of nymphs and adults) the bacterial pathogens Borrelia miyamotoi , Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis and the protozoan Babesia spp., which are also known agents of zoonotic diseases. The relatively high abundance of ticks and high diversity and overall prevalence of tick-borne pathogens suggest a lively and dense presence of mammalian and avian tick hosts in the city.

These settings involve a high degree of uncertainty regarding patients’ diagnoses and appear to be those most prone to diagnostic errors. Diagnostic errors comprise missed, delayed, or incorrect diagnoses preventing the patient from receiving correct and timely treatment. Data regarding which diagnoses are affected in these settings are scarce. Objectives: To understand the distribution of diagnoses among reported diagnostic errors in primary health and emergency care as a step towards creating countermeasures for safer care. Methods: A retrospective and descriptive cohort study investigating reported diagnostic errors. A nationwide cohort was collected from two databases. The study was performed in Sweden from 1 January 2011 until 31 December 2016. The setting was primary healthcare and emergency departments. Results: In total, 4830 cases of preventable harm were identified. Of these, 2208 (46%) were due to diagnostic errors. Diagnoses affected in primary care were cancer (37% and 23%, respectively, in the two databases; mostly colon and skin), fractures (mostly hand), heart disease (mostly myocardial infarction), and rupture of tendons (mostly Achilles). Of the diagnostic errors in the emergency department, fractures constituted 24% (mostly hand and wrist, 29%). Rupture/injury of muscle/tendon constituted 19% (mostly finger tendons, rotator cuff tendons, and Achilles tendon).

Here, we describe nine patients diagnosed with neuroinvasive JCV infection in Massachusetts from 2013, the year of the first reported case in the state, to 2017. Because current diagnostic testing relies on serology, which is complicated by cross-reactivity with related orthobunyaviruses and can be negative in immunosuppressed patients, we developed and evaluated an RT-qPCR assay for detection of JCV RNA. We tested this on the available archived serum from two patients, but did not detect viral RNA. JCV is transmitted by multiple mosquito species and its primary vector in Massachusetts is unknown, so we additionally applied the RT-qPCR assay and confirmatory RNA sequencing to assess JCV prevalence in a vector candidate, Ochlerotatus canadensis . We identified JCV in 0.6% of mosquito pools, a similar prevalence to neighboring Connecticut.

We develop a mathematical model of the Lyme disease system to study the consequences of differential tick developmental-stage phenology for the transmission of B. burgdorferi . Incorporating seasonal tick activity can increase B. burgdorferi fitness compared to continuous tick activity but can also prevent transmission completely. B. burgdorferi fitness is greatest when the activity period of the infectious nymphal stage slightly precedes the larval activity period. Surprisingly, B. burgdorferi is eradicated if the larval activity period begins long after the end of nymphal activity due to a feedback with mouse population dynamics.

Every adjuvant has a complex and often multi-factorial immunological mechanism, usually poorly understood in vivo. Many determinants of adjuvanticity exist, and each adjuvanted vaccine is unique. Adjuvant safety is critical and can enhance, retard, or stop development of an adjuvanted vaccine. The choice of an adjuvant often depends upon expensive experimental trial and error, upon cost, and upon commercial availability. Extensive regulatory and administrative support is required to conduct clinical trials of adjuvanted vaccines.

Kynureninase is a key enzyme on the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. One of the end products of the pathway is the neurotoxin quinolinic acid which appears to be responsible for neuronal cell death in a number of important neurological diseases. This makes kynureninase a possible therapeutic target for diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and AIDS related dementia, and the development of potent inhibitors an important research aim. Results. Two new kynurenine analogues, 3-hydroxydesaminokynurenine and 3-methoxydesaminokynurenine, were synthesised as inhibitors of kynureninase and tested on the tryptophan-induced bacterial enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens , the recombinant human enzyme and the rat hepatic enzyme. They were found to be mixed inhibitors of all three enzymes displaying both competitive and non competitive inhibition. The 3-hydroxy derivative gave low K i values of 5, 40 and 100 nM respectively. An improved 3-step purification scheme for recombinant human kynureninase was also developed. Conclusion. For kynureninase from all three species the 2-amino group was found to be crucial for activity whilst the 3-hydroxyl group played a fundamental role in binding at the active site presumably via hydrogen bonding. The potency of the various inhibitors was found to be species specific. The 3-hydroxylated inhibitor had a greater affinity for the human enzyme, consistent with its specificity for 3-hydroxykynurenine as substrate, whilst the methoxylated version yielded no significant difference between bacterial and human kynureninase. The modified purification described is relatively quick, simple and cost effective.",1679,0,1,0,0,de,en,

In the present study, we investigated the effect of IL-1F8 on primary human joint cells, and examined the expression of the new IL-1 family members in human and mouse joints. Human synovial fibroblasts (hSFs) and human articular chondrocytes (hACs) expressed the IL-1F8 receptor (IL-1Rrp2) and produced pro-inflammatory mediators in response to recombinant IL-1F8. IL-1F8 mRNA expression was increased in hSFs upon stimulation with proinflammatory cytokines, whereas in hACs IL-1F8 mRNA expression was constitutive. However, IL-1F8 protein was undetectable in hSF and hAC culture supernatants. Furthermore, although IL-1β protein levels were increased in inflamed human and mouse joint tissue, IL-1F8 protein levels were not. IL-1F8 levels in synovial fluids were similar to or lower than those in matched serum samples, suggesting that the joint itself is not a major source of IL-1F8. Serum levels of IL-1F8 were similar in healthy donors, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and septic shock, and did not correlate with inflammatory status. Interestingly however, we observed high IL-1F8 levels in several serum samples in all groups. In conclusion, IL-1F8 exerts proinflammatory effects in primary human joint cells. Joint and serum IL-1F8 protein levels did not correlate with inflammation, but they were high in some human serum samples tested, including samples from patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

4110,intensivmedizin up2date,Aktuelle Aspekte der Zeckenassoziierten neurologischen Infektionen,['R Kaiser'],10.1055/s-2007-995521,2008.0,0,HTML,"Permissions and Reprints All articles of this category Zecken zählen allgemein zu den am meisten verabscheuten Insekten, nicht nur weil sie sich in der Haut des Menschen so festbeißen, dass sie ohne chirurgische Hilfe häufig kaum zu entfernen sind, sondern auch, weil sie Krankheiten übertragen, die zu schweren Beeinträchtigungen und Defektheilungen führen können. Die kürzlich publizierte Beobachtung, dass sie auch den 95 °C Waschgang überleben können, unterstreicht die hohe Überlebenskunst dieser Spinnentiere, denen auch Temperaturen bis minus 40 °C wenig anhaben können. Von der Vielzahl der durch sie übertragenen Erkrankungen spielen für den Neurologen in Mitteleuropa epidemiologisch nur zwei eine Rolle: Die Neuroborreliose und die Frühsommer-Meningoenzephalitis. Beide Erkrankungen sind für den Kliniker in den meisten Fällen allein aufgrund ihrer Symptomatik gut zu differenzieren: Bei der FSME steht die schwere Beeinträchtigung des Allgemeinbefindens mit hohem Fieber und Kopfschmerzen ganz im Vordergrund, bei der Neuroborreliose klagt dagegen die Mehrzahl der Patienten über radikulär verteilte Schmerzen, die häufig nicht auf einfache Analgetika ansprechen. Patienten mit einer Neuroborreliose werden nur selten intensivpflichtig, solche mit einer FSME dagegen häufiger. Die Gründe hierfür finden sich in der unterschiedlichen Pathogenese beider Erkrankungen: Bei der Neuroborreliose entwickeln sich die Symptome aufgrund einer überschießenden Immunantwort auf bestimmte Oberflächenproteine des Erregers (ospA), bei der FSME infolge einer Lyse infizierter Neurone, wobei das Virus eine Prädilektion für die motorischen Hirnnervenkerne, die Vorderhornzellen im Rückenmark, die Purkinjezellen im Kleinhirn sowie Neuronenverbände im Thalamus und die Meningealzellen aufweist. Patienten mit einer FSME können innerhalb weniger Stunden bis ca. 3 Tage seit Erkrankungsbeginn (Fieberanstieg) intubationspflichtig werden, sodass bei entsprechendem Krankheitsverdacht zunächst eine engmaschige klinische Überwachung erforderlich ist. In seltenen Ausnahmefällen kann sich die FSME aber auch als isolierte Myelitis ohne Zeichen einer Meningitis oder Enzephalitis präsentieren (Fauser et al 2007). Bei der Neuroborreliose führen nur die seltene zerebrale Vaskulitis mit Präedilektion für das hintere Stromgebiet, die akute Enzephalitis mit sehr variablem klinischem Bild und die Querschnittsmyelitis gelegentlich zur Intensivüberwachung. Für die Diagnostik der Neuroborreliose gelten weiterhin die etablierten Kriterien der Serologie und insbesondere der Liquordiagnostik. Die Infektion ist bei passender klinischer Symptomatik wahrscheinlich bei Nachweis spezifischer Antikörper im Serum und zusätzlicher Pleozytose im Liquor (eine Schrankenstörung und intrathekale Immunglobulinsynthese finden sich häufig, aber nicht generell), sicher bei Nachweis einer intrathekalen erregerspezifischen Antikörpersynthese und/oder positiver PCR im Liquor. Der Stellenwert von Antikörpern gegen das vlsE bzw. das C6 Peptid (konservierter Bereich des vlsE) zur Diagnosesicherung wird zurzeit noch kontrovers diskutiert, dagegen konnte das Chemokin CXCL13 wiederholt als Marker einer akuten Neuroborreliose identifiziert werden (Rupprecht et al 2006). Leider ist der entsprechende Test bislang nicht allgemein verfügbar. Für die Therapie der Neuroborreliose ergaben Metaanalysen früherer Studien eine vergleichbare Wirksamkeit von Doxycyclin, Ceftriaxon, Cefotaxim und Penicillin G (Borg et al 2005, Halperin 2007). Dies überrascht zunächst, da Ceftriaxon eine deutlich bessere Liquorgängigkeit aufweist als Doxycyclin, andererseits zeigten retrospektive Analysen aus den 80er Jahren, dass die einfache Neuroborreliose (isolierte Radikulitis) auch ohne spezifische Antibiotikagabe ausheilen kann. Im Falle einer bedrohlichen neurologischen Symptomatik wird man daher aufgrund der exzellenten in vitro und in vivo Daten eher auf Ceftriaxon zurückgreifen, bei einer einfachen Radikulitis ohne dramatische Schmerzen (z. B. isolierte Fazialisparese) kann dagegen gut auf die Wirksamkeit des oral verabreichbaren Doxycyclins vertraut werden. Für das sehr seltene Post-Lyme-Syndrom gibt es bislang keine überzeugenden Hinweise für eine Erregerpersistenz oder einen Nutzen wiederholter Antibiotikagaben. Hier steht die symptomatische Therapie im Vordergrund. Die Diagnostik der FSME gestaltet sich vergleichsweise einfach: Hier genügt der Nachweis spezifischer IgM- und IgG-Antikörper im Serum sowie einer Pleozytose im Liquor. Da die FSME die gleiche klinische Symptomatik und dieselben laborchemischen Veränderungen wie die bakterielle Meningitis (CRP-Erhöhung, BSG-Beschleunigung, Leukozytose im Blut, granulozytäre Pleozytose im Liquor) aufweisen kann, sollte zur Differenzierung immer die Laktatbestimmung im Liquor erfolgen, welche bei der FSME in der Regel normale Werte ergibt. Die Therapie der FSME ist weiterhin Symptom orientiert, bislang gibt es keine kausalen Therapieansätze. Verlaufsuntersuchungen von Impflingen haben gezeigt, dass die Abstände für die Auffrischimpfungen bis zu einem Lebensalter von 50 Jahren von bislang 3 auf 5 Jahre verlängert werden können. Bei „vergessener” Auffrischimpfung kann bei einer kompletten Grundimmunisierung in der Vergangenheit durch eine einzige Boosterimpfung auch nach bis zu 8 Jahren wieder ein vollständiger Impfschutz erreicht werden.

Detection of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato was performed using the FL6 and FL7 primers according to sequences of conserved regions of the fla gene. The Osp A gene located on the linear 49-kb plasmid was used as target in multiplex PCR for genotyping. Genospecies-specific primers were used in the PCR for Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii and B. garinii . Results. Infection rates with Borrelia spp. were significantly lower at Fjelløyvær and Strøm compared to Tjore and Hinnebu; Fjelløyvær vs. Tjore (χ 2 = 20.27, p < 0.0001); Fjelløyvær vs. Hinnebu (χ 2 = 24.04, p < 0.0001); Strøm vs. Tjore (χ 2 = 11.47, p = 0.0007) and Strøm vs. Hinnebu (χ 2 = 16.63, p < 0.0001). The Borrelia genospecies were dominated by. B. afzelii (82%) followed by B. garinii (9.7%) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (6.9%). B. burgdorferi s.s. was only found on the island of Jomfruland. The infection rate of Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed the following figures; Fjelløyvær vs Hinnebu (χ 2 = 16.27, p = 0.0001); Strøm vs. Tjore (χ 2 = 13.16, p = 0.0003); Strøm vs. Hinnebu (χ 2 = 34.71, p < 0.0001); Fjelløyvær vs. Tjore (χ 2 = 3.19, p = 0.0742) and Fjelløyvær vs. Støm (χ 2 = 5.06, p = 0.0245). Wild cervids may serve as a reservoir for A. phagocytophilum . Jomfruland, with no wild cervids but high levels of migrating birds and rodents, harboured both B. burgdorferi s.l. and A. phagocytophilum in questing I. ricinus ticks. Birds and rodents may play an important role in maintaining the pathogens on Jomfruland. Conclusion. The high abundance of roe deer and red deer on the Norwegian islands of Fjelløyvær and Strøm may reduce the infection rate of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato in host seeking Ixodes ricinus , in contrast to mainland sites at Hinnebu and Tjore with moderate abundance of wild cervids. The infection rate of Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed the opposite result with a high prevalence in questing ticks in localities with a high density of wild cervids compared to localities with lower density.",2548,0,1,0,0,ro,en,

Lyme disease is commonly diagnosed in humans in Latvia, but up to date no studies have been performed to investigate its prevalence in dogs. The aim of this study was to evaluate if seroprevalence against B. burgdorferi sensu lato ( B. burgdorferi s.l.) and co-expression of antibodies against B.burgdorferi s.l. and A. phagocytophilum is higher in dogs with clinical suspicion of tick-borne diseases compared to healthy dogs. Findings. Venous blood was taken from healthy dogs (n=441) and dogs suspected to have borreliosis and/ or canine granulocytic anaplasmosis (n=29). The presence of antibodies was detected with SNAP 4Dx test (IDEXX, Westbrook, Maine, USA). The seroprevalence against B. burgdorferi s.l. in healthy dogs was 2.49% (11/441) and 36% (4/11) of seropositive dogs had antibodies against both of investigated bacteria. None of the dogs in sick dog group had detectable antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. Conclusions. We conclude that seroprevalence to B. burgdorferi s.l. in dogs in Latvia is low and that dogs with suspicion of tick-borne disease do not have higher B. burgdorferi s.l. seroprevalence than healthy dogs. Dogs that express antibodies against B. burgdorferi s.l. frequently co-express antibodies against A. phagocytophilum.",1272,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Babesiosis, a zoonotic parasitic infection transmitted by the Ixodes tick, has become an emerging health problem in humans that is attracting attention worldwide. Most cases of human babesiosis are reported in the United States and Europe. The disease is caused by the protozoa of the genus Babesia, which invade human erythrocytes and lyse them causing a febrile hemolytic anemia. The infection is usually asymptomatic or self-limited in the immunocompetent host, or follows a persistent, relapsing, and/or life threatening course with multi-organ failure, mainly in the splenectomized or immunosuppressed patients. Hematologic manifestations of the disease are common. They can range from mild anemia, to severe pancytopenia, splenic rupture, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), or even hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Case presentation. A 70 year old immunocompetent female patient living in New York City presented with a persistent fever, night sweats, and fatigue of 5 days duration. Full evaluation showed a febrile hemolytic anemia along with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Blood smear revealed intraerythrocytic Babesia, which was confirmed by PCR. Bone marrow biopsy was remarkable for dyserythropoiesis, suggesting possible HLH, supported by other blood workup meeting HLH-2004 trial criteria. Conclusion. Human babesiosis is an increasing healthcare problem in the United States that is being diagnosed more often nowadays. We presented a case of HLH triggered by Babesia microti that was treated successfully. Also, we presented the hematologic manifestations of this disease along with their pathophysiologies.",1660,0,1,0,0,en,en,

4123,environmental health,What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases? A systematic map,"['L Lugassy', 'L Amdouni-Boursier', '...']",10.1186/s13750-021-00220-4,2021.0,0,HTML,"Background. The control and prevention of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases is often based on the reduction of host or vector populations, involving but not limited to preventative culling and use of insecticides. Yet, destructive interventions such as these have shown several limitations including ineffectiveness on arthropods and negative impacts on ecosystems. An alternative strategy would be to rely on the natural ecosystem functions and their careful management to regulate such diseases. The goal of our work was to evaluate existing scientific evidence on potential links between ecosystem components/functions and 14 vector-borne and zoonotic diseases impacting human health and answer the question: “What evidence exists on the impact of specific ecosystem components and functions on infectious diseases?”. Methods. We searched for scientific articles published in English and French and screened them in a 3-round process (title, abstract and full-text). Articles were retained, without any geographical limitation, if they matched the following eligibility criteria: an exposure/intervention linked to changes in biological communities, habitats, or landscapes; an outcome consisting of any measure of infection in vector, animal or human hosts; and the presence of a comparator, in time and/or in space. The results are presented as a systematic map, followed by a narrative review where the amount of papers allowed for synthesis. Results. Searches in 5 scientific publication databases allowed to retrieve 9723 unique articles, among which 207 were retained after the screening process. The amount of relevant literature was highly variable depending on diseases, and the types of exposures also varied greatly among studies focusing on the same disease. A hundred articles presented in the map were unique in their “disease x exposure” combination and thus not eligible for further narrative description. The remaining 107 articles were organized in 34 “disease x exposure” groups, encompassing 9 out of the 14 initial diseases. The groups were composed of 2 to 16 articles and were examined to provide a description of the current state of knowledge for those diseases. Conclusion. Studies investigating the interaction between infectious diseases and ecosystems components and functions are still very scarce, and certain diseases are much more studied than others. Out of 14 diseases, 8 generated less than 10 relevant articles, while 2 diseases (Lyme disease and West Nile disease) represented 44% of all relevant studies. Although several vector-borne diseases included in the review represent a major health issue in the world, such as malaria or dengue, they have been exclusively studied under the prism of land-use, and we were unable to find relevant studies that tested the regulatory role of animal biodiversity-related functions. The role of predation in the regulation of vector and host populations has rarely been studied, with the exception of schistosomiasis. The dilution and amplification effects were addressed in several studies focusing on the composition of ecological communities. This map is a first step and could be upgraded in order to guide future research projects with the aim to conduct meta-analysis and build a robust evidence base to inform decision-making.",3314,0,1,0,0,en,en,

Importantly, such damages are largely absent from policy debates around the costs of delay and inaction on this crisis. While climate change is a global problem, its impacts are localized and personal, and there is growing demand for specific information on how climate change affects human health in different places. Existing research indicates that climate-fueled health problems are growing, and that investments in reducing carbon pollution and improving community resilience could help to avoid tens to hundreds of billions of dollars in climate-sensitive health impacts across the USA each year, including those stemming from extreme heat, air pollution, hurricanes, and wildfires. Science that explores the underappreciated local health impacts and health-related costs of climate change can enhance advocacy by demonstrating the need to both address the root causes of climate change and enhance climate resilience in vulnerable communities. The climate crisis has historically been predominantly conceived as a global environmental challenge; examination of climate impacts on public health enables researchers to localize this urgent problem for members of the public and policymakers. In turn, approaches to climate science that focus on health can make dangerous climate impacts and the need for cost-effective solutions more salient and tangible.",1434,0,1,0,0,en,en,
